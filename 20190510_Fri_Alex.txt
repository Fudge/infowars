[00:00.000 --> 00:24.400]  of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex
[00:24.400 --> 00:40.000]  Jones. I am now completely banned. There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.720]  calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person? These are very extreme individuals
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.360]  and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided
[00:49.360 --> 00:53.520]  to get rid of them. Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.840]  is saying. Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.440]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.400]  info wars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on
[01:10.400 --> 01:15.200]  Instagram. If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.520]  out. Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word? No,
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.480]  because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives. You know, the really dangerous
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.200]  ones. Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like. President Trump retweeted
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.080]  Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Info Wars Millie Weaver, social media's home
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.120]  monitor. Frank Stelter was not very happy about it. He is promoting the same alternative
[01:39.120 --> 01:44.160]  universe as Info Wars. Back to your point though about the Info Wars presidency, I want to know
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.160]  and I tweeted this all the day, what is the difference right at this point between Trump's
[01:48.160 --> 01:55.040]  Twitter feed and info wars.com. Info Wars content is useful to him. Info Wars personalities align
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.120]  with them. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. I think they are
[01:59.120 --> 02:05.920]  horrible for our society. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. Don't worry,
[02:05.920 --> 02:16.400]  these people aren't terrifying or anything. Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:16.400 --> 02:23.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're live. It's Friday, May 10th, 2019. I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll
[02:23.360 --> 02:27.840]  be here for the next four hours and then Owen Sroyer obviously with the war room every morning
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.440]  before I go live. We have David Knight with the David Knight Show and The Fabulous Job.
[02:31.440 --> 02:37.280]  He is doing as well. Yesterday I said that I would cover this lengthy New York Times
[02:37.920 --> 02:46.320]  24 page article written by the co-founder of Microsoft of Facebook. I never got to it
[02:46.320 --> 02:53.040]  because I wanted to reread it again last night before I gave you my informed take on it.
[02:55.520 --> 03:02.000]  Because this really signals what the establishment is planning to do, not just with Facebook but
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.520]  with the rest of Big Tech and the monopoly that's been set up over speech. And I can tell you it's
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.800]  not going to be good. It's going to be worse than it's already been. But they're going to sell their
[03:12.800 --> 03:21.040]  so-called solution to the problem as if it is pro free speech. So I will get into that today.
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.560]  We have cleared the decks to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.960]  We have a ton of just over the top incredible news to break down. We have the hysteria over the
[03:32.960 --> 03:42.160]  National Baseball League and the Cubs and somebody making an okay sign and the person being banned for
[03:42.160 --> 03:53.040]  life from the stadium and that clip where Millie Weaver is out and people are telling her just
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.360]  last week that she's using code word for racism and the same thing happened this week to Caitlin
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.200]  Bennett where she's at Kent State and she's talking to someone and they say, well, you deserve to be
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.360]  taken off the air because you're using coded racism. So say you shouldn't take somebody off the
[04:11.360 --> 04:14.480]  air because they're racist period because then they'll take everybody else's speech.
[04:14.480 --> 04:19.040]  And now we're learning that where they just defined everything as racist as the free speech
[04:19.040 --> 04:25.840]  collapses around us. Microsoft is coming out with its new word program that watches you in real
[04:25.840 --> 04:32.400]  time reports back on what you're typing and won't let you type certain things. New app encourages
[04:32.400 --> 04:37.760]  Americans to report offensive speech. That's up on info wars.com. It's all happening. The
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.760]  communist Chinese social score is not just coming to America, but it's coming to the entire planet.
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.200]  Again, we'll be right back on the other side of this broadcast. News wars.com,
[04:49.200 --> 04:54.640]  prisonplanet.com are our auxiliary sites. They're just as important as info wars.com.
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.640]  There's more and more. It's been blacklisted everywhere as you know. Stay with us. We'll be right
[04:58.640 --> 05:06.000]  back. I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.720]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[05:13.760 --> 05:19.600]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant,
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.960]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.880]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[05:30.880 --> 05:36.480]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut info wars down.
[05:36.480 --> 05:42.560]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.520]  away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done,
[05:47.520 --> 05:50.960]  but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.920]  financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[05:55.920 --> 06:03.600]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[06:03.600 --> 06:19.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:19.280 --> 06:32.960]  Make no mistake.
[06:34.320 --> 06:36.880]  Humanity is openly losing its soul in front of us.
[06:38.640 --> 06:42.240]  Most of the public behave and look like literal zombies now.
[06:42.240 --> 06:50.080]  Basic freedoms are seen as the enemy now and communist China is now the model of the planet.
[06:51.040 --> 06:54.480]  Coca-Cola is coming out to celebrate Ramadan with a crescent moon,
[06:55.600 --> 07:03.280]  but of course they would never put a cross on the Coca-Cola's for Christmas or for Eastern.
[07:04.320 --> 07:09.040]  Then big tech is removing any mention of Christian holidays from their calendars.
[07:09.040 --> 07:14.080]  I just thought I'd add that right up front for everybody to just break down the fact that
[07:15.200 --> 07:20.400]  the establishment is hopelessly anti-Christian in all of their operations.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.000]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today. My voice sounds particularly deep.
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.920]  Something's going on. I didn't have allergies till I was about 20,
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.120]  and then they've progressively gotten worse over the years. I don't hardly ever get the
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.080]  flu or get a fever maybe once every three, four years. I'm very healthy, but almost everyone I know
[07:43.040 --> 07:49.200]  for five months at Austin has had incredible allergies and gets incredibly sick from them,
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.080]  and I literally couldn't get out of bed this morning. It was so bad.
[07:57.680 --> 08:00.480]  My headache was so intense and my wife came in and she said,
[08:00.480 --> 08:06.720]  you know, I take the pollen block that you guys sell. Why don't you take it? And I'm like, oh,
[08:06.720 --> 08:14.720]  of course, bring me some. 30 minutes later, 70% of the dizziness, the pounding sinus was gone.
[08:15.760 --> 08:23.200]  My sinus is opened up and like a faucet, my nose started running, relieving all that
[08:23.200 --> 08:26.640]  incredible pressure that I could not get out with a handkerchief. But you know how it is,
[08:26.640 --> 08:32.480]  if you're a guy especially, I just don't even think about my own advice. I never even think
[08:32.480 --> 08:36.320]  about things that I'm saying myself. So I didn't mean to open the broadcast up with a plug right
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.880]  at the front. I really never do that for what funds our operation. But we do have that one
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.480]  minute ad pulled in, don't we? I'm going to play that here in just a moment since we're mentioning
[08:44.480 --> 08:52.880]  that for pollen block that you're running on the radio because it really is amazing. It's quail eggs
[08:52.880 --> 08:59.680]  from France that they learned at the quail that ate a certain diet in the wild forest and woods.
[09:01.680 --> 09:08.240]  If you ate those eggs, then you would have a massive reduction in histamines.
[09:13.120 --> 09:19.520]  So again, that's what is so exciting about the different systems that God's basically given us
[09:19.520 --> 09:30.480]  that God's designed. And pollen block has 70 plus reviews, got a 4.7 stars. And pollen block is
[09:30.480 --> 09:34.640]  simply amazing. And you just crunch them up in your mouth. They don't taste good. They don't
[09:34.640 --> 09:40.640]  taste bad. They have kind of like an egg flavor. It's just little white capsules. You just chew
[09:40.640 --> 09:49.040]  those up and scientists aren't even sure how it works. But for me, it works better than
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.320]  Clarenin D or Zertek D, which works pretty well when I have allergies, except it makes me feel
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.760]  like I'm speeding and have had 10 cups of coffee. And I'm a big jerk when I take it. So I don't take
[10:01.760 --> 10:07.680]  Zertek D. I don't take Clarenin D. And I was getting ready to take one. And my wife's like,
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.360]  I'm going to go get some Zertek D, Clarenin D, dig it out. Do you have it? She goes, look, honey,
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.120]  we don't take those. That's when we get in fights is when we both take those. The only time we fight
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.280]  is when we take those together. She has allergies too. That's the only time we ever have arguments.
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.840]  We're like, Oh, are we arguing? Oh, we took Zertek D or Clarenin D. She's like, here, take this.
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.800]  And so I took the pollen block 35 minutes later, starts training pressure goes away.
[10:31.440 --> 10:37.200]  And now about 90% better than I was three, four hours ago, I was going to call and cancel coming
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.720]  in something I never do for sickness. But again, it was all because I thought to take the pollen
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.480]  block also did the netty pot with the distilled water to call it the netty pot. I use the modern
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.360]  ones that are a little squishy, squishy deals. But that's all a side issue. The point is pollen
[10:53.360 --> 11:02.880]  block is available at infowarstore.com or by calling toll three, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.840]  nine. Again, eight, eight, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And here is the one minute
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.280]  ad that basically breaks it down. Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.880]  introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate
[11:20.880 --> 11:27.360]  seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort,
[11:27.360 --> 11:33.520]  and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.280]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.080]  studying this effect in published trials. And decades later, we now have the fruit of this
[11:44.080 --> 11:49.920]  research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.800]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[11:54.800 --> 11:59.360]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.240]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen
[12:10.240 --> 12:27.280]  block chewable tablets. Man, I tell you, what a world, what a world, what a world out here on
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.160]  this planet. What do you think is going to happen to all of us since the soul fades from humanity
[12:32.160 --> 12:37.600]  right in front of us? It's going to be rough. It's going to be rough. It's going to be tough.
[12:37.600 --> 12:43.760]  It's going to be hard. Just the way it is, though. Just the way it is.
[12:48.480 --> 12:56.160]  All right. Well, that's a good start to the broadcast today.
[12:56.160 --> 13:03.200]  All right. We have got an incredible amount of news and information to go over here
[13:04.080 --> 13:11.440]  to say it lightly. And I'm going to do my very best job to cover it all today for you. Do it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.200]  We have old Hillary Clinton stomping around on a campaign trail,
[13:19.200 --> 13:30.080]  attacking the First Amendment, attacking yours truly, attacking reality. And we've caught her
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.080]  in some new spectacular foot in the mouth moments. So that's coming up. As I mentioned,
[13:36.080 --> 13:46.160]  you've got this Cub situation with the okay sign. We're going to be going over all of that coming
[13:46.160 --> 13:53.760]  up and just how the system is moving on to attacking other words. Now, the system is moving
[13:53.760 --> 13:59.440]  on to attacking language itself and how that's really the plan to complete the destruction
[13:59.440 --> 14:05.200]  of humanity's cognitive communication skills and the conversion of the universities into systems
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.880]  of higher learning and education and free thought to systems of destruction of words,
[14:10.880 --> 14:19.760]  which was the Thabian socialist model in England and has been the model and is now being deployed
[14:20.880 --> 14:27.200]  against free humanity. Again, this is a premeditated plan. The televisions, the smartphones,
[14:27.200 --> 14:33.200]  all of it were rolled out with exact flicker rates to manipulate your dopamine to destroy
[14:33.920 --> 14:40.400]  attention spans and to destroy memory. And then once they give you all these false memories
[14:40.400 --> 14:45.440]  to the TVs and the smartphones, you can't differentiate real memories from false memories,
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.240]  and then they're able to start programming the subconscious to flip switches to make you
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.840]  turn your life force off, your will to live, your will to survive, and your focus. And so
[14:57.840 --> 15:05.760]  the average person out there is in a hypnotic state and is being maneuvered into a neurological
[15:05.760 --> 15:12.560]  collapse. We are the most drugged, most dumbed down population in world history.
[15:12.560 --> 15:16.880]  The United States leads the pack worldwide of that. We are entertained to death. We live
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.400]  in fantasy land. And I don't say all of this to be negative. I say it so that we can recognize
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.400]  what's going on, recognize what's happening, and hopefully turn around and fix it in some capacity.
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.000]  So I'm going to officially start the show when we come back.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.880]  I'm going to not see the last 15 minutes as the broadcast. And when we come back,
[15:37.440 --> 15:45.520]  I'm going to start the broadcast. And I'm going to do the best job I can to lay out what we're
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.680]  dealing with and how we turn the tide against this, and also to turn the phones off throughout the
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.000]  show today. Thank you so much for tuning in. Thank you.

[20:23.120 --> 20:33.680]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time. Sooner or later,
[20:33.680 --> 20:40.480]  gotta cut you down. China did not have running water, you know, or 90% of the nation just 45
[20:40.480 --> 20:50.400]  years ago, but now they have more industry, more technology, more science than we do
[20:50.400 --> 20:59.120]  because our government was against our country via the Council on Foreign Relations Board
[20:59.120 --> 21:06.240]  and set up systems to make the new century the Chinese century. And we're in that new century,
[21:06.240 --> 21:12.160]  19 years into it, and Trump is not playing ball with them so far because of the big trade war
[21:13.760 --> 21:19.840]  has kicked into high gear. China vows to retaliate after U.S. hikes, tariffs, we're going to be
[21:19.840 --> 21:26.640]  talking more about this coming up later in the hour. Also, Ann Coulter says the surge of illegals
[21:26.640 --> 21:35.680]  under Trump is worse than any year under Obama. She says that's 3D chess, baby. Well, yeah,
[21:35.680 --> 21:40.080]  the Democrats under Obama started breaking the border and telling folks come on up here to
[21:40.080 --> 21:45.360]  overwhelm the system so the courts and the detention centers would collapse. And then now we're in
[21:45.360 --> 21:49.920]  the middle of the U.N. invasion, just like Europe has been under for 10 years, and then she blames
[21:49.920 --> 21:55.360]  Trump that Congress and the people haven't acted properly. The president's been trying to get the
[21:55.360 --> 22:02.160]  legislation. He tried to get $12 billion. He got a billion, 300 million to deal with extra
[22:02.160 --> 22:09.120]  border security. Now, he should declare a real emergency, not just the police emergency he declared,
[22:09.120 --> 22:16.640]  but a full emergency as commander-in-chief. He could do that. He hasn't. But for Ann Coulter to
[22:16.640 --> 22:22.960]  continue to say that it's Trump doing it, it's not fair. I get it, though. You put pressure on Trump,
[22:22.960 --> 22:27.840]  he acts. And so I guess the end of the day, he hasn't declared the true emergency. This
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.160]  is an emergency. Diseases are pouring in, you name it. So I guess in a way she is right.
[22:32.160 --> 22:39.600]  Those are some of the topics I want to discuss with listeners here today. And we're going to have
[22:39.600 --> 22:49.040]  open phones in the second and in the third hour of the broadcast today. In fact, I'll probably
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.080]  start getting your calls in the last segment of this hour. So the toll-free number to join us on
[22:54.080 --> 23:03.520]  air is 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. And again, first-time callers or callers that have called in but
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.840]  been on hold haven't gotten on air. That counts. She was a first-time caller. 877-789-Alex. We've
[23:09.840 --> 23:15.200]  been having some really great callers as of late. And so the first 20 calls or so that get in are
[23:15.200 --> 23:20.400]  first-time callers. After that, other folks are welcome. We'd love to hear from you. But I don't
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.720]  want to make you sit on hold. You know, I've been getting better about taking 20 calls when I take
[23:24.720 --> 23:30.800]  calls. So maybe 10 calls. But it still takes a couple hours to get to you. So we're going to try
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.560]  to move through those as quickly as possible. I'm doing a little bit better job, but obviously not
[23:34.560 --> 23:39.280]  the best job I could do. So I look forward to speaking to you on any of these issues, on any of
[23:39.280 --> 23:44.320]  these topics that you'd like to discuss, the censorship taking place, all the rest of it.
[23:44.320 --> 23:52.240]  877-789-2539 is the toll-free number to join us. I wanted to play a Mark Dice report instead of
[23:52.240 --> 23:58.400]  just playing Comey in his town hall last night, because I think Mark does the best job breaking
[23:58.400 --> 24:04.160]  it all down. But Comey really has a lot of nerve. Former FBI director, disgraced, lied to Congress,
[24:04.160 --> 24:13.920]  perjured himself, a big leaker. He has a lot to show. I mean, he's in a serious crisis. Instead,
[24:13.920 --> 24:20.800]  he just doubles down and says that Trump could be indicted once he leaves office. Here's the report.
[24:21.920 --> 24:27.200]  On Thursday, CNN held one of their famous town hall events to commemorate the two-year
[24:27.200 --> 24:35.040]  anniversary of President Trump firing James Comey. Welcome back to our 360 town hall with former
[24:35.040 --> 24:40.000]  FCI director, James Comey. He's also the author of a book, A Higher Loyalty, which is now out of
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.960]  paperback with a whole brand new forward. We've been getting questions from our audience. We'll
[24:44.960 --> 24:49.440]  go back to the audience in just a second. I want to ask you. Oh, Jim, your poor thing. It's been two
[24:49.440 --> 24:55.040]  years to the day since Donald Trump fired you. Are you doing okay? I was numb because I didn't expect
[24:55.040 --> 25:01.680]  to be fired. I was actually in a room about this size talking to custodial staff employees about
[25:01.680 --> 25:07.600]  the importance of the FBI's mission. So it still feels a little bit numbing, frankly, and like it
[25:07.600 --> 25:11.840]  happened yesterday. Oh, you poor guy. How are you going to survive with your full government pension
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.160]  of six figures for the rest of your life and the millions of dollars you made off of your dumb
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.960]  book? Since the Democrat Party is a complete joke, it makes perfect sense that a parody website of
[25:20.960 --> 25:27.600]  Joe Biden's 2020 campaign is ranked higher on Google than his official campaign website.
[25:27.600 --> 25:34.480]  CNBC reports that the parody website with embarrassing photos of Joe sniffing women's
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.480]  hair is outranking his official campaign page on Google. I'm sure that Google will change this
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.400]  soon, but right now if you just type in Joe Biden into the search, the top search results are his
[25:46.400 --> 25:54.080]  Wikipedia page, his Twitter account, his Facebook page, CNBC, some other pages, and then right there,
[25:54.080 --> 26:01.600]  Joe Biden for president 2020. Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America's
[26:01.600 --> 26:09.920]  problems. At the bottom of the page, Google often includes a little box of similar searches
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.880]  and take a look at what the similar searches are to Joe Biden. It says people also ask,
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.880]  has Joe Biden ever run for president? That's the number one connected result.
[26:18.880 --> 26:25.120]  Did Joe Biden die? It's number two. Many Democrats are thrilled that Joe Biden has decided to
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.320]  re-enter the presidential race and he's number one in all of the polls, but not all of them are
[26:30.320 --> 26:37.200]  happy about it. It's something to see all three of the top of the polls being led by three white
[26:37.200 --> 26:46.240]  men though. I have to say, I am concerned that, as someone who worked for a woman candidate last
[26:46.240 --> 26:53.040]  time, that there's something about the sort of biases we still hold about leadership and what
[26:53.040 --> 27:02.560]  that looks like that makes us gravitate towards men and even white men and that there's something
[27:02.560 --> 27:06.960]  about- Somebody should tell the Democrats that the core of Martin Luther King's message was
[27:06.960 --> 27:12.080]  to not judge people based on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character.
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.720]  That means even if they're white, you lunatics. In other news, Elizabeth Warren's campaign is
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.680]  not doing so well. In fact, she's polling in third place in her own state and that's why she's taking
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.720]  desperate measures like offering the kids free college and just canceling all of their student
[27:28.720 --> 27:33.200]  loans. Oh, here she is doing another live stream from her kitchen trying to connect with the young
[27:33.200 --> 27:43.120]  voters. Hey kids, I'll get to your questions here just a second. Almost done. Yeah, just one more.
[27:43.120 --> 27:50.960]  Just hold on one second here. By the way, this is satire. Almost, almost ready for you.
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.800]  We need to fact check this to see if this is real.
[27:56.880 --> 27:58.320]  Drinking beer, smelling a bong.
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.840]  Okay, what's your questions? Meanwhile, Cory Booker is polling even lower than Elizabeth Warren
[28:07.840 --> 28:12.960]  at just 3% and I can't imagine why. What do you say to somebody who says,
[28:12.960 --> 28:18.960]  yeah, I'm not crazy about Trump, but the economy has done so much better and the Republicans keep
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.920]  telling me that the Democratic nominee is going to raise my taxes and he is talking about raising
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.560]  taxes. So that might hurt the economy. That might hurt my bottom line. What's the counter
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.640]  argument to that? Look, I think that we live in a nation with far more patriotism than people
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.520]  are expressing. What I mean by that is folks want the best for their country. Democrats won't mind
[28:37.520 --> 28:43.680]  paying more taxes because they're patriotic. He says, no, they're just stupid. Oh, look at this.
[28:43.680 --> 28:49.760]  James Comey's town hall is still going on an hour and 15 minutes later. CNN is like the more
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.920]  important folks will be right back on the other side of this quick break. We'll get into the
[28:53.920 --> 29:00.960]  okay sign hysteria and the end of free speech. Stocks and options trading involves financial
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.520]  risk and is not suitable for all investors. Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper

[32:57.760 --> 33:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.560 --> 33:24.800]  You are either with the republic or against it. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to god.
[33:24.800 --> 33:32.400]  It's Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us on this live global Friday transmission. I am your
[33:32.400 --> 33:39.760]  host Alex Jones. So let's lay out the facts of political correctness, of microaggressions that
[33:39.760 --> 33:46.080]  colleges and corporations are teaching their employees to recognize. You see, when you don't
[33:46.080 --> 33:51.360]  have a bunch of KKK running around or real people saying the n-word, you've got to have folks like
[33:51.360 --> 33:56.080]  Jesse Smollett go out and stage it. And when they get caught, well, you've got to go ahead and cover
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.440]  up for him because actually he's a hero who is out there turning everybody into victims and
[34:01.440 --> 34:06.640]  continuing the racial division that Hillary Clinton talks about in WikiLeaks, how it needs to be
[34:06.640 --> 34:13.760]  intensified so she can control all these, quote, dumb baristas. These are quotes. So she's in these
[34:14.480 --> 34:20.160]  professor talks with professors in email about how do we control the dumb baristas? How do we
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.360]  control the dumb blacks? How do we keep these predators under our control? And they say you've
[34:25.360 --> 34:32.000]  got to intensify culture war, men against women, women against men, gay against straight, black
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.080]  against white, Hispanic against black, on and on and on. And so you've got to create what you call
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.360]  dog whistles. If I don't want the IMF and World Bank running my life, I don't want the TPP unelected
[34:43.360 --> 34:50.320]  running my life. If I don't want all these big multinational agreements like the Trans Pacific
[34:50.320 --> 34:55.200]  Partnership that was set up a decade before by Hillary, she brags that she helped write much of
[34:55.200 --> 35:02.960]  it. If I don't want to be ruled by multinational secret of boards based in Singapore, why that's
[35:02.960 --> 35:11.120]  dog whistle for anti-Semitism. Nigel Farage comes on the show routinely, founder of U-Kip,
[35:11.120 --> 35:15.920]  now the head of the Brexit party that's sweeping Europe. They've got London Guardian articles,
[35:15.920 --> 35:21.280]  Associated Press articles. Is he a white supremacist for coming on the white supremacist show Alex Jones?
[35:21.920 --> 35:29.520]  Lies within lies within lies. And so you say, well, we'll just laugh at this. No, they'll take
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.120]  your bank account. They'll ban you from the baseball field for life.
[35:35.120 --> 35:44.640]  They will oppress you. So when they give you the false
[35:47.280 --> 35:56.240]  definition, they then as tyrants use that to then oppress and control you.
[35:58.160 --> 36:03.200]  Now, obviously, you know that, but they're going to have to be sued. They're going to have to be
[36:03.200 --> 36:09.520]  criminally charged because this is an organized racketeering operation by Hope Not Hate in the U.K.
[36:09.520 --> 36:14.960]  That's the Southern Parliament Law Center group over there. The SPLC here and others,
[36:16.400 --> 36:22.960]  where they are organizing and manipulating and knowingly lying about people to then create a
[36:22.960 --> 36:30.080]  banking and travel designation in the national security apparatus to literally deny you the
[36:30.080 --> 36:36.880]  ability to travel and live your life. Think about that. And that's in the news today.
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.680]  Camilla Harris was in Detroit two days ago. She said, right wingism is racist.
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.120]  They need to be banned. They need to be arrested. And so you go to the universities
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.040]  and you see almost every person you talk to, black, white, old, young,
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.720]  male, female, saying, you don't deserve speech because you're a conservative or you support
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.480]  Trump and they have hate in their eyes and they're glaring at you. But even the few that were for
[37:06.960 --> 37:13.040]  restricting free speech that were friendly in their demeanor still set out, register things like,
[37:13.040 --> 37:20.000]  well, we have to report things we see online or on the campus or in general life if it's hurtful
[37:20.000 --> 37:28.880]  to somebody or if it's a dog whistle. Now that's how you make selectively everything on earth
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.280]  selectively banable. And you say the okay sign that everybody associates with the
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.960]  habit of oxygen in your tanks when you're diving. Yes. Or SWAT teams. Everything good?
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.640]  Yes, it's the international okay symbol. Chefs for 100 years in France and Italy
[37:51.840 --> 37:58.320]  can see it on the cans of some tomato sauce. The chef will be going with the okay to their lips,
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.400]  which really means fabulous, delicious. So these are normal human can sites.
[38:06.480 --> 38:14.080]  Okay. They take it. Hillary comes out and calls it white supremacists. And then everyone makes
[38:14.080 --> 38:21.200]  a joke out of it on 4chan. And then suddenly, all the followers that buy into all this really
[38:21.200 --> 38:27.760]  believe they've seen this, then jokers start getting involved in it. And we're off to the races.
[38:28.880 --> 38:36.720]  So here's the headline total BS MLB team bands fan for life. Happy flashing white power hand sign.
[38:36.720 --> 38:41.600]  And on the news, they even blurred it out. Now this all broke a few days ago.
[38:41.600 --> 38:47.040]  What's interesting now is it's reached a total hysteria. Ladies and gentlemen, I can show you
[38:48.160 --> 38:56.320]  100 photos of Obama doing the okay sign. I can show you any politician or anybody in business
[38:56.320 --> 39:02.240]  or anybody in life doing the okay sign. It means okay. It means we're going to take care of it.
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.760]  It means things are going well. But even if the guy meant it as a white supremacist symbol,
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.720]  do we all get hysterical and now let every symbol out there be adopted and taken away from us?
[39:13.440 --> 39:21.120]  Is this what America's turned into? So here is a clip where two days ago,
[39:21.920 --> 39:27.920]  at Kent State, you have a black student who's just said he wants Caitlyn to lose her speech
[39:29.760 --> 39:37.040]  saying because it's a dog whistle, a secret code. And then see, they can then project onto that.
[39:37.040 --> 39:43.600]  Oh, you meant bad by this, here it is. It is like, you know, that's pretty much that's hate speech.
[39:43.600 --> 39:49.520]  What is hate speech? Hate speech is defined as like stuff like, you know, making like subtle dog
[39:49.520 --> 39:56.080]  whistles and like, you know, remarks that on the surface aren't seen as hateful, but really are.
[39:58.240 --> 40:03.120]  Like if you walk into a room and say, hey, you guys, dinner's ready. I'm not a guy, I'm a woman.
[40:03.120 --> 40:10.720]  That's taught at universities as hate, so you get to get upset about it. Now here's a 7-up ad from
[40:10.720 --> 40:18.080]  the 70s where you got a black guy talking about how great 7-up is and making the okay sign,
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.080]  because this means it's good, like thumbs up. Here it is.
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.960]  It's something very special about the taste of 7-up that's unlike any other soft drink,
[40:28.960 --> 40:35.760]  maybe because 7-up has no artificial flavor and no artificial color, never had it, never will,
[40:35.760 --> 40:43.440]  and no caffeine, never had it, never will, whatever it is that makes 7-up so refreshingly
[40:43.440 --> 40:50.320]  different for other soft drinks, never had it, haha, never will. So he's being authoritarian
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.560]  in a good way. He's being authoritative. He's saying with his index finger, does not have any
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.280]  bad stuff in it. He's saying never had it, never will. He's saying it's really good making the
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.880]  okay sign. That's called Communication 101. I just was authoritative for a team of viewer.
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.080]  Now let's go to the hysteria over Cubs and somebody making the okay sign. Here it is.
[41:12.960 --> 41:17.840]  Last night, the Cubs had a big win over Miami to put them in first place in the NL Central.
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.800]  But now the Cubs are apologizing for something that happened in the stands. CBS 2's Audrina Begas
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.280]  is live outside Rigby Field. Audrina, apparently a fan made an offensive gesture of some type.
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.640]  They did. Good morning, Mike and Erin. The Cubs are taking this very seriously.
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.840]  They're calling this gesture ignorant and repulsive. Now here is what they're talking about.
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.520]  She was just making the symbol herself because you do it. Oh my gosh, continue.
[41:45.520 --> 41:52.960]  Doug Glanville was giving an update. Now the fan behind him made the gesture that we've blurt out
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.600]  because it's just not appropriate and really offensive. It's a hand symbol often used by
[41:57.600 --> 42:03.600]  white supremacists. The Cubs say they are investigating this. We're actively trying to
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.120]  find out the circumstances of how this person got into those seats and who they are and that's
[42:09.120 --> 42:15.280]  important. As we suggested in our statement last night, this type of behavior is reprehensible.
[42:15.280 --> 42:22.880]  It's ignorant and it's not welcome at our ballpark. This morning the Cubs are also saying that any
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.080]  fan or early anyone in the ballpark who does something like this will not only be removed,
[42:28.080 --> 42:33.280]  but they'll be permanently banned from Rigby Field. And by the way, they hunted this guy down.
[42:33.280 --> 42:38.560]  He's been banned for life. So you see how that works. It's just Jesse Smollett, the city of Smollett.
[42:39.600 --> 42:42.960]  They just made this up. They just found somebody. People are flipping each other off. They're
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.680]  cussing. Who cares? Somebody makes the sign. They obsess over it. The Big Bitty Party banned him.
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.680]  It's another Jesse Smollett hoax. This time brought to you by the Cubs,
[42:51.680 --> 43:15.760]  that is local TV stations. What a bunch of despicable, race-baiting scum.
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.680]  How can I solve that problem? So we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze,

[46:58.640 --> 47:14.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:29.200 --> 47:40.080]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones, your host. We've got a loaded
[47:40.080 --> 47:48.160]  phone lines, your calls are coming up at the start of the next hour. Next segment,
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.160]  we've got some incredible new footage of Hillary yesterday,
[47:52.160 --> 47:59.680]  and outrageously unselfaware statements by her. That's next segment, and we've got her dead to
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.520]  rights. She says they lie about me and say that I've killed people. Well, you've not only killed
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.240]  people, lady, you've bragged about it. But first, let me just finish up what I was covering earlier.
[48:11.440 --> 48:18.960]  Barack Obama has been caught flashing a white supremacist hand sign hundreds of times.
[48:18.960 --> 48:27.120]  And he needs to be banned immediately from any Cubs games in Chicago, which he's reported to go to.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.440]  That's right. You've heard that the man a few days ago that flashed the OK sign,
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.280]  that is the International Symbol of OK in hand signing. Well,
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.360]  foreshand in a joke a few years ago to troll Hillary and said it was a white supremacist symbol
[48:43.360 --> 48:49.440]  when Trump was doing it. And it's a known sales tactic to say everything's premium.
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.440]  Everything's OK. Everything's complete. Dinner's ready. There's plenty of oxygen in our tanks.
[48:56.400 --> 49:03.120]  The cars gassed up. It's hand sign, meaning everything's OK. We're done. If you place it to
[49:03.120 --> 49:09.920]  your mouth and go, that means in French, it's delicious. It's good. So you're a chef way across
[49:09.920 --> 49:18.720]  the kitchen. And is the sauce ready? It's done. It's done. But all of that turns into something
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.680]  evil and something bad. And this is mass mental illness. I see it all over the Internet, though,
[49:23.680 --> 49:33.200]  not just that it's racist if you do it, but that it's the 666 sign. My whole life I've used the
[49:33.200 --> 49:40.880]  OK sign because I saw people use it. Yeah, we're done. Hey, come on out of the house. We're ready
[49:40.880 --> 49:50.480]  to go. How's the food taste? It's great. But it's projected by Schizophrenics Online that when I do
[49:50.480 --> 49:56.160]  this, it's a 666 sign, whatever that means. I guess you could say three fingers and then the zero
[49:56.160 --> 50:04.800]  means a six. I mean, that's just crazy. That's insane. You could argue that stars on the flag
[50:04.800 --> 50:12.160]  are pentagrams. It's intention that God looks at. The occult has taken on every symbol and made it
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.120]  their own. And that's really what the globalists are doing. You know, we're putting out a new shirt
[50:17.120 --> 50:22.560]  based on the NASA design. I believe in pro-human space exploration. It's our own design, but
[50:22.560 --> 50:30.800]  similar to NASA's. And it's got a red, white, and blue and yellow rainbow on it.
[50:33.760 --> 50:40.480]  And some people ask me, they said, why are you wearing a shirt with a rainbow? Well, A, it's not
[50:40.480 --> 50:46.800]  a classic My Little Pony rainbow. It's got all the colors. It's NASA, meaning the colors of the
[50:46.800 --> 50:52.640]  atmosphere, meaning that the space shuttle is going out of the atmosphere and the atmosphere actually has
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.600]  tinted colors to it as you go through it. That's what it means. But see, I'm not putting it out as
[50:57.600 --> 51:03.840]  some coded message that, you know, I'm going to go to the bathhouse today and have sex with five dudes.
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.440]  It's a NASA patch that's really cool. Everybody likes it. We've changed it. We're putting a shirt
[51:09.440 --> 51:14.640]  out that says Space Force with it. So it's the intent. You know, Washington said what the flag
[51:14.640 --> 51:20.880]  symbolized. The blue symbolizes God in the heavens. You will know God and his work by the
[51:20.880 --> 51:28.160]  work of his firmament. He put those Bible verses. The blue is the sky. The blue is space and God.
[51:28.880 --> 51:36.720]  The stars are the colonies. The red is the blood sacrificed by the people to found the nation.
[51:37.440 --> 51:43.840]  And the white is the purity, but also the bandages of war. That's the red, white, and blue,
[51:43.840 --> 51:52.240]  ladies and gentlemen, not some satanic crap. You know, sometimes we've had articles about
[51:52.240 --> 51:58.240]  humanity's waking up or winning and we'll have an image of the sun rising. The Bible's gotten lots
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.400]  of passages about never fear, you know, the sun's going to rise in the morning. The light always
[52:02.400 --> 52:07.920]  comes back. But oh, the occult sometimes uses the sun rising symbol. So you better not use it.
[52:07.920 --> 52:14.800]  This is mental illness. And so I'm a very expressive person. Everybody knows that. And I
[52:14.800 --> 52:18.960]  know our general audience gets this, but I wanted to be fair and not just batch leftist.
[52:20.560 --> 52:26.320]  I wanted to really get into this and explain that letting people manipulate you through
[52:26.320 --> 52:32.640]  symbols is not good. Folks should go off of what does someone produce? Christ said,
[52:32.640 --> 52:42.400]  judge a tree by its fruits, not by the so-called symbol. Now granted, an upside down star,
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.080]  a bathomet is purely used by satanists, invented by them. It's bad. The star is the sign of a human.
[52:48.080 --> 52:54.640]  The head, the arms, the legs. You invert that. It's an upside down crucifixion of the human.
[52:54.640 --> 53:03.120]  It's an inversion. So there are symbols that were invented by evil, used by evil, for evil purposes.
[53:03.120 --> 53:08.240]  But almost every other symbol is subjective entirely. And I know our general audience knows
[53:08.240 --> 53:15.120]  this, but just think about this. We have dozens and dozens and dozens of videos. We've got hundreds
[53:15.120 --> 53:20.400]  of them. I mean, probably thousands of every Democrat under the sun doing the okay sign.
[53:20.400 --> 53:27.360]  Because people have been using this for thousands of years. No one's even sure exactly where it
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.400]  came from. It just means everything is good. Everything is handled. Everything is taken care of.
[53:35.920 --> 53:41.360]  And yeah, you get into, I guess, Eastern mysticism and the Hindus or something. And I guess in
[53:41.360 --> 53:47.120]  meditation people do that because when you touch forefinger and thumb, it's been known that it's
[53:47.120 --> 53:52.000]  some type of electrical charge takes place. And it's a connection. It's a calming thing.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.960]  Anybody knows that if you've done it, if you touch your forefinger and your thumb together,
[53:56.960 --> 54:04.640]  it's very relaxing. So I do it a lot because I like it. Not because it's 666. Not because it means
[54:04.640 --> 54:10.320]  hail the KKK or any stupid crap like that. But because it's a universal symbol like thumbs up
[54:10.320 --> 54:18.240]  or any of that. And I know our audience understands that. But the fact that it's one of the top
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.600]  stories in the country that, oh my gosh, the panic that a white supremacist symbol got made and they
[54:23.600 --> 54:31.680]  are defaming this poor guy that they threw out and took away his ability to go to the baseball
[54:31.680 --> 54:36.240]  game. He's banned quote for life. Gosh, you commit murder here only, you know, in jail for 20 years
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.400]  or whatever. But oh, you're not politically right. You're banned from Twitter for life. You're banned
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.680]  from Facebook for life. You're banned from the Cub Stadium for life. Imagine the message they're
[54:45.680 --> 54:53.360]  sending. Imagine what they're saying. They're saying what you say is more important than even what
[54:53.360 --> 55:00.400]  you do. That's the opposite of what God says. God says what you do is more important than what you
[55:00.400 --> 55:07.360]  say. Because what you do is the proof of the pudding. It's the fruit of the tree.
[55:08.800 --> 55:14.640]  So it comes down to that. And it's just astounding that everyone knows that everybody
[55:15.760 --> 55:26.160]  basically uses the okay sign. And the fact that they think they can sell this and have a hysteria
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.880]  all over the country about somebody making a sign, even if it was a bad sign, why do you give it
[55:30.880 --> 55:37.120]  attention? Why do you worship? Why do you empower it? Why do you make it a big deal? Because they
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.040]  want to make a superstitious of knowledge and symbols and they want to turn us against each
[55:41.040 --> 55:46.080]  other and fight and make it create this illusion that there's this giant racism going on when I
[55:46.080 --> 55:52.720]  bet $1,000 that that guy's probably a listener. He should email show tips, prove it's him.
[55:52.720 --> 55:59.440]  Most guests we get on end up being listeners. And I bet he did it as an active pro-Trump as a sign
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.800]  of rebellion. Because once Hillary said it was a white supremacist symbol, being chumped, being
[56:04.800 --> 56:11.920]  trolled by fortune as a joke, then Trump supporters started doing it as a sign of support for the
[56:11.920 --> 56:18.720]  president. Especially minority supporters of the president, because they get how ridiculous this
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.640]  is almost every time I'm posing for a photograph with a black or Hispanic person or family,
[56:24.640 --> 56:32.400]  they start flashing that and laughing because they get how ridiculous it is. It's ridiculous.
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.960]  You know, I've done this symbol before on TV and people that hate me who are deceptive
[56:38.960 --> 56:45.280]  take it out of context. I love God. I hate the devil. I've done the symbol of the devil on air
[56:45.280 --> 56:51.280]  and people then say, oh my gosh, he's the devil. No, I'm showing the symbol.
[56:52.160 --> 56:57.840]  But also be hook them horns. Again, it's what's the use of it? That's a long horn.
[56:58.560 --> 57:04.320]  That, you could say, is Satanism. But that only got popularized in the 70s and 80s by Rodney
[57:04.320 --> 57:12.640]  James D on others. Before this was the symbol of stopping a hex or if you saw the devil or you
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.920]  saw evil, you did the sign of the devil at it to block it because that's the sign of the devil
[57:17.920 --> 57:24.160]  and that stopped it. So before in Italy, there is Eastern Europe for thousands of years,
[57:24.800 --> 57:31.440]  you can go back in the history books, this sign was to ward off evil. It was a symbol of get away
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.920]  devil. Here's your symbol. You're bound by it. So again, people need to learn some real history
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.880]  and understand that the enemy wants you to be superstitious of knowledge, superstitious of evil,
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.280]  superstitious of good, superstitious of information, superstitious of anything they can project,
[57:45.280 --> 57:51.920]  whatever name they want on it at any time. Getting your protein has never been easier

[1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:25.600]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. 3 p.m. I'm here live on your host Alex Jones
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:30.000]  and I'm back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Live with a lot of special reports
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:37.840]  and internet only transmissions we do at newswars.com, infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:46.560]  on the weekends and other special times as well. Okay, here's what I want to do. I want to go to
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:53.840]  your phone calls and then I got a little bit behind last hour and I can't believe I just spent two
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:59.600]  segments on the okay sign it's not a white supremacist sign. That is a absolute fact.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:11.120]  The swastika is when it was used by Hitler but not when it's on Indian temples that are 3,000
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:17.600]  years old that left us from America go to India and demand they be taken down.
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:27.040]  The swastika is a sun symbol. The swastika is a symbol of the sun. I remember being like
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:35.680]  5 years old at a Native American reservation we were driving through out in Arizona
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:43.040]  and walking in they had a big display of old Native American branding hires
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.960]  for I guess they had some cattle or horses and a couple of them were swastikas
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:53.360]  and I remember seeing some of the blankets on the wall that had swastikas
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:58.720]  and even when I was like five six years old I said dad is that the Nazis he said no that's
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:04.880]  just the swastika is used by everybody around the world Hitler just appropriated it and I just
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:08.960]  can't believe we've gotten to this point that I just spent two segments on that it makes me feel
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:18.080]  dirty it makes me feel stupid but you know what it had to be done it had to be covered because
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:29.280]  if you read 1984 by Eric Blair aka George Arwell and then you read all the non-fiction books that
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:38.240]  he wrote you understand a really bird's-eye view of what's really going on and I'm not going to get
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:44.960]  into a whole long story about that I'm just going to say this that he was a liberal and he had the
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:52.560]  bleeding heart to help people and he'd been in the police in India federal police then he had been
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.640]  a big intellectual and writer in England then he'd been part of the Spanish Civil War and fought
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:04.160]  against the Nazis and then he saw the corruption of the communists on the other side just as bad
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:11.840]  as the Nazis and then he was in World War two and was a propagandist at the BBC working for
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:22.240]  the Office of Strategic Services the later MI6 and when he got let in on the actual plan
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:32.560]  he wrote 1984 and he died the year it was published in 1948 and that's why you read 1984
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:40.400]  especially in today's climate you're going to ask yourself why is so much this coming true why is
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:47.600]  this exactly what they do the double think the 10 minutes of hate it's because the Thamian socialist
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:55.760]  out of England had developed a plan to break up the family to dumb down the language and to reduce
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:02.240]  things down to humans being like animals and children would be taken at birth like you take a
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:10.000]  hen's eggs is a quote he gave and where knowledge is demonized and where colleges or platforms are
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:15.760]  destroyed for speech and where your own children denounce you and where the government force feeds
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:21.360]  porn to everybody so that no lasting relationships take place and you ask yourself how did this
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:28.960]  guy predict all this because he was at the highest levels of the planning and Winston Smith is him
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:35.760]  he admitted that in papers before he died and that's their real plan so you read 1984
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:41.440]  you don't know where Hillary's taking us where they're all taking us that's their plan and that's
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:48.000]  what all this garbage is to believe that symbols are evil but then true evil oh well there's no
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.720]  good or evil that's what I was trying to say before break early we're gonna write back I promise
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:59.840]  if your phone calls in 60 seconds please stay with us our grandparents and great grandparents
[1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:04.960]  know that they can't food during the falls they have it during the winter and that's what I'm

[1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:35.600]  for the next two hours we're going to go directly to your calls ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:42.320]  starting out with Josh in California who says he's a professor
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:48.960]  I want to talk about censorship in the education system that will go to everybody else that is
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  patiently holding as well I said I get to it last hour I didn't but I will at the bottom of the hour
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:07:00.080]  play some chilling clips of Hillary where she calls for the end of free speech basically but
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:08.800]  then also says because people say I'm a murderer I'm going to play clips of her admitting she's a
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:16.240]  murderer when we air this so this is coming up bottom of the hour Josh in California thank you so
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:22.560]  much for taking your time out to call welcome yeah thank you so much for taking my call Alex
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:28.880]  first off I want to say just a long-time listener huge fan of the show you're just this icon of
[1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:33.280]  kind of identity for the resistance gives people like me hope so first off I just want to say thank
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:40.480]  you for doing what you're doing thank you sir so yeah I'm an instructor at a pretty liberal
[1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:47.840]  west coast university out here in California in an arts program and first off I just want to say
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:51.200]  you know I see on the show a lot that you're you know you critique academics and I just want to
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:54.160]  say you know don't paint us all with the same brush because there are a lot of us that are
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.080]  conservatives that are christians that are working in academia but we can't speak up we can't speak
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:03.520]  our minds because we will face some kind of retribution oh I totally know you're right I
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:08.480]  totally know you're right I mean they had evergreen where the mainly white professors said well no
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:12.320]  whites allowed this weekend and a few professors tried to come get their stuff out of their desk
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:16.800]  and we were thrown out of the school death threat until they had to quit so I know that I'm just
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:22.720]  saying we go to universities all over the country and our reporters do and it is like a zombie invasion
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:29.280]  has taken place 98 percent of people are anti-free speech and it is just horrifying it's ridiculous
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:33.280]  and this is my my whole career that I've wrapped up in this and I feel you know pretty enmeshed in
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:38.480]  this culture but like I can't speak my mind but the liberal professors can of course attack the
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:44.240]  president and attack Christianity while teaching to even gen ed classes where that stuff doesn't
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:48.240]  even have to come into play so I guess my question for you is you know there are a lot of people like
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.320]  me out there but obviously we're not we're not very visible but you know you've seen it some people
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:58.080]  can see it what what's your advice to people like me how can we help sort of alleviate censorship
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:02.400]  and kind of turn the tides of liberalism while working inside of this system well I think you
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:08.240]  just said it I think you just said it why why can't you speak your mind because they'll fall
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:12.240]  complaints on you they'll get you fired they'll harass you so they're bullies they're terrorists
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:19.440]  and they they they like being bullies like a street gang or something and so I'm not judging you
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:23.920]  for keeping your head down and then quietly trying to you know wake people up I think there is a big
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:31.120]  rebellion on campuses you know against the monotheistic brainwashing of the left but
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:38.160]  I think the president signed an executive order saying you're not going to have shutdowns of free
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:43.520]  speech on campuses you're not going to have the banning of speakers I think that should extend
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:49.280]  to the faculty of those institutions I mean it's been a long process of political correctness
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:55.040]  to phase out what was bastions of open free thought the colleges and it's happened I guess
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.160]  last 30 40 years but it seems like since Obama came in the bottom just dropped out so what do you
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:06.640]  think yeah I think that we haven't really seen the tide start to shift I mean maybe we're seeing
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:11.920]  this more in the midwestern universities but certainly not out here on the west coast um
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:17.680]  if anything the the uh kind of liberal presence on campus the hypersensitivity to things like
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:24.320]  microaggressions um different gender identities seems to be increasing maybe over the past year
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:30.080]  to to almost this level of absurdity so um part of me doesn't know whether to either feed into that
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:35.360]  system and try to accelerate its collapse or to somehow revist this in a way that still keeps my
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:41.840]  head down and and phase my career you know I always mix these two studies together so listeners
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:46.560]  should check it for yourself but you had the millner experiment you had the stanford research
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:52.320]  experiments and I always mix apples and oranges but they had a lot of university studies that
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:58.720]  have been published some of not as you know where they found of authority figures told people to kill
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.000]  another student in an experiment most people would finally kill fellow students even though
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.120]  they weren't really being killed they were following orders believing that was the case
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.400]  and so I really think it is the stanford research and millner experiments uh are just
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:17.760]  examples of psychological manipulation and successive approximation that has allowed the
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:23.280]  cult-like environment I mean take china with finances hollywood and and and netflix and all
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:28.080]  this anti uh human garbage here's an article right here now now I don't agree with this
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:33.440]  but this is what china does transgender people in china are classified as mentally ill they're
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:39.280]  put in slave camps and driven to perform self-surgery well if you're cutting your own genitals off
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.720]  because you think you're a woman that is mental illness that is insane and but china says that's
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:54.160]  insane but now we're going to have men winning powerlifting contest and track and field contest
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:58.080]  and they're going to say biological men are really women and so now they have they asked
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:04.080]  me within 10 years all the women's sports will be dominated by men now now how sick is that verbal
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.560]  mental gymnastics this is the left saying you'll accept whatever we say when we say it's like
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:16.240]  aoc saying the world's going to end in 12 years and then beto or work adopts it these are classic
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:22.240]  tenets of cults programming people when they say you must accept things that are clearly insane
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:34.640]  or you're ostracized review on that josh should death in a way and yeah i mean it's somebody who
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:40.160]  got into the academic game as someone who wanted to embrace meritocracy to sort of push the limit
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:46.160]  the things like you're referencing there in china the chinese reaction to this
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:51.920]  versus the the sort of american reaction to this it's just absolutely absurd it feels kind of like
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:58.160]  we're living in a crazy kind of clown upside down universe and again if you've got a free open
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:05.600]  truly egalitarian society like america was how do you overthrow it you discredit it you discredit
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:11.680]  logic common sense and then you can overthrow it until that's why you see the system waging war
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.240]  against anything that makes sense god bless you i appreciate your call now that was a great caller
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.480]  i just spent eight nine minutes with him show me come back we're going to talk to gene and

[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:46.800]  listeners that we're under attack they have harassed all of our sponsors into oblivion they

[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.960]  working with the big megacorporations that they're flooding the united states in europe
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:48.720]  with several populations so they can politically have a group they control
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:53.920]  you're welcome back i'm your host alex jones and i've got stacks of news on this i've even gotten
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:00.240]  to yet where migrants terrorize the elderly inhabitants of highest elevation correlation
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:08.480]  village that just broke exclusively at europe wars dot com that is just so crazy that some of
[1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:15.040]  what's coming up but back to your phone calls right now who's up next year let's talk to gene in
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:19.920]  virginia the war on christianity a great example of that is you'd never have coca cola put a cross
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:28.000]  on their coke cans but now they're putting for ramadan the crescent moon and i say it was
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.320]  predominantly muslim erin you're selling coke to them do it but they would never do that for
[1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:37.600]  christianity because it's dirty and again the left loves to have all these after school satanic
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:41.600]  deals but tries to shut down christian ones why do you think there's such a war on christianity gene
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:49.280]  alex it's a pleasure to be with you um thank you thank you i believe i believe that the war on
[1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:55.520]  christianity the reason it's happening is because it's the truth i mean you can pretty much disprove
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:03.280]  every religion but christianity in my humble opinion i uh it's a it's not even a religion
[1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:09.760]  in my opinion it's a promise from god to deliver humanity from the grips of this force that i
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:14.080]  don't even think we really understand no i agree and the more i see the world government operate
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:18.480]  the more i see the evil the more you know the bible is real and how the globalists go out of their way
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:23.120]  to do everything the bible says evil does they want to hurt people they want to dump people down
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:31.520]  they want our souls yeah and if you look at our current reality um it's pretty insane because
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:35.920]  people were the same right from like king david of george washington everybody pretty much lived
[1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:41.040]  the same am i right like there wasn't a whole lot of advance in technology dot com i mean it's uh
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:47.120]  and all of a sudden we're able to see across the world and real time i mean you read for instance
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:55.440]  if i can read revelation 11 sometime it uh people out there it it tells you that this system comes
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:01.200]  because uh you know uh it says there's a one-world government system the beast can be seen at all
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:05.920]  times by all peoples his image is worshiped it's like a television screen uh and he has
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:10.880]  individuals that go out and basically in prison and behead anyone that doesn't have his system
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:14.480]  you can't buy or sell without him i mean wow this is all really coming true
[1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:24.640]  it absolutely is alex um i can't really put in the even express how real it is it's um
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:31.280]  and it's it's powerful christianity is a power source that's why they hate it like when you like
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:38.000]  for instance me i didn't come from much and i have to say just honestly when i was 23 years old god
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:42.480]  told me to put my tools away you were start sharing business i mean i mean i wasn't even a
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:48.320]  religious person like i've never been to church in my life like i got connected to god and uh
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:54.320]  my business is built itself i don't even have business cards man i say so busy it's all just i
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:24:00.400]  love god i care about the kingdom and my life just keeps getting better and better no matter what
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:04.800]  well exactly exactly but the enemy tunes into the devil and he does things for them
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:08.880]  but always at the expense of others and always the expense of them in the end so exactly there's
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:14.080]  like an ethernet tuning into god and then there's the tuning into the devil and it's a real system
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:18.000]  and the globalists know it that's why they want to make us evil and fallen because then they get
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.680]  dominion over us then they get to control us and that's why their sacrament is killing babies
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:27.920]  and as long as we then say we want to kill babies and the babies are worthless crap
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:32.640]  well then satan has control i appreciate your call that's why i went and saw the movie hell satan
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:37.280]  earlier this week uh that's being pushed by the democratic party as their new operating system and
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:42.320]  that instead of this they're sweeping the country it was so pathetic they were so weak but they make
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:46.880]  fun of dead babies they're talking about how fetuses are crap and it's just it's always that same
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:53.600]  bullying of the species because it's a spirit that hates man it's remained the image of god it's that
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:25:01.680]  simple okay let's talk about big tech censorship with shon in virginia shon thanks for calling go
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:07.840]  ahead now it's me machine jones how you doing today sir i'm doing pretty good today i appreciate you
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:12.880]  i appreciate the crew i appreciate all the stations hey man god bless you god bless your crew everybody
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:19.920]  out there hey i just wanted to say that uh youtube is really uh far too far i don't know if you're
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:27.440]  aware of this but you cannot post american client emojis on youtube now um i did not know that but
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:34.160]  that's big news tell us about it i do know this remember a year and a half ago project veritas
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:39.040]  got into the new york times got into youtube google and twitter and in three of the videos
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:46.400]  they had you know girls they're talking to the managers and they say well what's ban he goes
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:54.560]  well anything with american flags or any type of veteran stuff or anything alex jones so so so so
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:02.000]  so so tell me about this now i was uh actually just on a live chat through uh right side broadcasting
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.960]  that work which is a conservative uh platform to begin with and uh i posted an american flag
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:15.040]  got immediately taken down and tried it again immediately taken down so asked the moderator
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:19.680]  you know what's the deal with this and he said well people are triggered by the american flag now
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:24.960]  you cannot post it but let's be clear were you in a youtube live feed and then that's what happened
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:31.200]  yes sir that's correct yeah no no i mean that's exactly it people think i'm joking it was five
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:37.360]  years ago the night circuit ruled you can't wear american flags in public schools in however many
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:42.800]  western states is the night circuit like three four states i forget i know it's california
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:47.840]  oregon and uh wash and leased guys look up with the night circuit covers please thanks just so
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:55.040]  i tell folks the right thing but they said it's a hateful symbol then they ruled again uh that people
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:00.880]  can lose their jobs if their employer doesn't like them wearing american flags so it's been ruled a
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:06.480]  symbol of hate that's what trump said last year yeah go ahead so hundreds of thousands of our
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:12.400]  ancestors and i'm only a third generation america my great grandparents came here to escape the
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:18.240]  nazis from poland wow okay so anytime i see this bouncy stuff it's just pure trash it's pure race
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:25.920]  baiting uh but what they're doing is successfully rewriting history every day when they rewrite
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:31.680]  history they can control the future it's it's i want to be clear nine of nine four absolutely i
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:37.600]  think we've lost something like nine million americans in wars and and so it's about nine million
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:43.200]  last time i checked uh all total in the last 240 years uh but you're absolutely right sir and
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:47.120]  member trump said after charlottesville they wanted to ban thomas jefferson statue
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.080]  trump said the american flag will be next well the i'm sure you've heard a lot of democrats
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:58.720]  want to remove the flag sir but now i didn't hear that i was totally unaware that our american flag
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:05.840]  a great symbol of national pride has somehow become intertwined with some kind of racial hatred it's
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:12.240]  no sir it's anything the okay symbol i mean again they can project on anything they want
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:17.040]  god bless you i appreciate your call you know even i can't believe this is happening yeah the
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:29.680]  night circuit is washington oregon california nevada um arizona utah is that why i'm here montana
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:35.760]  so there you go in those states federal courts ruled the american flag is bad
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:41.040]  can't make that up so yeah but you know i was kind of honored a year and a half ago when i
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:46.640]  learned on those videos that they said veterans the american flag and all it's just they just said
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:51.040]  you see that you shadow ban them so they can't talk to anybody and the dumb rednecks never
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:29:00.240]  know what had a much a quote wow everyone knows even good people fall on hard times your credit

[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:46.480]  but i want to hit this steve watson story that's really important that's an info wars dot com
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:50.800]  and news wars dot com and again the only way this article gets out is if you share it on your email
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:59.920]  on your text message in my word of mouth next week we're gonna tell folks the next level of
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:06.320]  censorship that happened to paul but i wanted to wait till next week where we got some more intel
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:10.400]  before we went public with it i've gotten the intel now confirming what we already knew
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:19.200]  but i'm gonna wait till next week till you hear this but microsoft is announcing their new word
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:23.680]  program we'll watch what you do record it and then report back to microsoft everything you're
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:28.400]  writing and doing they're also putting a thing on all the new phones that microsoft runs called news
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:33.680]  card run by neocons that watches what you do on your phone in live time it's in your phone it's
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:37.680]  not like when you go to a website it pops up it's in your phone that's been announced
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:43.840]  and they've got new apps coming out the universities are making their people get
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:54.000]  that track everything you do and then reports offensive speech so the way tyranny works is
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.080]  he doesn't usually do it incremental forever incremental incremental incremental but then
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.040]  if it thinks it's losing it'll jump and go for everything so the good news is they're jumping
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:08.960]  and going for broke the bad news is if we don't respond and really say no they can win but they
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.280]  are making some desperate moves but but let me get back to hillary clinton the story's up on
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.880]  info wars dot com news wars dot com video hypocrite hillary blames internet conspiracy
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:27.280]  fetishizing for lost to trump and i've got three clips now i was going to air the newscast that's
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:32.800]  what i found today but the crew went and actually found the speech itself without the newscast but
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:40.640]  i could do a whole two hour show three hour show just on her hour-long talk i could do an hour-long
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:51.200]  show just on the following newscast acts like god had set down in the town now if you don't know
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:58.640]  about hillary clinton and her whole past it's incredible but she calls for more censorship
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:04.800]  by big tech conservatives she says she lost the election because of yours truly internet
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:11.600]  conspiracies and she said that when people went to knock on doors for her they'd say i can't vote
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:18.880]  for you you're a murderer and she doesn't even really deny that now hillary i don't think she
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:25.840]  ever killed anybody herself she just had somebody do it for her but they said we'll mark it off you
[1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:31.600]  had him come in out of the dark obama lied to him then they set him up and killed him and then
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:36.160]  she went there and bragged i came i saw he died she didn't find it the year of spring to bring
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.080]  down the whole middle east and kill hundreds of thousands we're not going to play that clip first
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:50.720]  though let's play madeline albright secretary of state when hillary was co-president with bill
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:56.000]  and she also worked the state department and madeline albright went on national television on
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:04.240]  mbc and on 60 minutes cbs there's two different clips of this and said 500 000 dead iraqi children
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:09.120]  is a good price to pay because if you thought george herbert walker bush put sanctions on iraq
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:15.680]  in the eight years the clintons they put sanctions on them that killed over two million people
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:23.440]  because that's a desert country 95 of it they were shipping in their fertilizer their medicine
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:33.120]  everything so she gets asked by a half million kids and hillary clinton's mentor was working for
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:37.280]  hillary at the time madeline albright says it's a good price to pay then hillary goes in front of
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:43.680]  this crowd of fawning sycophants and want to be elitist and makes a joke about all this it's
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:48.800]  just incredible hillary clinton you are a murderer you are a criminal you've bragged about it you
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.160]  know it you're a ruthless person these are just times you bragged about killing or your associates
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:38:02.880]  bragged about your policies that killed millions so here it is we have heard that a half a million
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:11.680]  children have died i mean that's more children than died when went in hiroshima and and you know
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:18.640]  is the price worth it i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:25.920]  so that's 1996 may 12th that's uh hillary clinton's buddy and her and her policies that did this
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:32.480]  but then she's secretary of state many years later and they go in and use al qaeda and isis
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:38.640]  to take over a country put women back into sex slavery kill black libyans because the islamists
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:45.440]  are very anti-black and then hillary brags about she came she saw qaddafi died here it is i mean
[1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:53.600]  that is the land of unconfirmed yes we came we saw he died didn't have anything to do with your
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:59.280]  visit no i'm sure it did so she's bragging about like i like obama said i'm really good at killing
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:07.440]  people so he didn't actually drop the bombs from the predator drones he just gives the order so does
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:18.560]  she so let's go to that clip first here's hillary clinton saying that internet conspiracy theories
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:29.440]  lost her the election you mean people knowing about you lady i mean i've interviewed the individuals
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:32.160]  where the state police came to their house and arkansas and broke their legs
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.480]  i know the names of the people you had killed you carried oklahoma city lady i've had the
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:46.400]  police officers on the show who had the fbi that worked directly for eric holder come to their
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:51.040]  offices they were going to kill you and your wife if you don't shut up and i looked at a highly
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:58.000]  decorated marine corps veteran head of their k9 unit don browning and he gulped and said the names
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.080]  the fbi just said i've never said that on air and i just said well we're doubling down here aren't we
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:08.960]  so highly decorated marine corps veterans who had the fbi threatened to kill him and his wife
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.560]  not once but twice had never said the name said on the show i know the names which i know all about
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  it we've interviewed the witnesses that saw the bombs being placed we know who did it
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:26.000]  so somebody's got to have the will to stand against you and we do on our listeners back us
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:31.680]  and that's why you fear us but let's go to her saying she never killed nobody like 20 montana
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:36.800]  tells the corrupt cop in scarface no you never killed nobody you just had somebody else do it
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:45.280]  for you didn't yet hear this so even though i lived through all those years of ridiculous
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:51.280]  baseless attacks and got elected to the senate ran against barack obama who turned around and
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.160]  asked me to be a secretary of state so people who know me people who work with me know that's all
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:04.640]  baloney but if you're 10 20 30 steps removed and your facebook feed is telling you that i'm dying
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:10.640]  or whatever their lie is of the day enough people think well you know
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:17.680]  that might be true let's stop there you know when people and that's why paul's band is he
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:22.160]  drudge first asked before we ever did years before because hillary had brain surgery hillary
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:26.560]  disappeared for two years almost i mean it was fair game for john mccain or ronald reagan
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:32.720]  and then she's falling down all the time and so we said does she have another brain tumor
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:38.640]  is she really sick she looks like hell whether we were right or wrong as americans we have a
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:43.600]  right to ask that and people want that ass but that's why they took us on facebook was biden said
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.640]  not one but two major brain surgeries doctors said he had a 50 chance for covering the last time
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:52.080]  he had part of his brain removed and he was slurring all his words and we said is he had
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:42:01.280]  another stroke he got 20 million views on facebook because the public wants to ask questions about
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:09.120]  that let's continue well media made a difference yes we do there's increasing academic research
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:14.720]  that shows people believe this the people who were influenced could be influenced believed
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:20.240]  deposit so take me out of the you take you out of the equation no one believes known liars like
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:25.440]  you anymore and people know that i legitimately ask questions doesn't mean my question's always
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:30.560]  right most of the time it is i'm asking the same questions our audience is which that's why you

[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:35.520]  you for everything you've been doing fighting up against the the cabal and in defiance of the
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:41.760]  cabal and saying who they serve i've uh been taken to action the last the last year in my own
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:47.440]  community here um i basically you know out of frustration with all the censorship and all the
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:54.880]  lies and um i just been waving my flag every friday morning i call it freedom freedom flag
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:02:00.960]  friday i get out there in a really busy street corner eight to nine a.m every friday i put it
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:06.880]  on my facebook page i call my local radio station who uh pretty much tries to censor me
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:10.880]  but it's free on friday they let you call in you know talk about whatever you want i try to get
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:16.160]  about 30 seconds and then he shuts me down but uh basically it's been a great response to start
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:23.120]  out as like a social experiment but really as you know kind of getting this my my frustrations out
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:28.400]  just doing my thing but it's been really great um of course there's a lot of people being triggered
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:33.760]  by the flag like when your caller said now you know the flag's being censored on youtube and uh some
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.400]  people come and give me the finger and they they give me the thumbs down which is really ironic
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:44.640]  because all i'm doing is waving the flag out there and um but i guess that shows how the globalist
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:48.880]  are taking the country over and they've gotten a certain percentage maybe 10 of the public
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:54.000]  to really hate america i mean i think it's conservatively 10 percent you go into college
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  maybe 20 percent you go into a leftist area maybe half and again they believe they're the ruling
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.640]  class they believe they're about to have total power over everyone yeah and uh yeah i also use the
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:12.240]  talk about other symbols you know the okay sign that's also the three percenter sign right people
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.440]  hold up the three fingers three percenter sign so i've i've been doing that too so yeah so don't
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:22.000]  let people keep you for what symbols you want to use you know what your symbols mean you know what
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.600]  they stand for for you and this this this idea to pre-block symbols before you can use them uh is
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:33.520]  the desperateness of the establishment just to stop speech yeah yeah you know the biggest symbol
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:40.240]  though that people cannot figure out is um a smile and a wave they think they they don't they haven't
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:45.520]  figured that one out yet they're like hey this guy's waving the flag he's got a big smile on his face
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:51.840]  sometimes i wear my maga hat and um i wave to every single car that goes by my buddy rich a few of
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:56.160]  my friends that come and join me every once in a while my friend Nancy she's come out a few times

[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:12.480]  good way and people can't they can't fight that no that's beautiful let me ask this question
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:15.520]  do you get flipped off when you just have the american flag or is it when you have them
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:21.120]  they make american gradient hat too you know what it's funny i just had my coming out uh with the
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:25.360]  maga hat two two weeks ago so i've only done it twice i've been doing this for over a year now

[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:03.520]  new jersey hey alex what's up man i love talking to you brother what's on your mind today oh thanks
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:07.120]  man um well i just want to say i'm a long time listener i've been listening for about 10 years
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:13.200]  end game and and obama deception really helped me wake up and i kind of passed that torch around
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:18.880]  my family uh so i really appreciate the things that you guys are doing thank you brother um i
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:22.480]  wanted to talk to you a little bit about measles outbreak that's happening here in new jersey
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:29.040]  and new york i haven't even gotten to that yet you know europe has thousands of cases now so does
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:35.360]  the u.s and i have a stack of mainstream news admitting it's the illegal aliens yeah like i
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:40.320]  actually i mean i agree with that to a sense but i also know that uh it's and this is by no means
[2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:47.120]  anti-semitic uh but i know that it's it's coming from israel as well because i live close to uh
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:53.200]  lakewood which would be uh the highest orthodox jew population in the united no i mean they admit
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:58.000]  that it's the some of the main outbreaks of the orthodox jewish area because they follow leviticus
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:04.720]  and don't want to put the dead baby parts in them and a lot of vaccines are grown on dead baby tissue
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:10.880]  right so my my main concern is not not necessarily where it's coming from it's also like how they're
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:16.160]  trying to force vaccines now oh i'm very concerned sir i'm very concerned yes sir
[2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:22.240]  it's extending way past orthodox jewish religions and such and now they're trying to make sure that
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:28.720]  everybody's getting vaccinated for this mmr um and that's i mean even going as far as is making
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:34.400]  it mandated yep well it's not really mandated they're lying it's a fraud uh that's all color of law
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:38.720]  and it's all big pharma doing this because they have hundreds of vaccines they want you to take
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.640]  50 years ago it was like four or five vaccines now it's hundreds and did you know that vaccine
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:47.040]  makers have liability protection did you know they're not tested for safety did you know that
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.760]  no i didn't actually we've got an article on info wars dot com that's got posters we printed up
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:58.640]  so people can print them off and post them in your area and it just simply says vaccines can kill
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:05.280]  they have no liability they have no safety testing read the insert that comes with it
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:10.800]  humanity won't submit here's how you can strike back against censorship five thousand dollar prize
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:15.280]  i don't have the money to do these contests these days but i'm still going to do it it's a month-long
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:20.080]  contest videotape it put it on youtube facebook twitter get it out there make your own poster
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:24.640]  pick one of our posters get it out there videotape it get it legal awful areas five thousand first

[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:33.280]  appreciate your calling anthony yeah it's a big deal the force inoculation is a big big deal
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:38.400]  but the measles mum's for bella shot never protects you anyways they admit folks that have
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.920]  been vaccinated are the ones that are all getting sick so here's the thing if you've been vaccinated
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.880]  how am i bad for not taking it if you're supposedly protected
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:54.400]  all right let's go to craig louisiana craig you're on the air thanks for calling
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:03.120]  Alex let me just say um it's an honor to uh to be able to speak to you it's an honor to talk to
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:08.720]  you brother what's on your mind oh uh yeah and if i can just say real quickly um for the longest
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.360]  time my mother tried to give me to listen to you i thought she was nuts i thought you were nuts
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:19.280]  well let me say last year sorry right before the election i actually took me my wife and
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:25.280]  our unborn child we tried to go out there to go to your production studio uh because that's one
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.840]  thing that's on my bucket list uh so i still hope one day you can do a meet and greet and
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:34.800]  warm up with me and me and whole families and we can all meet with you that's on my bucket list
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:39.200]  meet with you and me with the president uh so what's on my mind well i'd love to meet with you
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:43.200]  too brother you know and i'm not bragging but even when i'm under the weather i'm up here on the
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:46.640]  air it's just that i'm i'm working all the time uh but but i would love to be able to meet the
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:53.280]  listeners more often do it soon and uh so the reason i called is uh you were talking about
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:13:02.000]  komi i think it's a uh it's a symptom of tbs um so what really needs to happen is the president
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:10.560]  i hope him or maybe one of his uh maybe someone in his cabinet is listening today
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:16.800]  in every day really uh because everything you do and uh and everything that we do has a people
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.000]  his country uh it's so important um but sure so what what does the white house need to do to
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:25.920]  komi because he's saying we're going to indict the president every time the president this is a
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:31.120]  disgraced criminal that lied to congress they got caught perjuring himself so so what do you think
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:37.440]  should be done to komi it's thickening so oh three things one we need to uh he needs to enact laws
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:42.320]  that say no more censorship we're being banned i'm personally i was banned for life on twitter
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:49.440]  we need to put it to an end uh making accounts etc uh second the border needs to be shut down
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:57.280]  immediately i personally i lost my cousin uh since we've moved out here uh but i can tell you
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:03.440]  has to end um well god bless you craig we're going to jump on other calls but thank you for
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:06.800]  your call vincent in boston you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead vincent
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:13.920]  thank you sir so college professors have waged a war of attrition upon the culture of our nation
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:18.640]  and alex i'm only 19 in a college student but at school i see firsthand a generation of young
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:23.200]  adults being indoctrinated in a cult-like manner the perverse ideologies such as total
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:28.560]  multiculturalism moral relativism and satanism and there are posters at my roman catholic
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:34.720]  college that say you must be tolerant of islam paganism and wicked witchcraft or else and the
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:38.400]  left doesn't even hide their evil anymore just look to the governor of virginia who's proud
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:42.720]  about slaughtering these already born babies young conservatives are afraid to speak out today
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.280]  because we know we will be targeted if we do and in the classroom professors will brutally
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:51.440]  chastise students such as myself for well listen you're obviously on fire i'm a whole job of
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:56.480]  vincent so you can finish up but you're right we're under assault the left hand path is making its
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.040]  move uh you see national is fighting back worldwide but it's not enough we have to get
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:06.400]  very aggressive conservatives can't just sit back and do defense we've got to go on offense politically
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:12.080]  correct and kids today in the colleges are forced to submit to the brainwashing if they
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:18.240]  want to succeed academically which is ironic and so and so a lot of them go into stockum syndrome
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:23.680]  and instead of being secretive and just being a leftist to pass they actually become a leftist
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:29.680]  yes and a residual effectiveness indoctrination is what i call the milk toast generation that needs
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:33.600]  safe spaces from disagreement and intelligent thought and it's that's why we're we've seen all
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:38.000]  these hyper sexualized violent men and women who believe it's their way of a highway and i have one

[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:23.120]  keep defending traditionalism because hella waits and sir i'd like to leave you with a quote
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:28.320]  by the great dante who said that the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:33.680]  their neutrality in times of moral crisis so god bless you alex god bless you yes i've read
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:37.760]  dantes in front of everybody should read it real literature thank you so much a lot of
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:42.720]  folks read dante and think it's like the bible or something but it's it's it's it's it's it's fiction
[2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:48.000]  but it's it's very powerful but deals with real things that go in the world okay we're just going
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:55.120]  to the order of the calls are received here let us now go ahead and take a call from

[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:24.320]  know if you do those anymore but i thought that was a great idea wish you'd do that again and yeah
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:27.760]  i know i like davis stain he wanted me to go on tour with him he wanted me to write his last three
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:34.880]  albums with him and i really like dav uh i i i just i don't i mean i'm sure he's gonna write
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:39.120]  really great albums without me but he listened to his music the last ten years it's basically
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:44.480]  in fours so he's a daily listener i really like davis stain i'm glad i know and i like both of
[2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:49.200]  you guys i god bless both of you guys i love you guys both um let me say this to you ever since
[2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:56.080]  i've been listening i've been buying your products um i gotta i gotta do a shout out for um the bone
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:05.280]  broth tastes like um uh tastes like uh a great milkshake you know if you just add it to milk
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:12.400]  i feel great since i've been taking it my daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste um
[2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:18.480]  i've used the uh supermail vitality a host of other products so thank you so much for that as well
[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:22.400]  brother you're thanking me for buying the products to keep me somewhere i'm thanking you but
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:27.600]  yes um this is the ultimate bone broth formula the media picks up making a joke about it me
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:33.360]  saying it tastes good with mixed with like uh different fruits and and milk it tastes okay
[2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:39.600]  in a blender with milk or water i don't recommend you do it with a spoon uh like vice sticks it's
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:44.560]  so thick you can't do it with the turmeric the chocolate mushroom the the true bone broth it
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:50.320]  in his next level it really is good so thank you i feel great since i've been taking it thank you
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:55.200]  so the reason i'm calling today is um because um i know you've been playing that clip with anna
[2:23:55.200 --> 2:24:00.080]  navarro a lot you know talking about how they basically want to deperson you and just you
[2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:05.120]  know make you just disappear and that's horrible but there's something subtle that takes place on
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:10.000]  that clip that i haven't heard a lot of people mentioning and that's joy bahar right before
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:16.400]  her saying um we've been noticing quote unquote excesses in the first and second amendment
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:20.640]  and i just wanted to say how shrewd the globalists are because i know that the view is just a
[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:27.440]  globalist mouthpiece platform it's the mouthpiece and how shrewd they are to use these subtle
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.560]  keys to try to delimit our rights and how effective it's been and i just wanted to see if you could
[2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:40.800]  maybe speak to who is at the top who's controlling these mouthpieces and given them their um marching
[2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:44.960]  orders because it's off now that said let me let me get to that thank you for the call great points
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:50.720]  mike here's navarro on the view shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they are
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:57.280]  horrible for our society she thinks it's horrible so she decides it won't be on air and
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:03.840]  so the caller was asking what's behind this i mean this i wouldn't even call it subtle i mean i
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:10.480]  you're right joy bahar is subtle compared to navarro she's like oh we have excesses in the
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:16.720]  second and first amendment this is just insane they want to take you off air so they can lie
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:22.320]  about what you said 99 percent of the time when they say things i've said are done they won't show it
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:28.080]  and now that they think i'm de-platformed now they think i'm not on all these systems i'm
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:33.200]  still on hundreds of radio and tv stations and info wars dot com and news wars dot com but now
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:41.680]  that they think i'm off air now it's the white supremacist thing which nobody buys everybody
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:50.160]  knows that's just political it's lies except they use it then in banking and in life and that's why
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:55.440]  i've got a false suit against these groups that are doing this not because i want to not because
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:01.120]  i even have the money to do it but because this is going to happen to you next this is the system
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:05.920]  show everybody's been called a racist everybody's been called a white supremacist everybody's been
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:12.960]  lied about and now that they think i'm not on these platforms they are i mean i wonder what
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:17.680]  they're going to make up next and again i'm not a victim i don't feel sorry for myself i'm just
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:29.760]  simply blown away that they're this criminal it was on nbc abc cbs cnn it was on every channel
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:35.680]  that i knew of when they de-platformed me last year that alex jones called for killing members of
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:41.840]  the medium there was no clip there was no video why would i say that a i disagree with that b it's
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:48.000]  illegal and they asked jack dorsi you haven't banned him yet you're the last guy but he said get
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:55.280]  battle rifles ready and kill the media dorsi goes i saw that i i'm still gonna keep him up so just
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:27:03.920]  a stunt then he banned me so explain this speech isn't about saying what you want to say
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:11.440]  that's the side issue speech is about standing up to liars when they lie about you
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:19.360]  so imagine having your arms your legs tied and your mouth gagged imagine they will you out in
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:27.760]  a gladiatorial event and you're tied to the front of a forklift and out walks brian stelter and
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:35.040]  avaro hillary clinton they pull out swords and they just shove them in your guts and everybody claps
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:41.280]  you're gagged and you're bleeding and the and there's big teleprompter flashing hooray death
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:50.880]  blow i mean the art type of how cowardly this is the art type of how ridiculous this is
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:56.160]  how did they ever get the left
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:07.520]  to be so evil i mean i watch these videos of katlyn benet milley weaver
[2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:11.120]  on these universities and oh and shroyer as well who just walked in

[2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:40.240]  it's friday 133 central standard time global
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:45.760]  of the broadcast live i'm on a return this saturday the live transmission i'm not announced yet
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:52.880]  the time of and then sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central oh it's frayers coming up three o'clock we're gonna
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.080]  have dr. dick vegas with us next hour your phone calls us a few minutes away but let's hit some of
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:04.240]  the breaking news that just came in seconds ago no i'm not talking about the tactical
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:10.320]  ram by helps synagogues defend against anti-seminic violence i'm gonna get to that in a moment i'm
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:16.240]  talking about this breaking news out of the new york times moeller won't testify next week says house
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:23.920]  judiciary chair reports nadler aka the hamburgler says us special counsel robert moeller the third
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:27.440]  will not testify before committee next week the democratic chairman of the house district
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:31.760]  committee told reporters on friday according to many reports chairman jared nadler said he hopes
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:36.800]  she's not ham to subpoena mr moller to appear for lawmakers but that he would issue if necessary
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:42.240]  adding that negotiations are continuing bloomberg fox another alice reported let's translate that for
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:50.160]  everybody right here i'll explain this again everyone keeps building up by bar like he's
[2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:59.680]  the lily whites as john goodman says in the big Lebowski the whites i know a lot of people that
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:07.120]  i've talked to that worked under bar they say he's a by the book guy and that he's not anti-american
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:12.960]  but let's just not lie to each other he helped cover up iran contra which is fighting a bunch of
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:17.120]  communists so i mean overall that's nothing apart from clinton's and i'm not defending it
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:21.920]  the point is is that he came in to cover up the attempted coup on trump to clean it up and they
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:26.400]  get the deep state to stop it and the moeller report does that so the fact that mollers now
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:33.520]  refusing to testify shows you that if they give out that whole redacted report it burns the illegal
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:38.640]  spies it burns the whole system and notice i said that months ago now they're saying in the news this
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:46.000]  week so this just shows the democrats are crazy it's like they've got a pea shooter and trump's
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:51.680]  got a howitzer cannon and they're not stopping what shows mental illness they're like impeachment and
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:55.760]  all these investigations when he's got them with illegal spying he's got him trying to overturn
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:36:00.320]  the election he's got him with paying off their families with the fusion gps money he's got them
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:06.320]  he's got them leaking to the media illegally he's got them perjuring themselves to congress which
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:15.200]  is illegal but they've been in power so long that they think they're still invincible because it
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:25.120]  worked in the past they don't quit so that's really your takeaway moeller cancels testimony
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:31.040]  in desperate bid to protect deep state not the deep state of donald trump donald trump
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:38.240]  barely got any control of the government yet the down the road some of trump's appointees became
[2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:44.800]  a government under themselves i'd oppose them no the dug in government like ticks you're trying
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  to pull out of your body you ever gone hiking around the woods or camping you get home and
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:52.960]  taking a shower you're like what's that down there like right down underneath your wavos
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:57.600]  is a tick you're like trying to get that sucker out of there and they're burrowed in they got
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:07.200]  their heads in they're holding on like they're riding bucking broncos this is an incredible time
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:13.920]  to be alive an absolutely amazing time but the fact that moeller has canceled his testimony
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:20.320]  shows the jig is up and trump you know why moeller did this right bob bar's telling
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.680]  him we've got all the files and stuff we've got the files inspector general we've got the
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:31.360]  test department inspector general we got all the emails all the text messages all the perjury
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:38.400]  to congress we've got all the admissions and trump is going to declassify it if you don't
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:43.280]  leave him alone you're not dealing with your average swamp creature that's scared he hasn't
[2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:50.160]  done anything you don't have anything on him he likes confrontation stop it back down for
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.160]  the good of the country quit we should have had a president stood up to china and didn't have one
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:59.680]  side deals we should have a president stood up to mexico you know and culture's thing is oh my gosh
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:06.320]  we've got double the record flooding us that's the plan that's why the un's funding the assault
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:12.880]  on our borders and our ice is to crush trump is to crush us that's the plan you don't blame
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:18.480]  trump for it and again i'm not bashing in culture i get her point get on trump's ass he may declare
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  the real national emergency and he should but i read her articles she doesn't really point that out
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:32.560]  she just shows us what a purist she is that she's there and you know trump well yeah his 3d chess
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:38.320]  yeah i told you a lot of times with trump there's no 3d chess it's called being pragmatic it's called
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:43.840]  what makes sense and what can he get done but he's not out to get you he likes the country he likes
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.880]  himself he likes his family and he doesn't like a future in america we're half the country's burning
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:53.200]  in race war he doesn't like a future in america where everybody's too poor to go to his golf courses
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:39:00.080]  he is the service economy and he wants people to be successful
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:07.360]  there's some ass kissing exercise because the president tweets my stuff or likes to show him
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:15.280]  it's because i've been persecuted for supporting trump that i support him even more
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:19.360]  very very lonely would be the word for the establishment
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:27.200]  so take opioids opioid use is now way down just a year and a half of a trump
[2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:32.160]  losses operation against that some numbers are 80 percent some numbers are 70 percent
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:37.760]  and opioid prescription rates tumble the latest sign trump led crackdown is working
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:43.760]  there's enough pills prescribed last year to give every adult united states 34 pills throughout that
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:53.280]  year but now trumps cut it massively the only numbers you look at 43 and 90 percent
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:59.280]  doesn't matter the point is trumps trying instead of just greasing the skids of the
[2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:03.600]  collapse of our civilization now let's shift gears to this
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:12.080]  you've got synagogues in churches being targeted by lunatics and islamists and others
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:16.320]  and i don't care whether you're a mosque in this country i don't care if you're a synagogue
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:22.720]  i don't care if you're a baptist church catholic church obviously these are targets with media
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:29.840]  hypsum for crazy people to go after them and so it's refreshing even see the la times talking about
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:36.560]  shocking the tactical rabbi pulling out an ar-15 and teaching people how to defend themselves
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:41.920]  and saying it's your right and your duty to do it that is a fundamental shift instead of people
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:50.400]  just being victims it was 45 minutes into the lecture when the rabbi pulled out his ar-15
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:58.240]  who thinks by show of hands that we should be carrying more guns rabbi brazil cohen asked the
[2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:04.720]  crowd of west side shabbat synagogue wednesday night during an active shooter seminar organized
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:11.040]  the wake of the deadly attack at the room raise their hands and then just goes into him explaining
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:14.240]  to them about guns good guys versus bad guys one needs to be done
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:23.680]  all right i've got a bunch of news about open borders and diseases spreading in the country
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:30.000]  that i want to get to and i've got your phone calls as well and i want to go to those and i've
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:34.400]  got some really important articles here about creepy tech oligarchs want to dictate your opinions
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:41.680]  we're going to hit those and more but first the system doesn't like me because i'm promoting
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:49.040]  independence and individuals being strong but at the end of the day as society unravels
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:54.720]  there's no excuses that stand up to the reality of the fact that we have to prepare
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:42:00.560]  and i know i've been on the air 24 years a lot of people just consider it that will always be here
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:06.480]  but i'll tell you straight with all the censorship and all the attacks and all the boycotts and all
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.160]  the lawsuits in the last few months it's been hard for us to continue on our course here and
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:15.280]  the mere fact that
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:25.280]  ultra 12 after almost six months of not having any
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:29.840]  came in and people are buying it put us back in the black just for the last few months so

[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:21.280]  but it's the truth the voice in the wilderness out of texas not in new york not in la not in london
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:35.040]  not in frankford or berlin or paris or tokyo or beijing or durbin or mexico city or calcata

[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:13.040]  now i have three different ideas i wanted to shoot by you but i also wanted to do a plug for
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:19.760]  a couple of your products that i really love changed my life the dna force is one and x2
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:24.880]  and you know i do a lot of construction and and we are using the tools that you're using
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:30.560]  you just really breaks havoc on your body and i had three of my fingers starting to go numb and
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:34.240]  i didn't think there was anything going to work on it and i tried your dna force a couple of weeks
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:40.240]  later started feeling that uh the numbness going away and tingling coming back and then uh you know
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:47.200]  now i'm full use of my hand it's great and uh just uh can't thank you enough for what you do
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:51.600]  just um in the fight for liberty well thank you brother i mean we want to tell you something
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:57.280]  works you want to order it again but pqq coq ten has been proven to uh make telomeres last longer
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:02.000]  to make nerves regrow it really is an amazing product for anybody above 40 the young people
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:08.960]  can take it as well but yes dna force plus is amazing uh what'd you think of the x2 i love that
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:14.160]  too i you know what i have to say is like after a few months of being on that i felt like i wasn't
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:18.560]  searching for words you know there was a time in my life where i felt like man i don't you know i don't
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:22.960]  know if i'm just too exhausted or what but you know you feel like you want to get in a conversation
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:28.320]  you're pausing and you can't you know you can't find the word to say and um i swear man that x2
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:32.560]  really helps with cognition well that's because the synapse is in the brain operate off of it
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:36.480]  it's electrochemical you're absolutely right when i forget to take x2 every couple days so
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:40.720]  does i forget for like a week because i get busy then i feel it and i take it and it really is
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:45.760]  amazing so thank you for the support brother uh what is your view on solutions and spreading the word
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:51.520]  well one thing uh you know this goes along with your uh your shirt promotion where you're talking
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:57.200]  about you know don't california my texas don't california my usa and all um and you know right
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:01.680]  now i'm actually i'm looking online right now at properties in texas because i think patriots
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:07.120]  need to move to texas there's a book out right now by lieutenant colonel alan west called hold
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:14.240]  texas hold the nation and um i i feel like maybe you could put a call out to patriot because you
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:20.240]  know what we love you and there's a lot of us out here and you know i by the way i like alan west
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:26.240]  i didn't know he had a book about hold texas hold the nation name of it yeah well and i feel like
[2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.320]  if we can't hold texas we're going to lose this nation and you know even if you you know if you
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:34.960]  live in a beautiful state like colorado maybe i can move back here one day but you know what the
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:40.960]  first thing we got to do is actually hold texas because if we can't keep that from if we can't
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:46.800]  keep it red and keep it from going blue like you were saying in 2024 then we're going to lose this
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:50.560]  whole thing by the way let's be clear they bring in millions of illegal aliens who aren't even bad
[2:51:50.560 --> 2:51:54.800]  people on average but they're here illegally no one's reaching out to them but democrats that
[2:51:54.800 --> 2:51:59.360]  shipped them here and control them with welfare now so automatically they're being set up as the
[2:51:59.360 --> 2:52:04.960]  voting block it is a criminal takeover it must be stopped i i hope we can save texas i tell you
[2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:10.000]  the average texan thinks everything's okay and the old texas will never know texas is in a lot
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:15.440]  of trouble and i think so and that's why i think like maybe maybe you had to put a call for for
[2:52:15.440 --> 2:52:19.840]  patriots to move there and the second the second tier goes right along with what you were saying
[2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:24.160]  because i think there's a multi-tiered thing we should do is patriots need to move to texas and
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:29.760]  two there needs to be an outreach we need to start reaching out to spanish-speaking people and try to
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:35.600]  really say hey you want to embrace the american way and you really want to if you want to escape
[2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:40.400]  where you came from you don't want to create it here so you know what you need to embrace the
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:45.440]  american way you need to and you know i i know lots of lots of mexicans lots of spanish-speaking
[2:52:45.440 --> 2:52:50.240]  people not just mexicans but they're some of the hardest working people i know and exactly but
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:54.880]  they've got leftists trying to control them and be their boss like alexandria cortez and the
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:53:00.000]  city of austin's now announced it's adopting her green plan that will bankrupt any city thank you
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:05.360]  eric great points uh speaking of alexandria cortez mic in south carolina is up next mic are on the
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:14.080]  air go ahead hello hello yes sir can you hear me i can i feel like we need to take her and i'm
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:23.840]  serious because they're all saying that at this point i take it as a threat sure i'm having trouble
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:28.000]  understanding exactly what you're saying uh maybe your phone's breaking up go ahead and say what you
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:36.880]  were saying again we just dropped this call just dropped okay wendy in ohio wendy you're on the
[2:53:36.880 --> 2:53:46.480]  air go ahead hello hi hey hi um allegedly flor lumer investigative journalists cannot each or get
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:56.240]  an uber and today is the day of the uber ipo and so it's very important for us to remember um outside
[2:53:56.240 --> 2:54:05.440]  it um remember that fear is um a problem with that that everybody needs to consider that uber is not
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:09.840]  a company of this sort of organization that's right uber lost a billion dollars last year it's
[2:54:09.840 --> 2:54:15.760]  very monopolistic it spies on people it sells your data and it wants driverless cars to take over

[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:56.480]  all right so i'm just gonna say this in late 1900s early 2000s i was working as a networking
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:02.720]  engineer in new hampshire at an air force base and i was chemically doused with a chemical
[2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:09.920]  that's now in our water supply a guy that called in the other day mentioned it it's called pfos
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:17.440]  but they keep changing the name the actual original name of it was c8 which gave a lot of
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:24.560]  people in ohio cancer during the 40s and 50s i don't know if you remember that i do but the the um
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:31.360]  media is covering it up okay you'll see an article every once in a while that they're down playing it
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:38.000]  i can tell you it's a killer it gets into the cells of your body and it attacks your immune system
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:44.320]  your body cannot break it down your your liver and kidneys do not break this chemical down
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:52.000]  this chemical is extremely dangerous my i i drank it in huge amounts huge quantities so i've gotten a
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:57.680]  lot of diseases and i've been fighting it but i just want people to know out there that this is
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:02.880]  happening and i think this is a eugenics thing because this is this cross is all various crosses

[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:06.960]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:12.880]  quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:18.800]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:24.480]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:29.600]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:35.280]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:05.760]  we are buying live
[3:00:09.040 --> 3:00:12.640]  i'm your host alex jones we've got about a nick baggis coming up in just about six minutes
[3:00:12.640 --> 3:00:19.120]  can an alabama thanks for holding her on the air
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:23.440]  second-time caller i've got about three ideas for you know you're short on time i'm gonna throw them
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:29.040]  at you real quick and then hang up you can comment thank you sir as you see fit uh maybe some of
[3:00:29.040 --> 3:00:32.800]  these ideas are good maybe they're not number one what can we do about these tech firms and
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:38.160]  particularly like facebook uh can those who know how to do it uh maybe short their uh stock and help
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:43.200]  drive it down or uh contrary to that maybe get a group of people together to buy enough of the
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:49.760]  shares together to have a block vote to have force a vote to force zuckerberg off the off the board
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:54.960]  or whatever and uh comment i mean the idea number two for you is your graphics department needs to
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:01:01.520]  create uh flyers and or posters uh that we can download in pdf format and print and distribute
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:07.120]  and i'd recommend that they put a large uh qr code in the little right hand corner say for
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:12.880]  instance this is a vaccine poster uh the people could scan that qr code and that would take them
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:17.760]  to a landing page on your website where you have lots of articles that people could read about
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:23.840]  about the dangers of vaccine and uh well that's a great idea and and and we've had qr codes before
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:28.160]  we'll do it again we do have a page on info wars right now that has a bunch of posters people
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:32.800]  can download or make your own and do it but that's a great idea 60 percent of facebook stocks owned
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:38.960]  by zuckerberg and the company's worth 560 something billion so i don't think we'll be able to affect
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:43.600]  that but i think word of mouth exposing and calling for president trump to break it up
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:49.360]  i think that is the answer under any trust act and i did number three for those of us who are
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:56.880]  computer savvy uh could you set up a uh a bit torrent server uh for us to uh download some of
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:02.800]  the uh current uh news items and videos that you guys are creating a contrary to popular belief you
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:07.520]  know bit torrent is not illegal unfortunately it's just a technology but some people use it for uh
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:12.240]  no i totally agree and i have a small it staff and we're not as sophisticated as folks think we
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:15.920]  would like to move into all of that we're being forced to because of all the censorship and the
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:20.640]  deplatforming because i mean i believe in those platforms i just don't believe in things like
[3:02:20.640 --> 3:02:26.720]  bitcoin as a bubble or a tulip bubble as an investment but i do believe in it as a currency yeah but
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:32.080]  bit torrent is a great technology i downloaded one of your videos yesterday on the internet
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:37.360]  using bit torrent your video about terrorism uh within about three four hours i was no i agree sir
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:43.120]  so send us an email at showtipsinforwards.com great caller thank you so much for all those
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:49.760]  points what a smart caller wish i was that smart seriously uh let's talk to bill in north carolina
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:56.320]  bill thanks for holding go ahead yes sir hey uh mr jones i was one talking about the free college
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:03.840]  tuition uh these guys keep pushing all that is is these colleges have been overrun by a bunch
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:09.600]  of liberal socialist professors and all this is another way to indoctrinate these kids to get
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:13.920]  a no i agree and that's why they're so violent now if they think you're a trump supporter you're
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:18.400]  trying to keep them from their free education as if they're ever really going to get that
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:23.040]  yes sir and also i wanted to visit with you about the second amendment
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:27.680]  that these guys are continuing trying to do away with the second amendment yes
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:34.400]  yes sir with they do away if they disarm disarmament of the population will be considered
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:42.240]  an act of war and will be dealt with accordingly yes sir no no me you're yes sir to you brother
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:46.080]  you the audience give me the orders you're awesome the points you're making are better
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:50.480]  than the point i make you're absolutely right the democrats are everywhere admitting they want our
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:56.160]  guns they want to repeal the second amendment and then we sit here and act like it's a game this is
[3:03:56.160 --> 3:04:03.040]  do or die this is exponential it's happening now what do you think we should do bill well sir if uh
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:10.000]  people need if they don't have uh some type of protection right now uh they need to get it
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:15.040]  whether it's really expensive or not because if we have any type of a bump getting ammunition and
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:20.880]  firearms will be prohibitive well there's no doubt sir that they they told us for decades
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:24.880]  the democrats don't want your guns even though in every other country they took them and now they
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:29.280]  say we want to repeal the second amendment we want your guns we're coming from them and there was a
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:33.840]  big article two days ago about kelemik brane in fact pull that kelemik brane article up it was like
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:39.280]  every democratic candidate is for massive gun confiscation was the headline we'll try to find
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:44.080]  that i'll come back and show that article show some clips and then go to uh the fellow that's
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:48.640]  going to host this hour or most of this hour that's dr dick baggage thank you bill with the right
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:57.600]  pack stay with us the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:03.200]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:08.960]  it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[3:05:08.960 --> 3:05:15.040]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:19.440]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:25.760]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:30.800]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:36.000]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:42.480]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges
[3:05:42.480 --> 3:05:48.800]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[3:05:48.800 --> 3:05:59.680]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot com you found it the tip of the
[3:05:59.680 --> 3:06:10.480]  spear it is the alex joneshow i hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:19.600]  country arping on wars we fight and griping about the way america is the apple in the globalist
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:26.320]  eye for all our problems we've done amazing things and if they can take control of us they believe
[3:06:26.320 --> 3:06:32.160]  they have global domination today the united states tomorrow the world is their view and so
[3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:36.960]  tell them to bring a few days ago wrote an article we'll put on screen for tv viewers
[3:06:37.760 --> 3:06:42.640]  dealing with the fact that every major democrat candidate there's 20 plus of them
[3:06:43.760 --> 3:06:48.800]  once gun confiscation nationwide proof every single dim candidate is a danger to the second
[3:06:48.800 --> 3:06:55.200]  amendment now let's go to a video compilation that's from that article this is just some of
[3:06:55.200 --> 3:07:00.800]  the videos that are in the article where they're admitting all of this just to illustrate how
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:07.760]  serious this is these individuals have bodyguards these individuals own guns but they don't want
[3:07:07.760 --> 3:07:13.040]  you to have them so we become like mexico or democrat cities that have confiscated the guns
[3:07:13.040 --> 3:07:18.720]  or don't allow second amendment like chicago or dc here's the report and then dr nick baggage takes
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:25.280]  over you know we have to get these weapons of war off the street with a with a ban on these kind of
[3:07:25.280 --> 3:07:31.920]  weapons they're meant for war is i think most americans agree that these weapons of war should
[3:07:31.920 --> 3:07:36.560]  not be on our streets again would you would you prosecute people do you support the government
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:40.320]  buying them back and if not potentially people could go to jail if they don't want to sell them
[3:07:40.320 --> 3:07:46.480]  back yes or no again we should have a law that bans these weapons and we should have a reasonable
[3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:53.280]  period in which people can turn in these weapons right now we have a nation that allows in streets
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:07:57.760]  and communities like mine these weapons that should not exist what's the punishment for people who
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:08:04.720]  don't hand in their guns do they go to jail well jake they would but i also offer an alternative
[3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:08.880]  which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range i want to do what australia did
[3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:12.720]  and new zealand just recently did i think this issue just needs some bold leadership by the
[3:08:12.720 --> 3:08:20.400]  way pause back to sub 10 seconds please that's all guns and a shooting launch that's the end of
[3:08:20.400 --> 3:08:24.080]  the second moment i mean they're doing it they're coming for your guns the new york times is the
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:33.440]  headline repeal the second amendment it's here do what australia did and new zealand just recently
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:38.320]  did i think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it isn't it fair to say you
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:44.160]  actually do want to take away people's guns you know keep your pistols keep your long rifles keep
[3:08:44.160 --> 3:08:48.720]  your shotguns i want the most dangerous weapons these weapons of war out of the hands of the most
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:55.120]  dangerous people it was back at it again he wants to set that precedent to take your guns
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:08:59.440]  even though shotguns and handguns are used in most crimes he wants you to just acquiesce that
[3:08:59.440 --> 3:09:04.640]  something's going to be turned in then it's everything continue isn't it fair to say you
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:10.560]  actually do want to take away people's guns you know keep your pistols keep your long rifles keep
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:15.040]  your shotguns i want the most dangerous weapons these weapons of war out of the hands of the most
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:32.000]  dangerous people we need to take on the nr a expand background checks and the gun show loophole
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:38.240]  and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons we have a ban on military style assault
[3:09:38.240 --> 3:09:46.240]  weapons we adopted universal background check i'm taking the no nra pledge i think that the nra
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:55.120]  owns congress the weapons of war do not belong on our streets they're gonna say if you give them
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:10:02.560]  bomb stock it's gonna be a slippery slope i certainly hope so how do you justify the democratic
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:08.000]  view on gun control when the shooter was stopped by a man who was legally licensed to carry a gun
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  well first of all uh the kind of gun being carried he shouldn't be carrying assault weapons are uh
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:21.200]  i wrote the first the last serious gun control law that was written it was law for 10 years
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:26.720]  and it outlawed assault weapons and all outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:32.320]  bullets and she can kill a whole lot of people a lot more quickly and we will also insist and ensure
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:40.320]  that weapons that were designed and sold to the united states military for the express purpose
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:46.800]  of killing people as efficiently as effectively and as great a number as possible are kept on the
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:51.280]  battlefields and are no longer sold into our communities because they will end up in our
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:58.160]  synagogues in our churches in our mosques in our public places they will take the lives of those
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:16.560]  in our lives upon being elected i will give the united states congress 100 days to get
[3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:21.520]  their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws and if they fail to
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:28.000]  do it then i will take executive action and specifically what i will do is put in place
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:34.480]  a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year they are required to do
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:40.640]  background checks when they sell those guns we outlaw all sorts of military grade weapons
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:46.320]  that are deemed too unsafe to have here in america things like grenades and anti-tank rockets
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:52.480]  and landmines will these kinds of weapons designed just to kill people should be outlawed as well
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:58.640]  and the truth is i have a very proud rating by the f by the n r a now but the truth of this is
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:06.800]  is that the n r a is corrupted if you are receiving this transmission you are in resistance
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:17.360]  and welcome back and welcome back to info wars you know we're just listening to this
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:27.520]  brief clip on the democrats sort of take on managing guns and gun control you know i want
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:32.480]  to talk about this just a bit uh you know they they want to paint it and they're using the phrase
[3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:40.480]  weapons of war right as if to distinguish between any other kind of weapon and i want to kind of
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:48.880]  roll back a couple centuries actually on this issue the revolutionary war right over 250 years ago
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:54.800]  right and and here was the deal you know we didn't have a navy and we didn't have a military
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:13:00.080]  because we were a bunch of independent colonies trying to organize ourselves and the fact is
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:06.800]  individuals owned what we call weapons of war in fact merchant ships were equipped with cannons
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:13.280]  and mortars you know big mortars and big cannons the biggest of the day that you can put on a ship
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:20.640]  and uh and then uh biggest states and farms and uh communities they all had cannons and mortars
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:26.480]  and most of them were in private hands actually uh cannons and mortars you know we don't let that
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:31.760]  happen you know i guess we've already got gun control right we don't let people have cannons
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:37.040]  and mortars but think of some of the merchant ships that have been stopped stuck by pirates
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:40.880]  around the world wouldn't it be nice that they were equipped with a few cannons these days to take
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:46.560]  care of that problem but the point is we don't allow that anymore and now they want to confiscate
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:51.920]  what they call assault weapons weapons of war well if it wasn't for the weapons of war in the
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:58.960]  revolutionary period we wouldn't have the country we have to fight about this today so um and maybe
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:03.920]  a little closer scrutiny about uh people that have them i mean in our legislature right now
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:09.760]  there's a bill pending i'm concerned about it but it's for anyone who is involuntarily incarcerated
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:17.280]  in a mental hospital might be restricted from buying a firearm but they too would have an
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:22.640]  appeal process to go back through and if it's been 50 years or whatever you know and reappeal
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:26.880]  but you know from my perspective that's again a slippery slope because then they'll say well if
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:30.880]  you have a mental illness well then what's that who's going to decide that is you ever saw a
[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:36.000]  counselor in your life a marriage counselor or counselor with your kids that can restrict you
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  at some point perhaps so uh you know again slippery slopes uh take us down the wrong
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:48.240]  direction which is what people are concerned about in using this heinous events you know of
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:55.120]  where people have gotten totally crazy um you know with assault rifles but more than that i mean most
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:00.640]  of the violence gun violence is not assault rifles it's shotguns pistols you know the guns that they're
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:04.640]  saying they're not going to restrict but this is a slippery slope you know in germany they're already
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:09.840]  restricted to gun clubs but try and get a membership to a gun club you go through extensive
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:14.960]  training for weeks or months or whatever and then you can go to the gun club check out your gun you
[3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:21.360]  know like uh pretty ridiculous in my part of the world in alaska gun ownership is kind of fundamental
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:27.680]  most people have one or two or three or four uh in their homes and uh usually a couple hundred
[3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:33.440]  rounds for each one so that's kind of standard bear in my part of the world in alaska uh we're
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:37.920]  coming into the break in a few seconds i'm going to come backward and get into the first amendment

[3:20:51.360 --> 3:20:58.160]  make sure you do that uh this weekend if you haven't done so already uh you know i thinking about
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:02.880]  you know all of the fundamental issues that are at stake right now you know and and when i started
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:08.560]  reporting on a lot of these issues technology issues the technocracy as it's now referred to
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:14.400]  in terms of what government has become the blending um and if you look at the democratic party what is
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:20.720]  it consists of now and you know multi-generational history my brother tom did his master's thesis
[3:21:21.680 --> 3:21:27.840]  on that and one of his things he was doing in college and it was the idea that over generations
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:33.280]  from one to the next is where you really get a historical context that otherwise is lost by
[3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:39.680]  whoever sort of trains up the next generation if you can do this successively two three four
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:47.600]  generations as this happened now um you can really reshape and reframe what becomes history
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:53.680]  but what is the future when you think about the internet and modern media the technocracies tools
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:22:00.080]  um these have the greatest impact of all in changing the very character and nature of not
[3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:06.400]  just public debate the town square if you will but let's think about it in the context of um
[3:22:06.400 --> 3:22:10.960]  our founding fathers even and what's kind of happened and what's driven it and a lot of it
[3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:17.920]  um is in fact the military industrial complex which later merged with the academics um and
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:24.400]  then the globalists to create something much much different but predicated on the same warnings
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:31.120]  that thomas fein one of our founding fathers in terms of debate you know when he wrote common
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:36.880]  sense and the rights of man who i've been reviewing that those writings lately and one of the things
[3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:44.480]  he warned about was military standing militaries being formed up after um and in advance of war
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:48.720]  you know that's when they collected tax we have standing income taxes and we didn't have standing
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:53.280]  armies so they would you know the governments would have these conflicts they would create
[3:22:53.280 --> 3:22:58.160]  taxation and then stand in their army to go deal with the problems and after the army was done
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:04.960]  doing its thing they never reduced the taxes they just added to them periodically with a new war
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:09.920]  and if you look at sort of the evolution of our country not inside of a monarchy but in
[3:23:09.920 --> 3:23:16.480]  sort of a technocracy that we've created today you have the same equation think about the largest
[3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:23.840]  portion of the deficits are driven by defense spending most of which is for foreign governments
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:30.960]  and foreign institutions that have nothing absolutely to do with you and i on a day-to-day
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:36.960]  basis but our deficits are paying for that our billions and billions and trillions of dollars
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:43.840]  now trillions in deficits are paying for all of that and the same time we deindustrialize
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:50.560]  the west and then suppress the ability to have this discussion and that's really what's going on
[3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:57.120]  it's an attack on the first amendment and the second amendment the foundations of the republic
[3:23:57.760 --> 3:24:04.720]  when you get right down to it on the same arguments the same debate the same fundamental human
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:12.240]  qualities that were being debated 250 275 years ago when the founding fathers were emerging in
[3:24:12.240 --> 3:24:17.520]  their thought processes in terms of what a democracy within a republic might look like
[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:23.440]  and how that might evolve and we've been in that experiment now over 250 years and there's been
[3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:28.560]  changes you know we've had constitutional amendments that came after those first 10
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:35.680]  bill of rights but when you think about this again within the technocracy that exists today
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:42.720]  ground has to be recaptured this president is the only one the democrats are making it
[3:24:42.720 --> 3:24:51.440]  institutionally acceptable to attack gun rights and speech rights and press rights and the right
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:58.800]  of assembly even when you consider the internet is the town square it's where we assemble in the
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:04.080]  21st century to have a dialogue and anything that restricts that dialogue is in the front
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:10.640]  to a constitutional form of government such as ours that has embedded in it freedom of the press
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:17.280]  which isn't just about the press getting to restrict and control it's not a business amendment
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:27.440]  it's not a business transaction the press is a principle an idea an ideal that's embedded in
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:35.760]  who we are whether you're a republican a democrat a libertarian an independent a green whatever you
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:44.320]  are politically the right to have discourse within the public square is fundamental to being
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:50.560]  whatever you are and whoever you are within this democratic republic that's what's under attack
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:56.080]  right now when you think of personal privacy as we used to think about the doorway of our home
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:03.120]  that was protected from intrusion right that no one could kick in your door and occupy your
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:10.640]  residence and confiscate your goods without due process and the understanding of law but your
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:16.560]  digital doorway that is more fundamental to your freedom and your liberty and your privacy today
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:22.640]  than anything ever imagined and would have been protected had it been imagined 250 years ago
[3:26:22.640 --> 3:26:29.760]  absolutely protected and it's not we've allowed businesses to exploit it for commercial purposes
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:35.760]  in partnership with government who exploits it for other purposes and then they use the vehicles
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:43.120]  of government under the obama administration to further their political lands no the vehicle of
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:50.320]  government is not to further anyone's individual or collective political ends in that sense without
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:56.480]  it being fully transparent and exposed to public debate public discourse open channels of communication
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:03.440]  in absolute free speech absolute free speech no restriction except you have the individual right
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:10.960]  to change the channel that's it in terms of weapons of war nonsense kick that back into their league
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:16.960]  and put a good a bumper sticker a t-shirt together without cannons in the merchant marines right
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:22.880]  i mean if we hadn't had independently owned cannons and mortars no revolutionary war would
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:28.480]  have been won and we wouldn't have been able to deal with the attacks of our shipping on the open
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:36.640]  seas in fact it was pain who proposed issuing special grants to privateers private ship owners
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:44.320]  where for every pound of of cannonballs and gunpowder and cannons that they had loose freight
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:49.680]  that we compensated them for the loss of freight but we equipped them with some cannons you know
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:53.440]  that would have been a pretty good expenditure public money you know merchant ships that we
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:58.320]  didn't have to pay for fully equipped with cannons pretty good idea you know got a lot of ships
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:04.640]  in the sea in a hurry and we're already there we just said hey guys add some more cannon
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:09.840]  you know and today we're worrying about assault rifles for a few lunatics and you know when you
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:14.080]  think about gun deaths in the united states in my community in alaska it's not gun deaths people
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:20.880]  get run over by cars you know i think they're out feeding gun deaths this year uh in anchorage
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:26.640]  but gun deaths yeah they're legitimate big deal you know 15 20 000 year that's a big number
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:31.280]  medical malpractice about a quarter million people die of that a year no one's confiscating
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:39.680]  scaffolds and uh pills from doctors right now but they're over 10 times 12 times 15 times

[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:42.880]  we're going to try and make this a regular friday fourth hour event unless i'm traveling or something
[3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:48.080]  otherwise you can plan on hearing me uh every fourth hour on fridays um
[3:33:49.440 --> 3:33:53.760]  speech you know freedom of speech you know under attack when we think about what's happened to
[3:33:53.760 --> 3:34:00.560]  this network and now others uh that's quickly um devolving but i want to go back in time again
[3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:07.440]  because the multi-generational history is is a big deal and you know i'm 60 now and and you know
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:13.920]  when i think back to the conversation i with my grandfather who was born in 1890 all right so
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:18.880]  that goes back a ways you know you get a perspective of the evolution of technology
[3:34:18.880 --> 3:34:23.200]  when you get to have a conversation with a guy like that now he's of course long since past
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  but thinking you know multi-generational memory and how we look at our politics we have now
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:38.000]  um over twitter in uh 50 years of history um from the founding fathers to where we are today and
[3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:45.600]  two and a half centuries plus uh you lose a lot in the translation over time and that's
[3:34:45.600 --> 3:34:50.720]  some of what i think this program has been about is trying to recapture some of that in the onslaught
[3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:56.880]  of a globalist assault that happens as the late uh Chuck Carter used to say um for those who
[3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:04.240]  remember him as a radio host one slice at a time until the baloney is all gone right i mean it's
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:09.920]  like the slow boil of the frog um and so the multi-generational perspective is important
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:17.760]  and young people now invigorated with that knowledge uh can be a real force uh for change
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:23.040]  and so you know part of the you know it's the analysis of the current events against the backdrop
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:28.560]  of history and the remembrance of the basic values that drive the country i think again is
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:35.760]  foundational and yeah they were a bunch of old uh white uh haired uh white dudes back then and we've
[3:35:35.760 --> 3:35:42.720]  evolved as a country um in terms of understanding of humanity and freedom and liberty and we've
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:48.480]  continued that evolution uh and yeah things do change and history does change things and so we
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:55.520]  need to make sure we've retained the fundamentals of those basic rights um on the backdrop of the
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:01.120]  scaffolding of modern culture on the things that create the modern culture because foundation
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:07.200]  still remains the same but we've continued to build on that foundation and we cannot lose sight
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:12.960]  of the foundation that holds the whole thing together and that's what's been lost this generation
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:17.840]  particularly although they say the generation coming behind this current one is one of the most
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:23.680]  conservative ever um and i think so because it's the backlash to the craziness that people are seeing
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:30.800]  today and how that's really rubbed against the base of humanity freedom of speech freedom of the
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:37.360]  press freedom of privacy as a fundamental were experiments 250 years ago and they proved to be
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:43.840]  quite useful um what has happened is a drift away from the experiment that was working in fact
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:49.760]  past the experiment to success and now it's evolving again and let me remind people how
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:53.920]  what was handled in a monarchy that's what i want to go back to because that was what was being
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:58.720]  resisted back then and it was the idea that everybody was on the land but the land was owned
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:04.960]  by the monarchy and they took your productive um production a certain percentage of production
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:09.280]  from the land and if you didn't produce enough they just throw you off in the street you know
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:14.240]  literally and you die and that's what happened you died you know during the irish potato famine you
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:20.240]  died frozen to death and the landlords continued to confiscate a lot of people left during that
[3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:26.560]  famine and that's one of the ways america was actually populated my family came uh a little
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:34.720]  bit later in the 1880s my great-grandfather my mother's side came here and on my uh my great-grandmother
[3:37:34.720 --> 3:37:40.320]  also on my mother's side came here from europe and then on my father's side from cohesion 1906
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:48.320]  you know i had the opportunity to go back and visit my grandfather's place of birth with my
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:56.000]  oldest son who's now 41 and that gives you some perspective because there's nothing changed
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:03.680]  hardly at all there and you know 120 years and the same place my grandfather left is still
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:09.360]  there i mean it's my relatives are still living there uh my grandfather never made it back and
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:14.880]  i think about when he came through ellis island and i've got the entry images and all that and his
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:20.560]  he came through in 1906 but he didn't become a citizen until the 1920s i believe before that was
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:27.120]  finalized and you know when you think about that whole migration period and what's happened
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:32.880]  that was before income tax they were leaving you know a rough way of being in the uh
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:39.280]  uh west so-called west uh liberty wasn't there freedom wasn't there even in 1906
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:44.320]  but going back to the founding fathers the monarchy maintained control of the land
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:50.160]  and um and and the church at the time and essentially kept you stupid because they
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:56.560]  thought you needed some intermediary between you and god which i got news flash you don't
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:01.600]  it's okay if that's what you want to do but you you don't need an intermediary and so
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:06.160]  when you look at what was happening when income tax came in it was another way to tax the labor
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:13.760]  of human beings something that was unconstitutional ruled by the u.s supreme court in the 1890s
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:19.760]  that income tax taxing a human human labor was in voluntary servitude not allowed in the united
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:25.280]  states and what we saw evolve was something that only affected not even the middle class
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:29.840]  or the lower class the massive of the country were not affected only the rich
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:36.080]  at the time in the very rich at the time paid an income tax and that of course we saw the erosion
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:41.440]  of that over time to where now corporations pay the least amount and individuals pay the most
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:46.720]  amount taxing over up to a third of your labor or more as an individual at the national level
[3:39:46.720 --> 3:39:50.800]  and then at the state level another bite and the next size taxes and all the roll up on that
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:55.760]  another bite another bite until they're probably grabbing about 80% of your productive labor uh
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:40:03.680]  so are you free or have we evolved into a new form of surf in fact most of our land has property
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:08.400]  tax at the local and state level in most communities in the country so you don't even own your land
[3:40:08.400 --> 3:40:13.520]  you have a partnership you have a partnership with the state and you have a partnership with the bank
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:18.480]  because most people don't own anything anymore uh used to be able to own a home said you go out
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:24.320]  put stakes in the ground grab the four corner survey at market off and you know create a farm
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:29.600]  there and clear it and at the end of the day you don't own it so you actually did own your property
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:34.720]  mortgage there's no such thing as mortgage that's a modern thing you know in terms of how those evolved
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:40.480]  in terms of average people having them a credit as such is evolved that's a banker's trip happened
[3:40:40.480 --> 3:40:46.560]  way after income taxes uh easy credit installment credit none of that that evolved in this last
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:52.720]  century you know like less than 100 years ago even but these are systems to recreate the slave
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:41:00.240]  state right i mean really you think about it and then to limit your privacy by attacking you digitally
[3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:06.960]  which is what's happened the kick in your digital doorways happened and that's where now because
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:11.520]  digital information is to the domain of commerce nobody wants to interfere it's not the domain of
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:17.520]  commerce anymore it's the domain of privacy belongs to us individually should not be used or exploited
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:24.320]  in any way collected for sales political or any other reason it ought to be deleted loot delete
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:30.480]  not related to you at all in any way shape or form any legal to do so on every level you know
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:39.120]  we need to rethink this digital world that we've created because in fact it is the foundation of
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:46.720]  freedom today and speech today and the very essence of who we are as liberal liberated in the old
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:57.040]  sense uh liberated people that's what it used to mean liberated free of restriction and undo
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:03.920]  regulation and undo intrusion by government into our lives it used to fit two volumes you could
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:11.440]  carry the entire law library under your arm and now it fills up three or four floors of a big building
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:18.240]  and nobody knows what the law says or what the regulations mean it's just a big hijacking of the
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:25.920]  republic a one slice at a time until the baloney's all gone and now we need to call it like it is
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:30.400]  we need to demand that this president do what he did what he said and what he has started
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:39.120]  doing like no other has ever done disrupt it shake the core of the status quo that has failed us
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:44.960]  that has failed the nation and failed our values no matter what political party or persuasion we
[3:42:44.960 --> 3:42:50.400]  come from we are being robbed of our democracy and robbed of this republic this is dr nick

[3:46:53.440 --> 3:47:04.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:04.320 --> 3:47:20.320]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:32.160]  and welcome back in the last segment of this fourth hour on may 10th 2019
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:37.520]  and we've been talking about uh really the fundamental rights in the context of the
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:45.200]  technocracy something that i started reporting on now 25 years ago as i saw it it kind of evolving
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:51.440]  and and what it was going to do and when i go back even to my uh teens my late uh teens i was
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:57.840]  talking to a lot of people about what i saw then this would have been the 1970s and what i was seeing
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:04.160]  then was this whole concept that transportation information and communication systems at that
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:10.160]  time were going to be the big revolutionary uh trend setters in terms of technology and if you
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:17.040]  think about it after that is where we got uh federal express ups the whole idea of the spoke
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:24.800]  and the hub uh idea of shipping and express shipping got evolved um literally alaska has
[3:48:24.800 --> 3:48:29.680]  shipping hubs for fedex and ups for their international shipping if you look on a globe
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:34.480]  which makes sense you'll see why because of where we sit relative to europe asian and north
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:40.480]  south america easy to transit this hub for the entire northern hemisphere for sure so when you
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:46.400]  think about um kind of technology and then you look at communications obviously now we can make
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:50.880]  calls anywhere in the u.s for virtually nothing you know it's all hooked into our cell phones
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:55.200]  internationally we can use skype or whatsapp or any number of things that will get us around the
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:49:00.160]  world basically nothing you know free free communication on on the level that's never
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:06.000]  been unbelievable i mean my grandfather again talking multi-generational memory was here when
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:11.440]  radio was invented okay i mean he was a kid when radio was invented uh he phones weren't
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:17.120]  in standard you say were kind of a unique thing when he was uh born in 1890 uh but you think
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:22.320]  of the whole evolution of transportation communication information system stuff i was
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:27.920]  talking about and you look at the next 50 years from the 70s to where we are and where we're headed
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:35.440]  unbelievable difference so when you think about technology technology doubled from where we are
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:41.600]  today from the invention of the wheel to where we are today that span of human inventiveness
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:49.120]  will double in six to nine months and does that every six months because now you have all these
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:55.280]  technologies feeding on one another and everything is accelerated and when you dump quantum computing
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:01.280]  on this which is coming an ai which is coming which is again going to reshape the whole discussion
[3:50:01.280 --> 3:50:07.360]  of what liberty freedom and within a democratic republic is going to look like this generation
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:13.280]  right now those that remember the values and those that know the technology the young and the old
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:19.440]  which is why now more than ever the recognition of multi-generational knowledge needs to be
[3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:27.120]  expressed and shared between grandparents and grandchildren you know we need to get the gap
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:34.080]  filled a lot of grandparents are retired share strong values have an opportunity to reach out
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:38.880]  communicate with your grandchildren through the vehicles that exist today use these tools
[3:50:38.880 --> 3:50:45.440]  skype internet whatever you can if you can't be with them in present be with them share the values
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:50.880]  pass them on because this is the way the next generation will be shaped either going to be
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:56.080]  on the backdrop of that think about what's happened within the household within the family again an
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:02.560]  erosion within a republic when when you have no one training kids the state is or daycare center is
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:09.360]  is giving them their agenda not your agenda grandparents who have time and engage their
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:16.160]  grandchildren ways the parents can't take them for the summer on a trip for a month go do something
[3:51:16.160 --> 3:51:21.920]  with your grandkids we have a chance to get close to them and influence them with your stories your
[3:51:21.920 --> 3:51:29.920]  narrative your thinking your experiences and pass them on in a context of values kids love it man
[3:51:29.920 --> 3:51:34.880]  and and and we don't do it enough and and it's something the kids are crying for
[3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:39.920]  that kind of our return the electronics off I know quite like crazy as they go through the
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:45.440]  electronic withdrawals because it is because what's happening with the electronics to get a
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:52.880]  releases of bio biochemicals within the brain that excite them that stimulate them the same
[3:51:52.880 --> 3:51:59.600]  centers of the brain that are that are attached to orgasm drug addiction alcoholism you know
[3:51:59.600 --> 3:52:05.920]  these things that create the reoccurring habits that are irresistible is what's being imposed on
[3:52:05.920 --> 3:52:13.840]  children today so extracting them and then you do the programming take over as chief program that's
[3:52:13.840 --> 3:52:19.200]  what I joke about it with my youngest is 12 I'm a chief programmer because what I say matters
[3:52:19.920 --> 3:52:25.600]  to her what you say to your children matters to them the values you convey and these fundamental
[3:52:25.600 --> 3:52:31.760]  values should be delivered in a way where they get the depth of the understanding and the and the
[3:52:31.760 --> 3:52:37.920]  heart of it the heart of what it means to be an American is only going to be conveyed by you
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:43.360]  because the institutions of education from K through 12 are not doing it anymore they're doing
[3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:52.640]  opposite they're giving a squishy socialistic collectivism for the new 21st century slave
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:59.360]  you this is not what we are about when you think about basic freedoms even the bill of
[3:52:59.360 --> 3:53:06.160]  rights isn't even taught in school you know I mean it's like the last course in a high school
[3:53:06.160 --> 3:53:13.200]  program is government class for a semester what do you learn by then nothing in a semester you
[3:53:13.200 --> 3:53:20.000]  should be knowing about government from K through 12 every year something that teaches you not just
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:25.600]  about a bunch of historical footnotes but how do you engage your government how do you participate
[3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:29.760]  in government what does it mean to have free speech what does it mean to have freedom of the
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:34.720]  press what are the bill of rights and should we be able to articulate them as children and the
[3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:42.080]  answer is yes we should foundationally from elementary school middle school high school
[3:53:42.080 --> 3:53:50.640]  not on the last semester of high school to fill out some check the box no it's foundational to
[3:53:50.640 --> 3:53:55.040]  who we are that box should have been checked long before your last year of high school and you
[3:53:55.040 --> 3:54:01.200]  ought to be participating by then if you're 18 years old in your precinct caucuses and your
[3:54:01.200 --> 3:54:06.240]  district caucuses if you're in a political party and so you can take over your political party
[3:54:06.240 --> 3:54:11.360]  if you're listening to this broadcast you know that's how simple as it is if you show up to your
[3:54:11.360 --> 3:54:17.760]  precinct caucuses nobody does democrats or republicans show or libertarians for that
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:22.800]  matter show up find out where they're at and then show up for the district caucuses after
[3:54:22.800 --> 3:54:28.240]  and if you show up in mass you take over and mass like on the district level might be 10 people
[3:54:29.040 --> 3:54:34.160]  you know and i've seen even less they can take over a district precinct caucus find out when
[3:54:34.160 --> 3:54:38.800]  their elections are and then crash the party and organize it you can do these things you know
[3:54:38.800 --> 3:54:45.680]  the moral majority did that back in the 80s you know and and they organized at the precinct level
[3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:49.680]  in the district level and they took over the republican party and held it for quite a while
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:55.440]  i don't believe in religious control of political parties even more is any more than i believe in
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:01.040]  a monarchy controlling them but the idea that individuals can control them with similar political
[3:55:01.040 --> 3:55:06.240]  values i think is the whole point of it isn't it and if they don't represent your values and
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:13.040]  either get out of those parties or take over you know i mean it's one of the two let's don't stay
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:18.480]  and talk about how crummy they are either take over or get out um and or you know and trump took
[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:24.240]  over he beat everybody and changed the republican party into the party of what it is today which is
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:28.640]  you know way different than what the globalists had in mind when they took control of it and what
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:35.360]  they have in mind owning the democrats still and they're doing everything they can to strip you
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:40.880]  of your freedom and your speech most importantly two years out front of the next election
[3:55:40.880 --> 3:55:46.080]  donald trump get on board man reclaim the public space we want to have our discussion
[3:55:46.080 --> 3:55:49.920]  whether you're running or not at least defend our right to have that discussion
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:55.840]  now and in the future by coming down on these big companies breaking up the monopoly power
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:56:02.800]  that they control and changing the course of history you know this this hour i haven't
