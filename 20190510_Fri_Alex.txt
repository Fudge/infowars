[00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.727]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:00:13.727 --> 00:00:21.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.231]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.432]  I am now completely banned.
[00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:30.714]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:31.794]  I want them shut down.
[00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:32.754]  I want them silenced.
[00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:33.475]  I want them muted.
[00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:35.475]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:36.976]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:43.278]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:50.279]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:54.320]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.301]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:11.216]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other InfoWars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.819]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.521]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:18.545]  Facebook, are you gonna do something about the liberals who call me the N-word?
[00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:19.665]  No!
[00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:23.487]  Because Big Tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:24.867]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:28.129]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.830]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.
[00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.211]  And a brief video by InfoWars Billy Weaver.
[00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:37.333]  Social media's hall monitor, Frank Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.494]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:50.497]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency, I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:53.237]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:55.838]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:56.918]  I want them shut down.
[00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:57.879]  I want them silenced.
[00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:58.699]  I want them muted.
[00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:00.660]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.020]  I want them shut down.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.580]  I want them silenced.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.561]  I want them muted.
[00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.101]  Don't worry.
[00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.802]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.183]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:19.664]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:21.324]  It's Friday, May 10th, 2019.
[00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:23.365]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:24.806]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.568]  Then Owens Royer, obviously, with The War Room.
[00:02:27.568 --> 00:02:34.671]  Every morning before I go live, we have David Knight with The David Knight Show, the fabulous job he is doing as well.
[00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:41.715]  Yesterday, I said that I would cover this lengthy New York Times 24-page article written by the co-founder of Micro...
[00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:45.411]  Microsoft of Facebook.
[00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:55.701]  I never got to it because I wanted to reread it again last night before I gave you my informed take on it.
[00:02:55.701 --> 00:03:03.088]  Because this really signals what the establishment is planning to do, not just with Facebook, but with the rest of big tech.
[00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:06.894]  And the monopoly that's been set up over speech.
[00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:08.395]  And I can tell you it's not going to be good.
[00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:11.817]  It's going to be worse than it's already been.
[00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:19.822]  But they're going to sell their so-called solution to the problem as if it is pro-free speech.
[00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:21.843]  So I will get into that today.
[00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:24.645]  We have cleared the decks to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.901]  We have a ton of just over-the-top incredible news to break down.
[00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:48.385]  We have the hysteria over the National Baseball League, and the Cubs, and somebody making an OK sign, and the person being banned for life from the stadium, and that clip where Millie Weaver
[00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:49.935]  Yes.
[00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.652]  So see, you shouldn't take somebody off the air because they're racist, period, because then they'll take everybody else's speech.
[00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:21.597]  And now we're learning that where they just define everything as racist as the free speech collapses around us.
[00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:29.663]  Microsoft is coming out with its new Word program that watches you in real time, reports back on what you're typing, and won't let you type certain things.
[00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:34.877]  New app encourages Americans to report offensive speech.
[00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.277]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:37.757]  It's all happening.
[00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:39.397]  The Communist Chinese social score.
[00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:45.078]  It's not just coming to America, but it's coming to the entire planet.
[00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:48.059]  Again, we'll be right back on the other side of this broadcast.
[00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:52.600]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are our auxiliary sites.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.720]  They're just as important as InfoWars.com.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.420]  There's more and more.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.341]  It's being blacklisted everywhere, as you know.
[00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.381]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:58.941]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:13.967]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:25.015]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:28.251]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.922]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:36.617]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:40.879]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.140]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.462]  This country is in a war!
[00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:56.167]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:59.749]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:07.576]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.471]  Make no mistake.
[00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:38.454]  Humanity is openly losing its soul in front of us.
[00:06:38.454 --> 00:06:43.957]  Most of the public behave and look like literal zombies now.
[00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:47.579]  Basic freedoms are seen as the enemy now.
[00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:51.201]  And Communist China is now the model of the planet.
[00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.543]  Coca-Cola is coming out to celebrate Ramadan with a crescent moon.
[00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:04.541]  But of course they would never put a cross on the Coca-Cola's for Christmas or for Easter.
[00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:09.782]  And big tech is removing any mention of Christian holidays from their calendars.
[00:07:09.782 --> 00:07:20.443]  Just thought I'd add that right up front for everybody to just break down the fact that the establishment is hopelessly anti-Christian in all of their operations.
[00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:23.104]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:27.510]  My voice sounds particularly deep.
[00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.151]  Something's going on.
[00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:31.812]  I didn't have allergies till I was about 20.
[00:07:31.812 --> 00:07:36.114]  And they progressively gotten worse over the years.
[00:07:36.114 --> 00:07:39.455]  I don't hardly ever get the flu or get a fever, maybe once every three, four years.
[00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:40.796]  I'm very healthy.
[00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:50.260]  But almost everyone I know for five months in Austin has had incredible allergies and gets incredibly sick from them.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.380]  And
[00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.470]  I literally couldn't get out of bed this morning.
[00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.871]  It was so bad.
[00:07:57.871 --> 00:08:04.854]  My headache was so intense and my wife came in and she said, you know, I take the pollen block that you guys sell.
[00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:05.754]  Why don't you take it?
[00:08:05.754 --> 00:08:08.595]  I'm like, oh, of course, bring me some.
[00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:15.899]  30 minutes later, 70% of the dizziness, the pounding sinus was gone.
[00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:20.061]  My sinuses opened up and like a faucet,
[00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:25.852]  My nose started running, relieving all that incredible pressure that I could not get out with a handkerchief.
[00:08:25.852 --> 00:08:30.784]  But you know how it is, if you're a guy especially, I just don't even think about my own advice.
[00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.453]  I never even think about things that I'm saying myself.
[00:08:34.453 --> 00:08:36.915]  So I didn't mean to open the broadcast up with a plug right at the front.
[00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:40.257]  I really never do that for what funds our operation.
[00:08:40.257 --> 00:08:42.018]  But we do have that one-minute ad pulled in, don't we?
[00:08:42.018 --> 00:08:52.005]  So I'm going to play that here in just a moment since we're mentioning that for Pollen Block that you hear running on the radio because it really is amazing.
[00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:59.691]  It's quail eggs from France that they learned that the quail that ate a certain diet in the wild forest and woods
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:13.293]  If you ate those eggs, then you would have a massive reduction in histamines.
[00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:21.262]  So, again, that's what is so exciting about the different systems that God's basically given us, that God's designed.
[00:09:21.262 --> 00:09:22.103]  And Pollen Block has 70
[00:09:24.892 --> 00:09:25.592]  Plus Reviews.
[00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.291]  Scientists aren't even sure how it works.
[00:09:46.291 --> 00:10:01.142]  But for me, it works better than Claritin D or Zyrtec D, which works pretty well when I have allergies, except it makes me feel like I'm speeding and I've had 10 cups of coffee and I'm a big jerk when I take it.
[00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:05.965]  So I don't take Zyrtec D. I don't take Claritin D. And I was getting ready to take one.
[00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:10.831]  And my wife's like, I'm gonna go get some Zyrtec-D, Claritin-D, dig it out, do you have it?
[00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:12.233]  She goes, look, honey, we don't take those.
[00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.536]  That's when we get in fights is when we both take those.
[00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:16.578]  Only time we fight is when we take those together.
[00:10:16.578 --> 00:10:17.419]  She has allergies too.
[00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:19.382]  That's the only time we ever have arguments.
[00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:20.523]  We're like, oh, why are we arguing?
[00:10:20.523 --> 00:10:22.345]  Oh, we took Zyrtec-D or Claritin-D.
[00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:23.867]  She's like, here, take this.
[00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:35.906]  And so I took the Pollen Block, 35 minutes later, starts draining, pressure goes away, and now about 90% better than I was three, four hours ago.
[00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:39.927]  I was gonna call and cancel coming in, something I never do for sickness.
[00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:47.169]  But again, it was all because I thought to take the Pollen Block, also did the Neti Pot with the distilled water.
[00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:51.050]  You call it the Neti Pot, I use the modern ones, they're little squishy, squishy deals.
[00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.711]  But that's all a side issue.
[00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:53.631]  The point is, Pollen Block,
[00:10:54.983 --> 00:11:00.645]  Is available at infowarestore.com or by calling toll free 253-3139.
[00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:01.185]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:05.666]  And here is the one minute ad that basically breaks it down.
[00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:15.455]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:17.256]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:29.485]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:38.352]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:11:38.812 --> 00:11:44.856]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:50.019]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.681]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.422]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:11:54.422 --> 00:12:04.128]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:12:04.128 --> 00:12:06.250]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:21.854]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:12:21.854 --> 00:12:23.574]  Man, I tell ya.
[00:12:23.574 --> 00:12:27.015]  What a world, what a world, what a world.
[00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:32.977]  Out here on this planet, what do you think's gonna happen to all of us as the soul fades from humanity right in front of us?
[00:12:32.977 --> 00:12:34.357]  It's gonna be rough.
[00:12:36.252 --> 00:12:40.897]  Gonna be rough, gonna be tough, gonna be hard.
[00:12:40.897 --> 00:12:43.079]  Just the way it is, though.
[00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:48.685]  Just the way it is.
[00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.368]  All right.
[00:12:51.368 --> 00:12:56.173]  Well, that's a good start to the broadcast today.
[00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:07.388]  We have got an incredible amount of news information to go over here to say it lightly.
[00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:11.131]  And I'm going to do my very best job to cover it all today for you.
[00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:14.194]  Let's do it.
[00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:25.884]  We have old Hillary Clinton stomping around on the campaign trail, attacking the First Amendment, attacking hers truly, attacking
[00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:51.836]  Reality and we've caught her in some new spectacular Foot-in-the-mouth moments, so that's coming up as I mentioned you've got this cub situation with the okay sign We're gonna be going over all of that coming up And just how the system is moving on to attacking other words and
[00:13:52.930 --> 00:14:19.770]  Now the system is moving on to attacking language itself and how that's really the plan to complete the destruction of humanity's cognitive communication skills and the conversion of the universities into systems of higher learning and education and free thought to systems of destruction of words, which was the Thabian socialist model in England and has been the model and is now being deployed
[00:14:21.044 --> 00:14:21.204]  I think?
[00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:45.620]  And then once they give you all these false memories through the TVs and the smartphones, you can't differentiate real memories from false memories.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:57.170]  And then they're able to start programming the subconscious to flip switches to make you turn your life force off, your will to live, your will to survive, and your focus.
[00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:06.358]  And so the average person out there is in a hypnotic state and is being maneuvered into a neurological collapse.
[00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:12.726]  We are the most drugged, most dumbed down population in world history.
[00:15:12.726 --> 00:15:15.588]  The United States leads the pack worldwide of that.
[00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:16.749]  We are entertained to death.
[00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:17.630]  We live in fantasy land.
[00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.593]  And I don't say all of this to be negative.
[00:15:20.593 --> 00:15:29.461]  I say it so that we can recognize what's going on, recognize what's happening, and hopefully turn around and fix it in some capacity.
[00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:32.004]  So I'm going to officially start the show when we come back.
[00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:35.653]  I'm going to not see the last 15 minutes as the broadcast.
[00:15:35.653 --> 00:15:41.039]  And when we come back, I'm going to start the broadcast.
[00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:47.205]  And I'm going to do the best job I can to lay out what we're dealing with and how we turn the tide against this.
[00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:50.589]  And I'll also get all the phones up throughout the show today.
[00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:51.870]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:52.111]  Thank you.
[00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:01.172]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:01.172 --> 00:16:04.393]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:04.393 --> 00:16:05.994]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:05.994 --> 00:16:08.834]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:09.494]  Awesome.
[00:16:09.494 --> 00:16:12.575]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:14.136]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:14.756]  Bacon.
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:18.917]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:20.357]  Or warm and serve.
[00:16:20.357 --> 00:16:22.397]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:24.338]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:33.080]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[00:17:03.473 --> 00:17:05.555]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.296]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:07.296 --> 00:17:13.841]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:18.924]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:23.628]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,

[00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:03.828]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:05.589]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:17.659]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:22.663]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.123 --> 00:18:23.603]  Let's do it!
[00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.220]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:52.209]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:54.872]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.872 --> 00:18:59.577]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.305]  Clarity.
[00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:07.246]  Energy.
[00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:12.713]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[00:19:12.713 --> 00:19:14.876]  Right now, it's massively discounted.

[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.221]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:28.902]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[00:20:03.264 --> 00:20:06.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.887]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:20:26.887 --> 00:20:29.209]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:29.209 --> 00:20:32.672]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:32.672 --> 00:20:36.056]  Sooner or later gotta put you down.
[00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:38.078]  China did not have running water.
[00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:41.100]  You know, we're 90% of the nation just 40, 50 years ago.
[00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:51.725]  But now they have more industry, more technology, more science than we do.
[00:20:51.725 --> 00:21:04.309]  Because our government was against our country via the Council on Foreign Relations board and set up systems to make the new century the Chinese century.
[00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:10.192]  And we're in that new century, 19 years into it, and Trump is not playing ball with them so far.
[00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:15.117]  So the big trade war has kicked into high gear.
[00:21:15.117 --> 00:21:18.458]  China vows to retaliate after U.S.
[00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:19.618]  hikes tariffs.
[00:21:19.618 --> 00:21:24.580]  We're going to be talking more about this coming up later in the hour.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:31.443]  Also, Ann Coulter says the surge of illegals under Trump is worse than any year under Obama.
[00:21:31.443 --> 00:21:33.764]  She says that's 3-D chess, baby.
[00:21:35.387 --> 00:21:41.408]  Well, yeah, the Democrats under Obama started breaking the border and telling folks, come on up here to overwhelm the system.
[00:21:41.408 --> 00:21:44.649]  So the courts and the detention centers would collapse.
[00:21:44.649 --> 00:21:46.269]  And then now we're in the middle of the U.N.
[00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:49.330]  invasion, just like Europe has been under for 10 years.
[00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.831]  And then she blames Trump that Congress and the people haven't acted properly.
[00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:56.271]  The president's been trying to get the legislation.
[00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:57.172]  He tried to get $12 billion.
[00:21:57.172 --> 00:21:59.272]  He got $1,300,000,000 to deal with extra border security.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:12.064]  Now he should declare a real emergency, not just the police emergency he declared, but a full Emergencies Commander-in-Chief.
[00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.325]  He could do that.
[00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:15.606]  He hasn't.
[00:22:15.606 --> 00:22:20.728]  But for Ian Coulter to continue to say that it's Trump doing it is not fair.
[00:22:20.728 --> 00:22:21.729]  I get it though.
[00:22:21.729 --> 00:22:24.530]  You put pressure on Trump, he acts.
[00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.812]  And so I guess at the end of the day, he hasn't declared the true emergency.
[00:22:27.812 --> 00:22:28.672]  This is an emergency.
[00:22:28.672 --> 00:22:30.633]  Diseases are pouring in, you name it.
[00:22:30.633 --> 00:22:32.254]  So I guess, in a way, she is right.
[00:22:33.544 --> 00:22:47.849]  Those are some of the topics I want to discuss with listeners here today, and we're going to have open phones in the second and in the third hour of the broadcast today.
[00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:52.891]  In fact, I'll probably start getting your calls in the last segment of this hour.
[00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:54.651]  So the toll-free number to join us on air is 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:07.738]  And again, first-time callers, or callers that have called in but been on hold, haven't gotten on air, that counts you as a first-time caller, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:23:07.738 --> 00:23:16.743]  We've been having some really great callers as of late, and so the first 20 calls or so that get in are first-time callers.
[00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:18.304]  After that, other folks are welcome.
[00:23:18.304 --> 00:23:21.827]  We'd love to hear from you, but I don't want to make you sit on hold.
[00:23:21.827 --> 00:23:25.049]  You know, I've been getting better about taking 20 calls when I take calls.
[00:23:26.024 --> 00:23:26.824]  So maybe 10 calls.
[00:23:56.073 --> 00:23:59.656]  Does the best job breaking it all down.
[00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:01.858]  But Comey really has a lot of nerve.
[00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:06.762]  Former FBI director, disgraced, lied to Congress, perjured himself, a big leaker.
[00:24:06.762 --> 00:24:10.866]  He has a lot to show.
[00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:13.729]  He's in a serious crisis.
[00:24:13.729 --> 00:24:20.254]  Instead, he just doubles down and says that Trump could be indicted once he leaves office.
[00:24:20.254 --> 00:24:20.835]  Here's the report.
[00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:30.815]  On Thursday, CNN held one of their famous town hall events to commemorate the two-year anniversary of President Trump firing James Comey.
[00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:36.785]  Welcome back to our 360 town hall with former FCI director James Comey.
[00:24:36.785 --> 00:24:43.052]  He's also the author of a book, Higher Loyalty, which is now out in paperback with a whole brand new floor.
[00:24:43.052 --> 00:24:45.015]  We've been getting questions from our audience.
[00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:46.476]  We'll go back to the audience in just a second.
[00:24:46.476 --> 00:24:48.999]  I want to ask you... Oh Jim, you poor thing!
[00:24:48.999 --> 00:24:51.782]  It's been two years to the day since Donald Trump fired you!
[00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:53.144]  Are you doing okay?
[00:24:53.584 --> 00:24:56.166]  I was numb because I didn't expect to be fired.
[00:24:56.166 --> 00:25:03.532]  I was actually in a room about this size talking to custodial staff employees about the importance of the FBI's mission.
[00:25:03.532 --> 00:25:08.456]  So it still feels a little bit numbing, frankly, and like it happened yesterday.
[00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:16.919]  Oh, you poor guy, how are you going to survive with your full government pension of six figures for the rest of your life and the millions of dollars you made off of your dumb book?
[00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:27.562]  Since the Democrat Party is a complete joke, it makes perfect sense that a parody website of Joe Biden's 2020 campaign is ranked higher on Google than his official campaign website.
[00:25:27.782 --> 00:25:39.289]  CNBC reports that the parody website with embarrassing photos of Joe, him sniffing women's hair, is outranking his official campaign page on Google.
[00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:43.872]  I'm sure that Google will change this soon, but right now if you just type in Joe Biden into the search...
[00:25:44.392 --> 00:25:53.079]  The top search results are his Wikipedia page, his Twitter account, his Facebook page, CNBC, some other pages.
[00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:57.082]  And then right there, Joe Biden for President 2020.
[00:25:57.082 --> 00:26:02.365]  Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America's problems.
[00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:13.612]  At the bottom of the page, Google often includes a little box of similar searches and take a look at what the similar searches are to Joe Biden.
[00:26:13.612 --> 00:26:16.934]  It says people also ask, has Joe Biden ever run for president?
[00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:19.036]  That's the number one connected result.
[00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:21.197]  Did Joe Biden die?
[00:26:21.197 --> 00:26:22.098]  It's number two.
[00:26:22.478 --> 00:26:29.184]  Many Democrats are thrilled that Joe Biden has decided to re-enter the presidential race, and he's number one in all of the polls.
[00:26:29.184 --> 00:26:32.326]  But not all of them are happy about it.
[00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:38.251]  It's something to see all three, the top of the polls being led by three white men, though.
[00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:38.992]  I have to say.
[00:26:42.033 --> 00:27:03.119]  You know, I am concerned that as someone who worked for a woman candidate last time that there's something that about the sort of biases we still hold about leadership and what that looks like that makes us gravitate towards towards men and even white men and there's something about
[00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:12.223]  Somebody should tell the Democrats that the core of Martin Luther King's message was to not judge people based on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character.
[00:27:12.223 --> 00:27:14.764]  That means even if they're white, you lunatics!
[00:27:14.764 --> 00:27:18.366]  In other news, Elizabeth Warren's campaign is not doing so well.
[00:27:18.366 --> 00:27:22.688]  In fact, she's polling in third place in her own state!
[00:27:22.688 --> 00:27:29.211]  And that's why she's taking desperate measures, like offering the kids free college and just canceling all of their student loans.
[00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:34.093]  Oh, here she is doing another live stream from her kitchen, trying to connect with the young voters.
[00:27:34.093 --> 00:27:39.336]  Hey kids, I'll get to your questions here in just a second.
[00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:41.117]  Yep, almost done.
[00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:42.097]  Cool.
[00:27:42.097 --> 00:27:43.838]  Yep, just one more.
[00:27:43.838 --> 00:27:45.319]  Just hold on one second here.
[00:27:45.319 --> 00:27:49.681]  By the way, this is satire.
[00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:53.082]  Almost, almost ready for you.
[00:27:53.082 --> 00:27:56.184]  We need to fact check this to see if this is real.
[00:28:02.742 --> 00:28:04.563]  Okay, what's your questions?
[00:28:04.563 --> 00:28:11.147]  Meanwhile, Cory Booker is polling even lower than Elizabeth Warren at just 3%, and I can't imagine why.
[00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:28.036]  What do you say to somebody who says, yeah, I'm not crazy about Trump, but the economy has done so much better, and Republicans keep telling me the Democratic nominee is going to raise my taxes, and he is talking about raising taxes, so that might hurt the economy, that might hurt my bottom line.
[00:28:28.036 --> 00:28:29.237]  What's the counter-argument to that?
[00:28:29.397 --> 00:28:33.580]  Look, I think that we live in a nation with far more patriotism than people are expressing.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.681]  What I mean by that is, folks want the best for their country.
[00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:41.484]  Democrats won't mind paying more taxes because they're patriotic, he says.
[00:28:41.484 --> 00:28:43.225]  No, they're just stupid.
[00:28:43.225 --> 00:28:43.846]  Oh, look at this!

[00:33:16.673 --> 00:33:20.795]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:33:20.795 --> 00:33:24.997]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:24.997 --> 00:33:27.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.278 --> 00:33:32.080]  Thank you for joining us on this live Global Friday Transmission.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.121]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:43.325]  So let's lay out the facts of political correctness, of microaggressions that colleges and corporations are teaching their employees to recognize.
[00:33:44.365 --> 00:33:54.091]  You see, when you don't have a bunch of KKK running around or real people saying the N-word, you've got to have folks like Jesse Smollett go out and stage it.
[00:33:54.091 --> 00:34:11.720]  And when they get caught, well, you've got to go ahead and cover up for him, because actually he's a hero who is out there turning everybody into victims and continuing the racial division that Hillary Clinton talks about in WikiLeaks, how it needs to be intensified so she can control all these, quote, dumb baristas.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.261]  These are quotes.
[00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:19.963]  So she's in these professor talks with professors in email about how do we control the dumb baristas?
[00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:21.743]  How do we control the dumb blacks?
[00:34:21.743 --> 00:34:24.404]  How do we keep these predators under our control?
[00:34:24.404 --> 00:34:28.185]  And they say, you've got to intensify culture war.
[00:34:28.185 --> 00:34:29.005]  Men against women.
[00:34:29.005 --> 00:34:30.646]  Women against men.
[00:34:30.646 --> 00:34:31.866]  Gay against straight.
[00:34:31.866 --> 00:34:32.646]  Black against white.
[00:34:32.646 --> 00:34:34.427]  Hispanic against black.
[00:34:34.427 --> 00:34:34.967]  On and on and on.
[00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:39.583]  And so you've got to create what you call dog whistles.
[00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:45.027]  If I don't want the IMF and World Bank running my life, I don't want the TPP unelected running my life.
[00:34:45.027 --> 00:34:53.693]  If I don't want all these big multinational agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that was set up a decade before by Hillary.
[00:34:53.693 --> 00:34:55.394]  She brags that she helped write much of it.
[00:34:55.394 --> 00:35:05.161]  If I don't want to be ruled by multinational secretive boards based in Singapore, why, that's dog whistle for anti-Semitism.
[00:35:07.284 --> 00:35:14.387]  Nigel Farage comes on the show routinely, founder of UKIP, now the head of the Brexit party that's sweeping Europe.
[00:35:14.387 --> 00:35:17.388]  They've got London Guardian articles, Associated Press articles.
[00:35:17.388 --> 00:35:21.970]  Is he a white supremacist for coming on the white supremacist show, Alex Jones?
[00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.512]  Lies within lies within lies.
[00:35:26.512 --> 00:35:28.712]  And so you say, well, we'll just laugh at this.
[00:35:28.712 --> 00:35:31.433]  No, they'll take your bank account.
[00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:35.175]  They'll ban you from the baseball field for life.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:42.079]  They will oppress you.
[00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:58.384]  So when they give you the false definition, they then, as tyrants, use that to then oppress and control you.
[00:35:58.384 --> 00:35:59.384]  Now, obviously, you know that.
[00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.648]  But they're going to have to be sued.
[00:36:02.648 --> 00:36:09.678]  They're going to have to be criminally charged because this is an organized racketeering operation by Hope Not Hate in the UK.
[00:36:09.678 --> 00:36:11.681]  That's the Southern Poverty Law Center group over there.
[00:36:11.681 --> 00:36:15.005]  The SPLC here and others.
[00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:34.337]  Where they are organizing and manipulating and knowingly lying about people to then create a banking and travel designation in the national security apparatus to literally deny you the ability to travel and live your life.
[00:36:34.337 --> 00:36:35.957]  Think about that.
[00:36:35.957 --> 00:36:36.918]  And that's in the news today.
[00:36:38.732 --> 00:36:40.873]  Kamala Harris was in Detroit two days ago.
[00:36:40.873 --> 00:36:44.394]  She said, right-wingism is racist.
[00:36:44.394 --> 00:36:45.534]  They need to be banned.
[00:36:45.534 --> 00:36:47.755]  They need to be arrested.
[00:36:47.755 --> 00:37:01.159]  And so you go to the universities and you see almost every person you talk to, black, white, old, young, male, female, saying, you don't deserve speech because you're a conservative or you support Trump.
[00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:04.560]  And they have hate in their eyes and they're glaring at you.
[00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:25.569]  But even the few that were for restricting free speech that were friendly in their demeanor still said outrageous things like, well, we have to report things we see online or on the campus or in general life if it's hurtful to somebody or if it's a dog whistle.
[00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:28.892]  Now that's how you make selectively everything on earth
[00:37:32.975 --> 00:37:34.856]  Selectively bannable.
[00:37:34.856 --> 00:37:41.739]  And you say the OK sign that everybody associates with, do you have enough oxygen in your tanks when you're diving?
[00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:43.160]  Yes.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.061]  Or SWAT teams, everything good?
[00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:45.381]  Yes.
[00:37:45.381 --> 00:37:48.463]  It's the international OK symbol.
[00:37:48.463 --> 00:37:55.186]  Chefs for a hundred years in France and Italy can see it on the cans of some tomato sauce.
[00:37:55.186 --> 00:38:00.889]  The chef will be going with the OK to their lips, which really means fabulous, delicioso.
[00:38:02.365 --> 00:38:06.628]  So these are normal human handsights.
[00:38:06.628 --> 00:38:08.168]  Okay?
[00:38:08.168 --> 00:38:22.917]  They take it, Hillary comes out and calls it white supremacists, and then everyone makes a joke out of it on 4chan, and then suddenly all the followers that buy into all this really believe they've seen this.
[00:38:22.917 --> 00:38:27.760]  Then jokers start getting involved in it, and we're off to the races.
[00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:36.929]  So here's the headline, Total BS MLB Team Bans Fan For Life After Flashing White Power Hand Sign.
[00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:39.949]  And on the news, they even blurred it out.
[00:38:39.949 --> 00:38:42.950]  Now this all broke a few days ago.
[00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.830]  What's interesting now is it's reached a total hysteria.
[00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:51.612]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can show you a hundred photos of Obama doing the okay sign.
[00:38:51.612 --> 00:38:58.193]  I can show you any politician or anybody in business or anybody in life doing the okay sign.
[00:38:59.747 --> 00:39:02.449]  It means, okay, it means we're going to take care of it.
[00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:04.531]  It means things are going well.
[00:39:04.531 --> 00:39:13.619]  But even if the guy meant it as a white supremacist symbol, do we all get hysterical and now let every symbol out there be adopted and taken away from us?
[00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:16.821]  Is this what America's turned into?
[00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:27.931]  So here is a clip where two days ago at Kent State, you have a black student who's just said he wants Caitlyn to lose her speech.
[00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:35.096]  Saying, because it's a dog whistle, a secret code.
[00:39:35.096 --> 00:39:39.799]  And then see, they can then project onto that, oh, you meant bad by this, Ernest.
[00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:43.742]  It is like, you know, that's pretty much, that's hate speech.
[00:39:43.742 --> 00:39:44.863]  What is hate speech?
[00:39:44.863 --> 00:39:56.210]  Hate speech is defined as like stuff like, you know, making like subtle dog whistles and like, you know, remarks that on the surface aren't seen as hateful, but really are.
[00:39:58.382 --> 00:40:01.843]  Like if you walk into a room and say, hey you guys, dinner's ready.
[00:40:01.843 --> 00:40:05.203]  I'm not a guy, I'm a woman.
[00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:09.384]  That's taught at universities as hate, so you get to get upset about it.
[00:40:09.384 --> 00:40:18.186]  Now here's a 7up ad from the 70s, where you got a black guy talking about how great 7up is and making the OK sign.
[00:40:18.186 --> 00:40:20.266]  Because this means it's good.
[00:40:20.266 --> 00:40:21.787]  Like thumbs up.
[00:40:21.787 --> 00:40:22.107]  Here it is.
[00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:29.091]  There's something very special about the taste of 7-Up that's unlike any other soft drink.
[00:40:29.091 --> 00:40:33.875]  Maybe because 7-Up has no artificial flavor and no artificial color.
[00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:35.956]  Never had it, never will.
[00:40:35.956 --> 00:40:37.818]  And no caffeine.
[00:40:37.818 --> 00:40:39.739]  Never had it, never will.
[00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:46.064]  Whatever it is that makes 7-Up so refreshingly different that other soft drinks never had it.
[00:40:46.064 --> 00:40:47.125]  Ha ha ha.
[00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:47.606]  Never will.
[00:40:49.207 --> 00:40:52.249]  So, he's being authoritarian in a good way.
[00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:53.550]  He's being authoritative.
[00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:57.853]  He's saying, with his index finger, does not have any bad stuff in it.
[00:40:57.853 --> 00:40:59.514]  He's saying, never had it, never will.
[00:40:59.514 --> 00:41:02.316]  He's saying it's really good making the OK sign.
[00:41:02.316 --> 00:41:04.177]  That's called Communication 101.
[00:41:04.177 --> 00:41:07.800]  I just was authoritative, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.803]  Now let's go to the hysteria over Cubs and somebody making the OK sign.
[00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:12.063]  Here it is.
[00:41:13.353 --> 00:41:17.994]  Last night the Cubs had a big win over Miami to put them in first place in the NL Central.
[00:41:17.994 --> 00:41:21.435]  But now the Cubs are apologizing for something that happened in the stands.
[00:41:21.435 --> 00:41:24.396]  CBS 2's Audrina Biggis is live outside Wrigley Field.
[00:41:24.396 --> 00:41:30.078]  Audrina, apparently a fan made an offensive gesture of some type?
[00:41:30.078 --> 00:41:30.478]  They did.
[00:41:30.478 --> 00:41:31.658]  Good morning Mike and Aaron.
[00:41:31.658 --> 00:41:34.739]  The Cubs are taking this very seriously.
[00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:38.300]  They're calling this gesture ignorant and repulsive.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.921]  Now here is what they're talking about.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.522]  She was just making the symbol herself.
[00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:44.763]  Does he do it?
[00:41:44.763 --> 00:41:47.946]  Oh my gosh, continue.
[00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:50.048]  Doug Glanville was giving an update.
[00:41:50.048 --> 00:41:55.993]  Now the fan behind him made the gesture that we've blurred out because it's just not appropriate and really offensive.
[00:41:55.993 --> 00:41:58.916]  It's a hand symbol often used by white supremacists.
[00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:01.238]  The Cubs say they are investigating this.
[00:42:02.788 --> 00:42:10.272]  We're actively trying to find out the circumstances of how this person got into those seats and who they are, and that's important.
[00:42:10.272 --> 00:42:18.397]  As we suggested in our statement last night, this type of behavior is reprehensible, it's ignorant, and it's not welcome at our ballpark.
[00:42:20.868 --> 00:42:31.418]  This morning the Cubs are also saying that any fan or really anyone in the ballpark who does something like this will not only be removed, but they'll be permanently banned from Wrigley Field.
[00:42:31.418 --> 00:42:35.722]  And by the way, they hunted this guy down, he's been banned for life.
[00:42:35.722 --> 00:42:36.523]  So you see how that works?
[00:42:36.523 --> 00:42:38.625]  It's just Jesse Smollett, the city of Smollett.
[00:42:39.775 --> 00:42:40.775]  They just made this up.
[00:42:40.775 --> 00:42:41.816]  They just found somebody.
[00:42:41.816 --> 00:42:42.896]  People are flipping each other off.
[00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:43.716]  They're cussing.
[00:42:43.716 --> 00:42:44.057]  Who cares?
[00:42:44.057 --> 00:42:45.277]  Somebody makes the sign.
[00:42:45.277 --> 00:42:47.038]  They obsess over it in a big pity party.
[00:42:47.038 --> 00:42:47.858]  Ban him.
[00:42:47.858 --> 00:42:49.859]  It's another Jussie Smollett hoax.
[00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:53.180]  This time brought to you by the Cubs and these local TV stations.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.561]  What a bunch of despicable race-baiting scum.
[00:42:59.187 --> 00:43:04.389]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:12.952]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:43:12.952 --> 00:43:15.933]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:43:15.933 --> 00:43:17.673]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:43:17.673 --> 00:43:23.955]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:31.378]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:43:31.378 --> 00:43:34.320]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.201]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:42.243]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:43:42.243 --> 00:43:44.064]  I've got two in my home.
[00:43:44.064 --> 00:43:50.166]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:51.007]  Don't live
[00:43:51.827 --> 00:43:55.530]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.151]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:59.508 --> 00:44:04.352]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.352 --> 00:44:13.279]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.279 --> 00:44:18.623]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:45:00.495 --> 00:45:11.079]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:13.139]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:13.139 --> 00:45:16.020]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.501]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:20.642]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.882 --> 00:45:24.325]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.325 --> 00:45:26.406]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.406 --> 00:45:36.113]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:36.113 --> 00:45:48.682]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:45:48.902 --> 00:45:49.303]  We're good to go.
[00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:04.046]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:46:04.046 --> 00:46:07.247]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.

[00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:33.315]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:36.197]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[00:46:36.197 --> 00:46:39.239]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:46:39.239 --> 00:46:40.000]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.740]  Well, you know what?
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.061]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:43.982]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:46:43.982 --> 00:46:44.983]  We decided to change the name.
[00:46:44.983 --> 00:46:46.204]  So when you peel off the label...
[00:46:47.436 --> 00:46:51.139]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:53.940]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.842]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.
[00:46:55.842 --> 00:47:03.267]  Infowarsstore.com, now back in stock after four months sold out.
[00:47:03.267 --> 00:47:05.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.446 --> 00:47:37.367]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:37.367 --> 00:47:39.008]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:39.008 --> 00:47:40.709]  We've got a loaded phone line.
[00:47:40.709 --> 00:47:43.630]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.011]  At the start of the next hour,
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:57.529]  Next segment, we've got some incredible new footage of Hillary yesterday, and outrageously un-self-aware statements by her.
[00:47:57.529 --> 00:48:00.752]  That's next segment, and we've got her dead to rights.
[00:48:00.752 --> 00:48:04.735]  She says, they lie about me and say that I've killed people.
[00:48:04.735 --> 00:48:08.058]  Well, you've not only killed people, lady, you've bragged about it.
[00:48:08.058 --> 00:48:10.240]  But first, let me just finish up what I was covering earlier.
[00:48:11.616 --> 00:48:28.186]  Barack Obama has been caught flashing a white supremacist hand sign hundreds of times, and he needs to be banned immediately from any Cubs games in Chicago, which he's reported to go to.
[00:48:28.186 --> 00:48:36.130]  That's right, you've heard that the man a few days ago that flashed the OK sign, that is the international symbol of OK, in hand signing?
[00:48:39.077 --> 00:48:46.321]  4chan did a joke a few years ago to troll Hillary and said it was a white supremacist symbol when Trump was doing it.
[00:48:46.321 --> 00:48:59.207]  And it's a known sales tactic to say everything's premium, everything's A-OK, everything's complete, dinner's ready, there's plenty of oxygen in our tanks, the car's gassed up.
[00:48:59.207 --> 00:49:02.488]  It's Einstein meaning everything's OK, we're done.
[00:49:02.488 --> 00:49:07.671]  If you place it to your mouth and go, that means in French, it's delicious, it's good.
[00:49:08.769 --> 00:49:13.872]  So you're a chef way across the kitchen, and is the sauce ready?
[00:49:13.872 --> 00:49:14.252]  It's done.
[00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:15.353]  It's done.
[00:49:15.353 --> 00:49:20.256]  But all of that turns into something evil and something bad.
[00:49:20.256 --> 00:49:22.097]  And this is mass mental illness.
[00:49:22.097 --> 00:49:23.858]  I see it all over the internet, though.
[00:49:23.858 --> 00:49:31.703]  Not just that it's racist if you do it, but that it's the 666 sign.
[00:49:31.703 --> 00:49:35.405]  My whole life, I've used the OK sign because
[00:49:37.017 --> 00:49:37.997]  I saw people use it.
[00:49:37.997 --> 00:49:38.998]  Yeah, we're done.
[00:49:38.998 --> 00:49:40.218]  Hey, come on out of the house.
[00:49:40.218 --> 00:49:43.499]  You know, we're ready to go.
[00:49:43.499 --> 00:49:44.920]  How's the food taste?
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.260]  Mmm, it's great.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:53.383]  But it's projected by Schizophrenics Online that when I do this, it's a 666 sign, whatever that means.
[00:49:53.383 --> 00:49:57.784]  I guess you'd say three fingers and then the zero means a six.
[00:49:57.784 --> 00:50:00.605]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:02.126]  That's insane.
[00:50:02.126 --> 00:50:05.747]  You could argue that stars on the flag are pentagrams.
[00:50:06.815 --> 00:50:09.737]  It's intention that God looks at.
[00:50:09.737 --> 00:50:12.639]  The occult has taken on every symbol and made it their own.
[00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:15.440]  And that's really what the globalists are doing.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.802]  You know, we're putting out a new shirt based on a NASA design.
[00:50:18.802 --> 00:50:21.844]  I believe in pro-human space exploration.
[00:50:21.844 --> 00:50:23.846]  It's our own design, but similar to NASA's.
[00:50:23.846 --> 00:50:33.992]  And it's got a red, white and blue and yellow rainbow on it.
[00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:34.112]  And
[00:50:36.511 --> 00:50:39.273]  Some people asked me, they said, why are you wearing a shirt with a rainbow?
[00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:45.397]  Well, A, it's not a classic My Little Pony rainbow, where it's got all the colors.
[00:50:45.397 --> 00:50:48.640]  It's NASA, meaning the colors of the atmosphere.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.604]  Meaning that the space shuttle's going out of the atmosphere and the atmosphere actually has tinted colors to it as you go through it.
[00:50:54.604 --> 00:50:55.745]  That's what it means.
[00:50:55.745 --> 00:51:03.871]  But see, I'm not putting it out as some coded message that, you know, I'm gonna go to the bathhouse today and have sex with five dudes.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.222]  It's a NASA patch that's really cool.
[00:51:07.222 --> 00:51:08.043]  Everybody likes it.
[00:51:08.043 --> 00:51:08.744]  We've changed it.
[00:51:08.744 --> 00:51:11.727]  We're putting a shirt out that says Space Force with it.
[00:51:11.727 --> 00:51:12.808]  So it's the intent.
[00:51:12.808 --> 00:51:15.811]  You know, Washington said what the flag symbolized.
[00:51:15.811 --> 00:51:18.834]  The blue symbolizes God in the heavens.
[00:51:18.834 --> 00:51:23.179]  You will know God and his work by the work of his firmament.
[00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:24.400]  In Pope's Bible verses.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.881]  The blue is the sky.
[00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:26.662]  The blue is space.
[00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:29.106]  And God.
[00:51:29.106 --> 00:51:31.287]  The stars are the colonies.
[00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:37.650]  The red is the blood sacrificed by the people to found the nation.
[00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:42.793]  And the white is the purity, but also the bandages of war.
[00:51:42.793 --> 00:51:49.796]  That's the red, white, and blue, ladies and gentlemen, not some satanic crap.
[00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:55.519]  You know, sometimes we've had articles about humanities waking up or winning, and we'll have an image of the sun rising.
[00:51:57.526 --> 00:52:03.788]  The Bible's got lots of passages about never fear, you know, the sun's gonna rise in the morning, the light always comes back.
[00:52:03.788 --> 00:52:08.070]  But oh, the occult sometimes uses the sun rising symbol, so you better not use it.
[00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.271]  This is mental illness.
[00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:20.814]  And so I'm a very expressive person, everybody knows that, and I know our general audience gets this, but I wanted to be fair and not just bash leftists.
[00:52:20.814 --> 00:52:21.595]  I wanted to really
[00:52:22.719 --> 00:52:28.901]  Get into this and explain that letting people manipulate you through symbols is not good.
[00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:31.743]  Folks should go off of, what does someone produce?
[00:52:31.743 --> 00:52:40.846]  Christ said, judge a tree by its fruits, not by the so-called symbol.
[00:52:40.846 --> 00:52:46.768]  Now granted, an upside-down star, a bath-o-mat, is purely used by Satanists, invented by them, it's bad.
[00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:48.289]  The star is the sign of a human.
[00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:50.430]  The head, the arms, the legs.
[00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:54.877]  You invert that, it's an upside-down crucifixion of the human.
[00:52:54.877 --> 00:52:56.878]  It's an inversion.
[00:52:56.878 --> 00:53:03.582]  So there are symbols that were invented by evil, used by evil, for evil purposes.
[00:53:03.582 --> 00:53:07.063]  But almost every other symbol is subjective entirely.
[00:53:07.063 --> 00:53:10.325]  And I know our general audience knows this, but just think about this.
[00:53:10.325 --> 00:53:14.728]  We have dozens and dozens and dozens of videos.
[00:53:14.728 --> 00:53:20.291]  We've got hundreds of them, I mean probably thousands, of every Democrat under the sun doing the OK sign.
[00:53:22.915 --> 00:53:26.183]  Because people have been using this for thousands of years.
[00:53:26.183 --> 00:53:28.148]  No one's even sure exactly where it came from.
[00:53:28.148 --> 00:53:30.213]  It just means everything is good.
[00:53:30.213 --> 00:53:31.396]  Everything is handled.
[00:53:31.396 --> 00:53:32.398]  Everything is taken care of.
[00:53:36.164 --> 00:53:52.150]  And yeah, you get into, I guess, Eastern mysticism and the Hindus or something, and I guess in meditation people do that, because when you touch forefinger and thumb, it's been known that some type of electrical charge takes place, and it's a connection, it's a calming thing.
[00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:58.173]  Anybody knows, if you've done it, if you touch your forefinger and your thumb together, it's very relaxing.
[00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:02.228]  So I do it a lot because I like it.
[00:54:02.228 --> 00:54:13.874]  Not because it's 666, not because it means hail the KKK or any stupid crap like that, but because it's a universal symbol like thumbs up or any of that.
[00:54:13.874 --> 00:54:16.936]  And I know our audience understands that.
[00:54:16.936 --> 00:54:27.741]  But the fact that it's one of the top stories in the country that, oh my gosh, the panic that a white supremacist symbol got made and they are defaming this poor guy that they threw out and took away his, uh,
[00:54:29.727 --> 00:54:33.569]  Ability to go to the baseball game, he's banned, quote, for life.
[00:54:33.569 --> 00:54:40.092]  Gosh, you commit murder, you're only, you know, in jail for 20 years or whatever, but oh, you're not politically correct, you're banned from Twitter for life.
[00:54:40.092 --> 00:54:41.733]  You're banned from Facebook for life.
[00:54:41.733 --> 00:54:44.294]  You're banned from the Cubs stadium for life.
[00:54:44.294 --> 00:54:47.356]  Imagine the message they're sending.
[00:54:47.356 --> 00:54:50.197]  Imagine what they're saying.
[00:54:50.197 --> 00:54:54.279]  They're saying what you say is more important than even what you do.
[00:54:54.279 --> 00:54:55.480]  That's the opposite of what God says.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.861]  God says what you do
[00:54:58.979 --> 00:55:02.102]  is more important than what you say.
[00:55:02.102 --> 00:55:04.463]  Because what you do is the proof of the pudding.
[00:55:04.463 --> 00:55:09.047]  It's the fruit of the tree.
[00:55:09.047 --> 00:55:17.214]  So it comes down to that and it's just astounding that everyone knows that everybody basically uses the OK sign.
[00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:31.687]  The fact that they think they can sell this and have a hysteria all over the country about somebody making a sign, even if it was a bad sign, why do you give it attention?
[00:55:31.687 --> 00:55:33.027]  Why do you worship?
[00:55:33.027 --> 00:55:34.248]  Why do you empower it?
[00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:36.549]  Why do you make it a big deal?
[00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:46.394]  Because they want to make us superstitious of knowledge and symbols, and they want to turn us against each other and fight, and they create this illusion that there's this giant racism going on when I bet $1,000.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:50.962]  That that guy's probably a listener.
[00:55:50.962 --> 00:55:52.263]  He should email Showtips.
[00:55:52.263 --> 00:55:54.523]  Prove it's him.
[00:55:54.523 --> 00:55:56.824]  Most guests we get on end up being listeners.
[00:55:56.824 --> 00:56:00.665]  And I bet he did it as an act of pro-Trump, as a sign of rebellion.
[00:56:00.665 --> 00:56:12.328]  Because once Hillary said it was a white supremacist symbol, being chumped, being trolled by 4chan, as a joke, then Trump supporters started doing it as a sign of support for the president.
[00:56:14.167 --> 00:56:18.909]  Especially minority supporters of the president, because they get how ridiculous it is.
[00:56:18.909 --> 00:56:31.175]  So almost every time I'm posing for a photograph with a black or Hispanic person or family, they start flashing that and laughing because they get how ridiculous it is.
[00:56:31.175 --> 00:56:34.517]  It's ridiculous.
[00:56:34.517 --> 00:56:39.999]  You know, I've done this symbol before on TV and people that hate me, who are deceptive, take it out of context.
[00:56:39.999 --> 00:56:40.580]  I love God.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.060]  I hate the devil.
[00:56:42.372 --> 00:56:48.196]  I've done the symbol of the devil on air.
[00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:50.297]  And people then say, oh my gosh, he's a devil.
[00:56:50.297 --> 00:56:51.238]  No, I'm showing the symbol.
[00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:53.590]  They could also be hook'em horns.
[00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.911]  Again, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, what's the use of it?
[00:56:56.911 --> 00:56:58.632]  That, that's a long horn.
[00:56:58.632 --> 00:57:05.735]  That, you could say, is Satanism, but that only got popularized in the 70s and 80s by Rodney James Dean and others.
[00:57:05.735 --> 00:57:18.882]  Before, this was the symbol of stopping a hex, or if you saw the devil, or you saw evil, you did the sign of the devil at it to block it, because that's the sign of the devil, and that stopped it.
[00:57:18.882 --> 00:57:20.583]  So before, in Italy,
[00:57:21.503 --> 00:57:29.289]  In areas of Eastern Europe, for thousands of years, you can go back to the history books, this sign was to ward off evil.
[00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:33.492]  It was a symbol of, get away devil, here's your symbol, you're bound by it.
[00:57:33.492 --> 00:57:47.322]  So again, people need to learn some real history and understand that the enemy wants you to be superstitious of knowledge, superstitious of evil, superstitious of good, superstitious of information, superstitious of anything, because they can project whatever name they want on it at any time.

[01:00:21.198 --> 01:00:23.180]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:23.600]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.221]  I'm here live.
[01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:25.822]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.864]  And I'm back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:00:27.864 --> 01:00:28.865]  Central Live.
[01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:31.628]  We have a lot of special reports.
[01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:42.597]  And internet-only transmissions we do at NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com on the weekends and at other special times as well.
[01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.099]  Okay.
[01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:46.261]  Here's what I want to do.
[01:00:46.261 --> 01:00:47.282]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:00:49.474 --> 01:00:57.759]  And then, I got a little bit behind last hour, and I can't believe I just spent two segments on the OK sign, it's not a white supremacist sign.
[01:00:57.759 --> 01:01:03.223]  That is an absolute fact.
[01:01:03.223 --> 01:01:08.966]  The swastika is, when it was used by Hitler.
[01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:17.612]  But not when it's on Indian temples that are 3,000 years old, that leftists from America go to India and demand they be taken down.
[01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:22.771]  The swastika is a sun symbol.
[01:01:22.771 --> 01:01:24.712]  The swastika is a symbol of the sun.
[01:01:24.712 --> 01:01:32.718]  I remember being like five years old at a Native American reservation.
[01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:37.902]  We were driving throughout Arizona.
[01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:44.507]  And walking in, they had a big display of old Native American branding irons.
[01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:45.968]  For I guess they had some cattle or horses.
[01:01:47.742 --> 01:01:50.823]  And a couple of them were swastikas.
[01:01:50.823 --> 01:01:54.323]  And I remember seeing some of the blankets on the wall that had swastikas.
[01:01:54.323 --> 01:01:58.004]  And even when I was like five, six years old, I said, Dad, is that the Nazis?
[01:01:58.004 --> 01:02:01.184]  He said, no, that's just the swastikas used by everybody around the world.
[01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:04.625]  Hitler just appropriated it.
[01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:08.426]  And I just can't believe we've gotten to this point that I just spent two segments on that.
[01:02:08.426 --> 01:02:09.346]  It makes me feel dirty.
[01:02:09.346 --> 01:02:12.826]  It makes me feel stupid.
[01:02:12.826 --> 01:02:13.586]  But you know what?
[01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:15.467]  It had to be done.
[01:02:15.467 --> 01:02:16.167]  It had to be covered.
[01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:37.837]  Because if you read 1984 by Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, and then you read all the non-fiction books that he wrote, you understand a really bird's-eye view of what's really going on.
[01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.618]  And I'm not going to get into a whole long story about that.
[01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:46.200]  I'm just going to say this, that he was a liberal, and he had the bleeding heart to help people.
[01:02:47.111 --> 01:02:51.855]  And he'd been in the police in India, federal police.
[01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:56.379]  Then he had been a big intellectual and writer in England.
[01:02:56.379 --> 01:03:01.603]  Then he'd been part of the Spanish Civil War and fought against the Nazis.
[01:03:01.603 --> 01:03:05.787]  And then he saw the corruption of the communists on the other side, just as bad as the Nazis.
[01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:11.972]  And then he was in World War II and was a propagandist at the BBC working for
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.983]  The Office of Strategic Services, the later MI6.
[01:03:19.983 --> 01:03:29.209]  And when he got let in on the actual plan, he wrote in 1984 and he died the year it was published, in 1948.
[01:03:29.209 --> 01:03:36.753]  And that's why you read 1984, especially in today's climate,
[01:03:37.964 --> 01:03:40.225]  You're going to ask yourself, why is so much this coming true?
[01:03:40.225 --> 01:03:43.206]  Why is this exactly what they do?
[01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:45.567]  The double thick, the ten minutes of hate.
[01:03:45.567 --> 01:04:00.071]  It's because the Fabian socialist out of England had developed a plan to break up the family, to dumb down the language, and to reduce things down to humans being like animals.
[01:04:00.071 --> 01:04:04.273]  And children would be taken at birth like you take a hen's eggs, is a quote he gave.
[01:04:05.896 --> 01:04:19.420]  And where knowledge is demonized, and where colleges are platforms to destroy speech, and where your own children denounce you, and where the government force feeds porn to everybody so that no lasting relationships take place.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.821]  And you're asking yourself, how did this guy predict all this?
[01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:27.583]  Because he was at the highest levels of the planning.
[01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:29.063]  And Winston Smith is him.
[01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:31.424]  He invented that in papers before he died.
[01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.076]  And that's their real plan.
[01:04:34.076 --> 01:04:39.682]  So, you read 1984, you'll know where Hillary's taking us, where they're all taking us.
[01:04:39.682 --> 01:04:41.324]  That's their plan.
[01:04:41.324 --> 01:04:43.726]  And that's what all this garbage is.
[01:04:43.726 --> 01:04:49.392]  To believe that symbols are evil, but then true evil, oh, well, there's no good or evil.
[01:04:49.392 --> 01:04:51.334]  That's what I was trying to say before break earlier.
[01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:52.976]  We'll be right back, I promise.
[01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.617]  Your phone calls in 60 seconds.
[01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:55.118]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:04.533]  Grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:07.456]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[01:05:07.456 --> 01:05:11.521]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.

[01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:22.214]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.601]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.601 --> 01:05:44.582]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.582 --> 01:05:47.143]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:52.105]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.105 --> 01:05:57.507]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:23.987]  It's Friday the 10th of May, 2019.
[01:06:23.987 --> 01:06:31.615]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.615 --> 01:06:36.420]  For the next two hours, we're going to go directly to your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:42.365]  Starting out with Josh in California, who says he's a professor.
[01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:47.029]  Let's talk about censorship in the education system.
[01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:51.852]  Then we'll go to everybody else that is patiently holding as well.
[01:06:51.852 --> 01:06:53.073]  I said I'd get to it last hour.
[01:06:53.073 --> 01:07:06.460]  I didn't, but I will at the bottom of the hour play some chilling clips of Hillary, where she calls for the end of free speech basically, but then also says, because people say I'm a murderer.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.162]  I'm going to play clips of her admitting she's a murderer.
[01:07:10.711 --> 01:07:12.071]  When we air this.
[01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:13.852]  So this is coming up on the hour.
[01:07:13.852 --> 01:07:15.672]  Josh in California.
[01:07:15.672 --> 01:07:18.673]  Thank you so much for taking your time out to call.
[01:07:18.673 --> 01:07:20.254]  Welcome.
[01:07:20.254 --> 01:07:20.534]  Yeah.
[01:07:20.534 --> 01:07:22.694]  Thank you so much for taking my call Alex.
[01:07:22.694 --> 01:07:26.696]  First off, I want to say just a long time listener, huge fan of the show.
[01:07:26.696 --> 01:07:32.097]  You're just this icon of kind of identity for the resistance gives people like me hope.
[01:07:32.097 --> 01:07:34.798]  So first off, I just want to say thank you for doing what you're doing.
[01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:35.258]  Thank you, sir.
[01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:47.053]  So, yeah, I'm an instructor at a pretty liberal West Coast University out here in California in an arts program.
[01:07:47.053 --> 01:07:57.639]  First off, I just want to say, you know, I see on the show a lot that you critique academics, and I just want to say, you know, don't paint us all with the same brush, because there are a lot of us that are conservatives, that are Christian, that are working in academia, but we can't speak up.
[01:07:57.639 --> 01:08:02.081]  We can't speak our minds, because we will face some kind of retribution.
[01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:03.542]  Oh, I totally know you're right.
[01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:04.422]  I totally know you're right.
[01:08:04.422 --> 01:08:05.883]  I mean, they had Evergreen, where
[01:08:06.923 --> 01:08:15.909]  The mainly white professors said, well no whites allowed this weekend, and a few professors tried to come get their stuff out of their desk and were thrown out of the school, death threat until they had to quit.
[01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:16.629]  So I know that.
[01:08:16.629 --> 01:08:24.214]  I'm just saying, we go to universities all over the country, and our reporters do, and it is like a zombie invasion has taken place.
[01:08:24.214 --> 01:08:27.436]  98% of people are anti-free speech, and it is just horrifying.
[01:08:28.744 --> 01:08:45.393]  It's ridiculous, and this is my whole career that I've wrapped up in this, and I feel, you know, pretty enmeshed in this culture, but, like, I can't speak my mind, but the liberal professors can, of course, attack the president, can attack Christianity, while teaching to even Gen Ed classes, where that stuff doesn't even have to come into play.
[01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:52.937]  So, I guess my question for you is, you know, there are a lot of people like me out there, but obviously we're not very visible, but, you know, you've seen it, some people can see it.
[01:08:53.817 --> 01:08:55.579]  What's your advice to people like me?
[01:08:55.579 --> 01:09:02.004]  How can we help sort of alleviate censorship and kind of turn the tides of liberalism while working inside of this system?
[01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.105]  Well I think you just said it.
[01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.806]  I think you just said it.
[01:09:04.806 --> 01:09:05.046]  Why?
[01:09:06.181 --> 01:09:07.581]  Why can't you speak your mind?
[01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:09.062]  Because they'll file complaints on you.
[01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.222]  They'll get you fired.
[01:09:10.222 --> 01:09:10.922]  They'll harass you.
[01:09:10.922 --> 01:09:11.623]  So they're bullies.
[01:09:11.623 --> 01:09:13.063]  They're terrorists.
[01:09:13.063 --> 01:09:16.764]  And they like being bullies, like a street gang or something.
[01:09:16.764 --> 01:09:23.386]  And so I'm not judging you for keeping your head down and then quietly trying to wake people up.
[01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:31.069]  I think there is a big rebellion on campuses against the monotheistic brainwashing of the left.
[01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:34.790]  But I think the president signed an executive order.
[01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:39.704]  Shane, you're not going to have shutdowns of free speech on campuses.
[01:09:39.704 --> 01:09:42.627]  You're not going to have the banning of speakers.
[01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:46.510]  I think that should extend to the faculty of those institutions.
[01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:54.297]  I mean, it's been a long process of political correctness to phase out what was bastions of open, free thought, the colleges.
[01:09:54.297 --> 01:09:56.138]  And it's happened, I guess, the last 30, 40 years.
[01:09:56.138 --> 01:09:59.861]  But it seems like since Obama came in, the bottom just dropped out.
[01:09:59.861 --> 01:10:00.442]  So what do you think?
[01:10:02.409 --> 01:10:05.651]  Yeah, I think that we haven't really seen the tide start to shift.
[01:10:05.651 --> 01:10:12.095]  I mean, maybe we're seeing this more in the Midwestern universities, but certainly not out here on the West Coast.
[01:10:12.095 --> 01:10:25.983]  If anything, the kind of liberal presence on campus, the hypersensitivity to things like microaggressions, different gender identities seems to be increasing maybe over the past year to almost this level of
[01:10:26.603 --> 01:10:27.244]  Absurdity.
[01:10:27.244 --> 01:10:38.354]  So part of me doesn't know whether to either feed into that system and try to accelerate its collapse or to somehow resist this in a way that still keeps my head down and saves my career.
[01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:43.439]  You know, I always mix these two studies together, so listeners should check it for yourself.
[01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:50.826]  But you had the Milner experiment, you had the Stanford research experiments, and I always mix apples and oranges, but I've had a lot of university studies
[01:10:52.366 --> 01:11:03.890]  that have been published, some have not, as you know, where they found that authority figures told people to kill another student in an experiment, most people would finally kill fellow students.
[01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.972]  Even though they weren't really being killed, they were following orders, believing that was the case.
[01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:19.436]  And so I really think it is the Stanford research and Milner experiments are just examples of psychological manipulation and successive approximation that has allowed the cult-like environment, I mean, take China.
[01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:25.839]  It finances Hollywood and Netflix and all this anti-human garbage.
[01:11:25.839 --> 01:11:26.780]  Here's an article right here.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.081]  Now, I don't agree with this, but this is what China does.
[01:11:30.081 --> 01:11:33.423]  Transgender people in China are classified as mentally ill.
[01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:37.545]  They're put in slave camps and driven to perform self-surgery.
[01:11:37.545 --> 01:11:43.849]  Well, if you're cutting your own genitals off because you think you're a woman, that is mental illness.
[01:11:43.849 --> 01:11:45.530]  That is insane.
[01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.211]  But China says that's insane.
[01:11:48.544 --> 01:11:57.214]  But now we're going to have men winning powerlifting contests and track and field contests, and they're going to say biological men are really women.
[01:11:57.214 --> 01:12:01.198]  And so now they have the estimate within 10 years, all the women's sports will be dominated by men.
[01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:04.142]  Now, how sick is that verbal?
[01:12:05.726 --> 01:12:10.210]  mental gymnastics, this is the left saying you'll accept whatever we say when we say.
[01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:15.134]  It's like AOC saying the world's gonna end in 12 years and then Beto O'Rourke adoption.
[01:12:15.134 --> 01:12:23.381]  These are classic tenets of cults programming people when they say you must accept things that are clearly insane or you're ostracized.
[01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:28.346]  Your view on that?
[01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:29.386]  Josh?
[01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:30.427]  To death in a way.
[01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:51.388]  Yeah, I mean, as somebody who got into the academic game, as someone who wanted to embrace meritocracy, to sort of push the limits, the things like you're referencing there in China, the Chinese reaction to this versus the sort of American reaction to this, it's just absolutely absurd.
[01:12:51.388 --> 01:12:55.969]  It feels kind of like we're living in a crazy, kind of clown, upside-down universe.
[01:12:55.969 --> 01:12:58.210]  And again, if you've got a free, open,
[01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:03.334]  Truly egalitarian society like America was, how do you overthrow it?
[01:13:03.334 --> 01:13:04.796]  You discredit it.
[01:13:04.796 --> 01:13:09.321]  You discredit logic, common sense, and then you can overthrow it.
[01:13:09.321 --> 01:13:13.825]  And so that's why you see the system waging war against anything that makes sense.
[01:13:13.825 --> 01:13:14.326]  God bless you.
[01:13:14.326 --> 01:13:15.467]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:15.467 --> 01:13:16.208]  That was a great caller.
[01:13:16.468 --> 01:13:18.628]  I just spent eight, nine minutes with him.
[01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:25.570]  So when we come back, we're going to talk to Gene and Liberty Dog and Sean and Wendy and Mike and Anthony and Craig and Mike and Doug and Vincent.
[01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:29.030]  We're going to get to everybody in the order that their call was received.
[01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:35.932]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you calling in and we will go through every different angle of this situation.
[01:13:35.932 --> 01:13:38.632]  At the bottom of the hour, I am going to play some of those Hillary clips.
[01:13:38.632 --> 01:13:41.773]  Let me just briefly remind listeners that we're under attack.
[01:13:43.442 --> 01:13:46.784]  They have harassed all of our sponsors into oblivion.
[01:13:46.784 --> 01:13:53.148]  They have taken away our opportunities to be able to advertise on third-party sites to promote our own products, to fund the show.
[01:13:53.148 --> 01:13:57.151]  They have hit us in hundreds of different ways in organized crime.
[01:13:57.151 --> 01:14:08.499]  But thanks to you still coming through, and thanks to you buying the products at InfoWarsTore.com, we have been able to hang on here in the face of unprecedented, blistering, authoritarian attack.
[01:14:08.499 --> 01:14:11.601]  That said, we have a new product that I'm very, very proud of.
[01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:12.632]  I think?
[01:14:28.055 --> 01:14:32.816]  You then have to change the name, so it's now not Secret12, it's Ultra12.
[01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:35.677]  No reviews yet, but you can read the thousands of five-star reviews for Secret12.
[01:14:35.677 --> 01:14:41.559]  This is just Secret12, but twice as strong at Infowarslife.com.
[01:14:41.559 --> 01:14:46.260]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.381]  We've got a big special that has to end early next week.
[01:14:49.381 --> 01:14:50.201]  That's the amazing...
[01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:55.169]  Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Pure Iodine Crystal.
[01:14:55.169 --> 01:14:56.792]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.636]  Learn about how important pure iodine is.
[01:14:58.636 --> 01:15:01.942]  Learn about how it's been removed out of the fields, out of the food, how it's been
[01:15:03.496 --> 01:15:06.637]  Causing huge problems with iodine deficiency.
[01:15:06.637 --> 01:15:08.858]  Learn about iodine deficiency and lower IQ.
[01:15:08.858 --> 01:15:10.758]  Learn about iodine at proper levels.

[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.840]  Iodine is so incredible.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.281]  We have the original X2.
[01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.302]  We're able to get it again via contract.
[01:15:20.302 --> 01:15:24.223]  We already made the X3 by then that has the original, but also two different types in it.
[01:15:24.223 --> 01:15:25.763]  So all three types of triiodine.
[01:15:25.763 --> 01:15:27.464]  Get a free bottle of triiodine.
[01:15:28.855 --> 01:15:31.958]  X3, when you get a bottle of X2, 25% off.
[01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:36.102]  25% off the X2, and then get the X3 absolutely free.
[01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:38.845]  And that's in cinnamons or running low on X2.
[01:15:38.845 --> 01:15:42.989]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:15:42.989 --> 01:15:44.451]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:44.451 --> 01:15:46.273]  God bless you all.
[01:15:46.273 --> 01:15:47.734]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:57.544 --> 01:15:58.805]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.805 --> 01:16:00.085]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.085 --> 01:16:03.826]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:04.907]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:06.748]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.748 --> 01:16:08.448]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:16.251 --> 01:16:17.251]  Bold statement?
[01:16:17.251 --> 01:16:18.252]  You bet.
[01:16:18.252 --> 01:16:20.733]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.

[01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:33.441]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:36.481]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.481 --> 01:16:42.403]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.403 --> 01:16:46.184]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:47.464]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.464 --> 01:16:48.804]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:55.006]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:56.426]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:59.323]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:04.646]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.646 --> 01:17:06.228]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.228 --> 01:17:14.574]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.574 --> 01:17:20.258]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.438 --> 01:17:22.259]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:24.521]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:28.925]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:31.127]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.127 --> 01:17:38.853]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:58.171 --> 01:17:59.212]  You like Secret 12?
[01:17:59.212 --> 01:18:01.796]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[01:18:01.796 --> 01:18:03.378]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.499]  Most expensive.
[01:18:04.499 --> 01:18:05.541]  Vitamin B12.
[01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:06.502]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:18:06.502 --> 01:18:08.224]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[01:18:08.224 --> 01:18:09.746]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[01:18:09.746 --> 01:18:13.331]  B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[01:18:13.331 --> 01:18:13.992]  Just like oxygen.
[01:18:13.992 --> 01:18:14.633]  Just like water.
[01:18:14.793 --> 01:18:19.255]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it, it's awesome, and it's the absolute go-to.
[01:18:19.255 --> 01:18:20.396]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.
[01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:22.977]  So get your X2 in a free bottle of X3 right now.
[01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:27.900]  Get the new Secret 12 Plus, or as it's known, Ultra 12 for 50% off and at FullRestore.com.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:34.864]  And for your wife, your husband, your family, for people that are out working in the fields, truck drivers, police officers, especially high-stress folks, this is way better than an energy drink for me.
[01:18:34.864 --> 01:18:38.666]  And you take it with something like a Turbo Force or a Rain Force, it just makes it all better.
[01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:39.766]  But just experience this.
[01:18:39.766 --> 01:18:41.607]  It's right out of Mother Nature, folks.
[01:18:41.607 --> 01:18:42.628]  That's pure B12.
[01:18:42.628 --> 01:18:43.068]  So amazing.
[01:18:43.308 --> 01:18:48.731]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:18:48.731 --> 01:18:50.292]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:51.673]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[01:18:51.673 --> 01:18:53.114]  Now, I can make them strong.
[01:18:53.114 --> 01:18:54.575]  Now, I can instruct them.
[01:18:54.575 --> 01:18:56.296]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:13.566]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:19:13.566 --> 01:19:18.708]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:19:18.708 --> 01:19:24.309]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:19:24.309 --> 01:19:27.950]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:32.911]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:19:32.911 --> 01:19:39.733]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:19:39.793 --> 01:19:43.577]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:19:43.577 --> 01:19:51.224]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:19:51.224 --> 01:20:01.814]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:20:01.814 --> 01:20:04.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:33.553 --> 01:20:36.955]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know what's really amazing?
[01:20:36.955 --> 01:20:48.724]  The United Nations admits, working with the big megacorporations, that they're flooding the United States and Europe with terminal populations so they can politically have a grip they control.
[01:20:49.987 --> 01:20:51.930]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.495]  I've got stacks of news on this I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:20:55.495 --> 01:21:01.303]  Where migrants terrorize elderly inhabitants of highest elevation Croatian village.
[01:21:01.303 --> 01:21:03.425]  That just broke exclusively at EuropeWars.com
[01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:08.214]  That is just so crazy.
[01:21:08.214 --> 01:21:09.275]  That's some of what's coming up.
[01:21:09.275 --> 01:21:12.359]  But back to your phone calls right now.
[01:21:12.359 --> 01:21:14.061]  Who's up next here?
[01:21:14.061 --> 01:21:15.763]  Let's talk to Gene in Virginia.
[01:21:15.763 --> 01:21:17.525]  The War on Christianity.
[01:21:17.525 --> 01:21:21.109]  A great example of that is you'd never have Coca-Cola put a cross on
[01:21:22.145 --> 01:21:25.086]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[01:21:25.086 --> 01:21:25.526]  Thank you.
[01:21:25.526 --> 01:21:27.026]  I believe that the war on Christianity
[01:21:51.263 --> 01:21:53.724]  The reason it's happening is because it's the truth.
[01:21:53.724 --> 01:22:02.087]  I mean, you can pretty much disprove every religion but Christianity, in my humble opinion.
[01:22:02.087 --> 01:22:08.230]  It's not even a religion, in my opinion, it's a promise from God to deliver humanity from the grips
[01:22:09.008 --> 01:22:11.571]  Of this force that I don't even think we really understand.
[01:22:11.571 --> 01:22:12.712]  No, I agree.
[01:22:12.712 --> 01:22:16.936]  And the more I see the world government operate, the more I see the evil, the more you know the Bible's real.
[01:22:16.936 --> 01:22:21.020]  And how the globalists go out of their way to do everything the Bible says evil does.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.181]  They want to hurt people.
[01:22:22.181 --> 01:22:23.222]  They want to dumb people down.
[01:22:23.222 --> 01:22:25.765]  They want our souls.
[01:22:25.765 --> 01:22:28.888]  Yeah, and if you look at our current reality,
[01:22:30.186 --> 01:22:34.767]  Um, it's pretty insane, because people were the same, right, from like King David to George Washington.
[01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:36.968]  Everybody pretty much lived the same, am I right?
[01:22:36.968 --> 01:22:40.289]  Like, there wasn't a whole lot of advance in technology at that time.
[01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:45.811]  I mean, it's, uh, and all of a sudden, we're able to see across the world in real time.
[01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:50.712]  I mean, you read, for instance, if I can, read Revelation 11 sometimes.
[01:22:50.712 --> 01:22:53.933]  It, uh, people out there, it, it tells you that
[01:22:54.437 --> 01:23:00.219]  This system comes because, uh, you know, uh, it says there's a one world government system.
[01:23:00.219 --> 01:23:02.560]  The beast can be seen at all times by all peoples.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.641]  His image is worshiped.
[01:23:03.641 --> 01:23:04.621]  It's like a television screen.
[01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:11.003]  Uh, and he has individuals that go out and basically in prison and behead anyone that doesn't have his system.
[01:23:11.003 --> 01:23:12.424]  You can't buy or sell without him.
[01:23:12.424 --> 01:23:16.686]  I mean, wow, this is all really coming true.
[01:23:16.686 --> 01:23:18.186]  It absolutely is Alex.
[01:23:18.186 --> 01:23:22.908]  Um, I can't really put into even express how
[01:23:23.553 --> 01:23:25.414]  Real it is.
[01:23:25.414 --> 01:23:26.594]  And it's powerful.
[01:23:26.594 --> 01:23:29.715]  Christianity is a power source.
[01:23:29.715 --> 01:23:31.196]  That's why they hate it.
[01:23:31.196 --> 01:23:34.157]  Like, for instance, me, I didn't come from much.
[01:23:34.157 --> 01:23:41.300]  And I have to say, just honestly, when I was 23 years old, God told me to put my tools away, you're gonna start your own business.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.701]  I mean, I wasn't even a religious person.
[01:23:43.701 --> 01:23:47.962]  Like, I've never been to church in my life, but I got connected to God.
[01:23:47.962 --> 01:23:50.403]  And my business has built itself.
[01:23:50.403 --> 01:23:51.924]  I don't even have business cards, man.
[01:23:51.924 --> 01:23:52.724]  I stay so busy.
[01:23:53.388 --> 01:24:00.533]  It's all just, I love God, I care about the kingdom, and my life just keeps getting better and better, no matter what.
[01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:01.674]  Well, exactly.
[01:24:01.674 --> 01:24:02.034]  Exactly.
[01:24:02.034 --> 01:24:04.976]  But the enemy tunes into the devil and he does things for them.
[01:24:04.976 --> 01:24:08.339]  But always at the expense of others, and always at the expense of them in the end.
[01:24:08.339 --> 01:24:10.800]  So exactly, there's like an Ethernet tuning into God.
[01:24:11.661 --> 01:24:29.332]  And then there's the tuning into the devil, and it's a real system, and the globalists know it, and that's why they want to make us evil and fallen, because then they get dominion over us, then they get to control us, and that's why their sacrament is killing babies, and as long as we then say we want to kill babies, and that babies are worthless crap, well then Satan has control.
[01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:30.093]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:30.093 --> 01:24:39.439]  That's why I went and saw the movie Hell's Satan earlier this week, that's being pushed by the Democratic Party as their new operating system, and instead of sweeping the country,
[01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:41.237]  It was so pathetic.
[01:24:41.237 --> 01:24:43.559]  They were so weak, but they make fun of dead babies.
[01:24:43.559 --> 01:24:45.440]  They talk about how fetuses are crap.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:51.245]  And it's just, it's always that same bullying of the species because it's a spirit that hates man.
[01:24:51.245 --> 01:24:53.367]  It's remained the image of God.
[01:24:53.367 --> 01:24:55.969]  It's that simple.
[01:24:55.969 --> 01:24:57.470]  Okay.
[01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:00.793]  Let's talk about big tech censorship with Sean in Virginia.
[01:25:00.793 --> 01:25:01.673]  Sean, thanks for calling.
[01:25:01.673 --> 01:25:03.455]  Go ahead.
[01:25:03.455 --> 01:25:04.636]  Alex Lee Machine Jones.
[01:25:04.636 --> 01:25:06.297]  How are you doing today, sir?
[01:25:06.297 --> 01:25:07.358]  I'm doing pretty good today.
[01:25:07.358 --> 01:25:07.958]  I appreciate you.
[01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:08.659]  I appreciate the crew.
[01:25:08.659 --> 01:25:09.640]  I appreciate all the stations.
[01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.400]  Hey man, God bless you, God bless your crew, everybody out there.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.404]  Hey, I just wanted to say that YouTube has really gone too far.
[01:25:19.404 --> 01:25:26.368]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but you cannot post American client emojis on YouTube now?
[01:25:26.368 --> 01:25:28.530]  I did not know that, but that's big news.
[01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:29.190]  Tell us about it.
[01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:31.412]  I do know this.
[01:25:31.412 --> 01:25:37.876]  Remember a year and a half ago, Project Veritas got into the New York Times, got into YouTube, Google, and Twitter.
[01:25:37.876 --> 01:25:39.117]  And in three of the videos,
[01:25:42.347 --> 01:25:46.008]  I was actually just doing a live chat through Right Side Broadcasting, which is a conservative
[01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:08.372]  Let's be clear, were you in a YouTube live feed and then that's what happened?
[01:26:25.945 --> 01:26:26.986]  Yes, sir, that's correct.
[01:26:26.986 --> 01:26:29.668]  Yeah, no, no, that's exactly it.
[01:26:29.668 --> 01:26:30.708]  People think I'm joking.
[01:26:30.708 --> 01:26:39.014]  It was five years ago the Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in public schools in however many western states.
[01:26:39.014 --> 01:26:40.935]  Is the Ninth Circuit like three, four states?
[01:26:40.935 --> 01:26:41.356]  I forget.
[01:26:41.356 --> 01:26:45.439]  I know it's California, Oregon, and Washington at least.
[01:26:45.439 --> 01:26:47.120]  Guys, look up what the Ninth Circuit covers, please.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.640]  Thanks.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.541]  Just so I tell folks the right thing.
[01:26:49.541 --> 01:26:51.823]  But they said it's a hateful symbol.
[01:26:51.823 --> 01:26:52.904]  Then they ruled again
[01:26:54.503 --> 01:26:59.170]  That people can lose their jobs if their employer doesn't like them wearing an American flag.
[01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:02.355]  So it's been ruled a symbol of hate.
[01:27:02.355 --> 01:27:03.537]  That's what Trump said last year.
[01:27:04.969 --> 01:27:05.249]  I think so.
[01:27:25.285 --> 01:27:28.926]  When they rewrite history, they can control the future.
[01:27:28.926 --> 01:27:31.147]  Sir, I want to be clear.
[01:27:31.147 --> 01:27:31.787]  Absolutely.
[01:27:31.787 --> 01:27:36.008]  I think we've lost something like 9 million Americans in wars.
[01:27:36.008 --> 01:27:39.189]  And so it's about 9 million last time I checked.
[01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:41.350]  All total in the last 240 years.
[01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:42.691]  But you're absolutely right, sir.
[01:27:42.691 --> 01:27:47.212]  And remember, Trump said after Charlottesville they wanted to ban the Thomas Jefferson statue.
[01:27:47.212 --> 01:27:49.193]  Trump said the American flag will be next.
[01:27:49.193 --> 01:27:53.434]  Well, I'm sure you've heard a lot of Democrats want to remove the flag, sir.
[01:27:54.748 --> 01:27:55.708]  No, I didn't hear that.
[01:27:55.708 --> 01:28:05.550]  I was totally unaware that our American flag, our great symbol of national pride, has somehow become intertwined with some kind of racial hatred.
[01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:06.670]  It's insane.
[01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:08.571]  Sir, it's the OK symbol.
[01:28:08.571 --> 01:28:12.432]  I mean, again, they can project onto anything they want.
[01:28:12.432 --> 01:28:12.992]  God bless you.
[01:28:12.992 --> 01:28:15.052]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:15.052 --> 01:28:16.873]  You know, even I can't believe this is happening.
[01:28:16.873 --> 01:28:21.914]  Yeah, the Ninth Circuit is Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada.
[01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.147]  Arizona.
[01:28:27.147 --> 01:28:28.488]  Utah.
[01:28:28.488 --> 01:28:30.488]  Was that Wyoming or Montana?
[01:28:30.488 --> 01:28:31.849]  So there you go.
[01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:35.870]  In those states, federal courts ruled the American flag is bad.
[01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:38.150]  I can't make that up.
[01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:39.010]  So yeah.
[01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:46.272]  But you know, I was kind of honored a year and a half ago when I learned on those videos that they said, veterans, the American flag, and Alex Jones.
[01:28:46.272 --> 01:28:47.813]  They just said, you see that?
[01:28:47.813 --> 01:28:50.153]  You shadow ban them so they can't talk to anybody.
[01:28:50.153 --> 01:28:51.654]  And the dumb rednecks never know what hit them.
[01:28:51.654 --> 01:28:52.754]  That's a quote.
[01:28:52.754 --> 01:28:52.914]  Wow.
[01:28:57.242 --> 01:28:59.925]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[01:28:59.925 --> 01:29:03.329]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[01:29:03.329 --> 01:29:08.014]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[01:29:08.014 --> 01:29:12.659]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:16.200]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.801]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.

[01:33:10.026 --> 01:33:12.629]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:18.657]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.257 --> 01:33:48.225]  Alright, I'm going to go right back to your phone calls here in a few minutes, but I want to hit this Steve Watson story that's really important that's at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:33:48.225 --> 01:33:56.672]  And again, the only way this article gets out is if you share it on your email, on your text message, and by word of mouth.
[01:33:56.672 --> 01:34:04.098]  Next week, we're going to tell folks the next level of censorship that happened to Paul, but I wanted to wait until next week.
[01:34:05.134 --> 01:34:07.976]  Where we got some more intel before we went public with it.
[01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:19.963]  I've gotten the intel now, confirming what we already knew, but I'm going to wait until next week until you hear this, but Microsoft is announcing their new Word program.
[01:34:19.963 --> 01:34:24.326]  We'll watch what you do, record it, and then report back to Microsoft everything you're writing and doing.
[01:34:25.342 --> 01:34:32.387]  They're also putting a thing on all the new phones that Microsoft runs called NewsGuard, run by neocons, that watches what you do on your phone in live time.
[01:34:32.387 --> 01:34:33.708]  It's in your phone.
[01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:35.549]  It's not like when you go to a website, it pops up.
[01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:37.130]  It's in your phone.
[01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:39.832]  That's been announced.
[01:34:39.832 --> 01:34:50.960]  And they've got new apps coming out that universities are making their people get that track everything you do and then reports offensive speech.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:51.100]  So
[01:34:53.012 --> 01:34:56.713]  The way tyranny works is it doesn't usually do it incremental forever.
[01:34:56.713 --> 01:34:57.974]  Incremental, incremental, incremental.
[01:34:57.974 --> 01:35:01.855]  But then if it thinks it's losing, it'll jump and go for everything.
[01:35:01.855 --> 01:35:04.937]  So the good news is they're jumping and going for broke.
[01:35:04.937 --> 01:35:08.878]  The bad news is if we don't respond and really say no, they can win.
[01:35:08.878 --> 01:35:10.179]  But they are making some desperate moves.
[01:35:10.179 --> 01:35:12.640]  But let me get back to Hillary Clinton.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.841]  The story's up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:16.541]  Video.
[01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:21.523]  Hypocrite Hillary blames internet conspiracy fetishizing for loss to Trump.
[01:35:23.288 --> 01:35:25.068]  And I've got three clips.
[01:35:25.068 --> 01:35:27.249]  Now, I was going to air the newscast.
[01:35:27.249 --> 01:35:29.590]  That's what I found today.
[01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:32.770]  But the crew went and actually found the speech itself without the newscast.
[01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:40.052]  But I could do a whole two-hour show, three-hour show just on her hour-long talk.
[01:35:40.052 --> 01:35:50.895]  I could do an hour-long show just on the fawning newscast acts like God had sat down in the town.
[01:35:50.895 --> 01:35:52.135]  Now, if you don't know about Hillary Clinton,
[01:35:54.423 --> 01:35:57.145]  And her whole past, it's incredible.
[01:35:57.145 --> 01:36:00.827]  But she calls for more censorship by big tech conservatives.
[01:36:00.827 --> 01:36:07.770]  She says she lost the election because of, yours truly, internet conspiracies.
[01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:15.655]  And she said that when people went to knock on doors for her, they'd say, I can't vote for you, you're a murderer.
[01:36:15.655 --> 01:36:17.796]  And she doesn't even really deny that.
[01:36:17.796 --> 01:36:21.698]  Now, Hillary, I don't think, has ever killed anybody herself.
[01:36:21.698 --> 01:36:23.019]  She just had somebody do it for her.
[01:36:24.619 --> 01:36:34.746]  They set Muammar Gaddafi up, had him come in out of the dark, Obama lied to him, then they set him up and killed him, then she went there and bragged, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:36:34.746 --> 01:36:41.030]  She then funded the Arab Spring to bring down the whole Middle East and kill hundreds of thousands.
[01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:44.012]  We're not going to play that clip first, though.
[01:36:44.012 --> 01:36:50.797]  Let's play Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, when Hillary was co-president with Bill.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:37:05.247]  And she also worked at the State Department, and Madeleine Albright went on national television, on NBC, and on 60 Minutes CBS, there's two different clips of this, and said, 500,000 dead Iraqi children is a good price to pay.
[01:37:05.247 --> 01:37:16.832]  Because if you thought George Herbert Walker Bush put sanctions on Iraq, in the eight years of the Clintons, they put sanctions on them that killed over two million people.
[01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:19.213]  Because that's a desert country, 95% of it.
[01:37:21.075 --> 01:37:26.439]  They were shipping in their fertilizer, their medicine, everything.
[01:37:26.439 --> 01:37:31.483]  So she gets asked by a half a million kids when Hillary Clinton's mentor.
[01:37:32.861 --> 01:37:34.082]  Hillary Clinton, you are a murderer.
[01:37:34.082 --> 01:37:34.642]  You are a criminal.
[01:37:34.642 --> 01:37:35.303]  You bragged about it.
[01:37:35.303 --> 01:37:36.224]  You know it.
[01:37:36.224 --> 01:37:37.364]  You're a ruthless person.
[01:37:37.364 --> 01:37:44.770]  These are just times you bragged about killing or your associates bragged about your policies that killed millions.
[01:37:44.770 --> 01:37:45.070]  So here it is.
[01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:03.694]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[01:38:03.694 --> 01:38:09.737]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:38:09.737 --> 01:38:14.020]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.281]  I think this is a very hard choice.
[01:38:16.281 --> 01:38:19.983]  But the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:38:19.983 --> 01:38:21.584]  So that's 1996, May 12th.
[01:38:21.584 --> 01:38:26.087]  That's Hillary Clinton's buddy and her policies that did this.
[01:38:26.087 --> 01:38:27.488]  But then she's Secretary of State.
[01:38:28.476 --> 01:38:43.849]  Many years later, and they go in and use Al-Qaeda and ISIS to take over a country, put women back into sex slavery, kill black Libyans, because the Islamists are very anti-black, and then Hillary brags about she came, she saw, Gaddafi died.
[01:38:43.849 --> 01:38:45.390]  Here it is.
[01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:47.832]  I mean, that is the land of unconfirmed witness.
[01:38:47.832 --> 01:38:50.675]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:54.118]  Did it have anything to do with your visit?
[01:38:54.118 --> 01:38:55.399]  No, I'm sure it did.
[01:38:56.624 --> 01:39:01.648]  So she's bragging about, like Obama said, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:39:01.648 --> 01:39:06.371]  So he didn't actually drop the bombs from the Predator drones.
[01:39:06.371 --> 01:39:07.272]  He just gives the order.
[01:39:07.272 --> 01:39:08.533]  So does she.
[01:39:08.533 --> 01:39:11.055]  So let's go to that clip first.
[01:39:11.055 --> 01:39:21.062]  Here's Hillary Clinton saying that Internet conspiracy theories lost her the election.
[01:39:21.062 --> 01:39:23.144]  You mean people knowing about you, lady?
[01:39:23.144 --> 01:39:24.305]  I mean, I've interviewed
[01:39:26.124 --> 01:39:34.994]  The individuals where the state police came to their house in Arkansas and broke their legs.
[01:39:34.994 --> 01:39:37.716]  I know the names of the people you had killed.
[01:39:37.716 --> 01:39:40.219]  You carried Oklahoma City, lady.
[01:39:40.219 --> 01:39:44.283]  I've had the police officers on the show who had the FBI that worked directly for
[01:39:45.492 --> 01:39:50.374]  Eric Holder, come to their office and say we're going to kill you and your wife if you don't shut up.
[01:39:50.374 --> 01:39:59.017]  And I looked at a highly decorated Marine Corps veteran, head of their K-9 unit, Don Browning, and he gulped and said the names the FBI just said.
[01:39:59.017 --> 01:40:00.337]  I've never said that on air.
[01:40:00.337 --> 01:40:02.078]  And I just said, well, we're doubling down here, aren't we?
[01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:12.396]  So, highly decorated Marine Corps veterans, who had the FBI threatened to kill him and his wife, not once but twice, had never said the name, said it on the show.
[01:40:12.396 --> 01:40:14.977]  I know the names, which, I know all about it.
[01:40:14.977 --> 01:40:17.797]  We've interviewed the witnesses that saw the bombs being placed.
[01:40:17.797 --> 01:40:21.118]  We know who did it.
[01:40:21.118 --> 01:40:23.739]  So somebody's got to have the will to stand against you.
[01:40:23.739 --> 01:40:24.719]  And we do.
[01:40:24.719 --> 01:40:26.160]  And our listeners back us.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:26.900]  And that's why you fear us.
[01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:30.954]  Let's go to her, saying she never killed nobody.
[01:40:30.954 --> 01:40:35.300]  Like Tony Montana tells the corrupt cop in Scarface, no, you never killed nobody.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.703]  You just had somebody else do it for you, didn't you?
[01:40:37.703 --> 01:40:38.064]  Here it is.
[01:40:39.238 --> 01:41:07.401]  So, even though I lived through all those years of ridiculous, baseless attacks, and got elected to the Senate, ran against Barack Obama, who turned around and asked me to be his Secretary of State, so people who know me, people who work with me, know that's all baloney, but if you're 10, 20, 30 steps removed, and your Facebook feed is telling you that I'm dying, or whatever their lie is of the day,
[01:41:08.757 --> 01:41:13.278]  Enough people think, well, you know, that might be true.
[01:41:13.278 --> 01:41:15.399]  Let's stop there.
[01:41:15.399 --> 01:41:17.099]  And that's why Paul's banned.
[01:41:17.099 --> 01:41:22.041]  Because he, Drudge first asked, before we ever did, years before, because Hillary had brain surgery.
[01:41:22.041 --> 01:41:24.101]  Hillary disappeared for two years almost.
[01:41:24.101 --> 01:41:27.442]  I mean, it was fair game for John McCain or Ronald Reagan.
[01:41:27.442 --> 01:41:30.243]  And then she's falling down all the time.
[01:41:30.243 --> 01:41:32.904]  And so we said, does she have another brain tumor?
[01:41:32.904 --> 01:41:33.624]  Is she really sick?
[01:41:33.624 --> 01:41:34.264]  She looks like hell.
[01:41:36.377 --> 01:41:42.761]  Whether we were right or wrong as Americans, we have a right to ask that and people want that asked, but that's why they took us on Facebook.
[01:41:42.761 --> 01:41:45.763]  Was Biden said not one, but two major brain surgeries.
[01:41:45.763 --> 01:41:48.884]  Doctors said he had a 50% chance of recovering the last time.
[01:41:48.884 --> 01:41:51.586]  He had part of his brain removed and he was slurring all his words.
[01:41:51.586 --> 01:41:53.647]  And we said, is he had another stroke?
[01:41:53.647 --> 01:41:58.550]  They got 20 million views on Facebook.
[01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:02.873]  Because the public wants to ask questions about that.
[01:42:02.873 --> 01:42:03.333]  Let's continue.
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.140]  Media made a difference.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:06.721]  Yes, we do.
[01:42:06.721 --> 01:42:11.062]  There's increasing academic research that shows people believe this.
[01:42:11.062 --> 01:42:15.543]  The people who were influenced, could be influenced, believed it.
[01:42:15.543 --> 01:42:17.304]  So take me out of the equation.
[01:42:17.304 --> 01:42:18.624]  Yeah, take you out of the equation.
[01:42:18.624 --> 01:42:21.345]  No one believes known liars like you anymore.
[01:42:21.345 --> 01:42:24.006]  And people know that I legitimately ask questions.
[01:42:24.006 --> 01:42:26.107]  Doesn't mean my question's always right.
[01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:27.307]  Most of the time it is.
[01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:28.948]  I'm asking the same questions our audience is.
[01:42:28.948 --> 01:42:30.248]  Which?
[01:42:30.248 --> 01:42:32.069]  That's why you can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[01:42:32.069 --> 01:42:32.569]  We're gonna come back.
[01:42:33.592 --> 01:42:37.956]  I'm going to finish up with this clip and then I'm going to go to all the callers that have been holding here.
[01:42:37.956 --> 01:42:43.960]  We're going to go to Vincent, Doug, Liberty Dog, Wendy, so many others.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.542]  Anthony, Craig, your calls are all coming up.
[01:42:46.542 --> 01:42:48.644]  Stay with us, whatever you do, however you're listening.
[01:42:48.644 --> 01:42:52.427]  Remember, the way to overpower them is your word of mouth is unstoppable.
[01:42:52.427 --> 01:42:53.808]  Tell folks how they tune in.
[01:42:53.808 --> 01:42:55.149]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:43:06.641 --> 01:43:15.607]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.607 --> 01:43:25.734]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.734 --> 01:43:34.260]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.441]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.441 --> 01:43:37.602]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.602 --> 01:43:39.683]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:43:39.683 --> 01:43:44.606]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.606 --> 01:43:46.127]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.127 --> 01:43:47.608]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.608 --> 01:43:54.293]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.293 --> 01:43:55.774]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:43:57.222 --> 01:44:02.424]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:44:02.424 --> 01:44:10.988]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:10.988 --> 01:44:13.969]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:13.969 --> 01:44:15.710]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:21.992]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:44:24.073 --> 01:44:29.415]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:44:29.415 --> 01:44:32.357]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.357 --> 01:44:36.298]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:36.298 --> 01:44:40.260]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.101]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.101 --> 01:44:48.183]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.183 --> 01:44:49.024]  Don't live
[01:44:49.864 --> 01:44:53.927]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[01:44:53.927 --> 01:44:55.389]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:55.389 --> 01:45:10.781]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:45:11.894 --> 01:45:24.269]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:45:24.269 --> 01:45:26.191]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:45:26.191 --> 01:45:28.875]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:45:30.265 --> 01:45:34.546]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut Infowars down.
[01:45:34.546 --> 01:45:38.467]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:45:38.467 --> 01:45:41.088]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:45:41.088 --> 01:45:43.408]  This country is in a war!
[01:45:43.408 --> 01:45:54.111]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:57.672]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfowarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:45:58.232 --> 01:46:05.862]  You realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:46:05.862 --> 01:46:06.342]  It's you!
[01:46:07.435 --> 01:46:09.936]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:09.936 --> 01:46:11.317]  You are the InfoWard.
[01:46:11.317 --> 01:46:14.238]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:28.601 --> 01:46:29.382]  We are the renaissance.
[01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:30.062]  And we are winning.
[01:47:01.324 --> 01:47:03.961]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.362]  Thanks for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[01:47:16.362 --> 01:47:17.783]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:17.783 --> 01:47:20.765]  I want to finish up with Hillary and then try to go to your calls as quickly as possible.
[01:47:20.765 --> 01:47:23.428]  I have so much breaking news too.
[01:47:23.428 --> 01:47:27.251]  You'll want to visit InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com so you don't miss any of it.
[01:47:27.251 --> 01:47:28.051]  Because we're in a war.
[01:47:28.051 --> 01:47:29.652]  People need to know what's happening.
[01:47:29.652 --> 01:47:33.916]  So Hillary still won't admit she lost because people don't like her.
[01:47:33.916 --> 01:47:35.417]  Madam President.
[01:47:35.417 --> 01:47:38.880]  And her fawning minions are up there in New York watching her basically run for president again.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.702]  She's also in New Hampshire.
[01:47:41.702 --> 01:47:42.723]  And so she says yesterday,
[01:47:44.178 --> 01:47:52.003]  That InfoWars, basically, conspiracies online cost her the election.
[01:47:52.003 --> 01:47:55.405]  She says she wants more censorship.
[01:47:55.405 --> 01:48:01.408]  And then she says people go to doors knocking for her in 2016 and people said, oh, I can't be for her.
[01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:02.549]  She's a murderer.
[01:48:02.549 --> 01:48:07.332]  I just played you clips of her directly involved in the murder of millions.
[01:48:07.332 --> 01:48:07.652]  Here it is.
[01:48:10.678 --> 01:48:14.042]  You know, it's already starting online.
[01:48:14.042 --> 01:48:15.945]  You can already begin to see it.
[01:48:15.945 --> 01:48:22.393]  And you see what, you know, Ray and Dan Coats and others have been warning us about.
[01:48:22.393 --> 01:48:24.395]  It's slowly beginning to bubble.
[01:48:24.395 --> 01:48:27.339]  And of course it's aimed at Democratic candidates.
[01:48:28.576 --> 01:48:38.518]  And so you have to be really careful consumers of what you read online, because it's going to happen again.
[01:48:38.518 --> 01:48:51.801]  You know, I met with a cyber security expert the other day who's, you know, not a political person at all, who said to me, if something is not done, the Russians are going to pick our next president.
[01:48:51.801 --> 01:48:53.302]  Then pause again.
[01:48:53.302 --> 01:48:54.222]  All that's a fraud.
[01:48:54.222 --> 01:48:54.882]  All that's a joke.
[01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:57.312]  She just tells you the story.
[01:48:57.312 --> 01:48:58.393]  Oh, he's not even political.
[01:48:58.393 --> 01:48:59.714]  He says the same thing I say.
[01:48:59.714 --> 01:49:02.837]  This woman is a globalist selling the country out.
[01:49:02.837 --> 01:49:06.420]  Just thank God her expiration date is almost up.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:10.223]  Thank God we have a 75-year lifespan on average.
[01:49:10.223 --> 01:49:12.125]  Because this woman is like rotten milk, man.
[01:49:12.125 --> 01:49:14.407]  It's time to put her in the garbage can.
[01:49:14.407 --> 01:49:18.470]  I don't wish any harm upon her, but just get out of our lives, witch!
[01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:19.491]  Good Lord!
[01:49:19.491 --> 01:49:21.433]  Russians didn't get Trump elected.
[01:49:21.433 --> 01:49:23.434]  The people did, you monster!
[01:49:23.434 --> 01:49:23.955]  Let's continue.
[01:49:25.162 --> 01:49:26.643]  Think of what that means.
[01:49:26.643 --> 01:49:32.566]  And so, the lies, the accusations, the memes.
[01:49:32.566 --> 01:49:34.267]  You know, I was at Yale.
[01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:34.988]  I was at Yale.
[01:49:34.988 --> 01:49:36.068]  Yeah, the free speech.
[01:49:36.068 --> 01:49:42.052]  Three weeks ago with John Kerry, and a young Yale faculty came up and he goes, I just have to tell you this.
[01:49:42.052 --> 01:49:53.519]  He said, I logged onto YouTube to look at something, and before what I was looking for began to play, there was just this flash, a ten second flash.
[01:49:55.054 --> 01:50:01.062]  About you being a pedophile and the Pizzagate lie.
[01:50:01.062 --> 01:50:02.784]  He said it then disappeared.
[01:50:02.784 --> 01:50:07.411]  And this young man says to me, he says, I think I'm pretty good on the Internet and the computer.
[01:50:07.411 --> 01:50:08.512]  I said, I tried to find it.
[01:50:08.512 --> 01:50:09.634]  I couldn't find it anywhere.
[01:50:10.765 --> 01:50:15.307]  And just think about the impact that that one lie, the Pizzagate lie, had.
[01:50:15.307 --> 01:50:16.428]  Pause again.
[01:50:16.428 --> 01:50:17.428]  That was a total setup.
[01:50:17.428 --> 01:50:18.649]  We had them dead to rights.
[01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:35.217]  We had John Podesta, the Aleister Crowley, the rituals, the kids in the hot tub, and then CNN, New York Times, and Washington Post all targeted the pizza place they all went to to make everybody cover that like a mockingbird acts like it's wings broken.
[01:50:35.217 --> 01:50:38.059]  So that you go away from the nest.
[01:50:40.458 --> 01:50:47.741]  I mean, lady, your own deputy chief of staff got busted trying to ship kids out of Haiti.
[01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:51.442]  Your first job was being a lawyer for convicted pedophiles.
[01:50:51.442 --> 01:50:55.564]  I mean, the whole system, Harvey Weinstein, everything you do is about that.
[01:50:55.564 --> 01:50:57.145]  You're a monster.
[01:50:57.145 --> 01:50:59.746]  Hollywood, sexualizing children.
[01:50:59.746 --> 01:51:00.926]  All this.
[01:51:00.926 --> 01:51:02.467]  And so she just brings this up.
[01:51:02.467 --> 01:51:04.207]  Continue.
[01:51:04.207 --> 01:51:08.209]  A stolen email about a little fundraiser at a little pizza place.
[01:51:09.977 --> 01:51:19.499]  That the Russians and their allies, including, I would argue, people online who were promoting Trump.
[01:51:19.499 --> 01:51:20.499]  Who's she talking about?
[01:51:20.499 --> 01:51:24.880]  Took and made into a weaponized attack.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:31.921]  To the point that a disturbed young man in North Carolina got in his car and drove to this little pizza place.
[01:51:31.921 --> 01:51:32.842]  Pause again.
[01:51:32.842 --> 01:51:34.862]  So you lied about WMDs and millions died.
[01:51:36.974 --> 01:51:45.598]  And you did all this other stuff, and all the other... Oh, but some crazy guy went in a pizza place because CNN said go to the pizza place.
[01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.318]  And then you said that I said go to the pizza place.
[01:51:47.318 --> 01:51:49.139]  Let's continue.
[01:51:49.139 --> 01:51:56.102]  He took his AR-15 and went into it, looking for the children that were kept chained in the basement.
[01:51:57.449 --> 01:51:59.330]  Now, there was no basement.
[01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:00.511]  There were no children.
[01:52:00.511 --> 01:52:02.492]  That goes without saying.
[01:52:02.492 --> 01:52:04.914]  He shot up the place before he was apprehended.
[01:52:04.914 --> 01:52:05.974]  Hey, pause.
[01:52:05.974 --> 01:52:07.415]  Actually, I talked to everybody involved.
[01:52:07.415 --> 01:52:08.476]  No one ever really said that happened.
[01:52:08.476 --> 01:52:10.437]  We just heard that one shot.
[01:52:10.437 --> 01:52:11.358]  The guy's an actor, too.
[01:52:11.358 --> 01:52:13.259]  Oh, Tariq's a great guy.
[01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:13.919]  Let's continue.
[01:52:13.919 --> 01:52:16.761]  His consequences.
[01:52:16.761 --> 01:52:23.925]  Think of the manifestos, the crazy manifestos written by the killer in New Zealand.
[01:52:23.925 --> 01:52:25.787]  The killer just this past weekend.
[01:52:26.764 --> 01:52:31.008]  Over Passover in California.
[01:52:31.008 --> 01:52:32.249]  Oh, pause.
[01:52:32.249 --> 01:52:35.973]  Don't mention the girl transitioning to a man in Colorado.
[01:52:35.973 --> 01:52:36.794]  Don't mention that.
[01:52:36.794 --> 01:52:37.734]  It's all crazy.
[01:52:37.734 --> 01:52:38.956]  There's all this death.
[01:52:38.956 --> 01:52:40.277]  Few deaths here, few deaths there.
[01:52:40.277 --> 01:52:42.639]  That's all your fault, but not Hillary's.
[01:52:42.639 --> 01:52:43.099]  No, no, no.
[01:52:43.099 --> 01:52:43.520]  She's good.
[01:52:46.096 --> 01:52:55.298]  This kind of conspiracy, fetishizing, the lies, it has real world consequences.
[01:52:55.298 --> 01:52:58.319]  So we've got to figure it out.
[01:52:58.319 --> 01:52:59.059]  Back it up.
[01:52:59.059 --> 01:53:01.419]  Yeah, real world consequences.
[01:53:01.419 --> 01:53:02.420]  You don't get elected.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.220]  You're a monster.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.841]  You're in bed with the Russians, the Chai Khans, everybody else.
[01:53:06.841 --> 01:53:07.601]  You're a globalist.
[01:53:07.601 --> 01:53:08.481]  You're anti-American.
[01:53:08.481 --> 01:53:09.361]  You're done.
[01:53:09.361 --> 01:53:10.341]  You're over.
[01:53:10.341 --> 01:53:12.082]  You're not in power anymore.
[01:53:12.082 --> 01:53:12.662]  You're over.
[01:53:13.643 --> 01:53:19.009]  But you watch the newscast, man, they were acting like Jesus Christ sat down.
[01:53:19.009 --> 01:53:20.170]  Continue.
[01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:21.211]  Stand up against it.
[01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:24.855]  But, you know, I sleep well at night because, look, I testified for 11 hours.
[01:53:24.855 --> 01:53:25.515]  What do I care?
[01:53:25.515 --> 01:53:32.783]  Alright, in the interest of taking your phone calls, I'm not going to get to the other clips.
[01:53:33.928 --> 01:53:38.349]  Hillary Clinton says Republicans must choose between rule of law and rule of Trump.
[01:53:38.349 --> 01:53:49.312]  She's the one that's all illegal, illegal servers, rigging everything, controlling Loretta Lynch, the head of the Justice Department, and just all, we'd have to list it all in the other clip.
[01:53:49.312 --> 01:53:54.254]  Hillary says Fox News is rotting people's brains and talks about censorship.
[01:53:54.254 --> 01:53:56.714]  We're just going to go to your phone calls instead.
[01:53:56.714 --> 01:53:59.795]  And I got so much more we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:53:59.795 --> 01:54:03.036]  Surprise, surprise, as Goldman Powell would say.
[01:54:04.485 --> 01:54:08.268]  Top Sanders advisor convicted of embezzling union funds.
[01:54:08.268 --> 01:54:09.288]  That's what leftists do.
[01:54:09.288 --> 01:54:17.835]  They get control of your town or city, your school, your university, your club, and they rob it.
[01:54:17.835 --> 01:54:18.715]  That's what his wife does.
[01:54:18.715 --> 01:54:19.416]  It's what he does.
[01:54:19.416 --> 01:54:20.997]  It's what these criminals do.
[01:54:20.997 --> 01:54:22.598]  They rob people.
[01:54:22.598 --> 01:54:23.659]  Period.
[01:54:23.659 --> 01:54:23.959]  Briefly.
[01:54:26.309 --> 01:54:28.571]  X2, you gotta learn why it's so powerful.
[01:54:28.571 --> 01:54:29.952]  The free bottle of X3, that's amazing.
[01:54:29.952 --> 01:54:33.354]  25% off the X2, get a free bottle of X3.
[01:54:33.354 --> 01:54:35.056]  That ends early next week, we're running low on X2.
[01:54:35.056 --> 01:54:40.439]  Won't get more in for about two months, so we'll go back to regular price for a couple months, until the new stuff comes in.
[01:54:40.439 --> 01:54:45.443]  InfoWarsLive.com, experience it for yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:45.443 --> 01:54:46.484]  And the new
[01:54:48.499 --> 01:54:50.720]  Highest quality B12 on the market from our research.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.321]  There may be something better, but this is the best we know of.
[01:54:53.321 --> 01:54:58.843]  That's Ultra 12, double the Methylcobalamin, the highest quality B12 out there.
[01:54:58.843 --> 01:54:59.483]  No reviews yet.
[01:54:59.483 --> 01:55:00.344]  It just came out this week.
[01:55:00.344 --> 01:55:01.584]  It's amazing.
[01:55:01.584 --> 01:55:03.725]  It's 50% off Ultra 12 out of the gates.
[01:55:03.725 --> 01:55:05.266]  Okay.
[01:55:05.266 --> 01:55:05.526]  All right.
[01:55:05.526 --> 01:55:08.567]  I'm going to go to your calls now.
[01:55:08.567 --> 01:55:09.708]  Each caller gets about a minute or two.
[01:55:09.708 --> 01:55:10.848]  It's only for the next person.
[01:55:10.848 --> 01:55:11.668]  Who should we go to next?
[01:55:11.668 --> 01:55:12.789]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:55:16.249 --> 01:55:17.869]  Doug in New York.
[01:55:17.869 --> 01:55:18.530]  Doug, you're on the air.
[01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:20.650]  Thanks for calling.
[01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:22.611]  Hello.
[01:55:22.611 --> 01:55:27.352]  I just want to say that we all recognize the trouble that we're in right now.
[01:55:27.352 --> 01:55:29.473]  We're really in big, big trouble.
[01:55:29.473 --> 01:55:30.493]  That's right.
[01:55:30.493 --> 01:55:44.197]  And I've got a very serious story I wish to share with the audience, and I want to preface that by saying that God has declared that He is a present help in time of trouble.
[01:55:45.252 --> 01:55:52.166]  And if we are to be obedient to the Lord and we really want to be empowered to fight this... We have a call on God!
[01:55:53.211 --> 01:55:54.851]  We have to call on God.
[01:55:54.851 --> 01:56:01.773]  We have to repent of our sins and be baptized in Jesus' name according to Acts 2.38 as Peter baptized in Jesus' name.
[01:56:01.773 --> 01:56:02.353]  No, I agree.
[01:56:02.353 --> 01:56:05.894]  I've had the globalists tell me off-record, and people say, why don't you say who they are?
[01:56:05.894 --> 01:56:06.754]  It's off-record.
[01:56:06.754 --> 01:56:09.134]  They just said, stop saying Jesus Christ.
[01:56:09.134 --> 01:56:10.755]  Stop saying God.
[01:56:10.755 --> 01:56:11.775]  Just leave it alone.
[01:56:11.775 --> 01:56:13.375]  Just let us do what we want with the kids.
[01:56:13.375 --> 01:56:15.716]  Just accept radical Islam, and I won't do it.
[01:56:15.716 --> 01:56:16.996]  So you go ahead, folks.
[01:56:16.996 --> 01:56:20.477]  If people are called by my name and shake my face and repent, I'll heal their land.
[01:56:20.477 --> 01:56:21.457]  So go ahead and tell us.
[01:56:22.839 --> 01:56:29.322]  Okay, so everyone should take a look at ConsumerRightsNow.org.
[01:56:29.322 --> 01:56:32.063]  ConsumerRightsNow.org.
[01:56:32.063 --> 01:56:50.110]  Now this is a story about a friend of mine of many years named Tyrone Holmes who just simply bought an Apple MacBook Pro with his credit card through Amazon and he got the MacBook Pro delivered
[01:56:50.917 --> 01:56:57.321]  And he signed up for AppleCare to make sure he had the right protection on the computer.
[01:56:57.321 --> 01:57:02.424]  And then he's using it for 90 days, for three months.
[01:57:02.424 --> 01:57:05.726]  And then all of a sudden he discovers he's being spied on.
[01:57:05.726 --> 01:57:08.128]  Everything he does.
[01:57:08.128 --> 01:57:14.312]  And then, while he's conducting a funeral, he's a music minister in Harlem.
[01:57:14.312 --> 01:57:17.554]  He gets a phone call from the NYPD
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:29.508]  Wanting him to come forward and that he has a stolen computer and they want him to surrender it or he's going to go to jail for four years.
[01:57:29.508 --> 01:57:31.189]  Can you imagine this?
[01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:38.375]  So what happened was that they hounded him for a whole month because he couldn't find the computer quick enough.
[01:57:38.375 --> 01:57:39.215]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:57:39.215 --> 01:57:40.997]  Yeah, yeah, we'll explain to people.
[01:57:40.997 --> 01:57:41.837]  This is what it's like.
[01:57:41.837 --> 01:57:44.539]  These computers are all two-way windows.
[01:57:44.539 --> 01:57:45.040]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:45.420]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.586 --> 01:57:52.172]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[01:57:52.172 --> 01:57:54.194]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:57:54.194 --> 01:57:55.276]  Good to talk to you.
[01:57:55.276 --> 01:57:59.922]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:57:59.922 --> 01:58:01.864]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:58:01.864 --> 01:58:06.430]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:12.676]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:58:12.676 --> 01:58:13.456]  I appreciate that.
[01:58:13.456 --> 01:58:15.058]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:58:15.058 --> 01:58:15.618]  Tell us about it.
[01:58:15.618 --> 01:58:16.439]  Well, it's really great.
[01:58:16.439 --> 01:58:17.720]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.161]  I take it.
[01:58:18.161 --> 01:58:18.981]  It tastes good.
[01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:20.843]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:58:20.843 --> 01:58:22.785]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:58:22.785 --> 01:58:26.228]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:58:26.288 --> 01:58:29.110]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:30.872]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:58:30.872 --> 01:58:32.953]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:58:32.953 --> 01:58:33.874]  So, yeah.
[01:58:33.874 --> 01:58:36.316]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:58:36.316 --> 01:58:39.138]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[01:58:39.138 --> 01:58:40.299]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:58:40.299 --> 01:58:42.121]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:50.567 --> 01:58:59.998]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[01:59:51.333 --> 01:59:54.015]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.685 --> 02:00:07.086]  Okay, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:00:07.086 --> 02:00:12.909]  Down in New York, we're going to talk about a spy tech story, big tech censorship.
[02:00:12.909 --> 02:00:18.212]  You know, we talk about spy tech 20 years ago, 10 years ago, people laugh at us because, oh, America doesn't do that.
[02:00:18.212 --> 02:00:18.812]  That never happened.
[02:00:18.812 --> 02:00:20.573]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:00:20.573 --> 02:00:25.256]  So finishing up your story real quick here, Doug, in New York, what happened to your friend?
[02:00:25.256 --> 02:00:33.560]  So what happened was they got with him and hounded him until the computer was found.
[02:00:34.272 --> 02:00:39.573]  Now, keep in mind, he's in federal court with this case now.
[02:00:39.573 --> 02:00:55.857]  This is Apple, Amazon, NYPD, and this big Defense Department pump company that has secret technology for oil pumping and deals with rigs all over the world.
[02:00:55.857 --> 02:00:58.338]  And this computer was supposedly bound for Dubai.
[02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:11.390]  So this is like an international espionage story, and I would appreciate if anybody going to that website of consumerrightsnow.org that they have an ability to help donate to this.
[02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:12.270]  No, no, no.
[02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.590]  I hear you.
[02:01:12.590 --> 02:01:13.310]  We'll look into the story.
[02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:14.211]  I appreciate your call, Doug.
[02:01:14.211 --> 02:01:16.611]  I appreciate that.
[02:01:16.611 --> 02:01:18.812]  We'll try to find out more about that.
[02:01:18.812 --> 02:01:20.633]  Okay, let's go to another caller here.
[02:01:20.633 --> 02:01:24.795]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liberty Dog in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
[02:01:24.795 --> 02:01:25.635]  You're on the air, Liberty Dog.
[02:01:25.635 --> 02:01:25.895]  Go ahead.
[02:01:27.090 --> 02:01:28.831]  Yes sir, Alex Jones.
[02:01:28.831 --> 02:01:32.312]  Thank you and God bless you for everything you've been doing.
[02:01:32.312 --> 02:01:37.994]  Fighting up against the Cabal and in defiance of the Cabal and saying who they serve.
[02:01:37.994 --> 02:01:42.535]  I've been taking some action the last year in my own community here.
[02:01:42.535 --> 02:01:47.977]  I'm basically out of frustration with all the censorship and all the lies.
[02:01:47.977 --> 02:01:53.379]  I've just been waving my flag every Friday morning.
[02:01:53.379 --> 02:01:55.380]  I call it Freedom Flag Friday.
[02:01:55.925 --> 02:01:59.527]  I get out there in a really busy street corner, 8 to 9 a.m.
[02:01:59.527 --> 02:02:10.494]  every Friday, I put it on my Facebook page, I call my local radio station, who pretty much tries to censor me, but on Fridays they let you call in and talk about whatever you want.
[02:02:10.494 --> 02:02:13.436]  I try to get about 30 seconds in and he shuts me down.
[02:02:13.436 --> 02:02:15.798]  But basically, it's been a great response.
[02:02:15.798 --> 02:02:24.183]  It started out as like a social experiment, but really it's kind of getting my frustrations out, just doing my thing.
[02:02:24.912 --> 02:02:26.834]  But it's been really great.
[02:02:26.834 --> 02:02:29.276]  Of course, there's a lot of people being triggered by the flag.
[02:02:29.276 --> 02:02:33.120]  Like, one of your callers said, now, you know, the flag's being censored on YouTube.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:40.807]  And some people come and give me the finger, and they give me the thumbs down, which is really ironic, because all I'm doing is waving the flag out there.
[02:02:41.702 --> 02:02:50.370]  Well, that shows how the globalists are taking the country over, and they've gotten a certain percentage, maybe 10% of the public, to really hate America.
[02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:51.892]  I mean, I think it's conservatively 10%.
[02:02:51.892 --> 02:02:54.514]  You go into college, maybe 20%.
[02:02:54.514 --> 02:02:57.997]  You go into a leftist area, maybe half.
[02:02:57.997 --> 02:03:00.559]  And again, they believe they're the ruling class.
[02:03:00.559 --> 02:03:03.202]  They believe they're about to have total power over everyone.
[02:03:04.437 --> 02:03:09.639]  Yeah, and I also use the, talk about other symbols, you know, the OK sign.
[02:03:09.639 --> 02:03:12.140]  That's also the three percenter sign, right?
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.602]  People hold up the three fingers, three percenter sign.
[02:03:14.602 --> 02:03:16.362]  So I've been doing that too.
[02:03:16.362 --> 02:03:20.364]  Yeah, so don't let people keep you for what symbols you want to use.
[02:03:20.364 --> 02:03:21.785]  You know what your symbols mean.
[02:03:21.785 --> 02:03:23.466]  You know what they stand for for you.
[02:03:23.466 --> 02:03:30.749]  And this idea to pre-block symbols before you can use them is the desperateness of the establishment just to stop speech.
[02:03:31.892 --> 02:03:39.214]  Yeah, you know what the biggest symbol, though, that people cannot figure out is a smile and a wave.
[02:03:39.214 --> 02:03:41.635]  They haven't figured that one out yet.
[02:03:41.635 --> 02:03:43.836]  They're like, hey, this guy's waving the flag.
[02:03:43.836 --> 02:03:45.656]  He's got a big smile on his face.
[02:03:45.656 --> 02:03:50.678]  Sometimes I wear my MAGA hat and I wave to every single car that goes by.
[02:03:50.678 --> 02:03:53.819]  My buddy Rich, a few of my friends have come and joined me every once in a while.
[02:03:53.819 --> 02:03:55.780]  My friend Nancy, she's come out a few times.
[02:03:57.350 --> 02:04:05.213]  I started a YouTube channel, I got about 30 subscribers now, LibertyDog1776, and started a Twitter feed.
[02:04:05.213 --> 02:04:05.694]  But you know what?
[02:04:05.694 --> 02:04:08.455]  I'm being defiant out there, but I'm doing it in a good way.
[02:04:08.455 --> 02:04:10.496]  And people can't, they can't fight that.
[02:04:10.496 --> 02:04:11.136]  No, that's beautiful.
[02:04:11.136 --> 02:04:12.556]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:04:12.556 --> 02:04:16.918]  Do you get flipped off when you just have the American flag, or is it when you have the Make America Great Again hat too?
[02:04:16.918 --> 02:04:18.639]  You know what?
[02:04:18.639 --> 02:04:19.059]  It's funny.
[02:04:19.059 --> 02:04:23.881]  I just had my coming out with the MAGA hat two weeks ago, so I've only done it twice.
[02:04:23.881 --> 02:04:25.662]  I've been doing this for over a year now, Alex.
[02:04:26.398 --> 02:04:27.439]  Sure.
[02:04:27.439 --> 02:04:33.063]  So they were getting mad at the flag.
[02:04:33.063 --> 02:04:34.544]  Well that shows how delusional they are.
[02:04:34.544 --> 02:04:35.365]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:35.365 --> 02:04:35.885]  Great job.
[02:04:35.885 --> 02:04:37.006]  Keep it up.
[02:04:37.006 --> 02:04:37.946]  Alright, more calls.
[02:04:37.946 --> 02:04:39.167]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:39.167 --> 02:04:42.209]  I'm going to go right to more of your calls.
[02:04:42.209 --> 02:04:43.070]  Right to your calls.
[02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:45.972]  Craig and Anthony and so many others.
[02:04:45.972 --> 02:04:46.813]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:04:46.813 --> 02:04:47.273]  Get ready.
[02:04:47.273 --> 02:04:48.454]  Start your engines.
[02:04:48.454 --> 02:04:49.435]  We're going to be right back.
[02:04:56.215 --> 02:05:01.417]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.417 --> 02:05:09.981]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:09.981 --> 02:05:12.983]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:12.983 --> 02:05:14.703]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.703 --> 02:05:20.986]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:23.087 --> 02:05:28.409]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:05:28.409 --> 02:05:31.350]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:35.252]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:35.252 --> 02:05:39.273]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.273 --> 02:05:41.094]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.094 --> 02:05:47.196]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.196 --> 02:05:48.017]  Don't live
[02:05:48.857 --> 02:05:52.920]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:54.382]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:54.382 --> 02:06:03.369]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's plain to see.
[02:06:03.369 --> 02:06:09.354]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:06:09.354 --> 02:06:11.576]  He never gives up.
[02:06:11.576 --> 02:06:13.637]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.637 --> 02:06:17.200]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:06:21.096 --> 02:06:25.557]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.557 --> 02:06:26.758]  I am now completely banned.
[02:06:26.758 --> 02:06:31.039]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.039 --> 02:06:32.119]  I want them shut down.
[02:06:32.119 --> 02:06:33.080]  I want them silenced.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:33.920]  I want them muted.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.801]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:06:35.801 --> 02:06:37.301]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:43.628]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:06:43.628 --> 02:06:50.637]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[02:06:50.637 --> 02:06:54.661]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[02:06:54.661 --> 02:06:57.665]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:06:57.965 --> 02:07:11.557]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other InfoWars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:14.159]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.840]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:18.883]  Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[02:07:19.463 --> 02:07:19.983]  No!
[02:07:19.983 --> 02:07:23.826]  Because Big Tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[02:07:23.826 --> 02:07:25.187]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[02:07:25.187 --> 02:07:28.469]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[02:07:28.469 --> 02:07:31.131]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.
[02:07:31.131 --> 02:07:33.553]  And a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[02:07:33.553 --> 02:07:37.656]  Social media's hall monitor, Frank Stoker, was not very happy about it.
[02:07:37.656 --> 02:07:40.838]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[02:07:41.018 --> 02:07:50.826]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency, I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:07:50.826 --> 02:07:53.568]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:07:53.568 --> 02:07:56.170]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:57.250]  I want them shut down.
[02:07:57.250 --> 02:07:58.211]  I want them silenced.
[02:07:58.211 --> 02:07:58.912]  I want them muted.
[02:07:58.912 --> 02:08:00.993]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:08:00.993 --> 02:08:02.374]  I want them shut down!
[02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:03.916]  I want them silenced!
[02:08:03.916 --> 02:08:05.317]  I want them muted!
[02:08:05.317 --> 02:08:06.437]  Don't worry.
[02:08:06.437 --> 02:08:08.159]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:08:13.075 --> 02:08:27.284]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:08:27.284 --> 02:08:28.485]  What's all the fuss about?
[02:08:28.485 --> 02:08:29.466]  Why do they want to stop air?
[02:08:29.466 --> 02:08:34.069]  Because we have the spirit of victory, the spirit of being alive, being pro-human.
[02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:38.031]  Alright, I've got stacks of news that just broke at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:08:38.031 --> 02:08:39.833]  I've got tons of incredible clips.
[02:08:39.833 --> 02:08:41.554]  I'm taking your calls on this Friday.
[02:08:42.898 --> 02:08:45.240]  That's what we're doing right now.
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:47.982]  We'll cover a ton of news at the bottom of the hour, and I'll continue with calls after that.
[02:08:47.982 --> 02:08:51.405]  But right now, we are taking your phone calls.
[02:08:51.405 --> 02:08:55.148]  All right, Anthony in New Jersey, we're going to order as the calls are received.
[02:08:55.148 --> 02:08:58.291]  Thanks for holding, Anthony in New Jersey.
[02:08:58.291 --> 02:09:00.532]  Hey Alex, what's up, man?
[02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.513]  I love talking to you, brother.
[02:09:01.513 --> 02:09:03.315]  What's on your mind today?
[02:09:03.315 --> 02:09:03.875]  Thanks, man.
[02:09:03.875 --> 02:09:05.937]  Well, I just want to say I'm a longtime listener.
[02:09:05.937 --> 02:09:08.359]  I've been listening for about 10 years.
[02:09:08.359 --> 02:09:10.841]  Endgame and Obama deception really helped me wake up.
[02:09:11.645 --> 02:09:14.747]  And I kind of passed that torch around my family.
[02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:16.928]  So I really appreciate the things that you guys are doing.
[02:09:16.928 --> 02:09:18.970]  Thank you, brother.
[02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:25.614]  I wanted to talk to you a little bit about measles outbreak that's happening here in New Jersey and New York.
[02:09:25.614 --> 02:09:26.955]  I haven't even gotten to that yet.
[02:09:26.955 --> 02:09:28.796]  You know, Europe has thousands of cases now.
[02:09:28.796 --> 02:09:29.436]  So does the U.S.
[02:09:29.436 --> 02:09:34.459]  And I have a stack of mainstream news admitting it's the illegal aliens.
[02:09:34.459 --> 02:09:40.363]  Yeah, like I actually I mean, I agree with that to a sense, but I also know that it's and this is by no means
[02:09:41.107 --> 02:09:52.376]  Anti-semitic, but I know that it's coming from Israel as well, because I live close to Lakewood, which would be the highest Orthodox Jew population in the United States.
[02:09:52.376 --> 02:10:02.544]  No, I mean, they admit that it's some of the main outbreaks in the Orthodox Jewish area, because they follow Leviticus and don't want to put the dead baby parts in them.
[02:10:02.544 --> 02:10:04.746]  And a lot of the vaccines are grown on dead baby tissue.
[02:10:05.871 --> 02:10:13.514]  Right, so my main concern is not necessarily where it's coming from, it's also like how they're trying to force vaccines now.
[02:10:13.514 --> 02:10:15.015]  Oh, I'm very concerned, sir.
[02:10:15.015 --> 02:10:17.076]  I'm very concerned, yes, sir.
[02:10:17.076 --> 02:10:25.659]  It's extending way past orthodox Jewish religions and such, and now they're trying to make sure that everybody's getting vaccinated for this MMR.
[02:10:25.659 --> 02:10:29.541]  And that's, I mean, even going as far as making it mandated.
[02:10:29.929 --> 02:10:38.836]  Yep, well it's not really mandated, they're lying, it's a fraud, it's all color of law, and it's all big pharma doing this, because they have hundreds of vaccines they want you to take.
[02:10:38.836 --> 02:10:41.858]  Fifty years ago it was like four or five vaccines, now it's hundreds.
[02:10:41.858 --> 02:10:44.981]  And did you know that vaccine makers have liability protection?
[02:10:44.981 --> 02:10:46.662]  Did you know they're not tested for safety?
[02:10:46.662 --> 02:10:48.143]  Did you know that?
[02:10:48.143 --> 02:10:49.705]  No, I didn't actually.
[02:10:49.705 --> 02:10:58.752]  We've got an article on Infowars.com that's got posters we printed up, so people can print them off and post them in your area, and it just simply says, vaccines can kill,
[02:10:59.824 --> 02:11:01.805]  They have no liability.
[02:11:01.805 --> 02:11:03.205]  They have no safety testing.
[02:11:03.205 --> 02:11:05.426]  Read the insert that comes with it.
[02:11:05.426 --> 02:11:06.667]  Humanity won't submit.
[02:11:06.667 --> 02:11:10.208]  Here's how you can strike back against censorship.
[02:11:10.208 --> 02:11:10.909]  $5,000 prize.
[02:11:10.909 --> 02:11:14.430]  I don't have the money to do these contests these days, but I'm still going to do it.
[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:16.191]  It's a month-long contest.
[02:11:16.191 --> 02:11:16.851]  Videotape it.
[02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:18.632]  Put it on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:11:18.632 --> 02:11:19.132]  Get it out there.
[02:11:19.132 --> 02:11:20.292]  Make your own poster.
[02:11:20.292 --> 02:11:21.213]  Pick one of our posters.
[02:11:21.213 --> 02:11:21.733]  Get it out there.
[02:11:21.733 --> 02:11:22.573]  Videotape it.
[02:11:22.573 --> 02:11:23.634]  Get it in legal and lawful areas.
[02:11:23.634 --> 02:11:24.474]  $5,000 first place.
[02:11:24.474 --> 02:11:24.974]  $1,000 second place.
[02:11:27.055 --> 02:11:28.496]  I think 500 bucks, third place.
[02:11:28.496 --> 02:11:29.257]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:11:29.257 --> 02:11:30.318]  I appreciate your call, Anthony.
[02:11:30.318 --> 02:11:31.459]  Yeah, it's a big deal.
[02:11:31.459 --> 02:11:34.021]  The forced inoculation is a big, big deal.
[02:11:34.021 --> 02:11:37.724]  But the measles, mumps, rubella shot never protects you anyways.
[02:11:37.724 --> 02:11:41.567]  They admit folks that have been vaccinated are the ones that are all getting sick.
[02:11:41.567 --> 02:11:42.668]  So here's the thing.
[02:11:42.668 --> 02:11:50.895]  If you've been vaccinated, how am I bad for not taking it if you're supposedly protected?
[02:11:50.895 --> 02:11:53.217]  All right, let's go to Craig, Louisiana.
[02:11:53.217 --> 02:11:53.817]  Craig, you're on the air.
[02:11:53.817 --> 02:11:54.438]  Thanks for calling.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:02.383]  Alex, let me just say, it's an honor to be able to speak to you.
[02:12:02.383 --> 02:12:03.564]  It's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:12:03.564 --> 02:12:05.004]  What's on your mind?
[02:12:05.004 --> 02:12:11.348]  Oh, yeah, and if I can just say real quickly, for the longest time, my mother tried to get me to listen to you.
[02:12:11.348 --> 02:12:12.268]  I thought she was nuts.
[02:12:12.268 --> 02:12:13.549]  I thought you were nuts.
[02:12:13.549 --> 02:12:23.754]  But let me say, last year, sorry, right before the election, I actually took me, my wife, and our unborn child, we tried to go out there to go to your production studio.
[02:12:24.906 --> 02:12:26.968]  Because that's one thing that's on my bucket list.
[02:12:26.968 --> 02:12:33.993]  So I still hope one day you can do a meet-and-greet with me and my whole family that we can all meet with you.
[02:12:33.993 --> 02:12:34.934]  That's on my bucket list.
[02:12:34.934 --> 02:12:37.636]  Meet with you and meet with the president.
[02:12:37.636 --> 02:12:38.316]  So it's on my mind.
[02:12:38.316 --> 02:12:39.998]  Well, I'd love to meet with you too, brother.
[02:12:39.998 --> 02:12:43.640]  You know, and I'm not bragging, but even when I'm under the weather, I'm up here on the air.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.742]  It's just that I'm working all the time.
[02:12:45.742 --> 02:12:49.545]  But I would love to be able to meet the listeners more often.
[02:12:49.545 --> 02:12:50.285]  Do it soon.
[02:12:50.285 --> 02:12:53.768]  And so the reason I called is you were talking about Comey.
[02:12:55.279 --> 02:12:59.002]  It's a symptom of TDS.
[02:12:59.002 --> 02:13:15.735]  So what really needs to happen is the President, I hope him or maybe one of his, or maybe someone in his cabinet is listening today and every day really, because everything you do and everything that we do
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:20.363]  As a people, as a country, it's so important.
[02:13:20.363 --> 02:13:22.504]  So what does the White House need to do to Comey?
[02:13:22.504 --> 02:13:25.687]  Because he's saying we're going to indict the president after he's not the president.
[02:13:25.687 --> 02:13:30.490]  This is a disgraced criminal that lied to Congress, that got caught perjuring himself.
[02:13:30.490 --> 02:13:33.072]  So what do you think should be done to Comey?
[02:13:33.072 --> 02:13:33.792]  It's sickening.
[02:13:33.792 --> 02:13:34.833]  Oh, three things.
[02:13:34.833 --> 02:13:39.136]  One, he needs to enact laws that say no more censorship.
[02:13:39.136 --> 02:13:40.197]  We're being banned.
[02:13:40.197 --> 02:13:42.479]  Personally, I was banned for life on Twitter.
[02:13:42.479 --> 02:13:43.679]  We need to put it to an end.
[02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.024]  Well, God bless you, Craig.
[02:13:46.024 --> 02:13:50.128]  We're gonna jump onto other calls, but thank you for your call.
[02:13:50.128 --> 02:13:52.871]  Vincent in Boston, you're on the air.
[02:13:52.871 --> 02:13:53.451]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:53.451 --> 02:13:54.753]  Go ahead, Vincent.
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:09.520]  Thank you, sir.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.122]  Some college professors have waged a war of attrition upon the culture of our nation.
[02:14:14.122 --> 02:14:26.888]  And Alex, I'm only 19 and a college student, but at school I see firsthand a generation of young adults being indoctrinated in a cult-like manner to perverse ideologies such as total multiculturalism, moral relativism, and Satanism.
[02:14:26.888 --> 02:14:34.191]  And there are posters at my Roman Catholic college that say, you must be tolerant of Islam, paganism, and wicked witchcraft or else.
[02:14:34.671 --> 02:14:36.072]  Well, listen, you're obviously on fire.
[02:14:36.072 --> 02:14:38.293]  I'm going to hold you up for a minute so you can finish up.
[02:14:53.573 --> 02:14:53.994]  You're right.
[02:14:53.994 --> 02:14:55.235]  We're under assault.
[02:14:55.235 --> 02:14:57.778]  The left-hand path is making its move.
[02:14:57.778 --> 02:15:00.200]  You see nationalists fighting back worldwide, but it's not enough.
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.322]  We have to get very aggressive.
[02:15:02.322 --> 02:15:04.885]  Conservatives can't just sit back and do defense.
[02:15:04.885 --> 02:15:06.407]  We've got to go on offense politically.
[02:15:07.984 --> 02:15:08.584]  Correct.
[02:15:08.584 --> 02:15:15.828]  And kids today in the colleges are forced to submit to the brainwashing if they want to succeed academically, which is ironic.
[02:15:15.828 --> 02:15:23.653]  And so a lot of them go into Stockholm Syndrome and instead of being secretive and just being a leftist to pass, they actually become a leftist.
[02:15:25.006 --> 02:15:32.350]  Yes, and a residual effect of this indoctrination is what I call the milquetoast generation that needs safe spaces from disagreement and intelligent thought.
[02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:37.673]  And that's why we've seen all these hyper-sexualized violent men and women who believe it's their way of a highway.
[02:15:37.673 --> 02:15:38.574]  And I have one last question.
[02:15:38.574 --> 02:15:38.814]  Hold on!
[02:15:38.814 --> 02:15:39.994]  Stay there, Vincent.
[02:15:39.994 --> 02:15:40.695]  You're on fire.
[02:15:40.695 --> 02:15:41.875]  I want to hear this.
[02:15:41.875 --> 02:15:43.877]  We're taking a lot of calls today, like I said I would.
[02:15:43.877 --> 02:15:45.918]  We're already 20-plus calls in.
[02:15:45.918 --> 02:15:46.338]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.805 --> 02:16:00.868]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[02:16:06.230 --> 02:16:14.274]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[02:16:26.543 --> 02:16:30.466]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.466 --> 02:16:32.007]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:32.007 --> 02:16:34.949]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.949 --> 02:16:40.513]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.513 --> 02:16:41.714]  I can help you, too.

[02:17:01.152 --> 02:17:04.196]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.196 --> 02:17:09.763]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.103 --> 02:17:13.904]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.904 --> 02:17:15.165]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.165 --> 02:17:16.165]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.165 --> 02:17:22.707]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:19:58.738 --> 02:20:15.536]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.536 --> 02:20:20.462]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:24.671 --> 02:20:29.455]  Not this segment, but next segment, I'm going to talk about the tactical rabbi.
[02:20:29.455 --> 02:20:32.117]  In the LA Times!
[02:20:32.117 --> 02:20:36.620]  Actually going into synagogues and teaching people that you need to have armed security here.
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:38.662]  It's okay for you to have guns.
[02:20:38.662 --> 02:20:41.384]  And the left is learning and actually getting guns.
[02:20:41.384 --> 02:20:44.847]  That's how we're going to beat the globalist plan for domestication.
[02:20:45.819 --> 02:20:49.901]  It was armed people that stopped the killer last week who would have killed probably dozens.
[02:20:49.901 --> 02:20:52.042]  Only killed a few people, thank God.
[02:20:52.042 --> 02:20:55.564]  I mean, I'm glad they killed a few people, but thank God it was only a few, not a whole bunch.
[02:20:55.564 --> 02:20:57.585]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:20:57.585 --> 02:20:59.165]  So that's coming up.
[02:20:59.165 --> 02:21:00.166]  And your calls continue.
[02:21:00.166 --> 02:21:02.067]  I'm being a good boy, I'm taking a lot of calls.
[02:21:02.067 --> 02:21:04.328]  Vincent in Boston, you were making some really good points, go ahead.
[02:21:06.195 --> 02:21:08.496]  Thank you, sir, and very quickly and I'll hang up.
[02:21:08.496 --> 02:21:17.960]  My message to you and the listeners is that although the liberals may have the loudest voices in the room, I promise there's many, many good conservative young adults out there and we are of a silent majority.
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:19.400]  So please do not lose hope.
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.561]  Keep defending traditionalism because hell awaits.
[02:21:21.561 --> 02:21:30.985]  And sir, I'd like to leave you with a quote by the great Dante, who said that the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.
[02:21:30.985 --> 02:21:31.965]  So God bless you, Alex.
[02:21:32.754 --> 02:21:33.314]  God bless you.
[02:21:33.314 --> 02:21:34.495]  Yes, I've read Dante's Inferno.
[02:21:34.495 --> 02:21:35.196]  Everybody should read it.
[02:21:35.196 --> 02:21:36.396]  Real literature.
[02:21:36.396 --> 02:21:37.077]  Thank you so much.
[02:21:37.077 --> 02:21:40.999]  A lot of folks read Dante and think it's like the Bible or something.
[02:21:40.999 --> 02:21:44.361]  But it's fiction, but it's very powerful.
[02:21:44.361 --> 02:21:47.603]  But it deals with real things that go on in the world.
[02:21:47.603 --> 02:21:51.425]  Okay, we're just going to the order of the calls received here.
[02:21:51.425 --> 02:21:58.109]  Let us now go ahead and take a call from Mike in New Jersey.
[02:21:58.109 --> 02:21:58.649]  You're on the air.
[02:21:58.649 --> 02:21:59.390]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:22:02.074 --> 02:22:02.917]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:22:02.917 --> 02:22:03.318]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:03.318 --> 02:22:03.880]  Thanks for calling.
[02:22:05.106 --> 02:22:06.427]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:22:06.427 --> 02:22:07.967]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:22:07.967 --> 02:22:08.707]  I'm so excited.
[02:22:08.707 --> 02:22:10.348]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:22:10.348 --> 02:22:22.752]  So, I first got into InfoWars about four years ago because I'm a huge Megadeth fan, and you had Dave Mustaine on for a great long interview, and I don't know if you do those anymore, but I thought that was a great idea.
[02:22:22.752 --> 02:22:23.613]  I wish you'd do that again.
[02:22:23.613 --> 02:22:24.673]  Yeah, I know.
[02:22:24.673 --> 02:22:25.673]  I like Dave Mustaine.
[02:22:25.673 --> 02:22:26.794]  He wanted me to go on tour with him.
[02:22:26.794 --> 02:22:31.476]  He wanted me to write his last three albums with him, and I really like Dave.
[02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:32.236]  I just... I don't...
[02:22:33.237 --> 02:22:38.681]  I mean, I'm sure he's going to write really great albums without me, but you listen to his music the last 10 years.
[02:22:38.681 --> 02:22:40.023]  It's basically M4's.
[02:22:40.023 --> 02:22:40.883]  So he's a daily listener.
[02:22:40.883 --> 02:22:43.205]  I really like Dave Mustaine.
[02:22:43.205 --> 02:22:45.367]  I know, and I like both of you guys.
[02:22:45.367 --> 02:22:46.468]  God bless both of you guys.
[02:22:46.468 --> 02:22:47.589]  I love you guys both.
[02:22:47.589 --> 02:22:48.930]  Let me say this too.
[02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:53.333]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:22:53.333 --> 02:22:56.916]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[02:22:56.916 --> 02:22:57.457]  Tastes like...
[02:23:01.693 --> 02:23:05.475]  A great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:23:05.475 --> 02:23:07.355]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:23:07.355 --> 02:23:12.598]  My daughter uses the bubblegum, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:23:12.598 --> 02:23:16.540]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:18.641]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:23:18.641 --> 02:23:21.223]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products.
[02:23:21.223 --> 02:23:25.245]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:23:26.045 --> 02:23:32.268]  The media picks up making a joke about me saying it tastes good mixed with different fruits and milk.
[02:23:32.268 --> 02:23:35.770]  It tastes okay in a blender with milk or water.
[02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:40.652]  I don't recommend you do it with a spoon like Vice did because it's so thick you can't do it.
[02:23:40.652 --> 02:23:45.414]  But the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth, it is next level.
[02:23:45.414 --> 02:23:46.415]  It really is good, so thank you.
[02:23:47.648 --> 02:23:49.590]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:50.411]  Thank you.
[02:23:50.411 --> 02:24:01.921]  So the reason I'm calling today is because I know you've been playing that clip of Ana Navarro a lot, you know, talking about how they basically want to deperson you and just, you know, make you just disappear.
[02:24:01.921 --> 02:24:03.222]  And that's horrible.
[02:24:03.222 --> 02:24:07.807]  But there's something subtle that takes place on that clip that I haven't heard a lot of people mentioning.
[02:24:07.807 --> 02:24:10.749]  And that's Joy Bahar right before her saying,
[02:24:11.989 --> 02:24:16.593]  We've been noticing quote-unquote excesses in the First and Second Amendment.
[02:24:16.593 --> 02:24:22.859]  And I just wanted to say how shrewd the globalists are because I know that The View is just a globalist platform.
[02:24:22.859 --> 02:24:23.980]  It's the mouthpiece.
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:31.387]  And how shrewd they are to use these subtleties to try to delimit our rights and how effective it's been.
[02:24:31.387 --> 02:24:33.389]  And I just wanted to see if you could maybe speak to
[02:24:33.869 --> 02:24:43.394]  Who is at the top who's controlling these mouthpieces and giving them their marching orders?
[02:24:43.394 --> 02:24:44.054]  Let me get to that.
[02:24:44.054 --> 02:24:44.635]  Thank you for the call.
[02:24:44.635 --> 02:24:45.475]  Great points, Mike.
[02:24:45.475 --> 02:24:47.976]  Here's Navarro on The View.
[02:24:47.976 --> 02:24:48.477]  Shut down.
[02:24:48.477 --> 02:24:49.457]  I want them silenced.
[02:24:49.457 --> 02:24:50.278]  I want them muted.
[02:24:50.278 --> 02:24:53.539]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:24:53.539 --> 02:24:57.301]  She thinks it's horrible, so she decides it won't be on air.
[02:24:57.301 --> 02:24:58.562]  And so the caller was asking
[02:25:00.089 --> 02:25:00.970]  What's behind this?
[02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:03.371]  I mean, I wouldn't even call it subtle.
[02:25:03.371 --> 02:25:04.471]  I mean, you're right.
[02:25:04.471 --> 02:25:09.234]  Joy Behar is subtle compared to Navarro.
[02:25:09.234 --> 02:25:13.136]  She's like, oh, we have excesses in the Second and First Amendment.
[02:25:13.136 --> 02:25:14.517]  This is just insane.
[02:25:14.517 --> 02:25:17.658]  They want to take you off air so they can lie about what you said.
[02:25:17.658 --> 02:25:22.481]  99% of the time when they say things I've said or done, they won't show it.
[02:25:22.481 --> 02:25:24.262]  And now that they think I'm deplatformed,
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.181]  Now they think I'm not on all these systems.
[02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:37.983]  I'm still on hundreds of radio and TV stations and Infowars.com and Newswars.com, but now that they think I'm off air.
[02:25:37.983 --> 02:25:41.504]  Now it's the white supremacist thing, which nobody buys.
[02:25:41.504 --> 02:25:42.724]  Everybody knows that's just political.
[02:25:42.724 --> 02:25:43.765]  It's lies.
[02:25:43.765 --> 02:25:49.846]  Except they use it then in banking and in life.
[02:25:49.846 --> 02:25:53.007]  And that's why I've got to file suit against these groups that are doing this.
[02:25:54.301 --> 02:26:00.444]  Not because I want to, not because I even have the money to do it, but because this is gonna happen to you next.
[02:26:00.444 --> 02:26:02.025]  This is the system.
[02:26:02.025 --> 02:26:07.528]  So, everybody's been called a racist, everybody's been called a white supremacist, everybody's been lied about.
[02:26:07.528 --> 02:26:13.972]  And now, that they think I'm not on these platforms, they are... I mean, I wonder what they're gonna make up next.
[02:26:13.972 --> 02:26:14.972]  And again, I'm not a victim.
[02:26:14.972 --> 02:26:17.394]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[02:26:17.394 --> 02:26:22.196]  I'm just simply blown away that they're this criminal.
[02:26:22.196 --> 02:26:22.677]  It was on...
[02:26:24.376 --> 02:26:33.761]  NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, it was on every channel that I knew of when they deplatformed me last year.
[02:26:33.761 --> 02:26:36.683]  That Alex Jones called for killing members of the media.
[02:26:36.683 --> 02:26:38.584]  There was no clip, there was no video.
[02:26:38.584 --> 02:26:40.125]  Why would I say that?
[02:26:40.125 --> 02:26:41.545]  A, I disagree with that.
[02:26:41.545 --> 02:26:44.267]  B, it's illegal.
[02:26:44.267 --> 02:26:50.450]  And they asked Jack Dorsey, you haven't banned him yet, you're the last guy, but he said get battle rifles ready and kill the media.
[02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:51.371]  Dorsey goes, I saw that.
[02:26:52.819 --> 02:26:53.700]  I'm still going to keep him up.
[02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:57.863]  It's all just a stunt.
[02:26:57.863 --> 02:26:59.604]  Then he banned me.
[02:26:59.604 --> 02:27:01.746]  Somebody explain this.
[02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:06.929]  Speech isn't about saying what you want to say.
[02:27:06.929 --> 02:27:08.731]  That's the side issue.
[02:27:08.731 --> 02:27:13.814]  Speech is about standing up to liars when they lie about you.
[02:27:13.814 --> 02:27:17.077]  So imagine having your arms, your legs tied and your mouth gagged.
[02:27:18.211 --> 02:27:25.416]  Imagine they wheel you out in a gladiatorial event, and you're tied to the front of a forklift.
[02:27:25.416 --> 02:27:35.103]  And out walks Brian Stelter, Anna Navarro, Hillary Clinton, and they pull out swords, and they just shove them in your guts, and everybody claps.
[02:27:35.103 --> 02:27:41.708]  And you're gagged, and you're bleeding, and there's big teleprompters flashing, hooray, death blow!
[02:27:41.708 --> 02:27:47.812]  I mean, the archetype of how cowardly this is, the archetype
[02:27:49.352 --> 02:27:54.495]  Of how ridiculous this is.
[02:27:54.495 --> 02:28:04.360]  How did they ever get the left to be so evil?
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:11.204]  I mean, I watch these videos of Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver on these universities, and Owen Troyer as well, who just walked in.
[02:28:11.204 --> 02:28:14.686]  That's Travis, but he just got back as well.
[02:28:18.615 --> 02:28:22.696]  These leftists just come right up and they say, we're going to shut you up.
[02:28:22.696 --> 02:28:24.957]  I'd like to see you in jail.
[02:28:24.957 --> 02:28:25.997]  And our crew are nice to them.
[02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:27.257]  They say, listen, America.
[02:28:27.257 --> 02:28:28.138]  And they go, you know what?
[02:28:28.138 --> 02:28:29.298]  F America.
[02:28:29.298 --> 02:28:30.558]  And F you too.
[02:28:30.558 --> 02:28:31.999]  We've seen the videos.
[02:28:31.999 --> 02:28:33.679]  And we're like, but that's dangerous.
[02:28:33.679 --> 02:28:33.959]  F you.
[02:28:33.959 --> 02:28:34.940]  I'll run things now.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:37.580]  You don't run anything.
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:38.621]  You don't run Jack.
[02:28:38.621 --> 02:28:40.681]  If we wanted to be authoritarian, you'd be done.
[02:28:40.681 --> 02:28:42.442]  And you know it.
[02:28:42.442 --> 02:28:43.422]  And that's the thing is,
[02:28:46.374 --> 02:28:49.217]  You're just really pushing it.
[02:28:49.217 --> 02:28:50.478]  You're really pushing it.
[02:28:50.478 --> 02:28:53.540]  You want that physical confrontation to make your bones?
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.301]  Yeah, you'll find out.
[02:28:55.279 --> 02:28:57.180]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:28:57.180 --> 02:29:00.402]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:29:00.402 --> 02:29:02.002]  Savory and delicious.
[02:29:02.002 --> 02:29:04.844]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:29:04.844 --> 02:29:05.504]  Awesome!
[02:29:05.504 --> 02:29:08.586]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:29:08.586 --> 02:29:10.147]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:32:27.318 --> 02:32:28.979]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[02:32:28.979 --> 02:32:31.840]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:34.881]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[02:32:34.881 --> 02:32:35.641]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[02:32:35.641 --> 02:32:36.401]  Well, you know what?
[02:32:36.401 --> 02:32:37.701]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[02:32:37.701 --> 02:32:39.682]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[02:32:39.682 --> 02:32:40.642]  We decided to change the name.
[02:32:40.642 --> 02:32:41.863]  So when you peel off the label...
[02:32:43.083 --> 02:32:46.785]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[02:32:46.785 --> 02:32:49.587]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.

[02:33:42.435 --> 02:33:44.376]  I'm going to return this Saturday.
[02:33:44.376 --> 02:33:47.419]  Live transmission, I've not announced yet, the time of.
[02:33:47.419 --> 02:33:49.380]  And then Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:50.541]  Central.
[02:33:50.541 --> 02:33:52.783]  Owen Schreier, it's coming up 3 o'clock.
[02:33:52.783 --> 02:33:55.045]  We're going to have Dr. Nick Begich with us next hour.
[02:33:55.045 --> 02:33:56.566]  Your phone call is just a few minutes away.
[02:33:56.566 --> 02:34:01.330]  But let's hit some of the breaking news that just came in seconds ago.
[02:34:02.529 --> 02:34:08.174]  No, I'm not talking about the tactical rabbi helps synagogues defend against anti-Semitic violence.
[02:34:08.174 --> 02:34:10.256]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[02:34:10.256 --> 02:34:14.139]  I'm talking about this breaking news out of the New York Times.
[02:34:14.139 --> 02:34:18.343]  Mueller won't testify next week, says House History Chair reports.
[02:34:18.343 --> 02:34:21.566]  Nadler, aka the Hamburglar, says U.S.
[02:34:21.566 --> 02:34:25.750]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller III will not testify before committee next week.
[02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:29.433]  The Democratic chairman of the House History Committee told reporters on Friday, according to many reports,
[02:34:29.913 --> 02:34:30.893]  Let's translate that for everybody right here.
[02:34:30.893 --> 02:34:31.934]  I'll explain this again.
[02:34:31.934 --> 02:34:33.955]  Everyone keeps building up Bob Barr like he's the Lillie White.
[02:34:33.955 --> 02:34:35.095]  As John Goodman says in The Big Lebowski.
[02:34:58.775 --> 02:35:01.838]  I know a lot of people that I've talked to that worked under Barr.
[02:35:01.838 --> 02:35:07.223]  They say he's a by-the-book guy, and that he's not anti-American.
[02:35:07.223 --> 02:35:09.585]  But let's just not lie to each other.
[02:35:09.585 --> 02:35:13.509]  He helped cover up Iran-Contra, which is fighting a bunch of communists.
[02:35:13.509 --> 02:35:16.111]  So, I mean, overall, that's nothing compared to Clinton's.
[02:35:16.111 --> 02:35:17.272]  And I'm not defending it.
[02:35:17.272 --> 02:35:23.098]  The point is, is that he came in to cover up the attempted coup on Trump, to clean it up, and to get the deep state to stop it.
[02:35:24.016 --> 02:35:25.497]  The Mueller Report does that.
[02:35:25.497 --> 02:35:29.301]  So the fact that Mueller is now refusing to testify shows you that.
[02:35:29.301 --> 02:35:35.527]  If they give out that whole redacted report, it burns the illegal spies, it burns the whole system.
[02:35:35.527 --> 02:35:41.332]  And notice I said that months ago, now they're saying it in the news this week.
[02:35:41.332 --> 02:35:43.394]  So this just shows the Democrats are crazy.
[02:35:44.369 --> 02:35:50.271]  It's like they've got a pea shooter and Trump's got a howitzer cannon and they're not stopping, which shows mental illness.
[02:35:50.271 --> 02:35:54.753]  They're like impeachment and all these investigations when he's got them with illegal spying.
[02:35:54.753 --> 02:35:56.494]  He's got them trying to overturn the election.
[02:35:56.494 --> 02:35:59.695]  He's got them paying off their families with the Fusion GPS money.
[02:35:59.695 --> 02:36:02.456]  He's got them!
[02:36:02.456 --> 02:36:04.577]  He's got them leaking to the media illegally.
[02:36:04.577 --> 02:36:09.979]  He's got them perjuring themselves to Congress, which is illegal.
[02:36:09.979 --> 02:36:11.480]  But they've been in power so long.
[02:36:13.319 --> 02:36:16.720]  That they think they're still invincible because it worked in the past.
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:20.601]  They don't quit.
[02:36:20.601 --> 02:36:23.642]  So that's really your takeaway.
[02:36:23.642 --> 02:36:30.705]  Mueller cancels testimony in desperate bid to protect deep state, not the deep state of Donald Trump.
[02:36:30.705 --> 02:36:36.627]  Donald Trump's barely got any control of the government yet.
[02:36:36.627 --> 02:36:39.388]  Down the road, some of Trump's appointees became a government under themselves.
[02:36:39.388 --> 02:36:39.868]  I'd oppose them.
[02:36:42.082 --> 02:36:46.445]  No, the dug-in government like ticks are trying to pull out of your body.
[02:36:46.445 --> 02:36:51.149]  You ever gone hiking around the woods or camping and you get home and taking a shower and you're like, what's that down there?
[02:36:51.149 --> 02:36:54.431]  And like right down underneath your huevos is a tick.
[02:36:54.431 --> 02:36:56.673]  You're like trying to get that sucker out of there.
[02:36:56.673 --> 02:37:06.460]  And they're burrowed in, they got their heads in, they're holding on like they're riding bucking broncos.
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:09.101]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:37:09.101 --> 02:37:10.302]  An absolutely amazing time.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:15.722]  But the fact that Mueller has canceled his testimony shows the jig is up.
[02:37:15.722 --> 02:37:19.504]  And Trump, you know why Mueller did this, right?
[02:37:19.504 --> 02:37:21.805]  Bob Barr's telling him.
[02:37:21.805 --> 02:37:23.106]  We've got all the FISA stuff.
[02:37:23.106 --> 02:37:25.007]  We've got the FISA Inspector General.
[02:37:25.007 --> 02:37:27.889]  We've got the Justice Department Inspector General.
[02:37:27.889 --> 02:37:32.871]  We've got all the emails, all the text messages, all the perjury to Congress.
[02:37:32.871 --> 02:37:33.872]  We've got all the admissions.
[02:37:35.256 --> 02:37:39.339]  And Trump is going to declassify it if you don't leave him alone.
[02:37:39.339 --> 02:37:42.701]  You're not dealing with your average swamp creature that's scared.
[02:37:42.701 --> 02:37:44.682]  He hasn't done anything.
[02:37:44.682 --> 02:37:46.823]  You don't have anything on him.
[02:37:46.823 --> 02:37:48.564]  He likes confrontation.
[02:37:48.564 --> 02:37:49.305]  Stop it.
[02:37:49.305 --> 02:37:50.986]  Back down for the good of the country.
[02:37:50.986 --> 02:37:51.726]  Quit.
[02:37:51.726 --> 02:37:54.988]  We should have had a president stood up to China and didn't have one side deals.
[02:37:54.988 --> 02:37:57.910]  We should have had a president stood up to Mexico.
[02:37:57.910 --> 02:38:02.232]  You know, man, Colter's thing is, oh my gosh, we've got double the record flooding us.
[02:38:02.232 --> 02:38:02.993]  That's the plan.
[02:38:04.212 --> 02:38:09.857]  That's why the UN is funding the assault on our borders and our ICE.
[02:38:09.857 --> 02:38:10.878]  It's to crush Trump.
[02:38:10.878 --> 02:38:11.759]  It's to crush us.
[02:38:11.759 --> 02:38:12.440]  That's the plan.
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:14.421]  You don't blame Trump for it.
[02:38:14.421 --> 02:38:16.163]  And again, I'm not bashing Ann Coulter.
[02:38:16.163 --> 02:38:16.784]  I get her point.
[02:38:16.784 --> 02:38:17.704]  Get on Trump's ass.
[02:38:17.704 --> 02:38:22.229]  He may declare the real national emergency, and he should.
[02:38:22.229 --> 02:38:23.410]  But I read her articles.
[02:38:23.410 --> 02:38:26.032]  She doesn't really point that out.
[02:38:26.032 --> 02:38:27.694]  She just shows us what a purist she is.
[02:38:29.422 --> 02:38:32.784]  She's there and, you know, Trump, oh yeah, his 3D chess.
[02:38:32.784 --> 02:38:36.346]  Yeah, I told you a lot of times, with Trump, there's no 3D chess.
[02:38:36.346 --> 02:38:38.147]  It's called being pragmatic.
[02:38:38.147 --> 02:38:40.568]  It's called what makes sense and what can he get done.
[02:38:40.568 --> 02:38:42.630]  But he's not out to get you.
[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:43.590]  He likes the country.
[02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:44.711]  He likes himself.
[02:38:44.711 --> 02:38:46.031]  He likes his family.
[02:38:46.031 --> 02:38:50.214]  And he doesn't like a future in America where half the country's burning in race war.
[02:38:50.214 --> 02:38:55.076]  He doesn't like a future in America where everybody's too poor to go to his golf courses.
[02:38:55.076 --> 02:38:56.117]  He is the service economy.
[02:38:58.018 --> 02:39:02.083]  And he wants people to be successful.
[02:39:02.083 --> 02:39:10.672]  That isn't some ass-kissing exercise because the president tweets my stuff or likes to show them.
[02:39:10.672 --> 02:39:16.819]  It's because I've been persecuted for supporting Trump that I support him even more.
[02:39:16.819 --> 02:39:19.422]  Very lowly would be the word for the establishment.
[02:39:21.212 --> 02:39:24.273]  So, take opioids.
[02:39:24.273 --> 02:39:26.294]  Opioid use is now way down.
[02:39:26.294 --> 02:39:29.896]  Just a year and a half after Trump launched his operation against that.
[02:39:29.896 --> 02:39:33.618]  Some numbers are 80%, some numbers are 70%.
[02:39:33.618 --> 02:39:35.559]  Opioid prescription rates tumble.
[02:39:35.559 --> 02:39:39.080]  The latest sign Trump lead crackdown is working.
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:47.544]  There's enough pills prescribed last year to give every adult in the United States 34 pills throughout that year.
[02:39:47.544 --> 02:39:49.305]  But now Trump's cut it massively.
[02:39:50.390 --> 02:39:53.894]  The numbers you look at, 43 to 90 percent doesn't matter.
[02:39:53.894 --> 02:39:57.518]  The point is, Trump's trying.
[02:39:57.518 --> 02:40:02.664]  Instead of just greasing the skids of the collapse of our civilization.
[02:40:02.664 --> 02:40:06.047]  Now let's shift gears to this.
[02:40:06.047 --> 02:40:08.050]  You've got synagogues and churches.
[02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:12.992]  Being targeted by lunatics and Islamists and others.
[02:40:12.992 --> 02:40:25.840]  And I don't care whether you're a mosque in this country, I don't care if you're a synagogue, I don't care if you're a Baptist church, Catholic church, obviously these are targets to let the media hype them for crazy people to go after them.
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:30.484]  And so it's refreshing to even see the LA Times talk about shocking
[02:40:31.769 --> 02:40:42.781]  The tactical rabbi pulling out an AR-15 and teaching people how to defend themselves and saying it's your right and your duty to do it, that is a fundamental shift instead of people just being victims.
[02:40:47.659 --> 02:40:51.180]  It was 45 minutes into the lecture when the rabbi pulled out his AR-15.
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:55.482]  Who thinks by a show of hands that we should be carrying more guns?
[02:40:55.482 --> 02:41:07.886]  Rabbi Rozel Cohen asked the crowd of West Side Shabbat synagogue Wednesday night during an active shooter seminar organized in the wake of the deadly attack.
[02:41:07.886 --> 02:41:10.046]  Half the room raised their hands.
[02:41:10.046 --> 02:41:14.228]  Then it just goes into him explaining to them about guns, good guys versus bad guys, what needs to be done.
[02:41:19.457 --> 02:41:21.058]  All right.
[02:41:21.058 --> 02:41:25.262]  I've got a bunch of news about open borders and diseases spreading in the country that I want to get to.
[02:41:25.262 --> 02:41:26.663]  And I've got your phone calls as well.
[02:41:26.663 --> 02:41:29.966]  And I want to go to those.
[02:41:29.966 --> 02:41:35.251]  And I've got some really important articles here about creepy tech oligarchs want to dictate your opinions.
[02:41:35.251 --> 02:41:36.632]  We're going to hit those and more.
[02:41:36.632 --> 02:41:43.378]  But first, the system doesn't like me because I'm promoting independence and individuals being strong.
[02:41:46.766 --> 02:41:56.214]  But at the end of the day, as society unravels, there's no excuses that stand up to the reality of the fact that we have been prepared.
[02:41:56.214 --> 02:42:03.980]  And I know I've been on the air 24 years, and a lot of people just consider it that we'll always be here, but I'll tell you straight.
[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:12.126]  With all the censorship and all the attacks and all the boycotts and all the lawsuits, the last few months, it's been hard for us to continue on our course here.
[02:42:12.126 --> 02:42:15.329]  And the mere fact that
[02:42:18.112 --> 02:42:23.032]  Ultra 12, after almost 6 months of not having any Vibram B12.
[02:42:25.478 --> 02:42:26.618]  Thank you for your support.
[02:42:55.606 --> 02:43:00.211]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[02:43:00.211 --> 02:43:02.233]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:43:02.233 --> 02:43:03.334]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:03.334 --> 02:43:07.958]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:43:07.958 --> 02:43:09.900]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:14.445]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:43:14.745 --> 02:43:20.712]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[02:43:20.712 --> 02:43:21.512]  I appreciate that.
[02:43:21.512 --> 02:43:23.094]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:43:23.094 --> 02:43:23.695]  Tell us about it.
[02:43:23.695 --> 02:43:24.476]  Well, it's really great.
[02:43:24.476 --> 02:43:26.277]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[02:43:26.277 --> 02:43:27.018]  It tastes good.
[02:43:27.018 --> 02:43:28.880]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:30.842]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:43:30.842 --> 02:43:34.306]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[02:43:34.326 --> 02:43:37.167]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:43:37.167 --> 02:43:38.907]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:43:38.907 --> 02:43:40.988]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:43:40.988 --> 02:43:41.908]  So, yeah.
[02:43:41.908 --> 02:43:44.349]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[02:43:44.349 --> 02:43:47.170]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[02:43:47.170 --> 02:43:48.330]  So, I'm glad you plugged it.

[02:46:59.229 --> 02:47:07.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.213 --> 02:47:07.554]  Remember?
[02:47:12.694 --> 02:47:16.977]  Remember when they told you world government didn't exist?
[02:47:16.977 --> 02:47:20.460]  Remember when they told you?
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:25.283]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:47:25.283 --> 02:47:28.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:28.785 --> 02:47:31.667]  Remember when they told you your cell phones weren't spying on you?
[02:47:31.667 --> 02:47:35.590]  Remember when they told you the Church of Satan wouldn't try to be in your local school?
[02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:38.692]  Remember when they told you the vaccines didn't cause any harm?
[02:47:38.692 --> 02:47:40.053]  Remember when they lied to you?
[02:47:40.053 --> 02:47:42.075]  It's a very small group of people.
[02:47:43.584 --> 02:47:49.306]  The sooner we start waking up and saying no to them, the sooner we start turning this planet around.
[02:47:49.306 --> 02:47:55.147]  Out of all the sites out there, out of all the shows, there's nothing like InfoWars.
[02:47:55.147 --> 02:47:56.068]  There's nothing like NewsWars.
[02:47:56.068 --> 02:47:59.789]  There's nothing like this syndicated radio TV show, other than DrudgeReport.com.
[02:47:59.789 --> 02:48:01.249]  And I wish it was multimedia.
[02:48:01.249 --> 02:48:02.669]  I wish Matt Dredge was on the air every day.
[02:48:02.669 --> 02:48:03.150]  I'd tune in.
[02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:05.230]  That's a smart guy.
[02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:06.551]  But we're here and we're fighting hard.
[02:48:06.551 --> 02:48:09.451]  We're setting the agenda worldwide.
[02:48:09.451 --> 02:48:09.891]  You are.
[02:48:09.891 --> 02:48:10.812]  I am.
[02:48:10.812 --> 02:48:11.432]  All of us together.
[02:48:12.466 --> 02:48:13.807]  We're not on a power trip when we say that.
[02:48:13.807 --> 02:48:15.468]  It's very, very humbling.
[02:48:15.468 --> 02:48:17.209]  But it's the truth.
[02:48:17.209 --> 02:48:19.431]  The voice of the wilderness out of Texas.
[02:48:19.431 --> 02:48:37.324]  Not in New York, not in L.A., not in London, not in Frankfurt or Berlin or Paris or Tokyo or Beijing or Durban or Mexico City or Calcutta.
[02:48:37.324 --> 02:48:40.026]  But here.
[02:48:40.026 --> 02:48:40.907]  And the system doesn't like it.
[02:48:42.691 --> 02:48:48.653]  Because they've tracked that everything they've done, their whole agenda is being opposed now.
[02:48:48.653 --> 02:48:51.133]  The old days they denied it existed.
[02:48:51.133 --> 02:48:53.114]  Now they just say, well, we need people to take them off the air.
[02:48:53.114 --> 02:48:56.475]  They don't want this system.
[02:48:56.475 --> 02:48:58.695]  All right, who's been holding it the longest here?
[02:48:58.695 --> 02:49:00.956]  Oh my gosh, Eric in Colorado.
[02:49:00.956 --> 02:49:02.316]  Eric, thanks for holding.
[02:49:02.316 --> 02:49:03.217]  I really appreciate you.
[02:49:03.217 --> 02:49:03.697]  You're on the air.
[02:49:03.697 --> 02:49:04.817]  Go ahead.
[02:49:04.817 --> 02:49:07.298]  Yeah, I really appreciate you and it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:49:08.297 --> 02:49:09.437]  I do, before I start.
[02:49:09.437 --> 02:49:16.119]  I have three different ideas I wanted to shoot by you, but I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[02:49:16.119 --> 02:49:16.839]  Changed my life.
[02:49:16.839 --> 02:49:19.320]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:34.544]  You know, I do a lot of construction, and when you're using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything I could work on, and I tried your DNA Force a couple weeks later.
[02:49:35.350 --> 02:49:40.192]  I started feeling that numbness going away and tingling coming back.
[02:49:40.192 --> 02:49:42.773]  Now I'm fully used to my hand.
[02:49:42.773 --> 02:49:44.674]  It's great.
[02:49:44.674 --> 02:49:45.695]  I can't thank you enough.
[02:49:46.676 --> 02:49:48.337]  What do you think of the X2?
[02:49:48.337 --> 02:49:49.158]  I love that too.
[02:49:49.158 --> 02:49:51.200]  You know what I have to say, after a few months of being on that,
[02:50:12.955 --> 02:50:15.740]  I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:20.108]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what.
[02:50:20.871 --> 02:50:29.835]  You know, you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't, you know, you can't find the word to say and I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[02:50:29.835 --> 02:50:32.656]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[02:50:32.656 --> 02:50:33.356]  It's electrochemical.
[02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:34.196]  You're absolutely right.
[02:50:34.196 --> 02:50:38.698]  When I forget to take X2 every couple days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[02:50:38.698 --> 02:50:41.599]  Then I feel it and I take it and it really is amazing.
[02:50:41.599 --> 02:50:43.240]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:45.781]  What is your view on solutions of spreading the word?
[02:50:46.610 --> 02:50:56.795]  Well, one thing, you know, this goes along with your shirt promotion where you're talking about, you know, don't California my Texas, don't California my USA and all.
[02:50:56.795 --> 02:51:03.099]  And, you know, right now I'm actually, I'm looking online right now at properties in Texas because I think Patriots need to move to Texas.
[02:51:03.099 --> 02:51:08.842]  There's a book out right now by Lieutenant Colonel Allen West called Old Texas, Old the Nation.
[02:51:08.842 --> 02:51:15.025]  And I feel like maybe you could put a call out to Patriots because, you know what, we love you.
[02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:20.386]  And there's a lot of us out here and, you know... By the way, I like Alan West.
[02:51:20.386 --> 02:51:24.327]  I didn't know he had a book about, Hold Texas, Hold the Nation?
[02:51:24.327 --> 02:51:25.587]  Name of it, yeah.
[02:51:25.587 --> 02:51:25.787]  Wow.
[02:51:25.787 --> 02:51:29.028]  And I feel like if we can't hold Texas, we're going to lose this nation.
[02:51:29.028 --> 02:51:34.469]  And you know, even if you, you know, if you live in a beautiful state like Colorado, maybe I can move back here one day.
[02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.930]  But you know what?
[02:51:34.930 --> 02:51:37.990]  The first thing we got to do is actually hold Texas.
[02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:44.232]  Because if we can't keep that from, if we can't keep it red, keep it from going blue, like you were saying in 2024,
[02:51:45.942 --> 02:51:47.362]  Then we're going to lose this whole thing.
[02:51:47.362 --> 02:51:48.543]  And by the way, let's be clear.
[02:51:48.543 --> 02:51:53.024]  They bring in millions of illegal aliens who aren't even bad people on average, but they're here illegally.
[02:51:53.024 --> 02:51:57.785]  No one's reaching out to them but Democrats that shipped them here and control them with welfare now.
[02:51:57.785 --> 02:52:00.266]  So automatically they're being set up as the voting block.
[02:52:00.266 --> 02:52:01.826]  It is a criminal takeover.
[02:52:01.826 --> 02:52:03.266]  It must be stopped.
[02:52:03.266 --> 02:52:04.467]  I hope we can save Texas.
[02:52:04.467 --> 02:52:11.189]  I tell you, the average Texan thinks everything's okay and they, oh, Texas will never, no, Texas is in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:11.189 --> 02:52:11.709]  And I think so.
[02:52:11.709 --> 02:52:12.789]  And that's why I think like maybe
[02:52:13.816 --> 02:52:17.578]  Maybe you ought to put out a call for Patriots to move there.
[02:52:17.578 --> 02:52:20.258]  The second tier goes right along with what you were saying.
[02:52:20.258 --> 02:52:22.839]  I think there's a multi-tiered thing we should do.
[02:52:22.839 --> 02:52:25.580]  Patriots need to move to Texas, and two, there needs to be an outreach.
[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:33.563]  We need to start reaching out to Spanish-speaking people and try to really say, hey, you want to embrace the American way?
[02:52:33.563 --> 02:52:39.085]  If you want to escape where you came from, you don't want to create it here.
[02:52:39.085 --> 02:52:39.806]  So, you know what?
[02:52:39.806 --> 02:52:41.026]  You need to embrace the American way.
[02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:42.210]  You need to.
[02:52:42.210 --> 02:52:49.833]  And you know, I know lots of Mexicans, lots of Spanish-speaking people, not just Mexicans, but they're some of the hardest-working people I know.
[02:52:49.833 --> 02:52:54.895]  Exactly, but they've got leftists trying to control them and be their boss, like Alexandria Cortez.
[02:52:54.895 --> 02:52:59.877]  The city of Austin has now announced it's adopting her green plan that will bankrupt any city.
[02:52:59.877 --> 02:53:00.397]  Thank you, Eric.
[02:53:00.397 --> 02:53:01.657]  Great points.
[02:53:01.657 --> 02:53:04.998]  Speaking of Alexandria Cortez, Mike in South Carolina is up next.
[02:53:04.998 --> 02:53:05.639]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:53:05.639 --> 02:53:06.059]  Go ahead.
[02:53:06.059 --> 02:53:07.119]  Hello?
[02:53:07.119 --> 02:53:07.839]  Hello?
[02:53:07.839 --> 02:53:08.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:08.980]  Can you hear me?
[02:53:08.980 --> 02:53:09.180]  I can.
[02:53:11.337 --> 02:53:19.661]  I feel like we need to take her and them serious because they're all saying it.
[02:53:19.661 --> 02:53:22.743]  At this point, I take it as a threat.
[02:53:22.743 --> 02:53:25.945]  Sure, I'm having trouble understanding exactly what you're saying.
[02:53:25.945 --> 02:53:27.485]  Maybe your phone's breaking up.
[02:53:27.485 --> 02:53:28.606]  Go ahead and say what you were saying again.
[02:53:32.401 --> 02:53:34.762]  We just dropped, this call just dropped.
[02:53:34.762 --> 02:53:36.443]  Okay, Wendy in Ohio.
[02:53:36.443 --> 02:53:38.044]  Wendy, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:53:38.044 --> 02:53:38.384]  Hello.
[02:53:38.384 --> 02:53:39.345]  Hi.
[02:53:39.345 --> 02:53:41.426]  Hey, hi.
[02:53:41.426 --> 02:53:47.669]  Allegedly, Laura Loomer, investigative journalist, cannot eat or get an Uber.
[02:53:47.669 --> 02:53:50.830]  And today is the day of the Uber IPO.
[02:53:50.830 --> 02:54:01.996]  And so, it's very important for us to remember, outside it, remember that there is a problem with that.
[02:54:02.645 --> 02:54:07.348]  That everybody needs to consider that Uber is not a company of a political organization.
[02:54:07.348 --> 02:54:07.949]  That's right.
[02:54:07.949 --> 02:54:09.850]  Uber lost a billion dollars last year.
[02:54:09.850 --> 02:54:11.311]  It's very monopolistic.
[02:54:11.311 --> 02:54:12.252]  It spies on people.
[02:54:12.252 --> 02:54:13.813]  It sells your data.
[02:54:13.813 --> 02:54:17.836]  And it wants driverless cars to take over for regular people.
[02:54:17.836 --> 02:54:18.796]  And no, it's real.
[02:54:18.796 --> 02:54:21.738]  Laura Loomer and many others can't get Airbnbs.
[02:54:21.738 --> 02:54:23.079]  They can't get Uber Eats.
[02:54:23.079 --> 02:54:26.041]  They're using their database on you to abuse you.
[02:54:26.041 --> 02:54:29.404]  They're another arrogant, out-of-control, leftist group.
[02:54:29.804 --> 02:54:35.546]  And I think everybody should do whatever they can to try to punish Uber.
[02:54:35.546 --> 02:54:36.886]  I got to go.
[02:54:36.886 --> 02:54:38.047]  I'll call back again sometime.
[02:54:38.047 --> 02:54:38.287]  All right.
[02:54:38.287 --> 02:54:40.087]  Thank you so much, Wendy.
[02:54:40.087 --> 02:54:40.347]  All right.
[02:54:40.347 --> 02:54:41.808]  Let's talk to Kat in Arizona.
[02:54:41.808 --> 02:54:42.528]  Kat, you're on the air.
[02:54:42.528 --> 02:54:44.669]  Go ahead.
[02:54:44.669 --> 02:54:45.229]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:45.229 --> 02:54:46.549]  Thanks for all your hard work.
[02:54:46.549 --> 02:54:48.350]  Thank you.
[02:54:48.350 --> 02:54:48.690]  All right.
[02:54:48.690 --> 02:54:52.771]  So I'm just going to say this.
[02:54:52.771 --> 02:54:58.333]  In late 1900s, early 2000s, I was working as a networking engineer in New Hampshire.
[02:54:59.261 --> 02:55:06.505]  At an Air Force Base, and I was chemically doused with a chemical that's now in our water supply.
[02:55:06.505 --> 02:55:08.987]  A guy that called in the other day mentioned it.
[02:55:08.987 --> 02:55:12.609]  It's called PFOS, but they keep changing the name.
[02:55:12.609 --> 02:55:20.873]  The actual original name of it was C8, which gave a lot of people in Ohio cancer during the 40s and 50s.
[02:55:20.873 --> 02:55:21.954]  I don't know if you remember that.
[02:55:21.954 --> 02:55:22.774]  I do.
[02:55:22.774 --> 02:55:27.337]  But the media is covering it up, okay?
[02:55:27.932 --> 02:55:31.514]  You'll see an article every once in a while that they're downplaying it.
[02:55:31.514 --> 02:55:32.955]  I can tell you it's a killer.
[02:55:32.955 --> 02:55:39.098]  It gets into the cells of your body and it attacks your immune system.
[02:55:39.098 --> 02:55:41.620]  Your body cannot break it down.
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:44.461]  Your liver and kidneys do not break this chemical down.
[02:55:44.461 --> 02:55:48.124]  This chemical is extremely dangerous.
[02:55:48.124 --> 02:55:53.887]  I drank it in huge amounts, huge quantities, so I've gotten a lot of diseases and I've been fighting it.
[02:55:54.724 --> 02:56:02.568]  But I just want people to know out there that this is happening and I think this is a eugenics thing because this crosses all barriers.
[02:56:02.568 --> 02:56:06.610]  Crosses religion, crosses race, crosses everything.
[02:56:06.610 --> 02:56:09.992]  How are you contaminated in the military?
[02:56:09.992 --> 02:56:12.153]  Well, I wasn't even a military personnel.
[02:56:12.153 --> 02:56:19.157]  I was a network engineer for a company in New Hampshire and they put this company
[02:56:20.254 --> 02:56:22.495]  On an ex-Superfund site.
[02:56:22.495 --> 02:56:23.695]  Okay, that's the other thing.
[02:56:23.695 --> 02:56:27.716]  They were supposed to wait ten years before they put any companies on there.
[02:56:27.716 --> 02:56:30.717]  They put companies on there after eight years.
[02:56:30.717 --> 02:56:33.237]  I was drinking the water out of the water fountain.
[02:56:33.237 --> 02:56:36.598]  This was in New Hampshire, so I thought, you know, the water tastes pretty good.
[02:56:36.598 --> 02:56:39.619]  Oh yeah, listen, everybody's got to filter their water.
[02:56:39.619 --> 02:56:42.319]  There's Superfund sites and toxic waste everywhere.
[02:56:42.319 --> 02:56:42.839]  Good Lord.
[02:56:42.839 --> 02:56:44.080]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:46.760]  Anything else, Kat?
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:49.301]  No, I just want you to know this has been in the water since the 40s.
[02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:51.962]  So everybody's been exposed to this chemical.
[02:56:51.962 --> 02:56:54.804]  You need to filter your water, and it's getting worse.
[02:56:54.804 --> 02:56:56.746]  If you go online, you can Google it.
[02:56:56.746 --> 02:57:00.509]  It's everywhere, and everybody's getting it, and it'll make you really sick.
[02:57:00.509 --> 02:57:01.210]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:02.151]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:57:02.151 --> 02:57:02.971]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:57:03.902 --> 02:57:11.592]  We're going to come back with a few more calls, and then I'm going to have Dr. Nick Begich, who's always super informative, really smart guy, take over.
[02:57:11.592 --> 02:57:15.877]  Then the weekend's here, Mother's Day, and I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:15.877 --> 02:57:16.638]  Central.
[02:57:16.638 --> 02:57:20.763]  Owen Troyer, in about an hour and three minutes, will be live with The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:57:20.763 --> 02:57:21.004]  Central.
[02:57:22.325 --> 02:57:24.847]  You are the most hardcore focused audience in the world.
[02:57:24.847 --> 02:57:27.448]  You're the people that care to tune in and go past the centrism.
[02:57:27.448 --> 02:57:30.230]  Find the broadcast if you don't tell people about it.
[02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:33.632]  If you don't tell people to go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:57:33.632 --> 02:57:36.994]  If you don't grab the clips and share them, nobody will.
[02:57:36.994 --> 02:57:38.915]  They fear this broadcast because they fear you.
[02:57:38.915 --> 02:57:42.297]  Whatever you do, spread the links now.
[02:57:45.191 --> 02:57:48.794]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.794 --> 02:57:50.556]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.556 --> 02:58:01.845]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.606 --> 02:58:11.751]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.751 --> 02:58:17.755]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.755 --> 02:58:22.858]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.858 --> 02:58:25.099]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.459 --> 02:58:27.181]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.181 --> 02:58:37.192]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.192 --> 02:58:39.835]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.835 --> 02:58:44.540]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:59:49.238 --> 02:59:51.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.275 --> 03:00:10.396]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.396 --> 03:00:11.836]  We've got another Nick Vegas coming up.
[03:00:11.836 --> 03:00:12.697]  It's about six minutes.
[03:00:12.697 --> 03:00:14.818]  Ken in Alabama, thanks for holding.
[03:00:14.818 --> 03:00:15.778]  You're on the air.
[03:00:15.778 --> 03:00:20.280]  This is your second time caller.
[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:21.721]  I've got about three ideas for you.
[03:00:21.721 --> 03:00:22.842]  I know you're short on time.
[03:00:22.842 --> 03:00:25.823]  I'm going to throw them at you real quick and then hang a few comments.
[03:00:25.823 --> 03:00:27.224]  Thank you, sir.
[03:00:27.224 --> 03:00:30.785]  As you say, Fit, maybe some of these ideas are good, maybe they're not.
[03:00:30.785 --> 03:00:33.987]  Number one, what can we do about these tech firms and particularly like Facebook,
[03:00:34.683 --> 03:00:39.284]  Uh, can those who know how to do it, uh, maybe short their, uh, stock and help drive it down?
[03:00:39.284 --> 03:00:45.645]  Or, uh, contrary to that, maybe get a group of people together to buy enough of the shares together to have a block vote?
[03:00:45.645 --> 03:00:50.867]  To have, force a vote to, uh, force, uh, Zuckerberg off the, off the board or whatever?
[03:00:50.867 --> 03:00:56.988]  And, uh, comment, uh, I mean, the idea number two for you is, uh, your graphics department needs to create, uh, flyers and or posters
[03:00:57.561 --> 03:01:01.692]  Uh, that we can download in PDF format and print and distribute.
[03:01:01.692 --> 03:01:06.464]  And I'd recommend that they put a large QR code in the lower right-hand corner.
[03:01:06.932 --> 03:01:08.733]  Well, that's a great idea.
[03:01:08.733 --> 03:01:11.834]  And we've had QR codes before.
[03:01:11.834 --> 03:01:12.855]  We'll do it again.
[03:01:12.855 --> 03:01:20.538]  We do have a page on InfoWars right now that has a bunch of posters people can download or make your own and do it.
[03:01:20.538 --> 03:01:21.658]  But that's a great idea.
[03:01:21.658 --> 03:01:23.679]  60% of Facebook stocks owned by Zuckerberg.
[03:01:34.464 --> 03:01:37.767]  And the company's worth five hundred and sixty seven billion.
[03:01:37.767 --> 03:01:39.268]  So I don't think we'll be able to affect that.
[03:01:39.268 --> 03:01:43.792]  But I think word of mouth exposing and calling for President Trump to break it up.
[03:01:43.792 --> 03:01:47.456]  I think that is the answer under antitrust act.
[03:01:47.456 --> 03:01:50.979]  And I did number three for those of us who are computer savvy.
[03:01:50.979 --> 03:01:57.805]  Could you set up a BitTorrent server for us to download some of the current
[03:01:59.856 --> 03:02:12.363]  I totally agree, and I have a small IT staff and we're not as sophisticated as folks think.
[03:02:12.363 --> 03:02:14.004]  We would like to move into all of that.
[03:02:14.004 --> 03:02:17.366]  We're being forced to because of all the censorship and the de-platforming.
[03:02:17.366 --> 03:02:19.167]  Because I mean, I believe in those platforms.
[03:02:19.167 --> 03:02:25.391]  I just don't believe in things like Bitcoin as a bubble or a tulip bubble as an investment, but I do believe in it as a currency.
[03:02:26.536 --> 03:02:28.757]  Yeah, but BitTorrent is a great technology.
[03:02:28.757 --> 03:02:35.241]  I downloaded one of your videos yesterday on the internet using BitTorrent, your video about terrorism.
[03:02:35.241 --> 03:02:38.102]  Within about three or four hours, I was... No, I agree, sir.
[03:02:38.102 --> 03:02:40.784]  So send us an email at ShowTipsAndInformers.com.
[03:02:40.784 --> 03:02:41.444]  Great caller.
[03:02:41.444 --> 03:02:43.565]  Thank you so much for all those points.
[03:02:43.565 --> 03:02:44.405]  What a smart caller.
[03:02:44.405 --> 03:02:45.686]  Wish I was that smart.
[03:02:45.686 --> 03:02:47.187]  Seriously.
[03:02:47.187 --> 03:02:49.908]  Let's talk to Bill in North Carolina.
[03:02:49.908 --> 03:02:50.609]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[03:02:50.609 --> 03:02:50.929]  Go ahead.
[03:02:52.366 --> 03:02:53.887]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:53.887 --> 03:02:56.908]  Mr. Jones, I just want to talk to you about the free college tuition.
[03:02:56.908 --> 03:02:59.629]  These guys keep pushing.
[03:02:59.629 --> 03:03:06.392]  All that is, is these colleges have been overrun by a bunch of liberal socialist professors.
[03:03:06.392 --> 03:03:09.913]  And all this is, is another way to indoctrinate these kids to get them in.
[03:03:09.913 --> 03:03:12.294]  No, I agree, and that's why they're so violent now.
[03:03:12.294 --> 03:03:18.457]  If they think you're a Trump supporter, you're trying to keep them from their free education, as if they're ever really going to get that.
[03:03:19.571 --> 03:03:20.132]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:20.132 --> 03:03:23.796]  And also I wanted to visit with you about the Second Amendment.
[03:03:23.796 --> 03:03:27.580]  That these guys are continuing trying to do away with the Second Amendment.
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:28.921]  Yes.
[03:03:28.921 --> 03:03:30.282]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:30.282 --> 03:03:38.771]  If they do away, if they disarm, disarmament of the population will be considered an act of war and will be dealt with accordingly.
[03:03:38.771 --> 03:03:39.072]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:40.313 --> 03:03:42.454]  No, I mean, yes, sir, to you, brother.
[03:03:42.454 --> 03:03:44.395]  You, the audience, give me the orders.
[03:03:44.395 --> 03:03:45.356]  You're awesome.
[03:03:45.356 --> 03:03:46.957]  The points you're making are better than the points I make.
[03:03:46.957 --> 03:03:48.277]  You're absolutely right.
[03:03:48.277 --> 03:03:51.259]  The Democrats are everywhere admitting they want our guns.
[03:03:51.259 --> 03:03:53.300]  They want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[03:03:53.300 --> 03:03:55.681]  And then we sit here and act like it's a game.
[03:03:55.681 --> 03:03:57.422]  This is do or die.
[03:03:57.422 --> 03:03:58.643]  This is exponential.
[03:03:58.643 --> 03:03:59.743]  It's happening now.
[03:03:59.743 --> 03:04:01.985]  What do you think we should do, Bill?
[03:04:01.985 --> 03:04:08.008]  Well, sir, if people need, if they don't have some type of protection right now,
[03:04:09.054 --> 03:04:17.536]  Uh, they need to get it, whether it's really expensive or not, because if we have any type of a bump, getting ammunition and firearms will be prohibitive.
[03:04:17.536 --> 03:04:24.457]  Well, there's no doubt, sir, that they told us for decades, the Democrats don't want your guns, even though in every other country they took them.
[03:04:24.457 --> 03:04:28.998]  And now they say, we want to repeal the Second Amendment, we want your guns, we're coming from them.
[03:04:28.998 --> 03:04:31.198]  And there was a big article two days ago about Kellyanne McBrain.
[03:04:31.198 --> 03:04:33.279]  In fact, pull that Kellyanne McBrain article up.
[03:04:33.279 --> 03:04:35.459]  It was like, every Democratic candidate
[03:04:36.099 --> 03:04:38.684]  is for massive gun confiscation was the headline.
[03:04:38.684 --> 03:04:39.866]  We'll try to find that.
[03:04:39.866 --> 03:04:46.777]  I'll come back and show that article, show some clips, and then go to the fellow that's gonna host this hour, or most of this hour.
[03:04:46.777 --> 03:04:47.599]  That's Dr. Nick Baggage.
[03:04:47.599 --> 03:04:48.200]  Thank you, Bill.
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:48.961]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.961 --> 03:04:49.382]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.082 --> 03:05:03.384]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:03.384 --> 03:05:06.245]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:06.245 --> 03:05:12.287]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:12.967 --> 03:05:19.232]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:19.232 --> 03:05:25.497]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:25.497 --> 03:05:32.463]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:33.584 --> 03:05:46.610]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:46.610 --> 03:05:50.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:50.852 --> 03:05:53.553]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:05:57.640 --> 03:05:58.800]  You found it.
[03:05:58.800 --> 03:06:00.802]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:00.802 --> 03:06:03.384]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:03.384 --> 03:06:13.111]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:06:13.111 --> 03:06:17.654]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are.
[03:06:17.654 --> 03:06:19.916]  America is the apple in the globalist's eye.
[03:06:21.333 --> 03:06:23.874]  For all our problems, we've done amazing things.
[03:06:23.874 --> 03:06:28.116]  And if they can take control of us, they believe they have global domination.
[03:06:28.116 --> 03:06:31.818]  Today the United States, tomorrow the world, is their view.
[03:06:31.818 --> 03:06:46.184]  And so, Kellan McBreen a few days ago wrote an article we'll put on screen for TV viewers, dealing with the fact that every major Democrat candidate, there's 20 plus of them, wants gun confiscation nationwide.
[03:06:46.184 --> 03:06:49.145]  Proof every single dim candidate is a danger to the Second Amendment.
[03:06:51.024 --> 03:06:54.506]  Let's go to a video compilation that's from that article.
[03:06:54.506 --> 03:07:03.211]  This is just some of the videos that are in the article, where they're admitting all of this, just to illustrate how serious this is.
[03:07:03.211 --> 03:07:06.052]  These individuals have bodyguards.
[03:07:06.052 --> 03:07:09.274]  These individuals own guns, but they don't want you to have them.
[03:07:09.274 --> 03:07:16.458]  So we become like Mexico, or Democrat cities that have confiscated the guns, or don't allow Second Amendment, like Chicago or D.C.
[03:07:16.458 --> 03:07:19.000]  Here's the report, and then Dr. Nick Baggage takes over.
[03:07:19.858 --> 03:07:23.439]  You know, we have to get these weapons of war off the street.
[03:07:23.439 --> 03:07:26.780]  With a ban on these kind of weapons, they're meant for war.
[03:07:26.780 --> 03:07:33.342]  I think most Americans agree that these weapons of war should not be on our streets.
[03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:35.723]  But would you prosecute people?
[03:07:35.723 --> 03:07:37.384]  Do you support the government buying them back?
[03:07:37.384 --> 03:07:40.765]  And if not, potentially people could go to jail if they don't want to sell them back.
[03:07:40.765 --> 03:07:41.225]  Yes or no?
[03:07:41.625 --> 03:07:50.050]  Again, we should have a law that bans these weapons, and we should have a reasonable period in which people can turn in these weapons.
[03:07:50.050 --> 03:07:56.293]  Right now, we have a nation that allows, in streets and communities like mine, these weapons that should not exist.
[03:07:56.293 --> 03:07:59.675]  What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns?
[03:07:59.675 --> 03:08:00.396]  Do they go to jail?
[03:08:02.042 --> 03:08:07.623]  Well, Jake, they would, but I also offer an alternative, which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range.
[03:08:07.623 --> 03:08:10.604]  I want to do what Australia did and New Zealand just recently did.
[03:08:10.604 --> 03:08:12.625]  I think this issue just needs some bold leadership.
[03:08:12.625 --> 03:08:14.565]  By the way, pause.
[03:08:14.565 --> 03:08:17.566]  Back this up ten seconds, please.
[03:08:17.566 --> 03:08:20.106]  That's all guns at a shooting launch.
[03:08:20.106 --> 03:08:20.987]  That's the end of the Second Amendment.
[03:08:20.987 --> 03:08:22.167]  I mean, they're doing it.
[03:08:22.167 --> 03:08:23.447]  They're coming for your guns.
[03:08:23.447 --> 03:08:24.588]  The New York Times is the headline.
[03:08:24.588 --> 03:08:25.768]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[03:08:25.768 --> 03:08:26.028]  It's here.
[03:08:31.468 --> 03:08:36.873]  What Australia did and New Zealand just recently did, I think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it.
[03:08:36.873 --> 03:08:40.436]  Isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?
[03:08:41.854 --> 03:08:45.296]  You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns.
[03:08:45.296 --> 03:08:51.199]  I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people.
[03:08:51.199 --> 03:08:51.719]  Back it up again.
[03:08:51.719 --> 03:08:58.023]  He wants to set that precedent to take your guns, even though shotguns and handguns are used in most crimes.
[03:08:58.023 --> 03:09:01.745]  He wants you to just acquiesce that something's going to be turned in, that it's everything.
[03:09:01.745 --> 03:09:03.306]  Continue.
[03:09:03.306 --> 03:09:06.808]  Isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?
[03:09:08.203 --> 03:09:11.665]  You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns.
[03:09:11.665 --> 03:09:15.868]  I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people.
[03:09:15.868 --> 03:09:25.294]  I said back in 1988, I do not believe that in America we should be selling or distributing assault weapons designed to kill human beings.
[03:09:25.294 --> 03:09:26.634]  I think they should be banned.
[03:09:26.634 --> 03:09:35.340]  We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons.
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:38.763]  We have a ban on military-style assault weapons.
[03:09:38.763 --> 03:09:41.185]  We adopted universal background checks.
[03:09:41.185 --> 03:09:44.928]  I'm taking the no NRA pledge.
[03:09:44.928 --> 03:09:47.610]  I think that the NRA owns Congress.
[03:09:47.610 --> 03:09:51.494]  That weapons of war do not belong on our streets!
[03:09:53.336 --> 03:09:59.179]  They're going to say, if you give them bump stock, it's going to be a slippery slope.
[03:09:59.179 --> 03:10:00.660]  I certainly hope so.
[03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:03.502]  Well, first of all, the kind of gun being carried, you shouldn't be carrying.
[03:10:03.502 --> 03:10:04.022]  Assault weapons are
[03:10:15.569 --> 03:10:30.021]  I wrote the first, the last serious gun control law that was written, it was law for 10 years, and it outlawed assault weapons, and it outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets, and so you could kill a whole lot of people a lot more quickly.
[03:10:30.021 --> 03:10:34.946]  And we will also insist and ensure that weapons that were designed
[03:10:36.092 --> 03:10:55.550]  And sold to the United States military for the express purpose of killing people as efficiently, as effectively, and as great a number as possible are kept on the battlefields and are no longer sold into our communities because they will end up in our synagogues, in our churches, in our mosques, in our public places.
[03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:58.954]  They will take the lives of those in our lives.
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:09.575]  There are some weapons of war that you simply cannot justify what they've been doing on the streets in Tucson, Maryland.
[03:11:13.425 --> 03:11:20.687]  I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
[03:11:20.687 --> 03:11:25.008]  And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.
[03:11:25.008 --> 03:11:36.552]  And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns.
[03:11:37.094 --> 03:11:43.399]  We outlaw all sorts of military-grade weapons that are deemed too unsafe to have here in America.
[03:11:43.399 --> 03:11:47.502]  Things like grenades and anti-tank rockets and landmines.
[03:11:47.502 --> 03:11:52.646]  Well, these kinds of weapons designed just to kill people should be outlawed as well.
[03:11:52.646 --> 03:12:00.593]  And the truth is, I have a very proud rating of an F by the NRA now, but the truth of this is that the NRA is corrupted.
[03:12:02.285 --> 03:12:10.434]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:12:10.434 --> 03:12:12.897]  And welcome back.
[03:12:12.897 --> 03:12:15.220]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:19.905]  You know, we were just listening to this brief clip on
[03:12:21.129 --> 03:12:26.936]  The Democrats sort of take on managing guns and gun control.
[03:12:26.936 --> 03:12:28.998]  You know, I want to talk about this just a bit.
[03:12:28.998 --> 03:12:35.345]  You know, they want to paint it, and they're using the phrase, weapons of war, right?
[03:12:35.345 --> 03:12:38.889]  As if to distinguish between any other kind of weapon.
[03:12:38.889 --> 03:12:41.231]  And I want to kind of roll back
[03:12:42.290 --> 03:12:45.413]  Couple centuries actually on this issue.
[03:12:45.413 --> 03:12:47.475]  The Revolutionary War, right?
[03:12:47.475 --> 03:12:49.837]  Over 250 years ago, right?
[03:12:49.837 --> 03:12:51.718]  And here was the deal.
[03:12:51.718 --> 03:12:58.865]  You know, we didn't have a Navy and we didn't have a military because we were a bunch of independent colonies trying to organize ourselves.
[03:12:58.865 --> 03:13:01.347]  And the fact is, individuals own
[03:13:02.088 --> 03:13:02.429]  We're good.
[03:13:16.021 --> 03:13:24.287]  Big estates and farms and communities, they all had cannons and mortars and most of them were in private hands actually.
[03:13:24.287 --> 03:13:27.169]  Cannons and mortars, you know, we don't let that happen.
[03:13:27.169 --> 03:13:30.452]  You know, I guess we already got gun control, right?
[03:13:30.452 --> 03:13:32.954]  We don't let people have cannons and mortars.
[03:13:32.954 --> 03:13:37.837]  But think of some of the merchant ships that have been stuck by pirates around the world.
[03:13:37.837 --> 03:13:41.840]  Wouldn't it be nice if they were equipped with a few cannons these days to take care of that problem?
[03:13:42.392 --> 03:13:50.097]  But the point is, we don't allow that anymore, and now they want to confiscate what they call assault weapons, weapons of war.
[03:13:50.097 --> 03:13:55.901]  Well, if it wasn't for the weapons of war in the Revolutionary period, we wouldn't have the country we have to fight about this today.
[03:13:58.802 --> 03:14:02.284]  Maybe a little closer scrutiny about people that have them.
[03:14:02.284 --> 03:14:05.747]  I mean, in our legislature right now, there's a bill pending.
[03:14:05.747 --> 03:14:06.787]  I'm concerned about it.
[03:14:06.787 --> 03:14:16.353]  But it's for anyone who is involuntarily incarcerated in a mental hospital, might be restricted from buying a firearm.
[03:14:16.353 --> 03:14:22.217]  But they too would have an appeal process to go back through and have to spend 50 years or whatever, you know, and reappeal.
[03:14:22.757 --> 03:14:28.960]  But, you know, from my perspective, that's again a slippery slope because then they'll say, well, if you have a mental illness, well, then what's that?
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:29.961]  Who's going to decide that?
[03:14:29.961 --> 03:14:34.483]  Have you ever saw a counselor in your life, a marriage counselor, a counselor with your kids?
[03:14:34.483 --> 03:14:37.004]  Is that going to restrict you at some point?
[03:14:37.004 --> 03:14:38.885]  Perhaps so.
[03:14:38.885 --> 03:14:50.912]  You know, again, slippery slopes take us down the wrong direction, which is what people are concerned about and using this heinous events, you know, of where people have gotten totally crazy.
[03:14:52.375 --> 03:14:57.880]  You know, with assault rifles, but more than that, I mean, most of the violence, gun violence, is not assault rifles.
[03:14:57.880 --> 03:15:02.163]  It's shotguns, pistols, you know, the guns that they're saying they're not going to restrict.
[03:15:02.163 --> 03:15:03.544]  But this is a slippery slope.
[03:15:03.544 --> 03:15:08.889]  You know, in Germany, they're already restricted to gun clubs, but try and get a membership to a gun club.
[03:15:08.889 --> 03:15:15.334]  You go through extensive training for weeks or months or whatever, and then you can go to the gun club, check out your gun, you know?
[03:15:17.096 --> 03:15:18.037]  Pretty ridiculous.
[03:15:18.037 --> 03:15:22.223]  In my part of the world in Alaska, gun ownership is kind of fundamental.
[03:15:22.223 --> 03:15:28.911]  Most people have one or two or three or four in their homes and usually a couple hundred rounds for each one.
[03:15:28.911 --> 03:15:32.576]  So that's kind of standard fare in my part of the world in Alaska.
[03:15:33.317 --> 03:15:35.178]  We're coming into the break in a few seconds.
[03:15:35.178 --> 03:15:42.245]  I'm going to come backward and get into the First Amendment rights, some of the implications in the technocracy of the 21st century.
[03:15:42.245 --> 03:15:43.526]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[03:15:43.526 --> 03:15:47.269]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and we'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:15:53.217 --> 03:15:57.080]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:15:57.080 --> 03:16:02.083]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:16:02.083 --> 03:16:06.906]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[03:16:06.906 --> 03:16:08.247]  Don't just take my word for it.

[03:20:20.608 --> 03:20:22.510]  With Nick Begich.
[03:20:26.124 --> 03:20:30.447]  And welcome back to Impulwars.com in this fourth hour.
[03:20:30.447 --> 03:20:32.809]  This Mother's Day is coming up this weekend.
[03:20:32.809 --> 03:20:45.137]  Mother's Day, I want to shout out for all the moms out there, my own and my fiancée Anne, who is recovering after a surgery this week, and all the mothers out there who
[03:20:46.338 --> 03:21:14.621]  Brought us all into the world so we can do the work that we do and just want to make sure we show our appreciation Make sure you do that this week, and if you haven't done so already You know I'm thinking about you know all of the fundamental issues that are at stake right now You know and when I started reporting on a lot of these issues Technology issues the technocracy as it's now referred to in terms of what government has become the blending And if you look at the Democratic Party, what is it?
[03:21:15.231 --> 03:21:18.433]  Consists of now and, you know, multi-generational history.
[03:21:18.433 --> 03:21:25.738]  My brother Tom did his master's thesis on that and one of his things he was doing in college.
[03:21:25.738 --> 03:21:36.545]  And it was the idea that over generations from one to the next is where you really get a historical context that otherwise is lost by whoever sort of trains up the next generation.
[03:21:36.545 --> 03:21:42.029]  If you can do this successively two, three, four generations as this happened now,
[03:21:43.624 --> 03:21:49.307]  You can really reshape and reframe what becomes history, what is the future.
[03:21:49.307 --> 03:22:10.355]  When you think about the Internet and modern media, the technocracies, tools, these have the greatest impact of all in changing the very character and nature of not just public debate, the town square if you will, but let's think about it in the context of our founding fathers even and what's kind of happened and what's driven it.
[03:22:10.355 --> 03:22:11.056]  And a lot of it
[03:22:12.596 --> 03:22:36.003]  Is, in fact, the military-industrial complex, which later merged with the academics and then the globalists to create something much, much different, but predicated on the same warnings that Thomas Paine, one of our founding fathers in terms of debate, you know, when he wrote Common Sense and the Rights of Man, and I've been reviewing those writings lately,
[03:22:36.563 --> 03:22:46.228]  And one of the things he warned about was military, standing militaries being formed up after and in advance of war, you know, that's when they collected taxes.
[03:22:46.228 --> 03:22:49.670]  We didn't have standing income taxes and we didn't have standing armies.
[03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:59.055]  So they would, governments would have these conflicts, they would create taxation and then an army to go deal with the problems and after the army was done doing its thing,
[03:23:00.107 --> 03:23:05.152]  They never reduced the taxes, they just added to them periodically with a new war.
[03:23:05.152 --> 03:23:14.780]  And if you look at sort of the evolution of our country, not inside of a monarchy, but sort of a technocracy that we've created today, you have the same equation.
[03:23:14.780 --> 03:23:21.806]  Think about the largest portion of the deficits are driven by defense spending, most of which is for
[03:23:22.586 --> 03:23:31.855]  Foreign governments and foreign institutions that have nothing absolutely to do with you and I on a day-to-day basis.
[03:23:31.855 --> 03:23:34.437]  But our deficits are paying for that.
[03:23:34.437 --> 03:23:41.904]  Our billions and billions and trillions of dollars, now trillions, in deficits are paying for all of that.
[03:23:41.904 --> 03:23:47.949]  At the same time, we de-industrialize the West and then suppress the ability to have this discussion.
[03:23:48.937 --> 03:23:50.678]  And that's really what's going on.
[03:23:50.678 --> 03:24:02.607]  It's an attack on the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the foundations of the Republic, when you get right down to it, on the same arguments, the same debate.
[03:24:03.243 --> 03:24:19.394]  The same fundamental human qualities that were being debated 250, 275 years ago when the founding fathers were emerging in their thought processes in terms of what a democracy within a republic might look like and how that might evolve.
[03:24:19.394 --> 03:24:22.517]  And we've been in that experiment now over 250 years.
[03:24:22.517 --> 03:24:30.422]  And there's been changes, you know, we've had constitutional amendments that came after those first 10 Bill of Rights.
[03:24:30.422 --> 03:24:32.644]  But when you think about this again,
[03:24:33.371 --> 03:24:38.313]  Within the technocracy that exists today, ground has to be recaptured.
[03:24:38.313 --> 03:24:41.274]  This president is the only one.
[03:24:41.274 --> 03:24:56.759]  The Democrats are making it institutionally acceptable to attack gun rights and speech rights and press rights and the right of assembly, even when you consider the Internet is the town square.
[03:24:56.759 --> 03:25:00.901]  It's where we assemble in the 21st century to have a dialogue.
[03:25:01.616 --> 03:25:15.184]  And anything that restricts that dialogue is an affront to a constitutional form of government such as ours that has embedded in it freedom of the press, which isn't just about the press getting to restrict and control.
[03:25:15.184 --> 03:25:18.486]  It's not a business amendment.
[03:25:18.486 --> 03:25:20.907]  It's not a business transaction.
[03:25:21.781 --> 03:25:37.028]  The press is a principle, an idea, an ideal that's embedded in who we are, whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, a Libertarian, an Independent, a Green, whatever you are.
[03:25:37.028 --> 03:25:49.273]  Politically, the right to have discourse within the public square is fundamental to being whatever you are and whoever you are within this democratic republic.
[03:25:49.273 --> 03:25:51.094]  That's what's under attack right now.
[03:25:51.863 --> 03:26:00.589]  When you think of personal privacy, as we used to think about the doorway of our home that was protected from intrusion, right?
[03:26:00.589 --> 03:26:10.295]  That no one could kick in your door and occupy your residence and confiscate your goods without due process and the understanding of law.
[03:26:10.295 --> 03:26:18.140]  But your digital doorway, that is more fundamental to your freedom and your liberty and your privacy today than anything ever imagined.
[03:26:18.875 --> 03:26:25.517]  And would have been protected had it been imagined 250 years ago, absolutely protected, and it's not.
[03:26:25.517 --> 03:26:41.403]  We've allowed businesses to exploit it for commercial purposes, in partnership with government who exploits it for other purposes, and then they use the vehicles of government under the Obama administration to further their political lands.
[03:26:41.403 --> 03:26:41.623]  No.
[03:26:42.509 --> 03:26:58.644]  The vehicle of government is not to further anyone's individual or collective political ends, in that sense, without it being fully transparent and exposed to public debate, public discourse, open channels of communication, and absolute free speech.
[03:26:58.644 --> 03:27:00.726]  Absolute free speech.
[03:27:00.726 --> 03:27:05.150]  No restriction, except you have the individual right to change the channel.
[03:27:05.150 --> 03:27:05.451]  That's it.
[03:27:06.221 --> 03:27:07.902]  In terms of weapons of war?
[03:27:07.902 --> 03:27:09.402]  Nonsense.
[03:27:09.402 --> 03:27:13.724]  Kick that back into their league and get a bumper sticker or t-shirt together.
[03:27:13.724 --> 03:27:17.165]  Without cannons and the merchant marines, right?
[03:27:17.165 --> 03:27:23.827]  I mean, if we hadn't had independently owned cannons and mortars, no Revolutionary War would have been won.
[03:27:23.827 --> 03:27:28.909]  We wouldn't have been able to deal with the attacks of our shipping on the open seas.
[03:27:28.909 --> 03:27:34.951]  In fact, it was Payne who proposed issuing special grants to privateers, private
[03:27:36.020 --> 03:27:49.005]  Ship owners, where for every pound of cannonballs and gunpowder and cannons that they had to lose freight, we compensated them for the loss of freight, but we equipped them with some cannons.
[03:27:49.005 --> 03:27:52.246]  You know, that would have been a pretty good expenditure of public money.
[03:27:52.246 --> 03:27:56.327]  You know, merchant ships that we didn't have to pay for, fully equipped with cannons.
[03:27:56.327 --> 03:27:57.608]  Pretty good idea, you know?
[03:27:57.608 --> 03:28:01.589]  Got a lot of ships in the sea in a hurry, and we're already there.
[03:28:01.589 --> 03:28:04.690]  We just said, hey guys, add some more cannons.
[03:28:05.535 --> 03:28:09.280]  You know, and today we're worrying about assault rifles for a few lunatics.
[03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:13.945]  And you know, when you think about gun deaths in the United States, in my community in Alaska, it's not gun deaths.
[03:28:13.945 --> 03:28:16.809]  People get run over by cars.
[03:28:16.809 --> 03:28:20.293]  You know, I think they're out beating gun deaths this year in Anchorage.
[03:28:20.951 --> 03:28:23.392]  But, gun deaths, yeah, they're legitimate, big deal.
[03:28:23.392 --> 03:28:26.774]  You know, 15, 20,000 a year, that's a big number.
[03:28:26.774 --> 03:28:30.255]  Medical malpractice, about a quarter of a million people die of that a year.
[03:28:30.255 --> 03:28:35.798]  No one's confiscating scaffolds and, uh, pills from doctors right now.
[03:28:35.798 --> 03:28:44.502]  But there's over 10 times, 12 times, 15 times gunshot deaths, and there's nothing going on there, except your medical bills are going up.
[03:28:44.502 --> 03:28:45.823]  This is Dr. Nick Feggis.
[03:28:45.823 --> 03:28:49.985]  We're talking about the Bill of Rights and our rights, and we'll be right back on Infoworks.
[03:28:53.211 --> 03:28:55.433]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.

[03:33:13.073 --> 03:33:20.239]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagich.
[03:33:20.239 --> 03:33:28.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.506 --> 03:33:29.407]  And welcome back.
[03:33:29.407 --> 03:33:37.854]  This is Dr. Nick Vagich on this Friday at 4th hour, you know, and actually I'm going to be here on every Friday.
[03:33:37.854 --> 03:33:41.077]  We're going to try and make this a regular Friday 4th hour event.
[03:33:41.737 --> 03:33:47.227]  Unless I'm traveling or something, otherwise you can plan on hearing me every fourth hour on Fridays.
[03:33:49.554 --> 03:33:58.481]  Speech, you know, freedom of speech, you know, under attack when we think about what's happened to this network and now others that's quickly devolving.
[03:33:58.481 --> 03:34:04.425]  But I want to go back in time again because the multi-generational history is a big deal.
[03:34:04.425 --> 03:34:06.646]  And, you know, I'm 60 now.
[03:34:06.646 --> 03:34:12.951]  And, you know, when I think back to the conversation I had with my grandfather, who was born in 1890.
[03:34:12.951 --> 03:34:13.371]  All right.
[03:34:13.371 --> 03:34:15.513]  So that goes back a ways.
[03:34:15.513 --> 03:34:18.475]  You know, you get a perspective of the evolution of technology.
[03:34:19.068 --> 03:34:30.876]  When you get to have a conversation with a guy like that, now he's of course long since passed, but thinking, you know, multi-generational memory and how we look at our politics, we have now over 250 years of history.
[03:34:35.138 --> 03:34:38.041]  From the Founding Fathers to where we are today.
[03:34:38.041 --> 03:34:44.946]  And two and a half centuries plus, you lose a lot in the translation over time.
[03:34:44.946 --> 03:34:58.437]  And that's some of what I think this program has been about, is trying to recapture some of that in the onslaught of a globalist assault that happens, as the late Chuck Carter used to say, for those who remember him as a radio host,
[03:34:59.585 --> 03:35:03.788]  One slice at a time until the bologna is all gone, right?
[03:35:03.788 --> 03:35:07.710]  I mean, it's like the slow boil of the frog.
[03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:16.096]  So the multi-generational perspective is important and young people now invigorated with that knowledge can be a real force.
[03:35:16.896 --> 03:35:37.439]  For change and so, you know part of the you know, it's the analysis of the current events against the backdrop of history and the remembrance of the basic values that drive the country I think again is foundational and yeah, they were a bunch of old white haired white dudes back then and we've evolved as a country and
[03:35:38.399 --> 03:35:44.741]  In terms of our understanding of humanity and freedom and liberty, and we've continued that evolution.
[03:35:44.741 --> 03:35:48.182]  And yeah, things do change and history does change things.
[03:35:48.182 --> 03:36:02.525]  And so we need to make sure we've retained the fundamentals of those basic rights on the backdrop of the scaffolding of modern culture, on the things that create the modern culture, because the foundation still remains the same.
[03:36:03.431 --> 03:36:12.138]  We've continued to build on that foundation and we cannot lose sight of the foundation that holds the whole thing together and that's what's been lost.
[03:36:12.138 --> 03:36:28.612]  This generation particularly, although they say the generation coming behind this current one is one of the most conservative ever, and I think so because it's the backlash to the craziness that people are seeing today and how that's really rubbed against the base of humanity.
[03:36:29.286 --> 03:36:38.933]  Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, privacy as a fundamental were experiments 250 years ago, and they proved to be quite useful.
[03:36:38.933 --> 03:36:46.278]  What has happened is a drift away from the experiment that was working, in fact, past the experiment to success.
[03:36:46.278 --> 03:36:48.300]  And now it's evolving again.
[03:36:48.300 --> 03:36:51.462]  And let me remind people how what was handled in a monarchy.
[03:36:51.462 --> 03:36:53.143]  That's what I want to go back to.
[03:36:53.143 --> 03:36:55.045]  That's what was being resisted back then.
[03:36:55.505 --> 03:37:10.537]  And it was the idea that everybody was on the land, but the land was owned by the monarchy, and they took your productive production, a certain percentage of production from the land, and if you didn't produce enough, they just throw you off in the street, you know, literally, and you die.
[03:37:10.537 --> 03:37:11.317]  And that's what happened.
[03:37:11.317 --> 03:37:11.838]  You died.
[03:37:11.838 --> 03:37:14.820]  You know, during the Irish potato famine, you died.
[03:37:15.802 --> 03:37:18.943]  Frozen to death and the landlords continued to confiscate.
[03:37:18.943 --> 03:37:24.664]  A lot of people left during that famine and that's one of the ways America was actually populated.
[03:37:24.664 --> 03:37:28.224]  My family came a little bit later in the 1880s.
[03:37:28.224 --> 03:37:39.507]  My great-grandfather on my mother's side came here and my great-grandmother also on my mother's side came here from Europe and then on my father's side from Croatia in 1906.
[03:37:42.458 --> 03:37:50.681]  You know, I had the opportunity to go back and visit my grandfather's place of birth with my oldest son, who's now 41.
[03:37:50.681 --> 03:38:00.304]  And that gives you some perspective, because there's nothing changed hardly at all there in, you know, 120 years.
[03:38:00.304 --> 03:38:04.325]  And the same place my grandfather left is still there.
[03:38:04.325 --> 03:38:06.646]  I mean, it's my relatives are still living there.
[03:38:07.673 --> 03:38:22.045]  My grandfather never made it back, and I think about when he came through Ellis Island, and I've got the entry images and all that, and he came through in 1906, but he didn't become a citizen until the 1920s, I believe, before that was finalized.
[03:38:22.045 --> 03:38:29.111]  And, you know, when you think about that whole migration period and what's happened, that was before income tax.
[03:38:29.111 --> 03:38:32.153]  They were leaving, you know, a rough way of being in the
[03:38:33.741 --> 03:38:35.802]  West, so-called West.
[03:38:35.802 --> 03:38:36.742]  Liberty wasn't there.
[03:38:36.742 --> 03:38:39.603]  Freedom wasn't there, even in 1906.
[03:38:39.603 --> 03:38:56.310]  Going back to the Founding Fathers, the monarchy maintained control of the land and the church at the time essentially kept you stupid because they thought you needed some intermediary between you and God, which, I got a newsflash, you don't.
[03:38:56.310 --> 03:38:59.131]  It's okay if that's what you want to do, but you don't.
[03:38:59.771 --> 03:39:00.911]  I need an intermediary.
[03:39:00.911 --> 03:39:11.453]  And so, when you look at what was happening, when income tax came in, it was another way to tax the labor of human beings, something that was unconstitutional, ruled by the U.S.
[03:39:11.453 --> 03:39:21.015]  Supreme Court in the 1890s, that income tax, taxing human labor was involuntary servitude, not allowed in the United States.
[03:39:21.015 --> 03:39:25.356]  And what we saw evolve was something that only affected, not even the middle class,
[03:39:26.056 --> 03:39:29.198]  Or the lower class, the massive of the country, were not affected.
[03:39:29.198 --> 03:39:34.540]  Only the rich at the time, and the very rich at the time, paid an income tax.
[03:39:34.540 --> 03:39:46.967]  And that, of course, we saw the erosion of that over time to where now corporations pay the least amount and individuals pay the most amount, taxing up to a third of your labor or more as an individual at the national level.
[03:39:46.967 --> 03:39:48.588]  And then at the state level, another bite.
[03:39:48.588 --> 03:39:50.949]  And then excise taxes and all the roll up on that.
[03:39:50.949 --> 03:39:54.971]  Another bite, another bite, until they're probably grabbing about 80% of your productive labor.
[03:39:55.932 --> 03:39:58.293]  So are you free?
[03:39:58.293 --> 03:40:01.974]  Or have we evolved into a new form of surf?
[03:40:01.974 --> 03:40:07.235]  In fact, most of our land has property tax at the local and state level in most communities in the country.
[03:40:07.235 --> 03:40:10.016]  So you don't even own your land, you have a partnership.
[03:40:10.016 --> 03:40:12.237]  You have a partnership with the state.
[03:40:12.237 --> 03:40:15.578]  And you have a partnership with the bank, because most people don't own anything anymore.
[03:40:15.578 --> 03:40:22.320]  You used to be able to own a home, said you could go out, put stakes in the ground, grab the four corners, survey it, mark it off, and
[03:40:23.067 --> 03:40:27.570]  You know, create a farm there and clear it, and at the end of the day, you'd own it.
[03:40:27.570 --> 03:40:30.092]  So you actually did own your property mortgage.
[03:40:30.092 --> 03:40:31.333]  There's no such thing as mortgage.
[03:40:31.333 --> 03:40:37.237]  That's a modern thing, you know, in terms of how those evolved, in terms of average people having them.
[03:40:37.237 --> 03:40:38.958]  A credit as such has evolved.
[03:40:38.958 --> 03:40:43.041]  That's a banker's trick, happened way after income taxes.
[03:40:43.041 --> 03:40:45.062]  Easy credit, installment credit, none of that.
[03:40:45.062 --> 03:40:49.485]  That evolved in this last century, you know, like less than a hundred years ago, even.
[03:40:50.298 --> 03:40:53.110]  But these are systems that recreate the slave state.
[03:40:53.849 --> 03:40:54.229]  Right?
[03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:56.450]  I mean, really, if you think about it.
[03:40:56.450 --> 03:41:01.931]  And then to limit your privacy by attacking you digitally, which is what's happened.
[03:41:01.931 --> 03:41:10.833]  The kick in your digital doorway has happened, and that's where now, because digital information is the domain of commerce, nobody wants to interfere.
[03:41:10.833 --> 03:41:12.453]  It's not the domain of commerce anymore.
[03:41:12.453 --> 03:41:13.873]  It's the domain of privacy.
[03:41:13.873 --> 03:41:15.754]  It belongs to us individually.
[03:41:15.754 --> 03:41:20.775]  It should not be used or exploited in any way, collected for sales, political, or any other reason.
[03:41:21.295 --> 03:41:23.437]  It ought to be deleted.
[03:41:23.437 --> 03:41:23.897]  Boop!
[03:41:23.897 --> 03:41:24.437]  Delete!
[03:41:24.437 --> 03:41:30.322]  Not related to you at all in any way, shape, or form, or any legal to do so on every level.
[03:41:30.322 --> 03:41:48.955]  You know, we need to rethink this digital world that we've created because in fact it is the foundation of freedom today and speech today and the very essence of who we are as liberal, liberated, in the old sense, liberated people.
[03:41:49.927 --> 03:41:51.848]  That's what it used to mean.
[03:41:51.848 --> 03:42:01.774]  Liberated, free of restriction and undue regulation and undue intrusion by government into our lives.
[03:42:01.774 --> 03:42:03.715]  It used to fit two volumes.
[03:42:03.715 --> 03:42:15.142]  You could carry the entire law library under your arm and now it fills up three or four floors of a big building and nobody knows what the law says or what the regulations mean.
[03:42:15.142 --> 03:42:15.983]  It's just a big
[03:42:16.889 --> 03:42:23.915]  Hijacking of the Republic, one slice at a time, until the baloney's all gone.
[03:42:23.915 --> 03:42:26.037]  And now we need to call it like it is.
[03:42:26.037 --> 03:42:33.144]  We need to demand that this president do what he said and what he has started doing like no other has ever done.
[03:42:33.144 --> 03:42:34.365]  Disrupt it!
[03:42:35.356 --> 03:42:39.278]  Shake the core of the status quo that has failed us.
[03:42:39.278 --> 03:42:42.640]  That has failed the nation and failed our values.
[03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:49.645]  No matter what political party or persuasion we come from, we are being robbed of our democracy and robbed of this republic.
[03:42:49.645 --> 03:42:50.865]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:42:50.865 --> 03:42:51.646]  We'll be right back.

[03:43:09.893 --> 03:43:11.653]  How can I solve that problem?

[03:45:57.308 --> 03:45:58.891]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[03:45:58.891 --> 03:45:59.992]  Most expensive.
[03:45:59.992 --> 03:46:01.034]  Vitamin B12.
[03:46:01.034 --> 03:46:02.015]  Methylcobalamin.
[03:46:02.015 --> 03:46:03.738]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[03:46:03.738 --> 03:46:05.260]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[03:46:05.260 --> 03:46:08.845]  B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[03:46:08.845 --> 03:46:09.566]  Just like oxygen.
[03:46:09.566 --> 03:46:10.147]  Just like water.

[03:46:38.115 --> 03:46:38.555]  Showmation.
[03:46:38.735 --> 03:46:40.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:09.913 --> 03:47:16.766]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.766 --> 03:47:19.411]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:47:26.329 --> 03:47:31.652]  And welcome back in the last segment of this fourth hour on May 10th, 2019.
[03:47:31.652 --> 03:47:47.261]  And we've been talking about really the fundamental rights in the context of the technocracy, something that I started reporting on now 25 years ago, as I saw it kind of evolving and what it was going to do.
[03:47:47.261 --> 03:47:54.065]  And when I go back even to my teens, my late teens, I was talking to a lot of people about what I saw then.
[03:47:54.065 --> 03:47:54.826]  This would have been the 19.
[03:47:56.186 --> 03:48:10.972]  Seventies and what I was seeing then was this whole concept that transportation information and communication systems at that time were going to be the big revolutionary trendsetters in terms of technology and if you think about it.
[03:48:11.818 --> 03:48:23.029]  After that is where we got Federal Express, UPS, the whole idea of the spoke and hub idea of shipping and express shipping got evolved.
[03:48:23.029 --> 03:48:28.295]  Literally, Alaska has shipping hubs for FedEx and UPS for their international shipping.
[03:48:28.295 --> 03:48:29.296]  If you look on a globe,
[03:48:29.836 --> 03:48:35.819]  Which makes sense, you'll see why, because of where we sit relative to Europe, Asia and the North and South America.
[03:48:35.819 --> 03:48:39.861]  Easy to transit this hub for the entire Northern Hemisphere for sure.
[03:48:39.861 --> 03:48:41.182]  So when you think about...
[03:48:42.580 --> 03:48:43.821]  Kind of technology.
[03:48:43.821 --> 03:48:45.902]  And then you look at communications, obviously.
[03:48:45.902 --> 03:48:47.784]  Now we can make calls anywhere in the U.S.
[03:48:47.784 --> 03:48:48.725]  for virtually nothing.
[03:48:48.725 --> 03:48:51.066]  You know, it's all hooked into our cell phones.
[03:48:51.066 --> 03:48:55.730]  Internationally, we can use Skype or WhatsApp or any number of things that will get us around the world.
[03:48:55.730 --> 03:49:01.774]  Basically nothing, you know, free, free communication on a level that's never been unbelievable.
[03:49:01.774 --> 03:49:07.939]  I mean, my grandfather, again, talking multi-generational memory, was here when radio was invented, OK?
[03:49:07.939 --> 03:49:09.800]  I mean, he was a kid when radio was invented.
[03:49:10.996 --> 03:49:12.297]  Phones weren't in standard use.
[03:49:12.297 --> 03:49:16.720]  They were kind of a unique thing when he was born in 1890.
[03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:30.749]  But you think of the whole evolution of transportation, communication, information systems, stuff I was talking about, and you look at the next 50 years from the 70s to where we are and where we're headed, unbelievable difference.
[03:49:30.749 --> 03:49:34.811]  So when you think about technology, technology doubles.
[03:49:34.811 --> 03:49:35.892]  From where we are today,
[03:49:36.932 --> 03:49:46.118]  From the invention of the wheel to where we are today, that span of human inventiveness will double in six to nine months.
[03:49:46.118 --> 03:49:48.240]  And it does that every six to nine months.
[03:49:48.240 --> 03:49:53.424]  Because now you have all these technologies feeding on one another and everything is accelerated.
[03:49:53.424 --> 03:49:58.267]  And when you dump quantum computing on this, which is coming, and AI, which is coming,
[03:49:58.846 --> 03:50:05.810]  Which is, again, going to reshape the whole discussion of what liberty and freedom within a democratic republic is going to look like.
[03:50:05.810 --> 03:50:24.101]  This generation, right now, those that remember the values and those that know the technology, the young and the old, which is why now, more than ever, the recognition of multi-generational knowledge needs to be expressed and shared between grandparents and grandchildren.
[03:50:24.748 --> 03:50:27.650]  You know, we need to get the gap filled.
[03:50:27.650 --> 03:50:34.234]  A lot of grandparents are retired, share strong values, have an opportunity to reach out.
[03:50:34.234 --> 03:50:37.876]  Communicate with your grandchildren through the vehicles that exist today.
[03:50:37.876 --> 03:50:39.077]  Use these tools.
[03:50:39.077 --> 03:50:42.599]  Skype, internet, whatever you can if you can't be with them in present.
[03:50:43.277 --> 03:50:44.558]  Be with them.
[03:50:44.558 --> 03:50:45.579]  Share the values.
[03:50:45.579 --> 03:50:46.840]  Pass them on.
[03:50:46.840 --> 03:50:50.182]  Because this is the way the next generation will be shaped.
[03:50:50.182 --> 03:50:52.764]  Gee, they're going to be on the backdrop of that.
[03:50:52.764 --> 03:50:55.706]  Think about what's happened within the household, within the family.
[03:50:55.706 --> 03:50:58.688]  Again, an erosion within a republic.
[03:50:58.688 --> 03:51:01.470]  When you have no one training kids, the state is.
[03:51:01.470 --> 03:51:02.691]  Or daycare center is.
[03:51:02.691 --> 03:51:05.893]  It's giving them their agenda, not your agenda.
[03:51:05.893 --> 03:51:11.197]  Grandparents who have time can engage their grandchildren in ways that parents can't.
[03:51:11.960 --> 03:51:15.424]  Take them for the summer on a trip for a month.
[03:51:15.424 --> 03:51:17.827]  Go do something with your grandkids.
[03:51:17.827 --> 03:51:28.618]  We have a chance to get close to them and influence them with your stories, your narrative, your thinking, your experiences, and pass them on in a context of values.
[03:51:28.618 --> 03:51:31.922]  Kids love it, man, and we don't do it enough.
[03:51:32.402 --> 03:51:34.986]  Uh, and it's something the kids are crying for.
[03:51:34.986 --> 03:51:41.995]  That kind of, uh, I'll return the electronics off, and they'll fight like crazy as they go through the electronic withdrawals.
[03:51:41.995 --> 03:51:43.176]  Because it is!
[03:51:43.176 --> 03:51:50.266]  Because what's happening with the electronics, they get a, uh, releases of biochemicals within the brain.
[03:51:50.806 --> 03:52:06.909]  That excite them, that stimulate them, the same centers of the brain that are attached to orgasm, drug addiction, alcoholism, you know, these things that create the reoccurring habits that are irresistible is what's being imposed on children today.
[03:52:06.909 --> 03:52:08.910]  So extracting them.
[03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:12.050]  And then you do the programming.
[03:52:12.050 --> 03:52:13.691]  Take over as chief programmer.
[03:52:13.691 --> 03:52:19.172]  That's why I joke about it with my youngest, who's 12, I'm their chief programmer, because what I say matters.
[03:52:20.006 --> 03:52:21.547]  To her.
[03:52:21.547 --> 03:52:23.728]  What you say to your children matters to them.
[03:52:23.728 --> 03:52:33.472]  The values you convey, and these fundamental values, should be delivered in a way where they get the depth of the understanding and the heart of it.
[03:52:33.472 --> 03:52:38.134]  The heart of what it means to be an American is only going to be conveyed by you.
[03:52:38.134 --> 03:52:42.976]  Because the institutions of education from K through 12 are not doing it anymore.
[03:52:42.976 --> 03:52:44.757]  They're doing the opposite.
[03:52:44.757 --> 03:52:48.719]  They're giving a squishy, socialistic, collectivism
[03:52:49.857 --> 03:52:53.340]  Uh, for the new 21st century slave.
[03:52:53.340 --> 03:52:56.822]  This is not what we are about.
[03:52:56.822 --> 03:53:02.787]  Um, when you think about basic freedoms, even the Bill of Rights isn't even taught in school.
[03:53:02.787 --> 03:53:09.732]  You know, I mean, it's like the last course in a high school program is government class first semester.
[03:53:09.732 --> 03:53:10.993]  What do you learn by then?
[03:53:10.993 --> 03:53:11.373]  Nothing.
[03:53:12.395 --> 03:53:24.681]  In a semester, you should be knowing about government from K through 12 every year, something that teaches you not just about a bunch of historical footnotes, but how do you engage your government?
[03:53:24.681 --> 03:53:26.122]  How do you participate in government?
[03:53:26.122 --> 03:53:28.203]  What does it mean to have free speech?
[03:53:28.203 --> 03:53:30.524]  What does it mean to have freedom of the press?
[03:53:30.524 --> 03:53:34.626]  What are the Bill of Rights and should we be able to articulate them as children?
[03:53:34.626 --> 03:53:37.328]  And the answer is yes, we should.
[03:53:38.267 --> 03:53:49.150]  Foundationally, from elementary school, middle school, high school, not on the last semester of high school to fill out some check the box.
[03:53:49.150 --> 03:53:51.291]  No, it's foundational to who we are.
[03:53:51.291 --> 03:53:57.733]  That box should have been checked long before your last year of high school and you ought to be participating by then if you're 18 years old.
[03:53:59.421 --> 03:54:04.185]  In your precinct caucuses, in your district caucuses, if you're in a political party.
[03:54:04.185 --> 03:54:07.727]  And so you can take over your political party if you're listening to this broadcast.
[03:54:07.727 --> 03:54:10.149]  You know, that's how simple as it is.
[03:54:10.149 --> 03:54:22.638]  If you show up to your precinct caucuses, nobody does, Democrats or Republicans, or Libertarians for that matter, show up, find out where they're at, and then show up for the district caucuses after.
[03:54:22.638 --> 03:54:25.440]  And if you show up en masse, you take over.
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:28.302]  En masse, like on the district level, might be 10 people.
[03:54:29.182 --> 03:54:37.428]  You know, and I've seen even less that can take over a district precinct caucus, find out when their elections are, and then crash the party and organize it.
[03:54:37.428 --> 03:54:38.308]  You can do these things.
[03:54:38.308 --> 03:54:49.897]  You know, the moral majority did that back in the 80s, you know, and they organized at the precinct level and the district level, and they took over the Republican Party and held it for quite a while.
[03:54:49.897 --> 03:54:53.039]  I don't believe in religious control of political parties, even
[03:54:54.540 --> 03:54:57.303]  Any more than I believe in a monarchy controlling them.
[03:54:57.303 --> 03:55:04.851]  But the idea that individuals can control them with similar political values, I think is the whole point of it, isn't it?
[03:55:04.851 --> 03:55:08.395]  And if they don't represent your values, then either get out of those parties or take over.
[03:55:08.395 --> 03:55:10.477]  You know?
[03:55:10.477 --> 03:55:12.339]  I mean, it's one of the two.
[03:55:12.339 --> 03:55:16.163]  Don't stay and talk about how crummy they are, either take over or get out.
[03:55:17.589 --> 03:55:18.890]  Or, you know, Trump took over.
[03:55:18.890 --> 03:55:31.775]  He beat everybody and changed the Republican Party into the party of what it is today, which is, you know, way different than what the globalists had in mind when they took control of it and what they have in mind owning the Democrats still.
[03:55:31.775 --> 03:55:36.137]  And they're doing everything they can to strip you of your freedom.
[03:55:36.903 --> 03:55:41.024]  And your speech, most importantly, two years out in front of the next election.
[03:55:41.024 --> 03:55:43.045]  Donald Trump, get on board, man.
[03:55:43.045 --> 03:55:44.605]  Reclaim the public space.
[03:55:44.605 --> 03:55:46.186]  We want to have our discussion.
[03:55:46.186 --> 03:55:59.610]  Whether you're running or not, at least defend our right to have that discussion now and in the future by coming down on these big tech companies, breaking up the monopoly power that they control, and changing the course of history.
[03:56:00.316 --> 03:56:10.980]  You know, this hour I haven't plugged and I need to plug a little bit for the network and I want to encourage people to go to the InfoStor.
[03:56:10.980 --> 03:56:14.641]  InfoStor.com supports this network.
[03:56:14.641 --> 03:56:21.883]  I volunteer my time when I come up, so I'm not on the payroll here or anything like that, because I believe in what we're doing.
[03:56:21.883 --> 03:56:23.884]  I believe in the education that we're providing.
[03:56:24.764 --> 03:56:26.525]  And it's important.
[03:56:26.525 --> 03:56:36.127]  Three or four times a year, I come down for a week and do some more intense stuff with the guys here because I believe in the network and what we're accomplishing, but we need your support.
[03:56:36.127 --> 03:56:39.968]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:39.968 --> 03:56:43.749]  We always have specials going, but the products are the best.
[03:56:45.561 --> 03:56:47.223]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:56:47.223 --> 03:56:48.845]  My books and videos are there.
[03:56:48.845 --> 03:56:50.867]  Supplements are all there.
[03:56:50.867 --> 03:56:52.809]  Go there and support the network.
[03:56:52.809 --> 03:56:56.112]  That takes care of the guys that allow this production to happen.
[03:56:56.112 --> 03:57:03.259]  And there's a great group behind those of us that have a face on the screen or a voice on the airwaves that make this all work.
[03:57:04.080 --> 03:57:10.802]  Oh, and we appreciate when you support the InfoWars and the war we're in because it really is about information.
[03:57:10.802 --> 03:57:21.506]  You know, when we've been going through the show today talking about the basic fundamental rights that are being stripped away by the technocracy, by those that would attack our freedoms, strip us of our liberties.
[03:57:22.146 --> 03:57:25.469]  And take away our guns so we can never get them back.
[03:57:25.469 --> 03:57:26.629]  Now is the time.
[03:57:26.629 --> 03:57:27.470]  This is the call.
[03:57:27.470 --> 03:57:28.671]  You're the tip of the spear.
[03:57:28.671 --> 03:57:34.855]  And this is Dr. Nick Begich in this fourth hour on a Friday afternoon in my part of the world.
[03:57:34.855 --> 03:57:36.617]  And we'll be back next Friday.
[03:57:36.617 --> 03:57:37.818]  Thank you for being here.
[03:57:37.818 --> 03:57:38.698]  Have a great weekend.
[03:57:38.698 --> 03:57:40.319]  Remember your mothers.
[03:57:40.319 --> 03:57:41.700]  It's Mother's Day.
[03:57:41.700 --> 03:57:43.782]  Remember your mothers and your wives.
[03:57:52.577 --> 03:58:01.579]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:58:01.579 --> 03:58:11.640]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:58:11.640 --> 03:58:20.182]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:58:21.022 --> 03:58:22.363]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:58:22.363 --> 03:58:23.524]  You must experience it.
[03:58:23.524 --> 03:58:25.465]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:58:25.465 --> 03:58:30.528]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:58:30.528 --> 03:58:32.049]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:58:32.049 --> 03:58:33.530]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:58:33.530 --> 03:58:40.215]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
