[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:27.280]  Texas alex Jones welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for
[00:27.280 --> 00:35.480]  joining us I am absolutely chomping at the bit to reveal to you the incredible
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.680]  earth-changing events that are happening right now there are times in
[00:40.680 --> 00:44.360]  history when more happens in just a few years that happened politically in the
[00:44.360 --> 00:48.720]  last hundred and we aren't at the cusp of that right now all of the
[00:48.720 --> 00:57.320]  acceleration of change all of the political turmoil and economic turmoil
[00:57.320 --> 01:02.600]  we've seen the wars the invasions the destabilizations the police state
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.600]  surveillance grid all of that is in preparation for the time we are now
[01:08.600 --> 01:16.080]  entering open world government as the solution to all of our problems but not
[01:16.080 --> 01:22.440]  just a world government a private bank of the world you'll pay your VAT your
[01:22.440 --> 01:28.040]  global sales taxes your carbon taxes to that will surveil and standardize a
[01:28.040 --> 01:33.800]  cashless society system now I didn't get this out of the Bible I got this out of
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.640]  globalist think tanks from decades ago that are public and I've made films and
[01:38.640 --> 01:43.640]  written articles but the last three years time magazine financial times of
[01:43.640 --> 01:48.840]  London you name it have shed the answer is a private world government run by a
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.600]  private World Bank the very bankers that engineered the global financial crisis
[01:53.600 --> 01:57.720]  I told you the crisis was coming I told you it would be derivatives based 12
[01:57.720 --> 02:02.000]  years ago I told you the answer would be world government I'm not only right
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.600]  about the world government coming or the exact type of world government I
[02:05.600 --> 02:11.520]  specifically told you how it would be triggered but not because I'm smart not
[02:11.520 --> 02:18.760]  because I have a crystal ball but because I do my research as a man when I
[02:18.760 --> 02:23.680]  study history and then I see the same systems of tyranny being set up with a
[02:23.680 --> 02:33.880]  modern overlay and then I see the system building surveillance weapon systems
[02:33.880 --> 02:40.360]  classical spying systems and pointing the system at the people and telling us
[02:40.360 --> 02:47.480]  it's for foreign adversaries that are actually funded by the globalist I have
[02:47.480 --> 02:55.160]  a right but not just a right I have a absolute duty to warn if I know a
[02:55.160 --> 02:58.840]  wildfires coming through the through the forest towards a neighborhood and I'm
[02:58.840 --> 03:02.160]  driving down the road I don't start warning people or call the police I am
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.320]  culpable if I see people have a horrible car wreck and and I I'm the first to see
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.880]  it I don't stop and render aid I'm culpable I see all this happening I
[03:12.880 --> 03:20.760]  don't frankly at a flesh level at a at a cynical fallen creature level like
[03:20.760 --> 03:25.080]  having to warn you and put myself in the danger zone but quite frankly I've
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.040]  done this so long now I actually enjoy being persecuted and I it's it's it
[03:31.040 --> 03:38.160]  always turns into good but the point is that and I don't enjoy the
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.080]  persecution while it's happening but I always it always gets turned against the
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.280]  enemy in the end and and it's that doing the right thing and going through what
[03:47.280 --> 03:53.440]  has to come that's what's going to save this society and this species and I am

[08:35.960 --> 08:43.440]  the next three hours every week I come in here and cannot believe the magnitude
[08:43.440 --> 08:52.160]  of news and information and developments and just how stunningly crystal accurate
[08:52.160 --> 09:00.880]  we have been in the last 16 plus years on air and how everything that we said
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.800]  would unfold to this point has now transpired if we've been inaccurate it's
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.160]  underestimating the true magnitude of wickedness evil duplicity corruption the
[09:12.160 --> 09:18.400]  scientifically crafted nature of this false reality this matrix like system
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.840]  you can see it when the major corporations and governments simultaneously
[09:22.840 --> 09:29.160]  roll out new propaganda campaigns new technology systems new control grids new
[09:29.160 --> 09:39.160]  cashless systems it is completely and absolutely coordinated all right let me
[09:39.160 --> 09:52.240]  call myself here and just go through some of this news here today okay let me
[09:52.240 --> 09:59.480]  just call myself and go over the news
[09:59.480 --> 10:10.160]  we are seeing something happen in Europe right now that is more than 50 years in
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.520]  the making and design we have the founding documents in the Treaty of Rome
[10:14.520 --> 10:25.280]  1957 54 years ago where the Economic Union was meant to set up a super state
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.360]  that would then destroy the sovereignty of the sub-states just as our federal
[10:30.360 --> 10:38.360]  government is now liquefying and removing any real state powers then that
[10:38.360 --> 10:42.480]  super state and the North American and the Asian super state will transfer
[10:42.480 --> 10:49.000]  their power into the Bank of the World this is in the declassified public
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.080]  trilateral Commission documents 1975 that we've published at info wars.com and
[10:54.080 --> 11:00.760]  linked to many articles it's in the Club of Rome published documents it's in the
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.720]  minutes of the UN the Euro Bilderberg members have given interviews we've
[11:05.720 --> 11:11.040]  covered it all at nauseam the last three four years you've seen articles like
[11:11.040 --> 11:14.440]  this one I'm gonna put on screen for prison planet TV viewers titled and now
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.200]  for world government the foreign editor of the Financial Times of London where
[11:19.200 --> 11:30.760]  he says yes it's authoritarian yes we kept it secret from you yes this world
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.840]  government will be a private bank that runs your life that you pay your taxes
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.800]  to and again if you guys can pull up that Financial Times of London article and
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.960]  now for world government is the headline we'll put that up for people on
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.360]  screen but radio listeners can just search that term there it is and he
[11:45.360 --> 11:51.400]  admits world government it's good it's been built in secret it's authoritarian
[11:51.400 --> 12:00.080]  and now they're launching it okay now time magazine about a month later came
[12:00.080 --> 12:03.640]  out this is a couple years ago with Bank of the World it'll fix your problems
[12:03.640 --> 12:12.720]  during the financial crisis of October 08 all engineered they create the system
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.680]  they create the crisis and I know you know this but it's one thing to know
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.440]  that they're gonna do this it's nothing we're now there they're plunging the
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.400]  euro they're plunging the euro markets just as they did the dollar and our
[12:25.400 --> 12:33.600]  markets in October of 08 until those countries vote as those politicians and
[12:33.600 --> 12:37.440]  their constituents watch the German people said we're not gonna give what's
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.040]  left of our sovereignty over the euro we're not gonna give unlimited capital
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.720]  that we've developed our money our pension funds that's what this is backed
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.760]  up with by the way to you and they said you know what you're not going to get
[12:50.760 --> 12:54.480]  him anyways because the stock markets totally rigged they are dropping it
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.520]  down to nothing over there until the Germans capitulate and then the
[12:58.520 --> 13:01.760]  globalists can just steal their money incrementally do you know what's in the
[13:01.760 --> 13:11.480]  up to the minute London Telegraph live feed and and video feed as well as the
[13:11.480 --> 13:16.800]  other reports you know what they're doing right now they are saying oh they're
[13:16.800 --> 13:20.960]  this is actually in the news in our electrical there won't be any new money
[13:20.960 --> 13:27.360]  pledged of the hundreds and hundreds of billions 450 billion to begin with but
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.840]  actually signs them on to unlimited trillions it actually says in there go
[13:32.840 --> 13:36.600]  read it for yourself there's a link to it up at drudgereport.com we've got a
[13:36.600 --> 13:40.760]  link to info wars.com as well it's debt crisis live actually have the
[13:40.760 --> 13:48.240]  reporters in there quoting what's happening in the German parliament they
[13:48.240 --> 13:52.600]  actually say well there's no real new money but the money they're going to
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.520]  pledge there's no money but there's money they're going to pledge is the
[13:56.520 --> 14:01.720]  insurance funds because the Germans unlike the US didn't actually spend
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.760]  their social security money they didn't spend all of it they're pledging that the
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.560]  pensions of the German people the quote insurance funds the backup funds
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.960]  they're pledging that to pay off the private derivatives investors and again
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.440]  they're saying it's all because of Greece Greece is just a a diversion Greece is
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.640]  a tiny part of it and most of their debt is because their government was
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.320]  induced to invest the government funds and pension funds in the derivatives so
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.400]  the banksters a got all that money up front and got it out the back door and
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.000]  now hold Europe hostage but it's the same in every country but Germany that's
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.880]  still solvent and they're going to hold them hostage and after they get this
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.720]  deal holding them hostage there'll be another deal and another and another and
[14:50.720 --> 14:57.000]  another there's never enough to pay off the black hole the black hole of tens
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.320]  of thousands of quadrillions is impossible to pay off it grows
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.000]  exponentially the more money you give the central banks in bailouts the more
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.320]  they just leverage that to infinity the bailouts trigger a bigger black hole the
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.720]  more energy you feed it how many economists we have it on to explain this
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.960]  there's no way to backstop it you were just told last week Bank of America has
[15:21.960 --> 15:28.960]  asked for $79 trillion and is preparing to request it out of the FDIC they've
[15:28.960 --> 15:36.040]  moved their money which is even money the debts into the FDIC system and they're
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.520]  going to be allowed to do it you're told all day about 14.5 trillion dollar
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.680]  deficits and how you are going to have to have your taxes raised and services
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.940]  cut because you owe this money that's just a backdrop sounds big to make you
[15:51.940 --> 15:56.080]  feel like you owe something to make you feel like this is your debt you see
[15:56.080 --> 16:01.240]  this hoax going of well the sticking point to the Greeks because you know
[16:01.240 --> 16:07.280]  they're talking about a hundred percent payoff on these derivatives to private
[16:07.280 --> 16:12.640]  investors but not even to the government investments the government
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.520]  invested investments and derivatives that doesn't get paid off your pension
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.240]  fund invested derivatives that doesn't get paid off your pension gets devalued
[16:20.240 --> 16:26.440]  I mean this is total robbery this is as big as World War two without the tens
[16:26.440 --> 16:30.840]  of millions dying but the austerity coming out of this will impoverish the
[16:30.840 --> 16:35.000]  West and we'll kill over a billion people in the next decade Lord Monks and
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.160]  others have broken down the numbers they're very conservative very
[16:38.160 --> 16:43.680]  conservative in in in one billion this so in the final equation is bigger than
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.680]  World War two and World War one combined but it's a new kind of war it's a
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.880]  financial matrix war where the globalists roll out their cashless grid
[16:51.880 --> 16:57.480]  bring everybody into a Ponzi scheme that they pump up in the 90s everybody's
[16:57.480 --> 17:00.880]  like wow this system's really great while it's all being set up to bring us
[17:00.880 --> 17:05.960]  into debt bondage and then as I told you 16 years ago as I told you ten years
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.640]  ago and three years ago and a month ago and last week that you would see all
[17:11.640 --> 17:16.440]  institutions when everyone is in fear say we've got to have a bank of the
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.160]  world a new bank to put these debts in and we're going to sign over our
[17:20.160 --> 17:23.880]  sovereignty because that's the deal that they admit that in Europe they can
[17:23.880 --> 17:28.080]  never get out of this once their country sign on to it now that's a fraudulent
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.280]  contract it's like saying you can trick somebody to sign a contract to be there's
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.400]  you know they're they're slave I mean it's a fraud and especially if it's
[17:37.400 --> 17:44.280]  induced through deception and it says they can never get out this is and on
[17:44.280 --> 17:47.460]  the news Bloomberg says don't worry American investments will be fine they're
[17:47.460 --> 17:50.240]  telling investors that here this your pension fund will be fine your
[17:50.240 --> 17:54.640]  investment will be fine because we're getting rid of democracy in Germany I've
[17:54.640 --> 17:59.280]  actually heard CNBC and MSNBC people say you heard it on TV I listen on XM to
[17:59.280 --> 18:04.160]  TV I actually have heard them you've heard it you're a business person or
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.400]  investor it's it's don't worry about the crisis we're gonna they doesn't matter
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.240]  what the Germans want they're gonna totally implode if they don't do this and
[18:14.240 --> 18:18.600]  so their government is set it doesn't work today or this week it'll be next
[18:18.600 --> 18:24.420]  week they'll drive their stocks down to nothing they'll panic everyone just like
[18:24.420 --> 18:29.320]  Hitler threatening to shell Paris if the French didn't didn't surrender and

[24:54.440 --> 25:01.960]  while I was in Las Vegas for three days I've got to continue to even process the
[25:01.960 --> 25:08.080]  things I saw everywhere I went was like a movie a surreal movie everywhere
[25:08.080 --> 25:13.200]  flying out there flying back a dead soldier on the airplane flying back to
[25:13.200 --> 25:18.640]  Austin water cannon spraying the airplane when we landed awesome police
[25:18.640 --> 25:25.880]  will know that the new listeners are like what it prostitutes continually
[25:25.880 --> 25:34.920]  coming over Illuminati symbolism everywhere I went out to this private
[25:34.920 --> 25:39.720]  rocket base that I'm not even supposed to get into while I was there with
[25:39.720 --> 25:42.960]  Ventura people like why are you in Las Vegas we were there for that rocket base
[25:42.960 --> 25:52.440]  it is just I can't even talk about that till the TV show comes out and then they
[25:52.440 --> 26:00.360]  were telling I mean I just my life is so bizarre but I realize it's because I'm
[26:00.360 --> 26:04.600]  conscious I'm not in a trance by the way Ventura is coming out of his trance
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.760]  they just been waking up the last six seven years Tyrell the Sun started
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.960]  waking him up my materially with my materially and others right around the
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.360]  time he was starting to wake up I first met him six years ago so Ventura is in
[26:18.360 --> 26:26.280]  a process of awakening fully his wife's completely awake while Terry Ventura is
[26:26.280 --> 26:35.720]  really neat gotten to know her good a truly smart graceful beautiful woman
[26:35.720 --> 26:50.200]  enchanting is a way to describe her but I the way to describe this is like Saul
[26:50.200 --> 26:56.000]  of Tarsus and this has happened to me multiple times but each time it just
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.800]  goes to another level where I can't even describe what I'm seeing or the level
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.960]  of understanding it's like being knocked off your horse by a bright light and
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.320]  it's it's like whoa and you open your eyes again and it's just so much clear
[27:10.320 --> 27:19.960]  I mean this whole trip was synchronicity I'm flying out of Austin they search a
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.400]  guy with with eight silver coins or seven silver coins one gold coin he
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.400]  happens to get on my flight and sit right by me then I'm watching him search
[27:29.400 --> 27:33.920]  this Air Force sergeant I know he had three stripes with a forget what type of
[27:33.920 --> 27:40.320]  sergeant 20 years in a weapons specialist been in seven tours his buddy
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.400]  killed an Iraq
[27:46.920 --> 27:54.200]  they put the coffin on the plane because I happened to board first and again
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.320]  happened to sit right by him again and talk to him for two and a half hours and
[27:58.320 --> 28:03.040]  they still were the search team at the gate and we're going in his pants and
[28:03.040 --> 28:12.080]  everything and of course then there's the TSA before that in Las Vegas what
[28:12.080 --> 28:21.520]  you before I left I got the everyone was being body scanned and this guy this
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.800]  TSA guy said I know who you are Mr. Jones I listen to your show and I have
[28:25.800 --> 28:29.480]  administrative rights and you can either let me do this we're going to go to the
[28:29.480 --> 28:33.120]  other procedure and he looked at me he goes you know what that is because you
[28:33.120 --> 28:36.120]  have a right for this next thing to happen and I realized I'd walked into a
[28:36.120 --> 28:42.360]  trap because they were going to come over still search me and then find me
[28:42.360 --> 28:52.560]  $11,000 and this guy a man it literally well on a power trip stuck his hands in
[28:52.560 --> 29:01.480]  my pants everything and the and the and the the the the pilgrims progress if
[29:01.480 --> 29:05.680]  you haven't read it it was like that the hookers coming up to me so I've been in
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.160]  Vegas a few other times to shoot for different TV shows and interviews and I

[29:13.840 --> 29:19.200]  and you know it's your friend you go but I didn't run into this you know I would
[29:19.200 --> 29:25.040]  just be going to get something to eat by myself and hookers would come over and
[29:25.040 --> 29:35.240]  their eyes were so soulless I mean the whole place I I okay I'll get into the
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.520]  world government establishment when we come back and then get into the whole

[33:14.840 --> 33:25.080]  the GCN radio network I dislike Las Vegas so much I may go back there and
[33:25.080 --> 33:33.200]  actually make a documentary Las Vegas is the model of the future world the
[33:33.200 --> 33:40.640]  symbols everywhere the jumbo trons creating a false reality manipulating
[33:40.640 --> 33:46.080]  with with conscious and subliminal messages archetypal images the most
[33:46.080 --> 33:53.960]  important thing you can take away from this broadcast from my deep deep deep
[33:53.960 --> 34:02.760]  full devotion to understanding the world is that the public is asleep and is in
[34:02.760 --> 34:09.240]  a trance and I am in a trance you have been induced into a trance now some
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.760]  people are down 10,000 feet in the darkness of the sea imaging the mind
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.760]  the consciousness is a sea total darkness ice cold they can have they have no
[34:18.760 --> 34:23.720]  sight it's basically just like a matrix informations funneled into them they
[34:23.720 --> 34:30.000]  just believe whatever they see I have basically made my way up swimming
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.080]  upwards into the light and I'm basically about one inch beneath the water right
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.840]  now and I can see the brilliance and I can maybe make out some clouds but I
[34:41.840 --> 34:49.600]  cannot imagine if you're even able while you're confined to to your earth suit to
[34:49.600 --> 34:56.080]  go out and emerge but I'm one inch beneath the water and the quickening but
[34:56.080 --> 34:59.600]  it's all because the whole world you can feel it everyone knows it my dad's
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.960]  always an optimist and he knows history he knows that my information is accurate
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.360]  but he's still gone from joking about some of the stuff 16 years ago when I
[35:09.360 --> 35:12.680]  first got on air to being more serious but always saying you know we're gonna
[35:12.680 --> 35:15.360]  make it it's gonna be all right I was over there last night for dinner with
[35:15.360 --> 35:19.640]  my children and they left with my wife because I came after work and as I dropped
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.360]  by here yesterday after I flew back in in the afternoon and he kind of in
[35:24.360 --> 35:28.800]  concern not snapped at me but went well what's gonna happen to us now that you've
[35:28.800 --> 35:33.040]  done this what's gonna happen to us that this stuff's all coming down I mean it
[35:33.040 --> 35:36.440]  really dawned on him that if we don't beat this they're gonna come line us up
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.080]  and shoot us and I'm very few times if I see my dad I've seen like a car wreck
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.080]  and he gets out and help somebody has that serious look or one time I cut
[35:44.080 --> 35:46.840]  myself really bad when I was a kid and blubber spraying all over the walls I
[35:46.840 --> 35:50.080]  ran through a plate last door that just been closed had been open all day I was
[35:50.080 --> 35:53.760]  running in and out to the pool and I saw that same look and he got up he kind of
[35:53.760 --> 35:56.680]  jumped up when I was saying things I wasn't being loud I was saying you have
[35:56.680 --> 35:59.560]  to understand I'm not really thinking about some of the family stuff you're
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.360]  bringing up I'm really thinking about it's all coming down he got up off the
[36:02.360 --> 36:08.640]  couch he said what's gonna happen to us what's gonna happen to you and then it
[36:08.640 --> 36:11.680]  was just for a moment then he snapped back and he said well we've just got to
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.000]  stop this from happening and as I was saying that he was saying we just got
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.200]  something from happening as I was blurting out dad we've just got to stop
[36:19.200 --> 36:23.560]  it we're all in I was like dad we've got a study he said it himself you
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.520]  understand it was like mind meld people understand and everywhere I go people
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.880]  there was a 90-year-old Scott the Scottish woman on the plane next to me
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.920]  and then right next to me's this Air Force Sergeant armor weapons specialist
[36:38.920 --> 36:42.520]  seven tours and he didn't want to talk about I started talking to it and you
[36:42.520 --> 36:47.720]  know looking on the guy's eyes I could really see into him it's the it's the
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.760]  discernment ladies and gentlemen I almost didn't even come in and do this radio
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.560]  show today almost just left for a month I mean I do not even feel worthy to even
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.120]  try to describe these the the magnitude of all of this and and and what's
[37:01.120 --> 37:08.480]  happening and and and everything that it's just I've just lived a movie in the
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.640]  last three days just the whole thing and you notice hanging out with Jesse
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.440]  Ventura and going out and doing shoots at clandestine facilities and having
[37:16.440 --> 37:20.080]  security harasses and finding out about stuff they're going through and all this
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.440]  craziness and Sean Stone there to you know super high understanding of the
[37:25.440 --> 37:31.800]  Illuminati and telling me stuff that then I can't repeat about things he's seen
[37:31.800 --> 37:40.240]  and the Illuminati I mean it is just but that's none of that is even that's
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.960]  just window dressing for the for the experiences everywhere I went everything
[37:44.960 --> 37:54.120]  I did was a lesson everything I saw every hooker I turned down it was it was
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.960]  mind-blowing and boosting I mean I was in here yesterday I got in here about
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.040]  three o'clock plane landed at about 330 they made us all stay on the plane while
[38:03.040 --> 38:10.360]  they got the coffin off and everything the dead soldier and I came in here and
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.720]  literally sat in the chair trying to have meetings and talk to people and
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.960]  I've been gone a few days you're trying to give orders and give people's ideas and
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.960]  have discussions and I was like a jellyfish I was so tired that I wasn't
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.440]  even tired I just felt like I couldn't get up I was super awake but I couldn't
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.520]  even get up and I just sat here for like three hours just sitting there telling
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.120]  over my parents
[38:36.480 --> 38:44.080]  and I was sitting there next to that 90 year old woman from Scotland who was
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.200]  over here visiting her daughter and they look like clones of each other who
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.080]  was 70 something and and the 90 year old was a great great grandmother and was
[38:55.080 --> 39:03.560]  going to visit her 12th grand shot a great great grandchild and these old
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.560]  women didn't know who I was they're like in that Scottish accent you can feel the
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.440]  world changing something big is about to happen these wars are evil America was
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.880]  once a great country but now evil has taken it and these old women like you
[39:15.880 --> 39:19.640]  can feel it and their eyes were looking at me and I was just like it was just
[39:19.640 --> 39:25.360]  every person I talked to it was it was like a spiritual experience at a level
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.360]  I couldn't every person and and watching people and how they were
[39:30.360 --> 39:40.880]  interacting and what they were doing my god and I'm one inch I can feel it
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.720]  spiritually I am one inch from breaking the surface and let me tell you folks I
[39:45.720 --> 39:56.560]  haven't run into anybody very few who aren't extremely old the only people I've
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.760]  run into that I can tell that have woken up more than I have her people like Ron
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.840]  Paul you could tell but God didn't tell you one tenth of what he knows folks he's
[40:05.840 --> 40:11.360]  very hourly and like that old woman she didn't have all the knowledge I have of
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.400]  like contemporary things but she had deep knowledge of being a great great
[40:16.400 --> 40:29.240]  grandmother she had ancestral knowledge the knowledge that only elders can have
[40:29.240 --> 40:32.640]  who've been on the right path you know an old person who's not been on the right
[40:32.640 --> 40:39.320]  path is usually mean ugly in their soul hating youth but then there's the old
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.200]  people who who can see life and enjoy it and and frolic in happiness and
[40:46.200 --> 40:51.960]  people doing well let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen the
[40:51.960 --> 40:55.320]  message was talking to Tim when I got here yesterday at like three o'clock
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.680]  talking to my mother talking to people on the plane people in Las Vegas who were
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.120]  there for business I'll always let you know I'm here for business you know I'm
[41:03.120 --> 41:06.680]  not here to be taken advantage of I'm you know I'm here yeah I understand yeah
[41:06.680 --> 41:12.200]  was how there's this false reality programming people in thousands of
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.320]  different ways in a concerted system that's being built for eons like a
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.880]  pyramid that's why it's so finely oiled they only make slight tweaks in it
[41:22.440 --> 41:28.560]  everyone would look at me and say who's awake would say you know this is in a
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.800]  human intelligence doing this people that are awake realize you can you say
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.600]  what it is the devil some people like David Ike would say you know what it's
[41:37.600 --> 41:44.000]  space aliens but the presence once you awaken that eye of Soran is looking at
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.120]  you and you can't deny it's there you feel it and it's yeah that's right
[41:50.120 --> 42:00.560]  you're not just fighting humans pal you're fighting demons this is not human
[42:00.560 --> 42:07.760]  built ladies and gentlemen I can talk about all these world events and
[42:07.760 --> 42:10.160]  everything I talked about happening they're going to set up world
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.440]  government and they're going to kill billions of people you understand that
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.200]  they want blood they want death that's what these people want that's what they
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.840]  came for they don't care about money and sex and power that's stuff they buy us
[42:23.840 --> 42:31.240]  with that's stuff that humans want not the devil the devil wants your soul the
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.920]  devil wants your spirit wants your intellect wants your mind
[42:35.920 --> 42:43.920]  let me read you a black Sabbath passage from Rodney James Dio that this is
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.800]  somebody into evil but who has seen gone deep enough into evil from the other
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.800]  side to see what I've seen sing me a song you're a singer do me a wrong you're a
[42:54.800 --> 43:00.320]  bringer of evil the devil is never a maker the less that you give you're a
[43:00.320 --> 43:07.960]  taker so it's on and on on and on and on it's heaven and hell oh well you understand
[43:07.960 --> 43:13.200]  what this is saying the lover of life's not a sinner the ending is just a
[43:13.200 --> 43:19.120]  beginner the closer you get to the meaning the sooner you'll know that
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.240]  you're dreaming you know you're dreaming when you write as you come out of the
[43:23.240 --> 43:31.880]  trance so it's on and on on and on and on and I watch my dad come right to the
[43:31.880 --> 43:36.120]  surface last night just like we're just right where I'm at he's older than I am
[43:36.120 --> 43:41.400]  but I watched him come right to the point I am of all of breaking his trance
[43:41.400 --> 43:45.560]  he already subconsciously knows there's a great threat and he's under chemical
[43:45.560 --> 43:50.040]  assault and biological assault and spiritual assault but he's robust he's
[43:50.040 --> 43:55.200]  a frontiers person he he's gonna make it he's gonna hack through it you know
[43:55.200 --> 43:59.080]  there's this attitude of men alright they got us using de weapons or the
[43:59.080 --> 44:02.880]  Marines will use them when you're young it's meant to kill you 20 years later
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.320]  no you've got to fully break the trance and realize they're killing me this is
[44:07.320 --> 44:15.000]  it my government they're doing something 10,000 times al-qaeda you have to
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.640]  fully realize you're under assault it's a creeping death though the enemy knows
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.320]  how to ooze in around you like a snake that comes up and says I'm your friend
[44:24.320 --> 44:29.520]  here's a kiss it curls around you and kisses you on the cheek and whispers in
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.440]  your ear and its eyes are pinwheels spinning but then it just kind of oh let
[44:33.440 --> 44:37.680]  me caress you and you and later you you look down you're bleeding it's it's
[44:37.680 --> 44:44.200]  been it's been biting your breast see we're designed to face a cave bear
[44:44.200 --> 44:49.040]  rushing in into the can and humans are like you know what I got to defend my
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.320]  children this will get my guts going up all that NFL stuff you see jumping over
[44:53.320 --> 44:56.480]  groups of people and all that that's meant for when you're defending your
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.580]  family that's why you're so excited you're not designed to face something
[45:01.580 --> 45:06.200]  put in your water something broadcast invisible electronic waves you can't see
[45:06.200 --> 45:13.480]  giving you cancer breaking up your DNA like a like a ultrasound breaking up
[45:13.480 --> 45:19.240]  kidney stones same thing just waves everywhere just blasting us cancer rates
[45:19.240 --> 45:22.840]  exploding and right now I'm here surrounded by TV sets wireless systems
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.120]  I'm just frying here just if you could just see it but you see a limited
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.440]  spectrum you can't see that dimension but it's there you're blasting me right
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.680]  now I'm just in a blast furnace I feel ill every day when I leave here but it's
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.880]  the technology of the matrix I have to step in to the matrix temple relay
[45:38.880 --> 45:46.280]  system to even reach you it's a giant soul-sucking kill grid all this
[45:46.280 --> 45:51.080]  technology everything they could have had clean forms of it it was designed to
[45:51.080 --> 45:55.320]  be dirty it was designed to pollute your spirit it was designed to take you
[45:55.320 --> 46:00.600]  straight to hell and so none of this other stuff matters none of it not that
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.320]  not the euro being set up not the poison vaccines none of it if you don't wake
[46:05.320 --> 46:10.320]  up and recognize what it is you see as the world begins to wake up the globalist
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.360]  are coming out more in everybody's face oh you don't want the Gardasil shot you
[46:14.360 --> 46:17.640]  didn't buy that it was a mandatory we'll just say it's mandatory again this time
[46:17.640 --> 46:22.200]  the federal government and your little boys are gonna take it next as if we
[46:22.200 --> 46:27.080]  haven't hurt them enough one in 25,000 having autism 20 something years ago now
[46:27.080 --> 46:32.640]  one in 58 now we got your little girls and never get your little boys and it is
[46:32.640 --> 46:38.680]  a sacrifice of your children but these demons like it to go slow they like to
[46:38.680 --> 46:42.480]  hurt the child in the womb then they like to death by a thousand cuts vaccines
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.920]  fluoride GMO and they can just see in the spiritual realm that child being
[46:46.920 --> 46:53.520]  swiped everything they eat everything they do the evil just hates that energy
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.520]  hates that light hates that goodness and they're just like vampire little vampire
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.000]  bats all of your child biting it the GMO the fluoride the electronic pollution
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.960]  the electronic fog just thousands of vampire bats all over your child just
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.000]  biting and that's why it's vampires vampires vampires all over TV constant
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.680]  vampires constant constant constant which is the which is the legend of the
[47:15.680 --> 47:21.280]  spiritual vampire it's not the physical vampire and that's what I realized is
[47:21.280 --> 47:31.160]  that Las Vegas is a vampire capital a spiritual vortex of of of vampiric evil
[47:31.160 --> 47:51.280]  that's what the God of this world is is a big fat vampire I have asked God
[47:51.280 --> 47:55.200]  because I have shirt from this I have known and I'm not one of the
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.840]  responsibility but I officially have asked God to give me the empowerment to
[48:01.840 --> 48:06.080]  face these people head on I want everything that comes with it I want
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.960]  all of it I want the pain I want I want I want to truly face it because I'm
[48:11.960 --> 48:16.560]  already under attack by everyone else is and I can't stand watching it go on
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.760]  anymore I can't stand watching them hurt the children anymore I can't stand
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.480]  watching them wreck society I can't stand watching people in darkness and the
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.720]  thing I really can't stand is watching good people like that's Air Force
[48:33.720 --> 48:37.840]  Sergeant going to bury his friend who was praying when he didn't think
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.360]  anybody was watching him who was very composed very professional filling out
[48:42.360 --> 48:49.040]  reports the whole time when he wasn't talking to me meaning well saying you
[48:49.040 --> 48:54.720]  got a good guess they're going to hit Iran Israel first he meant well when he
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.080]  said turn Iran into a parking lot he really believes he's fighting for good
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.680]  that's the incredible deception is that the the satanic government harnesses
[49:04.680 --> 49:10.280]  good people who are deceived living in a false reality to carry out their evil
[49:10.280 --> 49:14.680]  and there are men are our men all over the world fighting more than anybody
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.880]  ever did in World War two you name it seven turds he said some of them have been a nine
[49:25.080 --> 49:35.040]  and he is literally pouring himself out totally dedicated and he has no idea
[49:35.040 --> 49:41.320]  because he's in a trance I'm literally looking at a prisoner who understands
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.960]  this temporal world but does not understand the spiritual you call
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.320]  whatever you want the subconscious what system is programming if you're an
[49:51.320 --> 49:55.800]  atheist and agnostic whatever you are whatever whatever system you're
[49:55.800 --> 49:59.760]  believing in it doesn't matter reality is still there and let me tell you
[49:59.760 --> 50:03.960]  something have you seen how we predicted everything that's happened have you seen
[50:03.960 --> 50:06.960]  how the Vatican's come out for world government the Bank of the World a
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.120]  private bank we told you that was going to happen have you seen how all this is
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.240]  unfolding are you are you ready for the next stuff to unfold and one of the
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.680]  biggest lies of this system is that we can't change things we are in a battle
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.480]  we are in a war a gladiatorial fight between good and evil with the whole
[50:27.480 --> 50:36.360]  universe watching and Christians have not really read what's in the Bible
[50:36.360 --> 50:43.360]  Nineveh all the examples of reprieves of societies repenting I don't mean repent
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.360]  at one of these four-house churches I mean really repent and ask God to be given
[50:48.360 --> 50:54.760]  discernment and to face down evil we could turn this around hi this is Alex

[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.200]  amazing syndicated radio host and comedian limel we had scheduled last
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.360]  week will be joining us by that I look forward to having him on but I am in a
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:25.280]  very volcanic mood but I will attempt to give you short and sweet analysis on the
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.840]  other side just to get into any subject in an entire library just opens up of
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:36.040]  information in the spoken word how do you access said information how do you
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:44.840]  deliver quadrillion terabyte downloads of data well all I can do is get you to
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:52.280]  realize the archetypal coding that you already have you already know all of
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.360]  this in your subconscious in your soul whatever you want to call it that's what
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.800]  the globalist are always trying to keep that closed they're always trying to
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.760]  block you from awakening to keep you in deception to keep you in darkness now and
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.960]  their whole system is about keeping you suppressed the chemicals the biologicals
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:22.240]  all of it they do not want you to become aware their entire system look seek
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.520]  information seek history learn about the globally learn about their programs I
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.200]  mean I think about the hardcore nature all the fact that we've written articles
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.240]  linked to the government documents that it's it's it's ridiculous how much we
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:46.240]  can prove that this system is an extermination grid and that most of us
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.480]  have already been implanted with harmonially triggered viruses that once
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.520]  we're seen is not useful once our hormone system starts shutting down and
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.720]  cell division starts slowing down triggers our untimely death that's
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:07.120]  another epiphany they want to kill us before we grow old because then many
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.560]  people don't get on the right path till they're old and it is a devilish design
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:23.160]  so that people won't spiritually awaken before they die they say that life's a
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.920]  carousel spinning fast you got to ride it well the world is full of kings and
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.880]  queens blind your eyes and steal your dreams what are kings and queens
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.400]  princes and principalities powers that be little officers of the god of this
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.840]  world themselves into the office into the temporal power into the little badges
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:54.560]  and outfits and monkey suits they wear and they are always deceived themselves
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.600]  because anybody that knew this stuff would never want to serve evil but
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.880]  some would say that's predestined to a certain point so that's their lot and
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.400]  you have free will but you don't it's a complex thing it's even hard to
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  articulate there are definitely some that are predestined to be evil because
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.600]  there's free will but there's also your genetics it's like a certain breed of
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:29.080]  dog is known to be gregarious and friendly and strong and brave other dogs
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.040]  are known to be neurotic and bite people and seek to perpetually urinate on
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:39.320]  your rug that's the new world order but see it's all about those that know how
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.800]  to manipulate and they want to keep you down so they can enslave you with the
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:52.040]  manipulation I am here and you are here to break those chains to take off the
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:05:03.720]  blinders this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.160]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:26.760]  fights are breaking out in the Italian Parliament fires and rioting a spread
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.800]  all over areas of Greece
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:40.200]  significant new offers have been made to bondholders they're talking about the
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:47.360]  EU being saved by transferring its power into this new financial union that is
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.800]  private and sets up a financial and physical dictatorship through the EU
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.880]  bureaucracy over the once sovereign countries that's not my analysis I mean
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.000]  I've been the first to break that down years ago this was coming from reading
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.160]  globalist own documents and publishing republishing and covering them here but
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.000]  you've you've seen anybody that follows financial news we've shown you the
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.160]  articles here we showed you some last hour where they openly state that the
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.680]  countries can't get out of it that it is undemocratic that it's authoritarian and
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.640]  that Europe's being held hostage and that it is a euro super state conspiracy
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.760]  takeover like I saw a bunch of those in the telegraph and even German papers
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.800]  last week and I never even got to them because it's so passe for us I should be
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.320]  saying see we told you so here they are admitting it
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:55.200]  it's right out in the open and what does the London telegraph and others have at
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:03.880]  their 535 Greenwich mean time update it said that the left parties in the German
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:11.800]  parliament have come out and they're saying we must create the super Europe
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.600]  because it's bigoted to not I mean no facts know why it's bigoted it's just
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.840]  they're telling the left it's a left versus right fight that's what they
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.640]  actually say here they say it's a left versus right fight and that they must
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.080]  fight the bigots who don't want to have the banks take over that engineered the
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.360]  crisis I mean anytime I've ever talked about the New World War people say why
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.480]  are you racist what are you talking about I'm talking about a global private
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.480]  corporate government but see they create a religion of political correctness
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.320]  where you don't want to be called racist so soon there's not even charges or
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.160]  proof or even a story of how you're racist it's just racist I mean I'm
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.560]  looking for restaurants if you don't like your food to say are you racist I
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.640]  mean we already know if you complain about the TSA stick in their hands on
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.880]  your pants newspaper reporters and others we've read the articles they call
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.400]  you a conspiracy terrorist now not liking someone to touch your genitals
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.720]  he's not your wife or husband that that is a conspiracy theory see having a
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.160]  thought having a view having a soul having a mooring having a compass and
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:34.200]  here's that news on the Vatican now again I get criticized by both sides of this
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:44.640]  divide and conquer I have found the Catholic bashing crew to be duplicitous
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:50.920]  liars who make stuff up incessantly people say well then counter it I have
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.840]  countered stuff it only makes people get more into it and so if they just want
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.040]  to attack me all day that's fine I'll get the info out and not even respond to
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:04.240]  it I mean here's an example about a year ago Rob Jacobson comes in goes hey we
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.920]  got these emails people asking us about in game 1.5 and I'm going oh yeah I
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.400]  remember that a thing we put on prison planet TV took about a week to make
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.400]  right it's some internet clips some of our stuff he goes yeah what is it he
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.200]  pulls up this fellow Schlafly clip and I'm sitting there okay what about it and
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.960]  he goes well there's they're saying we went to a conservative CMP meeting and
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.160]  and and you and that you shot this and I said wait a minute I remember this let
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.280]  me see the film so I'll pull it up because I was trying to think that you
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.120]  did wow did I go to one of those that you know I mean was able because I've
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.440]  sent crews all over the place and I know a little bit about them now because
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.800]  I've been accused of being part of it or something so I researched it and then
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.760]  found out you know decade ago I had Peter El Scott on talking about it that's
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.680]  the guy that you know talks about kind of get secret of conservative groups some
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.680]  of my guests have you know you know gone to another I've asked him I asked him on
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.320]  air what is it but but the point is side issue I've never been there never been
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.760]  approached by it and but I'm this is like four years ago we put out in game
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:08.960]  1.5 or three and a half years ago so I said let me look that up and I pull it
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.200]  up and I go well that's a YouTube clip I said it's about law the sea because the
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.200]  people were saying we had gotten into there so we must be members and so I
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.120]  went and I typed in law the sea treaty fellow Schlafly and there was the clip
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.080]  on somebody's website on on YouTube still from from six months before in game
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.000]  1.5 came out and I said we'll just send on their YouTube channel and their
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.600]  emails send the people that are saying this I'm usually respond to stuff but I
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.080]  thought I stood in Rob's office and I said I have a feeling these people are
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.520]  government agents or they're just jealous I said send them the YouTube clip
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:57.600]  and tell them contact the guy who has that channel and show them this and we
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.120]  got responses back of your scum we're gonna get you so people are saying I go
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.560]  to secret meetings here's the proof I shot this video I go like that's law the
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.400]  sea treaty fellow Schlafly from 2007 we pull it up there in his own YouTube
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:16.760]  where we got it and then the people respond by saying well Alex is a liar
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.280]  he said in game is all his footage in game 1.5 has got clips of Glenn Beck on
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.160]  his show and and and CB you know all this channels it again it's these that's
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:37.560]  how this but then I realized this wasn't about the truth this was about saying I
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:44.320]  work for the CMP and you know that's a wake-up call that I knew that when I
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.280]  sent people proof of this they didn't want that proof they for whatever reason
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:56.560]  wanted to say that I'd done this and again I'm not even responding to
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.720]  something like this now because it's about me it should be a a a okay I got
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.400]  all this news to get to but but see I start talking about the Vatican because
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.600]  then this connects to that it brings up a whole data file on that there are
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.640]  people that any time I have someone on who's Catholic write articles saying
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.920]  that it's because I'm a Vatican warlock supreme commander that's where those
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.720]  jokes come from
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:37.320]  and then I'll also get attacked by Catholic groups anytime I do criticize
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.560]  something the Vatican's doing and they'll always try to spin it and say
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.120]  well that's not really what the Pope meant or that's not what the what how
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.800]  this is interpreted and you're just Catholic bashing you know I don't get
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.000]  up here and bash Chinese people because I don't like the Communist Chinese I
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.920]  don't get up here and bash Jews because I don't like what some of the political
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.480]  parties in Israel are doing lobbying over here for gun control and stuff I
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.120]  just want my guns I'm not against the English or the British because they are
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.520]  a big part of the New World Order that's the power structure there wherever
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.000]  you've got strong people or a strong group you're gonna have strong mafia's
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.040]  over them you understand that Americans aren't overall bad people they're in a
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.240]  trance they're blind they're manipulated but I noticed when we wrote
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:26.920]  articles about this when I was out of town over the last few days people were
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.560]  attacking us for just quoting the Vatican calling for world government and
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.520]  all this so that's what I'm saying I'm not here to bash you for whatever group
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.000]  or or or organization unless you're consciously you know a member of the
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.840]  Satanist or something and then that's a pathetic seeking after power as well
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.320]  it's just well that's how I got off into the first story that popped in my mind
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:02.200]  about disinformation my point is it makes my head hurt to think about it
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:08.120]  because it's it's it's so ridiculous you know people that say I'm Catholic and
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.960]  all this stuff because because I'm nothing against Catholics but it's you
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:20.360]  my identity is who I am and my family's famous Protestants on record you know
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:26.520]  the heirs family Hammons others that came here with with shiploads of Bibles
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:31.000]  because they were mad that people weren't allowed to practice Protestantism here
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:39.040]  in Texas and you know to have people try to steal my identity of where I come
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.200]  from and know who I am and my family raising Colonel Travis the son and who
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.120]  I am it just shows that's what the New World Order does it tries to get us all
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:54.780]  fighting with each other but the truth is the truth I mean when Protestant
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.800]  groups come out and do evil New World Order stuff or push it or people inside
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.240]  those grips to it we have to stand up and speak out against it when Catholic
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.320]  groups do things like that it has to be spoken out against it has to be it has
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.400]  to be discussed instead they just want to get us fighting over the religious name
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:18.120]  or organization instead of the actual deeds that's my point and then later it
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.040]  was discovered the main guy that you know promotes that everything's Catholic
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.240]  run or whatever it's connected to Israel and goes over there and does all these
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.760]  things and and again that's how the globalists play each other off against
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.240]  each other but but but again I'm digressing because I've got all this
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.120]  news here in front of me and it studied it I want to go over it it's just that
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.680]  each subject I get into I want to get into detail but but regardless when we
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:52.280]  wrote articles about this and linked to Reuters and others a few days ago when
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.480]  all of this happened we were being bashed by those in the comments saying we
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.320]  were covering up for the Vatican and then those saying we were bashing the
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.400]  Vatican see I mean this is the idiocy people afraid of information it is a
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.760]  fact the Vatican was instrumental in setting up what's become the Euro in
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.960]  the Treaty of Rome in 1957 it is a fact that large elements of the Vatican
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:21.640]  helped establish Bilderberg group it is a fact that you say whatever you want
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:26.440]  about this is a powerful organization it's now wanting my bailout money my
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:30.120]  tax money that's where most of the bailout goes to Europe to create this
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.160]  new bank of the world that I'll pay all these taxes to and they're spinning it
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.080]  like the Occupy Wall Street people saying this is the moral response to the
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.400]  banks is to give them all this power and set up this bank of the world so
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.040]  there's my point Vatican Council calls for world government central bank
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.640]  that's new American here's Reuters Vatican calls for global authority on
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.560]  economy wraps idolatry of the market I want to come back get more into this
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.040]  and then get an even bigger news feds order YouTube for a move video for

[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:14.120]  you know jaren was just making a great point there in the break in the 60s the
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:19.160]  media spun the movement as sex and drugs which was part of it but then that
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.160]  dominated the view and the idea of it not getting healthy not getting out of the
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.720]  system not killing your television you know all the real things that really
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.240]  started got erased the CIA brought LSD in that's all declassified and actually
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.560]  put change agents in to take it over I'm even saying it was a good movement bad
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.160]  but the point is it's not the movement it began as and with anti-war they
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.880]  infiltrated with anarchists and things like that who aren't even anarchists
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.760]  it's just a name they use it's kind of a cutout like anonymous anonymous could be
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:53.440]  good it could be bad the point is it's it's these cutouts and now occupied
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.520]  wall streets kicked off by democratic operatives that's on record now the
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:05.840]  service employees union now it's been released acorn the ad buster guys all
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.160]  of that's been confirmed and there's more reports coming out now every day on
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.360]  it but still there's a lot of good people there on the ground the
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.680]  establishment puts the call out doesn't say really what it's about it's just
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.760]  anger at government corruption wall street then they show up and now they're
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:30.360]  calling for sales taxes national vat's on the general public they're calling for
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.320]  robin hood taxes on people who worth a couple million dollars who they think are
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.560]  rich that's the trillionaire controllers who control trillions worth
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.720]  hundreds of billions a piece they want that new system to shut down their
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.920]  competition and and jaren made the point he said before they would always just
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.000]  spin it and say this is what they stand for but now they can't spin it because
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  any way you do it's big banks banks are bad mega banks are out of control so now
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.200]  they're just saying we don't know what they stand for we don't know what they're
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.600]  pushing for that way they can just totally ignore the whole thing and
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.480]  inject confusion into it and yes that's a way to ignore what they're actually
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.920]  saying so when it's a group that they don't want to tell you what they're
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:17.560]  saying in the Fedders or people that want to claw back the money from Wall
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.880]  Street or folks that want a speculation tax on those type of derivatives that's
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.160]  all ignored but when it's a democratic operative group in the crowd they then
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.160]  get to be the spokesman so they neutralize everybody that actually has
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.480]  something to say by just saying we don't know what you want and ignoring it and
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.280]  then then they only show the democratic operatives then they let it come out
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.680]  that is democratic operatives then that makes it a left-right issue so now
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.640]  conservatives and libertarians don't want to come out and demonstrate against
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.440]  banks because it's seen as liberal when it was actually myself Ron Paul and
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:54.160]  others I've been protesting the Federal Reserve for more than a decade Ron Paul
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:01.920]  for 30 years in the Fed stuff going on for four years you see so this is how
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.240]  they try to brand movements it's it's it's it's multifaceted and they have
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.760]  these top ad men these top pitch men advertising people that sit around in
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.720]  these big government think tanks and corporate think tanks being paid
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.160]  millions of dollars a month in some cases to to to come up with slogans and
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.840]  systems and they test them the talking points then go out and then local media
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.400]  knows that well I don't get orders from somebody this is what locals you know
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.560]  basically operate under well I don't get you know orders as an Austin
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.440]  American statesman writer or as a local talk show host but I know if I imitate
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:46.480]  the national people I'll sound smart and people that do that tend to move up they
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.520]  see it as I'm copying the research of the national guys and you know I'm
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.560]  copying their success but but but really you're just copying a talking point you
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.760]  see as long as you control the central system Brad Pitt wears a certain outfit
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:07.680]  everybody wants to wear it Angelina Jo Lee wears a certain outfit women suddenly
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.480]  want to wear it she gets a cabala tattoo you know seven eight years ago all the
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.840]  other women go out and go so people understand that basic programming that's
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.560]  going on but but but what I'm here to try to do is to get people really looking
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:32.720]  for it really seeing it because it's everywhere and it's so inculcated that
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.600]  then even junior advertisement people imitate what they've seen on TV fast
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.480]  things moving quick things flashing I can't tell you how many times I've told
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:46.280]  my graphics people who who who aren't even conscious of this they're great do
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.680]  not make an intro that's that fast it's not subliminal but it's close to
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.840]  subliminal and and and I'm like why did you do that I'm like well that's that's
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:59.240]  what I see on the news I mean I'm imitating you'll fast moving things
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:06.760]  and people aren't sophisticated enough to get take like police state for when
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.720]  the graphics came in some of the video graphics it was it was twice as fast and
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.000]  I said slow that down by double I said slow it down by triple but when you did
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.480]  that it looked blocky it didn't work I said okay just by double I'm in a hurry I
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:24.800]  want to get this out so it flashes a badge and says you know fear submit but
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.800]  that's more like because I talked to the graph versus why do they say well
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:34.400]  that's like the obey shirts I mean we're not actually saying obey but it's
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.960]  supposed to make you see they're telling you to obey but but but the reason I
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:44.320]  tell that story is it's just illustrate how we're also programmed that we then
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.880]  repeat the programming even though we're not conscious of it you see what I'm
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:56.320]  saying we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:03.680]  here he just finished it this morning I wanted to go over this though again
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.560]  ladies and gentlemen the magnitude of this feds order YouTube to remove video
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:15.080]  for containing government criticism US authorities hit Google with 70% rise in
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:20.360]  takedown orders and they're admitting now that they're gonna take websites down
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.480]  without court orders the feds will just do whatever they want and I can and the
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:31.600]  UN will that was announced last week Glen Beck has come out and admitted that the
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.320]  EAS system next month is going to do a forced takedown of all radio and TV with
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.600]  takeover boxes that have been wired in I of course exposed this in 2000 I
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.240]  expose it 96 I exposed it this year we have a video going over that that
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.640]  everybody should watch now back EAS test allows feds disease control
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.920]  communications here's our article from February 8th on video Obama launched his
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:35:00.160]  total takeover of media emergency alert system and again all these grids are
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.760]  going in here's another one this is on drudge report right now it was top of
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.880]  the page just move to the right-hand side drudge report calm new street lights
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.200]  to have homeland security applications high-tech security to include speakers
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.560]  video surveillance emergency alerts this is just one company it's already been in
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.960]  place for 14 years it's just going in everywhere directly out of 1984 now I
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.000]  want to go to this video paralleling the genetic Armageddon the genetic
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.760]  takeover that is the end of humanity as we know it this is extremely powerful
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.120]  and of the greatest import stay with us when we come back I'll get into all the
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:44.960]  other news we'll be right back stay with us in the 1950s universal pictures put
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:52.000]  out a classic sci-fi horror film the thing and it's been likened to a carrot
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.480]  from outer space they dig up in the snow that had crashed in Antarctica on the
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:05.680]  south pole of this planet dug it up and then it was basically a shape shifter
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:12.160]  that would devour its prey and then copy them and then of course they had the
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:18.800]  John Carpenter classic in 1982 which is probably one of the best sci-fi horror
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.200]  films ever made in my humble opinion but you see we live in the real world and
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:30.000]  truth is stranger than fiction no we haven't had a alien that crashed
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.400]  millions of years ago in Antarctica that's been thawed out and it's now at
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:43.280]  a research facility absorbing the crew with a eye towards invading the main
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.960]  land and taking over the entire biosphere of the planet Earth no no no
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.280]  that's not happening and of course they're now re-releasing basically a
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.600]  remake of the 1982 from the reviews I've read no I'm talking about the real
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:10.280]  thing the real deal I'm talking about genetic engineers transhumanist working
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:17.240]  for the globalist who in their own words admit going back to the 1970s that
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:25.280]  they had a plan to patent every major food crop and then every major life form
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:34.120]  prolific life form on this planet and put artificial genes genetics DNA RNA into
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.520]  them to manipulate viruses bacteria and now that's been done with tens of
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.560]  thousands of different species in some cases hundreds of different species are
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.800]  being spliced together you know about spider goats that are part goat part
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.360]  spider that produce body armor in their milk you've read about the super salmon
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.480]  that University studies have shown will extinct the normal salmon that are in
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.960]  the ocean and these salmon different varieties have been mixed with other
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:11.000]  fish insects plants the list goes on and on you see that's the real thing you're
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  eating corn you're eating a GMO potato and it's had insect genes and other
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.320]  traits added to it it's had pharmacological traits in the BT corn
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:30.120]  and other crops where a pesticide is engineered to grow inside the corn to
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:36.280]  where field mice and insects can't eat it if they do they die but then you are
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:43.840]  fed this my point is as we prepare to enter 2012 we have a global ruling class
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.600]  that are playing God and who quite frankly don't know what they're doing
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.280]  I mean they were able to foresee with their futurist and their think tanks
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.320]  hiring the top minds in the world what could be done but they are endangering
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:04.600]  the planet itself while constantly distracting the public with fake
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  environmental crises like carbon dioxide that is 0.0 360 of the atmosphere the
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:20.440]  New World Order simply put our people trying to play God they've studied how
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:27.480]  humans operate as if they were an alien coming here from a foreign planet they
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:35.040]  have funded literally hundreds and hundreds of universities for more than 150
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:44.400]  years to study every facet of psychological spiritual physical processes
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:50.080]  that take place and they have tested and refined incredible tools of social
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.680]  control propaganda chemical control through the water and food supply this
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:03.400]  is all on record the globalists have also for at least 80 years engaged in
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.840]  lethal chemical and biological as well as radiological tests on prisoners
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:14.560]  foster children military personnel the list goes on and on you know about
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.200]  injecting people with syphilis you know about the horrors of children being
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:23.400]  radiated by the thousands in atomic studies in you know about four
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.240]  sterilizations going on right into the 1980s or at least you should know about
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.360]  that that is only the tip of the iceberg and it's being done to test these
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.400]  systems but also to test the personnel and to create larger pools of
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.920]  individuals that will carry out these type of activities because they enjoy
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.600]  the power because they believe the end justifies the means the point is the
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.760]  global ruling class believe they are a separate species from us and openly
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.400]  right about this they believe they have transcended the common man and are
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:08.160]  actively trying to poison and also socially dumb down the general
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.440]  population so that we will fit in to the mold and the typecast that they've
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.160]  made for us so when you see movies like John Carpenter's classic or this new
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:26.880]  one that just came out remember that the real world is a lot stranger than what
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.440]  Hollywood screenwriters can come up with and sure it's not as sexy it's not as
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:39.640]  shocking as a young heroine fighting the monster from deep space and there
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:44.800]  aren't bodies splitting apart and and in spewing out tentacles with razor sharp
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:53.320]  teeth and heroes standing up to it with flamethrowers and dynamite no in this
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:42:02.760]  war the thing the globalist system of control is simply taking over species
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:10.600]  after species infecting every major food crop every staple food animal and
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:17.560]  splicing new systems into their DNA that irrevocably spread into the entire
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:24.080]  family take the case of corn going back over a decade close to 90% of all known
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:31.160]  corn varieties and there are thousands originating in Mexico have now been
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:38.520]  infected the latest numbers I saw is that there is no known major cultivated
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:45.400]  crop unless it's in closed laboratories that has not been infected everything is
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:50.320]  being infected so in the thing it shows under an electron microscope the alien
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.800]  cells metastasizing and taking over the natural cells of the husky or of the
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.760]  human that it's infected but in reality this is already happening to us but it
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:06.400]  doesn't happen right away you see if a GMO crop was put out that caused people
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.080]  to mutate and bleed out and die or turn into something else right in front of
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:15.800]  you you would recognize it as a threat but because it's a slow creeping
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:21.840]  methodical death you're not aware of it we're designed to face a frontal assault
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:28.200]  a saber-toothed cat jumping out against a troop of hunting chromagnon we are not
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.560]  designed to deal with poison that's been added into our environment we're
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.240]  designed to just basically adapt to it or die and so the globalists have
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:44.920]  developed a very very sophisticated soft kill incremental ambient genetic
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:54.440]  Armageddon takeover system where it just slowly is ramped up if you look please
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:59.000]  for you and your family's sake for the future of this planet and the life
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.160]  forms that developed here over untold eons there is a total revolution by the
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.320]  quote scientific class in their lust for power in their lust for extended life
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.680]  in their lust for super weapons to dominate the globe they have already
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:26.480]  opened up a thousand times a thousand Pandora's boxes and if you just look at
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:34.160]  the admitted studies in guinea pigs rats mice dogs monkeys where the life
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:41.720]  cycles are in weeks months or years instead of human life cycles being in
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:48.080]  around 76 years in every major study within three generations with every
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:55.000]  major GMO crop where they've had cross PC splicing and genetic chimera cross
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.800]  clone manipulation in every case within three generations the genitals
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:07.320]  shrivel up to nothing fertility goes down to almost zero those that ate the
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.440]  genetically engineered toy they didn't actually show the problems in the first
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.760]  generation the second generation was slower growth slower onset for maturity
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.760]  but by the third generation that's when nearly all of the adults had lost the
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:27.680]  ability to have babies there are more horror movie type mutations where most
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:33.080]  of the young are born dead or deformed or the young are born small mentally
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.520]  retarded with hair growing out of their mouths eyeballs on the back of their
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.800]  head and within three generations it does get like a John Carpenter movie the
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.720]  thing this is not by accident they stack these traits and and genetic
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.720]  engineers that we've interviewed who worked for these companies have said
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.220]  hey this potato is sterilizing the rats they're like don't worry about that
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:01.440]  trait just move ahead so there are Trojan horse traits that have been added
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.160]  to all of these this is 21st century warfare and of course that's just the
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.800]  tip of the iceberg when we talk about chimeras and cross species clones and
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.320]  the island of Dr. Maru type things that are happening that H.C. Wells predicted
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:22.120]  over a hundred years ago would come to fruition the real revolution and why
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.920]  the globalists are so arrogant is they've created new classes of vaccines
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:31.840]  they call them vaccines that's a diversion they're really genetically
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.360]  engineered nanotech and they advertise it soon we've already developed it but
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.600]  soon we're going to get approval they say of a vaccine where you'll never be
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:44.480]  angry you'll never be sad or you'll never want to drink alcohol or use
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:51.600]  cocaine because the virus actually goes in and changes your brain chemistry
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.840]  listen to me the facts are in please for your own sake and the sake of our
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:03.000]  species let's not let these control freak psychopaths mutilate and vandalize
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.640]  and irrevocably damage the biosphere and the ancient genetic system of this
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:15.600]  planet so they can be on a power trip and play God look at the fruits of the
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.720]  new world order most cancers have more than tripled in the last two decades
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:29.000]  diabetes has doubled in the last decade all sorts of new cancers that never
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.320]  existed before are now appearing scores of vaccines have been found to be
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:42.880]  implanted with sterilants cancer viruses microplasms nanotech microplasms
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:48.680]  that are purely artificial the United States has the highest rates of every
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.000]  major cancer in the world including breast cancer and the system always
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.880]  talks about giving more money when you buy food or go to a movie to try to
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.800]  create cures for breast cancer instead of finding out why it's all skyrocketing
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:09.120]  why pancreatic cancer is skyrocketing and why the system is trying to block
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:18.040]  vitamins and minerals from the public again the globalist might as well be a
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:23.400]  space alien from 15 trillion miles away who crashed in Antarctica and got dug
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:29.520]  up and wants to wreck this planet and totally genetically absorb it like John
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.560]  Carpenter's the thing might as well be the globalist covered up the fact that
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.720]  Fukushima was many times Chernobyl and that the radiation levels were rising
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:48.360]  all across the United States and so the EPA's response was just to raise the
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.240]  level of isotopes in some cases 100,000 times what they said was
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:59.520]  previously safe this is the type of self-destructive truly demonic as only
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.240]  were to describe it behavior that we see coming out of the ruling class and
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:12.320]  it's time for people infected by cynicism and by a hatred of life to
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.400]  really ask yourself is this what you want to be part of the things that the
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.440]  globalists create are malformed abominations the entire biosphere is
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:28.320]  being absorbed it may already be irreversible a life cycle of these rats
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.560]  and mice and guinea pigs is just a few years and within three generations near
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:40.800]  total infertility and adult mental retardation total deformities still
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:50.440]  births just just a wreck species we are eating the same stuff but on average we
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.760]  have offspring every 20 years and already look at the mental retardation
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:01.480]  all the new problems all the new cancers the diseases and we are just one
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:07.520]  generation into this the mercury alone in the vaccines major study shows is
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:15.960]  causing massive irrevocable DNA damage that we're already seeing in this
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.760]  generation of your 25 years or so the numbers are off the chart but it's
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:25.480]  damaging the eggs of the girls that are being born now and they've got cadaver
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:28.800]  studies on young children that have died young girls and they've looked at their
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:38.280]  eggs they're nearly infertile even alien from a foreign planet wanted to come
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.320]  in and infiltrate and destroy humanity it couldn't do a better job than the
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:51.480]  globalist have done all right you've been warned all right ladies and gentlemen

[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.960]  renegades of mine the globalist have sought to dominate humanity for
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.400]  thousands of years and now they're doing it through chemical biological
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:24.280]  overlaid with programming and this was predicted years ago privately and now
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:28.000]  it's been confirmed since Gardasil's been given to 20-something million
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  girls fertility has plunged teen pregnancy has plunged and you're gonna
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  find those girls aren't gonna be having any kids dr. Sherry 10 penny on with
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.800]  that tonight anytime a government comes out and says you got to take something
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.640]  and runs the hoax and lies about the the deaths in the trials and it turns out
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.360]  the virus oh accidentally was almost completely intact accidentally bound to
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:56:00.520]  the adjuvant causing an autoimmune disorder and now they want your the
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.280]  Mexican government has been promised billions in aid and part of the
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:09.400]  agreement is they give all their girls a shot but you're not gonna hear your
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:14.560]  Mexican-American center in town tell you look out they're gonna tell you all day
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.160]  about Raza this Raza that they're gonna make sure your Raza is deader than a
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:20.320]  hammer
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:28.880]  what's it say the lover of life's not a center the ending is just the beginner
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:33.440]  the closer you get to the meaning the sooner you'll know you're dreaming
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:41.520]  well if it seems to be real well if it seems to be real it's illusion for every
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:49.200]  moment of truth there's confusion in life love can be seen as the answer but
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:55.480]  nobody bleeds for the dancer and it's on and on on and on and on it's heaven and
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.680]  hell
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:07.480]  Mexico now one of its most popular gods is the Grim Reaper and death will come
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:14.800]  and we love death here in America I've seen us old women on the flight to Las
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:20.640]  Vegas to do a TV report the skulls all over their purses people think skulls
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:27.920]  are tough skulls mean something every army that wears a skull brings death
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:35.240]  and evil our military never had skulls on its flags until World War two they
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.320]  thought will be tough like those Nazis will put skulls on things symbols
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:50.280]  signals logos mean something let my symbol be life but my symbol be a child
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:57.000]  or a field or a bird something healthy something happy something good not death
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.400]  they'll be kind enough for that and this system is an attack on the life force
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:08.760]  and the regenerative systems of life itself it is a takeover as we covered in
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:18.080]  that incredible piece I haven't named it yet we're going to get it up on info
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:21.360]  wars.com and prison planet calm the next few hours I'll give you before the show
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.160]  ends the name of that special video report on the takeover of the human
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:31.680]  system the end of humanity the end of man the end of humankind the extermination
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:40.400]  the soft-kill genetic armageddon third hour straight ahead stay with us

[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:55.360]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.520]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.360]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:06.120]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:10.560]  body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:14.880]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.400]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:22.880]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:30.080]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:34.400]  and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute

[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:33.520]  be joining us the balance of the hour coming up our story got linked on the
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:39.000]  drugs report top of the page today it's moved down on the lower left-hand side
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.760]  under the picture of mr. Napolitano new street lights to have homeland security
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:50.840]  applications drudge as usual even had a better headline than we did we go back
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:58.920]  to the drudge report dot com the master and the master headline writer here you
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.800]  watch you new street lights to have homeland security applications that's
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.760]  that he really doesn't crystallize really what's happening but I called Paul
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.000]  this morning I said this story's gonna get a lot of attention so I got a big
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.240]  feeling it is and I said there's a bunch of companies that have put in
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.080]  microphones and cameras and smart police command centers under Homeland
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:21.480]  Security watching and listening I said we're gonna get attacked for this even
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:24.960]  though you're linked to the company and Homeland Security I said beef the article
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:30.680]  that means add more sure enough there's a controversy in response to our article
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:35.880]  being linked on drudge the company behind the Intella streets illuminating
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:40.400]  concepts now pull the video from YouTube entirely presumably nervous about the
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:45.440]  negative publicity that could be generated from concerns about the street
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.920]  lights being used for Homeland Security purposes their words on ours we have
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.280]  added an alternative version I guess they put a new one up I got a call Paul but
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:58.520]  it may be subject removal anytime I got a call pause I'm just gonna have him look
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:01.440]  we've got a bunch of other articles about this so we'll just show you a bunch of
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.200]  companies in the Homeland Security doing it as I told him to do he's already
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.440]  added a bunch of stuff so I'm gonna bring ten Anderson up a couple minutes here
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:13.280]  couple minutes on the next side because I got to him late man I tell you I'm so
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:17.640]  recharge getting back from that three-day shoot with Jesse Ventura in
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:24.120]  Vegas because he was out there to film a private space propulsion thing I'm not
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.960]  gonna I'm not supposed to get into more of it but then we did some other stuff
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.560]  in the area there's a lot of military industrial complex stuff and but it's
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.760]  what happened while I was at the hotel in the morning in the evenings and flying
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.200]  out there and flying back was just incredible I don't even know if I'll
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.040]  get to my TSA audio today and what happened to me and everything because I
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.240]  can't do justice to it here I might do it on the nightly news too the nightly
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.640]  news is gonna be huge tonight oh by the way well let's just bring that up Ted
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:52.640]  huge things happening in Europe they're holding Europe hostage as we said they
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.000]  would threatening to totally plunge them into depression if they don't give them
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.960]  a deal now they're saying they might have a deal but what what it entails is
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:06.440]  taking the pension fund quote insurance or the the some of the European
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.520]  countries money and this is buried in the agreement and gold of course and
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:13.800]  silver is exploded as we said it would but you luckily bought it when it was
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:20.240]  lower so give us a crash crash pitch here Ted because a G Gordon Liddy said
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:24.520]  stay tuned for crash commercial messages you know my view on this is I'm very
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:30.360]  proud of my crash crash promotion of golden silver by silver at $5 now 30
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.360]  something by gold at 260 bucks now you know 1700 or so I mean I think people
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.680]  should really call you and get the best deal in town well they sure should I mean
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:47.480]  gold is seen a high today of 1728 currently up 1490 at 1720 50 silver
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:53.880]  seeing a high of 3382 just almost touching $34 an ounce Alex the video in
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:59.680]  the book right now at $73 delivered is so out of this so underpriced it's not
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:04.080]  even funny for those of you who haven't had a chance the American dream video
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.400]  puts together the new world order in a cartoon that is so entertaining that
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.440]  anybody will want to watch it but the other thing to Frank said 376 dollars
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.120]  walking Liberty halves at 1652 I mean there's just so many different buys that
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:22.360]  you can get into right now because gold just ran up through the roof you know
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:26.680]  and and and I don't know why people think that the economy pro economic
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:29.620]  problems are solved just because gold and silver took a little bit of a hit
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:33.880]  here recently of course it's gonna come back up again you know when you have the
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:37.320]  European Union doing what they're doing try to decide how much debt they're
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.760]  gonna they're gonna create and and how much they're gonna put the screw to
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:45.080]  screw balls to the people it's amazing but anyways I hope they don't release
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.940]  too many screwballs on us because I've been told I'm the chief screwball hey

[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:37.760]  homeland security applications I'm not just doing this because Lionel's here
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.040]  I'm gonna go back to Ted for just a moment because Lionel's made you know
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:44.000]  jokes about this at my roasting at the talkers conference where I was the
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.800]  keynote speaker earlier in the year how he likes to hear me call Watson on
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:53.520]  air actually I called Watson this morning he was just tuned in and I said
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:57.240]  look you're gonna need to add even more proof of this I know it's there I know
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:01.320]  you're linked to it you're gonna get attacked for this and he said okay and
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:05.000]  he did add some more but the companies now pull their video where they admit
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.880]  they've got homeland security applications because see the cover in 98 all
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.040]  over the country they put up microphones on on street lamps and they even hid some
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:18.160]  of them was he came out in the paper and Austin but later they said it's a gunshot
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.320]  detector never once they use it for gunshots they're there they're shotgun
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:26.440]  mics they can listen to you 100 yards away the company it turned out that time
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:31.720]  I went and ferried it out had audio online in a presentation about how it was
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.320]  really meant to record what people are talking about and send it through
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:40.120]  keyword software so this has been put up but you can they've got police towers
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:44.160]  these little telescoping towers that have microphones on them too so I'm gonna
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:50.800]  have Watson add that to his article I'm gonna have Watson let's just call Watson
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.880]  right now on air well you guys always call his home number I'm gonna call
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:58.720]  a cell this is just quicker because I want to finish with Ted briefly and tell
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.680]  people about something very exciting concerning the nightly news then we'll
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.640]  get to Lionel and go through all the news with him but of course none of this
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.320]  even pales and significance to this article Feds order YouTube to remove
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:17.720]  video for containing I'm only here hold on Watson let me finish this Watson's
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.560]  like sorry what are you talking about Feds order YouTube to remove video for
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.240]  containing government criticism do you realize the magnitude of this Google has
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:31.840]  released government request what the government's telling it to do this big
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.280]  report quite frankly this is what should be on dredge report but I mean he can't
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.400]  guess he can't link to only our stuff but this is the type of stuff Watson's
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:42.440]  ferreting out hey Watson I wanted to call you in a hurry so you're not on air but
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.720]  I'm on air talking to you remember this morning for airtime I called you and said
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:53.440]  we'd be attacked for this article remember I called you and said add stuff
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.720]  says yep he's a man of many words you know why I knew that I didn't have
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.280]  time for the show tell you why I knew that because that company wasn't I'll
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.480]  guarantee you exposed to admit it's for Homeland Security she just like with the
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:13.160]  mail trucks they say oh data transfer the post office is going to make make
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:18.040]  money now with with private wireless towers on top of the mail trucks and
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:21.360]  then they admitted that all there also be a Homeland Security application
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:25.400]  grabbing all your wireless data that's really what it's for the cover is the
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.160]  making money but the global's also like to pay for you know pay for what they're
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:34.280]  doing in a free market way while taxing us at the same time so I knew that so I
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.480]  know you've added that but also add the police towers that are gonna grab all
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.360]  the communications and have have all the bristling systems but I wanted you to
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:48.880]  specifically just tell me briefly you know what I'm gonna bring you up with
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:53.920]  Lionel I'm sure he's gonna love it because I haven't had time your article
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:58.440]  the update says that it was that they pulled the video but an added but but
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.680]  you have an alternative version do you mean you found a clip that somebody
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.840]  already downloaded and put on another YouTube site not their official site or
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:08.000]  or have they altered it
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:15.200]  okay so the original was deleted but you were able to find explain that to
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:19.320]  folks say we were able to find one that was copied get it while you can but but
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.040]  what I'm saying is folks will say oh well never mind I'm saying throw a bunch
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:27.440]  more on there because this is not the only example of this look up gunshot
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.720]  detectors well you know it's in my film police day two thousand 1999 I show the
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:34.880]  Austin American statesman and all that they're really microphones listening to
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.520]  us and now that now the slaves are ready to wake up and not be slaves and
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:41.800]  actually see this but like like like you wrote that article yesterday about
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:45.400]  Glenn Beck is worried about the EAS switching stuff off and that's great we
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.960]  want to give him credit when he starts going in the right direction all
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.040]  broadcasters should be talking about this but why not add my video from February
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:56.720]  detailing it all see what I mean I mean I mean it's almost like we're ashamed of
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.360]  how right we are Paul we need to let folks know we don't we're talking about
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:07.280]  you see what I'm saying well you're a genius you're on fire as usual and a
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.440]  good job with your latest reports you know what Lionel's holding we're going
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:15.600]  to overdrive the day I really apologize for all of this folks I've been out of
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:21.160]  town and I'm so wound up with energy it's just driving me crazy Paul at the
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.360]  bottom of the hour just five minutes I know Lionel wants to talk to you he's a
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  big fan of you so I'm gonna have you call in then because he's on video Skype
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.920]  and then I want to get your take on everything okay especially this article
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.280]  you wrote about feds order YouTube to remove video for containing government
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.760]  criticism oh they'll never stick their hands down our pants they'll never put
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:41.680]  floor on the water they'll never give people gargles old shots that kill us
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:45.280]  again I'm getting to where I'm so conditioned this comes out and is
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:48.560]  documented by Google admitting it but they're taking videos down as the
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:51.840]  government tells them to because it's critical of the government and I'm not
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.240]  even upset by this Paul do you realize what that means we're being conditioned
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:04.160]  here yep that's right Paul says I will get you on later I appreciate you buddy
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:09.720]  all right thank you we're gonna get a Lionel here in just a moment
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:14.280]  normally if I was this wound up I would even cancel gas but Lionel is so good
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.360]  he's there but I apologize have any months in minutes late finishing up with
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:20.560]  Ted and the crash infomercial for a minute or two because I haven't plugged
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.040]  stuff all day okay and like other radio hosts would every segment I didn't do it
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.200]  all in one spot I haven't even told you since yesterday we launched 15 day free
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.480]  trial we'll put it on screen go to prisonplanet.tv you got the nightly
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.480]  news Alex Jones live that's this show radio TV you got special reports the
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:40.840]  rants is the only area I haven't been updating I'm sort of doing a bunch of
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.600]  those but a few technical things on that because I'm not very technical and I'm
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.960]  trouble uploading to it when I'm at home point is it's there 15 cents a day you
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:56.200]  fund our operation but I've done Limex always copying me and everything on his
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:59.640]  subscription site so I decided to go ahead and copy him he has a 14-day trial
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.800]  I have a 15-day free trial but everybody does free trials the point is

[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:30.240]  doing this 15-day free trial is we keep getting customer service emails saying I
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.240]  went and tried to watch your nightly news and I got an advertisement yeah if

[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.520]  is prisonplanet.tv 15-day free trial watching the news now going back to
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.120]  Ted Anderson Ted I told people to get gold and silver you know silver one was
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.840]  five dollars gold when it was 260 I feel great here because I know you've got the
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.800]  best deals out there I could buy gold anywhere as you know Ted I buy from one
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.320]  guy Ted Anderson few times I bought it locally but I can't even get deals as
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:11.600]  good as you because you buy when it's low sell when it's high at the old price
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.480]  so you've got gold way lower than what it was just a few months ago you before it
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:22.760]  dipped and then way lower than it is right now tell folks where this gold and
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:26.200]  silver is what level of the market you bought it at what you've got left how
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:29.320]  long till that runs out you've got to go up give people just in a minute or two a
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:34.200]  listing of the prices well I mean we're trading about 1675 when I was in there
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.320]  buying my positions right now we're at 1721 so that kind of gives you an idea
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.760]  where we're at I mean that Frank and forecaster where you get the full-year
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:46.600]  subscription to Bob's newsletter that's at 376 that's like buying gold at like
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:50.800]  $1100 an ounce a little less than that actually when you consider the fact that
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:55.000]  you get the subscription but then what about that silver deal I mean Alex for
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.680]  $73 I mean I've been holding that price down since gold or one silver was at
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:06.480]  $26 an ounce right now we've seen a high of 3382 currently right now 3349 and
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:10.160]  then you get the video on the book along with it I mean people need to know
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.800]  about the world New World Order everything you've been talking about is
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:17.360]  this the central control that we have coming down upon us this is central
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:21.960]  control central control well I mean that's that's just it we have you know
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:26.160]  video surveillance I mean the way that they're GMO foods I mean what else do
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:30.400]  you want I mean come on you're gonna need gold and silver the reason why our
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:33.800]  forefathers said that you should have gold and silver as money because they
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:36.960]  didn't want people like we have right now in control of the government and
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:41.280]  also the world know at this point and if you don't understand what I'm talking
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.960]  about you should get that American dream video because it's gonna lay it out for
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.280]  you in such a simple that's right it's a great deal to get two silver dollars for
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:52.720]  73 bucks but they have shipping free the free video the free book you can't
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:18:03.160]  beat it 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 but what folks ask about the radio gold and
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.160]  silver specials they've got everything I mean Ted you were telling me you've
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:10.440]  still got a pretty good smattering of everything at the older lower prices yeah
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:14.560]  yeah we do I mean you can get the U.S. seagulls we have silver silver maple
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:17.760]  leaves that are at a discount oh my god it was a whole bunch of stuff those
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:23.680]  maple leaves are some of my favorites along with the buffaloes 800 686 2237
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:28.280]  how much is silver and gold up today well right now silver is at hang on a
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:34.160]  second I just gotta get back there 1560 silver's up 12 cents today at 3339 but
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:38.880]  been as high as 3382 I mean the EU right now is meeting and they're trying to
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:42.440]  decide how much of the Europeans money they're gonna steal what do you think
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:48.840]  no the deal looks like they're gonna do is to take the pension fund insurance the
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:53.000]  actual money that's in there and give it to the bankers on derivatives and tell
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.760]  people it was Greece's fault I mean how about they said some Eskimos fault they're
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:00.280]  not even involved in it it's just like look Greece Greece look over here while
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:05.040]  they're stealing everything 800 686 237 Ted Anderson thank you so much for
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:09.080]  spending time with us you got it Alex now I apologize to Lionel for getting him

[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:36.160]  I've been ranting I don't know if you were listening earlier in the show but
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:40.560]  Lionel it's getting crazy little boys be given cervical cancer shots because
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:44.720]  they have cervixes and it's because they give the girls the disease the little
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:48.000]  10-year-old boys are bad all the psychological warfare they won't even
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.640]  say it's Gardasil they don't want to say the name of the Wicked Merc we've got
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:57.920]  street lights spying on people we've got literal bedlam unfolding homeland
[02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:02.120]  security telling the YouTube to pull videos critical of the government I mean
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:07.840]  have we entered some alternate dimension of like the Soviets took America over
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:13.000]  and and I mean we're living in a in a fruitcakeville my friend well Alex I
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:20.520]  would suggest that we have entered in a an alternate dementia dimension let me
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:22.960]  explain a couple of things that first of all I want to thank you very much for
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.720]  having me back it is indeed an honor to be here with you and I mean that
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:32.040]  absolutely sincerely the biggest problem that I have but I mentioned it on my
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:37.560]  podcast of Lionel media I do nightly commentaries in New York and Alex the
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:40.960]  people want to know what's going on the people are extremely interested in
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:44.680]  knowing what's going on because they sense something but the number one
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:49.640]  problem in our country and the world happens to deal with the subject that
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:55.280]  people feel is arcane reckoned I beyond their comprehension and that is
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:22:03.560]  currency credit monetary system global currency the euro the dollar when you
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:09.000]  tell people this Alex and when you tell them that there is no no piece of data
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:15.240]  no or datum no subject that will affect them as seriously as this they start
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:20.560]  their eyes kind of roll back I suggest to people that what they should do is on
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:25.160]  any given day check out your website info wars or prison planet just
[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:34.520]  pick anything on the crisis if you will and let it then take you because what
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:38.680]  you do is you are a resource center I have learned more and I thought I knew
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:42.480]  I'm a good college graduate and a lawyer and all that business I have learned
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.720]  more about fundamental economics not economics that you teach learned in
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:51.120]  school not Keynesian supply and demand and that sort of thing but the
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:55.680]  politicized version of economics and I'm telling you right now that is the
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:00.280]  biggest single source of all of the problems that we have in this world now
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:06.200]  right now I'm in New York and downtown is occupied Wall Street something that
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:12.840]  the mainstream sock puppet echo chamber stenographic bottom-sold corporate
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:18.560]  media are trying to whittle away in terms of the efficacy or the message for a
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:22.680]  couple of reasons first they don't have enough time number two they don't
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:27.320]  understand it and Alex the strangest thing is happening there is this weird
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:32.720]  conflation this connection between people who are protesting what is what
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:38.120]  could be the very implosion of not only our our country but the world and they're
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:43.400]  they're making this connection between these protesters and hippies or the
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:49.840]  SDS and long hair every single night just look around what do they talk about
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:54.040]  there is something happening not to to borrow from Steven stills but there's
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:59.720]  something happening here this occupied movement is viral and what they're what
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:05.480]  a lot of people are focusing on is how there are sanitary problems or how
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:11.120]  somebody may be holding up a poster or a placard and these are our job
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.000]  provocateur these are agent provocateurs but we know that but instead of
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  looking at the message they're picking it apart now here's the question I have
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:25.320]  for you if they took that inquiry that that desire to know the truth and you
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:29.760]  walked up to somebody and said I've got something I'd like to ask you and I ask
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:33.960]  my friends it's in fact I ask all of your viewers and listeners to try this
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:38.760]  pick a friend of yours who knows the most a real pain in the neck know it all
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:43.800]  somebody who knows everything and you say you know Bob you're a smart guy if
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:49.320]  anybody would know this you would could you please explain to me the basics the
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:54.960]  rudiments of the Federal Reserve sit back and just watch their eyes flutter
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:01.960]  and they'll say well it's this inquiry demanding that these people all over the
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:07.680]  world say specifically in explicate and limb absuriatum all that they're about
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:15.720]  that inquiry is lost when it comes to this basic central private bank that is
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:22.080]  under the radar so a part of our fabric and not one person in the mainstream
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:28.760]  media the Ted Baxter media has ever even thought to say hey this week instead of
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.880]  things in your bathroom that can kill you why don't we do a little piece on the
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:39.240]  Federal Reserve the most mysterious subject known to man and it's happening
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.560]  right now Alex and nobody knows this they have no idea right now I tell
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:48.280]  people look to Europe look what's happening now may I also add some me
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:54.000]  Alex one of the biggest problems you have and I had is we use words and people
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  don't understand the sting of it you don't understand and I mentioned this on
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.960]  Lionelmedia.com and I try it and people are frankly my friends are getting
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:08.800]  tired of it because I saw like a broken record Alex the word globalism sounds
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.920]  wonderful global remember uh co-commercials I like to teach the world
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:22.600]  to say harmony interconnectivity of the human race cooperation global it sounds
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:27.960]  terrific what we're talking about is again part of this fundamental virus
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:34.160]  that's affecting everything is we're a subjugation we're ceding jurisdiction the
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:41.400]  United States of America has become a part of this huge international global
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:47.080]  superstructure one of the things that should have absolutely caused people to
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:51.600]  riot in the streets is when our president and it doesn't matter if it's
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:59.960]  president Obama president Bush or anybody when he said that NATO NATO ordered
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:05.880]  our troops into Libya and by the way don't give me these definitional
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:11.960]  hair splitings of kinetic military action and support and training do you
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:18.840]  know Alex what that meant when NATO is telling us we have lost the battle
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.160]  completely well it's even worse than that and again we just glaze over it
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:28.200]  even I do we're being broken like a pimp breaks the prostitute and just getting
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.640]  used to being slapped in the face now knocking our teeth out you know putting
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:38.560]  cigarettes out on us you know making us sleep in a dog cage I guess it's got to
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.200]  the point I mean just to just to back you up it's gotten to the point where
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:47.080]  Congress came to him and said look we're more mongers we'll give you the
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.120]  authorization but you got to get permission from us under the
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.880]  Constitution and Obama said no I'm doing this for the credibility of the UN and
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:01.200]  NATO saying I'm saying they're our boss literally engaging in treason that's
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.640]  what it is I've had constitutional scholars on this is wallowing in our
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:12.000]  face and it's just like that Google now admits and it's not even a news item
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.520]  that the feds are ordering them to remove videos critical of the government
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:20.280]  I mean I mean we've entered we've entered quite a time while now one of the
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.640]  things Alex that you brought up and I talk about this on my pixel ebb and
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:30.840]  commentaries Lionelmedia.com again to the point where I'm a broken record what
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:35.680]  the America and by the way I'm I don't want to say I don't want to make it
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:40.200]  sound like I'm saying that my American brothers and sisters are stupid or real
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:45.840]  informed I don't want to say that I think that we and I include myself are hard
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:50.560]  working and good intention but you know Alex what will kill us is this sense of
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:55.640]  exceptionalism this idea that people have that this that we are indeed the
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:01.760]  city on the hill that we are blessed by God or by some force field that protects
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:06.680]  us through through some type of divine protection or some weird cosmic
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:12.000]  prophylactic that prevents us from an internal internecine collapse and I'm
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.560]  telling you that's going to be our problem one of the things which amazes
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:21.520]  me also is how the world of semantics how neuro linguistic programming and how
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:27.920]  I can shapeshift the enemy for example when you have a when you have Libya now
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:31.600]  I know we all stay there let's get the living only come back shifting straight
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.280]  ahead and how they manipulate and flip terms and do all of this this idea it
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:40.960]  can't happen here TSA can't do that here fellow reserve can't do that here
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.360]  Gardasil can't do that here they've done it all they're gonna do a lot more if we

[02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:00.640]  audio video dealing with the takeover of the entire biosphere including human
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:04.400]  genetics what's being implanted in us via the vaccines the GMO here's the
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:12.320]  economist and man-made life how about and the globalist played God but what is
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:20.640]  the dyslexic globalist play does he play dog that's a jaren pun and man-made
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:28.880]  life now it took life and perverted it and spliced it man didn't make life and
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:34.560]  again you're a free creature why are they allowed to trespass on your body
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:41.000]  trespass into the food their GMO spreading now what Lionel's getting at
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.840]  here is at the heart of it and the beginning of it is believing it can't
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:50.040]  happen here we're the best we're the greatest this weird fake pride yeah
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:57.320]  America does lead in cancer and diabetes and infant mortality now and it leads
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:02.200]  in everything bad prison populations in fact I'm gonna do a piece soon America
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:10.360]  is is the leader and going straight to hell America that's a good one is the
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:18.200]  leader in going straight to hell there you go see the bigger they are the harder
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:23.920]  they fall like the Roman Empire and what happens is once the public and I won't
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.080]  allow to speak to this because that's where he's going that's the meat of this
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:38.520]  on his perspective on it once the public has bought into a little corruption in
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.080]  fact I was reading about Caesar and how he didn't quote corruptions it was the
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.600]  process of corrupting someone it starts with something small like they tried to
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:51.320]  bribe Serpico in New York with something small here's a necklace just take it the
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:55.120]  guys don't feel better if you do you know it's hospitality you're part of a
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:01.040]  family now that's how this works and so Americans have put up with so much that
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.600]  now it's gotten blaringly ridiculous world governments being admitted a
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:07.760]  corporate private world government and they'll still laugh and say you're a
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:10.720]  coop for believing in it but yeah we need a global government but it's
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.440]  undemocratic it's run by a bunch of really cold-blooded people now Lionel was
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.920]  getting to the hypocrisy of Libya and the semantics I was on the plane with the
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:25.040]  sergeant flying his dead buddy back he'd done seven tours his buddy had done I
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:28.240]  think he said seven as well in different places he was going to burying him at
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.680]  Fort Hood and I said but what about Al Qaeda being the main group in there and
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:34.800]  all this and what about the opium being grown he's like well we do what we have
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:39.760]  to do but I thought we're fighting Al Qaeda and they had TSA there at the
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.840]  plane sticking their hands down his pants he's like well that's what we have to
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.280]  do for America oh they're not America then you know we just run in fear because
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.800]  somebody might try something and by that extension Al Qaeda might try to blow up a
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:55.240]  cornfield we got to have guards in cornfields well actually that's the
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:58.880]  cashless society tracker system we're in the future you'll need an authorization
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:02.200]  to go anywhere and everywhere you go will be pre-approved the government
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:06.120]  admits this you're like that'll never happen all this other stuff would never
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.080]  happen it's a plan to opolis read about it in their own word just Google
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:14.760]  plan to opolis you'll be at globalist think tank sites with you and approval
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:18.200]  you'll reach stuff they came with 20 years ago is now in place we live in a
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:25.640]  planned society and the planners are eugenicist extremist control freaks we
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:29.880]  live in a grid that's not done being built yet it's not finished but it's
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:32.880]  almost like they're building a guillotine or gallows and they're saying yeah
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:36.520]  we're gonna hang you in that next week and I'm like well I don't need to be huh
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:41.040]  I don't deserve this no one back to Lionel I'm sorry you have to come on
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:44.880]  today when I'm really wound up but getting into your point about samanics
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:50.280]  things to us first of all you know Alex I'm again I talk about this and I do
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:56.680]  this seven nights a week in New York and people come up to me literally and I'm
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:00.760]  not getting on some ways I'm a man of the people and they will say constantly
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:07.200]  thank you for telling the truth there is a hunger and a thirst Alex that people
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:11.120]  are yearning for and they keep looking like Neil Young said whatever that song
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.520]  was 300 channels and nothing's on what I want to do one time Alex and I mentioned
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.160]  this on my podcasting site at Lionel media dot com and by Twitter I got my
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:24.920]  always Twitter at Lionel media and I also retweet what you say and and
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:31.240]  everybody to get this message out information will set us free data will
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:38.560]  set us free if this the worst thing in the world for this world for the leaders
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.480]  for people who are not necessarily psychopath by nature but who do
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.280]  psychopathic things the worst thing that could ever happen to them is if the
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:53.000]  world wakes up because right now we can drown the world in just our bodily
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.160]  fluids we're that many the only thing that keeps the people down is ignorance
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:03.680]  nations and the worst thing Alex this idea of American exceptionalism that
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:08.520]  we're different and that all of the stuff that we see it in the EU and we see
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.760]  a calamity in the streets of Greece and rioting and starvation and that that
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.720]  happens over there that that can't come here let me also tell you this I love to
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:23.480]  do with you one time I kind of like a post-Orwellian movie a movie if you
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:28.840]  will about dystopia and I want to talk about the future and we will have new
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:34.720]  governmental offices and in addition to the central bank which will be the Fed
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:38.960]  and which will supply and virtually everything I want to be in the general
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.560]  services like we have the attorney general and we have the surgeon general I
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:50.200]  want to be the psychologist general and what I want to do is I create the meme
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:56.200]  the memetics the psychological construct that gives people the idea of what to
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:02.840]  believe and what not to believe and words are my palette words are my weapons I
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:09.440]  rephrase things for example when somebody tells you the truth when somebody
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.840]  that tells you that something you can Alex as you do and I love the way you go
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.240]  from one thought to another I do it too you are the human Pachinko machine you
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.680]  go from one to the next and I do it too they call a desultory because
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:26.960]  literally sometimes you have to stop and take a deep breath because you're being
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:33.760]  hit with so many you're being bombarded like with nuclear I coming at you you
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.840]  you feel like you can't process all this but what I want to do is this rule
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:42.760]  number one whenever somebody poses something to you no matter the fact you
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:48.360]  can show videotape you can talk about the government putting surveillance cameras
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:56.080]  in homes and micro whatever you can pick the most awful civil libertarian scary
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.960]  story there is and what I as the psychologist general of the United
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:08.800]  States will pronounce is you are a conspiracy theorist you're a nut job
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:13.080]  you're a paranoid you're an aluminum foil by the way tinfoils out we were
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.600]  aluminum you know gordon all one times that I love this he said I'm not a
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:23.520]  conspiracy theorist I'm a conspiracy analyst I'm going to literally reframe
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:30.040]  bad news and make it sound crazy then you're a naysayer oh you must be one of
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.840]  those Alex Jones types I what's the what's the matter with you you really
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:40.640]  hate America what now next what I do is I use key words for example let's go
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:47.640]  back to our great our great history the rebel freedom fighter for as long as I
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:51.960]  remember Alex somebody said one man's terrorist is another man's freedom
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:59.960]  fighter we had Gaddafi who replaces him the LIFG the Libyan or the Libyan
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:06.840]  Islamic fighting group Al-Qaeda this was teaming up with NATO who is the NTC by
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:11.360]  the way folks cannot handle the initialisms in the in the acronyms the
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:16.800]  National Transition Council these are puppet groups for Al-Qaeda you've got
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.160]  and by the way you and your pieces with Webster Tarpley have been so informative
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:27.640]  look at where based upon panic I mean West Point documents look at Syrinaica
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:32.840]  look at Benghazi and Tobruk and Darna this is this is the South Central of
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:38.040]  Al-Qaeda it's its corporate headquarters you also have the Fizan the black
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:43.120]  Libyans who aren't necessarily on board you have to pull a Tanya we have taken
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:49.760]  this gerrymandered cobbled together fractious Libya and we have made it sound
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:56.800]  like it's this unified group and we have called rebels which is Al-Qaeda we've
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:01.640]  called them freedom fighters and the people who are Libyans who live there
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:08.200]  are hardcore Gaddafi loyalists and with that right now and nobody this is the
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:11.840]  part that gets me out it's this is the part that I will never understand major
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:17.320]  mainstream media corporate Ted Baxter sock puppet stenographic cookie cutter
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:22.600]  echo chambered they're not reporters they're repeaters they repeat what the
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:27.040]  administration whoever it is whoever we remember it like you say the left right
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:31.240]  paradigm is an illusion whoever's in charge here is your talking boys tonight
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:36.520]  so they send some war correspondent to the middle of Tripoli or wherever cert
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:42.440]  and all they do is they say look like a child crying like an adult jiggling
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:47.520]  keys look look at all this see this look at the war isn't that cool great now see
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:53.240]  you haven't told me anything who are these people who's who invited us in by
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:57.840]  the way it's confirmed most of them as you said our actual Al-Qaeda the leader
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.880]  is they're putting in Sharia law and they're slaughtering the blacks who were
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:06.900]  part of Africa after all it is Africa all of this is happening but now they're
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:10.760]  already starting to spin our military better come in there because Al-Qaeda
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:16.640]  somehow is taking the country over so so so again not missing a beat now our
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:21.640]  military might have to go in to maintain order and stop Al-Qaeda after they put
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:27.440]  Al-Qaeda in no Alex you've talked about this and again I do it on Lionel media
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:30.800]  dot com and I talked about it all the time and it's so much of it you know
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.560]  we're kind of like echo chambers mutual echo chambers and again you are at the
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:39.120]  top of the pyramid though I don't want to say pyramid because that has a weird
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:47.160]  connotation here but there are ideas here of this one to ask me to come in ask
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:52.600]  me to help you I can foment rebels anywhere what would have happened
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:57.440]  assuming we were a country that was weak enough but what if an exterior country
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:04.800]  took our clan or our SDS or our mother weathermen in the 60s and fortified them
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:09.680]  with an actual corporate structure with an organizational hierarchy of how to
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:15.000]  change what if they funded them what if the clan came in like some of these
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.240]  groups because we don't know who these groups are and then all of a sudden when
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:23.360]  chaos breaks out you know if you have a hornets nest in your backyard Alex and
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.640]  I'm the exterminator and you say I've got this hornets nest there's a million
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:34.400]  hornets in there but the nest amazingly encases these the next access kind of a
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:39.000]  holder the potential for disaster is awful and I come in there with a baseball
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.760]  bat and I smash up the nest as a great I took care of the nest so what happens
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:48.280]  is step one chaos step two we're we the world
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:54.680]  reinvited in to fix up this mess help us let me ask you something how many
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:59.440]  people have ever heard of african how many have ever heard about this this
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:06.040]  megabase in Djibouti how many have has how many people know more about the
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:09.840]  Michael Jackson from which I find it interesting what's it I like trash no
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:13.640]  but that's how they distract and and we predicted an Obama deception almost three
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:17.800]  years ago that they would invade Africa through Libya use it as a base for
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:22.000]  african now they're saying they've got to have drones out of Libya to fight
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.080]  al-Qaeda in surrounding areas when in truth they just give an al-Qaeda control
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:32.120]  of Libya and as you said even the army war college and West Point admit that
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:35.480]  and I brought it up to a military man this weekend he said no I know about
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:40.360]  that but he said that's just the way it is so so it's this mind control we give
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:43.680]  our rights up to fight al-Qaeda and then we give out to kind of control but I
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.760]  want to bring Watson in here for a moment to to a shift gears into another
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:55.440]  subject what do you make vinyl of the fact that the feds have ordered YouTube
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:59.080]  to remove video for containing government criticism I want to get your
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:03.000]  take on this after you hear Watson talk about his article that's up on info
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:07.880]  wars.com certainly US authorities hit Google with 70% rise in takedown orders
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:15.280]  and it goes on that Google has now well I released that information and we're
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:18.640]  gonna get Paul's take on that real quick and then get your take on it Paul tell
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:22.960]  folks the meat of this article for those that haven't read it yet
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:27.560]  well it's basically the release of Google's new transparency report which
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:34.600]  breaks down country by country what the nature and amount of takedown orders
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.280]  they've received from government and this is not only YouTube videos it's
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:45.160]  search terms and also things like images on Google images so the government
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:49.240]  comes in with an order then Google decides whether or not to remove it
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:55.560]  according to this new report the US well US authorities which means both the
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:01.360]  government the federal government and law enforcement authorities bombarded
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:07.440]  Google with 70% increase in takedown orders over the course of the last year
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.240]  compared to the previous reporting period and I went in and looked at the
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.680]  actual report itself because this was reported on other technology websites
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:21.120]  but they didn't pick up the key thing which was when you actually go to the
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:26.720]  breakdown of the report on what exactly the US government or US authorities
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:33.960]  wanted removed one of the examples given is for the reason that a video was
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.760]  removed from YouTube is quote government criticism and it doesn't say
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:43.160]  whether YouTube complied with the request or not they did comply with
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:48.320]  63% of requests but it's just the bombshell fact that the US government
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:52.680]  and this was the federal government because the ones related to police
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:57.400]  brutality which law enforcement authorities asked YouTube to remove
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.760]  were in a separate category called defamation and by the way I hope people
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:05.920]  realize the magnitude we've had senators and people saying I need to be able to
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:08.960]  call YouTube and have something taken down now they're announcing they're
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:12.040]  going to take stuff down without a court order so this is the internet kill
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:16.760]  switch but but implemented in an a la carte way stay there Paul let's get
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.280]  Lionel's take on this Lionel what do you think is a media critic you know one of
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.280]  the things which I worry about not as a media critic but also as a lawyer
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:29.600]  somebody also conversant with the First Amendment as I love the way people will
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:35.320]  use different vehicles Alex and Paul to to take something down what you're going
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:41.280]  to see in the future is the election of copyright laws copyright laws will be
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:46.520]  the vehicle which is the easiest to understand which will allow people to
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:52.240]  remove information that is quote not copyrighted they will make a claim
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:55.960]  whether it's the government or individuals or I don't know but they
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:01.840]  will make a claim using a vehicle that has the patina of legitimacy the
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:08.000]  problem though is that is aside from that to try to invigorate the population
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.600]  to explain to them do you know what this means do you understand that YouTube
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:18.560]  is the same as a book or an iPad or an iPad whatever let me stop you let me
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:21.440]  stop you we gotta go break this is genius we're gonna do some overdrive with
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:24.840]  both of you but stay there folks he's absolutely right it's already happened in
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:28.160]  this new federal international announcement the government will decide
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.120]  of its copyright with no hearing and companies will be able to take the stuff
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:37.160]  down it's like they're trying to sue Skype Fox News is for using the word
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:42.480]  sky in their name and so it's literal copywriting of words but then you don't
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:46.760]  get a hearing because it would be thrown out like these ride-haven suits have
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:52.200]  been no the government just takes it down because somebody said it was their
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:56.400]  copyright so this is already begun and he has Lionel is a former prosecutor so
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:00.800]  we'll get his view on that get Watson's take on this as well stay with us

[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:51.680]  and you put this watch on it first as a cat this is clunky after a period of
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.760]  time the stimulus of the watch because it's over and over and over again
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:03.560]  because it's systematic it's successive it's repeated the novelty wears off it's
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:08.280]  called habituation you don't even know what's there when you're an American
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:15.000]  citizen even someone as astute as you and Paul after a while if you literally
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.840]  watch every bit of news tour you are so inundated that sometimes you can through
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:25.080]  a process called learned helplessness just give up no no no let me stop you
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:29.480]  that's the thing is that I used to get even more mad at the TSA and more mad
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.400]  and they they know they're pushing it I've seen corporate documents where they
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:38.040]  said a 87% hate what we're doing with the cashless society but our studies
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:41.880]  also show they will conform we have to force it through on them that the thing
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:47.280]  is it's all premeditated and and but if we're conscious of this we we can
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:52.160]  defeat it but what happens also is what the citizen will say how many times have
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:56.960]  you heard this look there's nothing I can do just like privacy me another
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.440]  example going back to my idea of music and not only it's not let me stop you
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:03.320]  again we're going to overdrive you can do it
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:07.960]  fairly listen what you just said though about this this like psychologies are in
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:12.600]  a dystopic future that's what they do now I'm seeing a trend if you have a view
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:17.120]  on something it's a conspiracy theory something that's admitted fact blue car
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:21.440]  red car you want blue car and they want to sell you red car that's a conspiracy
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:26.280]  theory it's like a it's like a pejorative now indeed one of the things
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:29.920]  are going to do also and you've talked about this going back to copyright I
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:34.280]  never thought I'd live to see intellectual property you were used as
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.800]  as subterfuge for example everybody's got this is going to be Steve Jobs's
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:42.120]  legacy this is gonna be the phone everybody's got a phone what's happening
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:47.200]  right now is you're going to be going to a concert and this new device which is
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:52.000]  you'll have in all phones eventually allows a venue to put out a particular
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:57.280]  beam some type of a sensor that will turn the video capabilities of your phone
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:00.840]  off they've announced that the police cars are gonna have it already done
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:05.120]  copyright protection right makes sense so therefore we're then going to put
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:09.600]  this in all the phones and we of course like sheeple we're just not our head in
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:14.360]  obeisance learn help us is okay sure whatever now eventually now that
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:18.600]  everybody's got the device the next time you go to let's say an occupied
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:23.240]  Wall Street or something in Austin or something in Chicago and police or
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:28.560]  anybody are about to converge and do some pretty serious harm a police officer
[02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:34.320]  or army anybody can push a button on their lapel and activate that that's
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:37.680]  already happening under global standardization this stuff's being hard
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:45.480]  wired as Trojan horses and everything stay with us thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:53.600]  visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:58.040]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:02.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:05.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:09.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:14.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:59:14.520 --> 02:59:18.520]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:22.320]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:25.960]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:59:25.960 --> 02:59:30.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:33.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:37.160]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:41.960]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:46.200]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:57.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:12.640]  Broadcasting Network network ladies and gentlemen we are into overdrive by the
[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:16.560]  way we got breaking news on Gardasil haven't even gotten to tonight the
[03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:23.240]  correlation with pregnancy being down it's been up for decades down when you
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:26.680]  get 20 something million girls taking it and we're gonna show you you in
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:30.520]  examples and Rockefeller documents dealing with sterilization Lionel is
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:35.880]  our guest Watson is riding shotgun with us Watson what he's saying is the
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:39.400]  admitted plan we're through global standardization these international
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:45.480]  treaties on copyright cell phones regular phones all computers that's what
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:53.360]  Shazam and all this stuff is where where now YouTube every video you upload is
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:58.160]  run through an encoder of a database and routinely even though I have
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:03.080]  authorization from the company itself to have shooter Jennings in police state
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.120]  for we still had to fire counterclaims or have it taken down because it didn't
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:12.020]  matter it heard that music and knew it was there or Paul a few weeks ago you
[03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:16.360]  played it like a 30-second clip of a television station in Canada promoting
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:22.120]  you know a casual society and all this they didn't follow the complaint it ran
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.320]  through a computer it was clearly fair use commentary it was clearly you playing
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:29.380]  it and saying look how they're wrong totally protected under every court
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:32.760]  case we have a lawyer out here can break it down for us but I already studied
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:37.160]  it myself I'm a lawyer when it comes to this stuff and so we had to file the
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.840]  former the the counterclaim but 99% of people don't know how to do that and
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:46.360]  now the feds are saying they don't care one time your website's gone period and
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:49.240]  then you'll be blacklisted on the internet because now it's going to be a
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:53.000]  digital thumbprint to get online you get one violation you're never on the web
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:56.800]  again and then you're going to be drug off by cybersecurity they've set up give
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.160]  you somehow hack in under another identity now you can't even work and
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:04.240]  live in society because you're on this digital probation when you never went
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:07.080]  through a regular court system Lionel that's what you're talking about isn't
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:12.200]  it that is indeed part of the process may also talk about something which is
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:16.400]  another aspect of it because remember going back to what I said originally if
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:21.160]  I could be the psychologist general and I could systematically habituate the
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:26.640]  people to something in 1975 there was a TV show called SWAT first came out with
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:31.120]  SWAT teams were brand new special weapons and tactics remember that ABC I
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:35.840]  think it was in the old days to show you how subtle this is and it may not seem
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.240]  like much to people but to me that's a lot the idea of a SWAT team that was a
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:46.000]  van a van that went to where the the suspect was or the hostage situation
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:51.720]  was and the police officers changed from their regular you know you uniform into
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:58.680]  the militaristic helmet Kevlar M4s automatic weapons it was a process now
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:05.920]  that's been eliminated we have overnight through this very subtle very gradual
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:12.560]  systematic habituation our local police have turned into the military and if you
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:17.280]  told somebody if I could bring Thomas Jefferson back from the grave and say
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:22.720]  look at what happened look how there has been how this firewall the spirit if you
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:26.720]  will have posse comment on this but the spirit of this differentiation between
[03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:33.160]  domestic police and military that's all but gone what happens let me stop you I
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:35.680]  gotta stop you again because you're making my brain explode with them you're
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.960]  right and the key to this for anybody who's been habituated to lie to
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:43.040]  themselves and like the system people think that gives them power over it the
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:47.480]  point is it's scientifically been habituated been incremental it was
[03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:51.600]  designed we even have the Rand Corporation documents on that how G even
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:55.400]  the smallest you know town has to have its SWAT team now and now they're kicking
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:59.800]  down doors over unpaid parking tickets this is the new Gestapo force and look
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:04.440]  how they did it let me throw another one at you if I could ask yourself this I
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:08.240]  want all of your listeners all of your viewers just to ask themselves a very
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:15.480]  simple question do you remember any time in your life when you heard that word
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:23.720]  vaccine brought up in news stories TV shows magazines newspapers articles
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:32.480]  blogs more than now we are inundated we are immersed bathing in this new
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:37.480]  habituation about vaccines now I'm just saying whether they're good matter of
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:43.800]  different it's a different story the word terrorism the word support your
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:48.680]  troops these are all these movies about forced inoculations coming by the way
[03:04:48.680 --> 03:04:53.640]  and and more importantly how the government the government is to the
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:57.720]  rescue remember we're going to need you you know I'll stay there stay there we

[03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:37.920]  wouldn't even get it going here I've got Nemo in here going get get Scotty down
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:44.360]  in the engine room to get prison planet TV working or not prison planet TV the
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:49.040]  WordPress on info wars.com and I'm like I've got two IT people just on that I
[03:08:49.040 --> 03:08:54.000]  can't afford more and he's like I've got to get the power into the main converter
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:01.640]  captain it's probably because drugs has got a giant link to us right now and then
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:06.680]  I've got Lionel waiting and then I've got about Paul there and you know the
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:10.200]  frustrating thing is you know all this knowledge you know it's real you know
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:16.120]  you're being consciously manipulated by very corrupt ruthless people and even
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:19.000]  when you're conscious of it it's hard to beat and then you've got people who
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.080]  are willfully ignorant because part of the conditioning is when you're deep in
[03:09:23.080 --> 03:09:29.000]  it is you like it and you defend it and you love your servitude but now the
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.760]  globalist are bringing us into the next phase where they destroy the economy to
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:38.000]  make us then do whatever we're told to get it back of course you don't really
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:41.880]  get it back Europe gives up all of its sovereignty raises its taxes money goes
[03:09:41.880 --> 03:09:46.640]  to foreign banks same thing here it never gets better it only gets worse this
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:50.280]  is the post-industrial world Paul Watson's waiting in the wings Paul what
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:54.040]  do you think of what Lionel was talking about this whole use of copyright
[03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:58.640]  everything having systems engineered into it where your phone your computer
[03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:03.560]  spies on you and then shuts things off if it thinks it's copyright that's on
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:10.040]  the Teavos that's on our own video converters to run videoed to screens for
[03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:14.320]  television it's always screwing up with high death because it has to watch the
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:18.680]  signal and make sure it isn't copyright and then it causes endless problems
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:23.000]  messing with everything and then buying expensive converters and things to even
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:27.640]  be able to do my own TV show I mean this surveillance grid this panopticon
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:31.720]  they have built into the technological system through DARPA and these global
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:38.640]  conventions total control Watson I mean Homeland Security has seized website
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:43.880]  domain not for hosting copyright material but merely for linking to it so
[03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:48.280]  they've got to that level but people say well YouTube's a private website I mean
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:52.720]  they can delete what they want okay fine then we lose you know a third of our
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:56.560]  audience so what we're gonna do when Berrystein which is the company that
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:02.600]  controls all the dot-com domain names gets the power to shut down dot-coms by
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:07.000]  government decree which is now what they requested what we're gonna do when
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  Joe Lieberman then a you know Homeland Security office calls up Amazon and says
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:17.280]  get WikiLeaks off your servers now and ten minutes later it's gone because
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:21.280]  that's already happening but it's not just about YouTube it's about government
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:25.000]  having the power to stop you there I'm gonna stop you there and have you
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.200]  comment go back to Lionel on this Paul it's worse than that when when you
[03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:36.400]  advertise a business and you advertise a semi-commons there's an agreement when
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:40.320]  you sign that YouTube agreement it's saying your free speech is honored you
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:44.280]  are the you and YouTube you bring your value to them and it's just like a
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:48.400]  company cheating you are not being fair and it's advertising being dishonest
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:52.800]  when YouTube tries to always use its rules against us we go do the filings we
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:56.640]  threaten to sue them just to stay on YouTube and reach 300 million people
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:01.240]  conservatively there in the last two years and so but again the general
[03:12:01.240 --> 03:12:04.440]  public doesn't know how to do this they don't open law books up and talk to
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:08.400]  lawyers as consultants and you know talk to the electronic frontier
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:12.680]  foundation and do all this research 17 years of media research they're not a
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:17.320]  former prosecutor like Lionel and a media critic like Lionel I mean they just
[03:12:17.320 --> 03:12:21.960]  don't know go ahead Lionel you know Alex that's one of the things also which is
[03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:26.120]  important you also want to remember going back to my nefarious position as
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:32.320]  psychologist general I want to impress upon my subjects that they're stupid
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:37.440]  they're uneducated they're ignorant they're nescient they don't know as much as
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:43.320]  big daddy I know more than you this is a legal thing this is about global warming
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:48.160]  this is about medicine and vaccines this is about commerce if I let me give you
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:51.960]  one more if I could before forget this is the best example I've mentioned this
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:56.640]  before I've got it on my YouTube channel as long as that's up I've mentioned it
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:13:00.880]  on local commentary this is how the systematic and this also goes into your
[03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:05.240]  cashless society there was a story in New York recently this heart-rending story
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:10.640]  of this little dog that traveled five years ago from Denver it shows up in
[03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:15.520]  Manhattan I don't know how and they found this little dog and a veterinarian
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:21.640]  scanned and said hey look it has an embedded RFID chip a little chip let's
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:26.560]  see could it be that maybe the information is there sure enough and they
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:31.480]  called the owners up and the little girl who was elected five when fluffy
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:37.640]  when a roamed off was so delighted now here's how the transition works it fits
[03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:43.040]  good enough for your dog then let's say you have a parent parent who has
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:48.200]  dementia Alzheimer's tends to walk off let's put a little RFID chip in your
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:53.120]  parents why and this is the thing that just lulls people into the sense of
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:59.280]  hypnotic trance like approbation medical records don't you want your parents
[03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:08.040]  medical records in this chip yes follow the watch then the next step well if
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:11.920]  it's good enough for your dog and good enough for your parents you know all
[03:14:11.920 --> 03:14:16.440]  these poor kids at Amber Alerts these kids that are swiped off the street what
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:21.120]  if I could make child abduction impossible a thing of the past through
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:26.160]  embedding a chip not in any one usual place God forbid a child's arm is but
[03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:31.440]  it's injected so it's so it's tracker nanotech all over you and that's what
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:35.480]  and the companies admit they want to make it the law and then all of this
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:41.200]  yeah IBM secretly funded it came out very chip just to be their frontline
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:45.200]  company to get everybody conditioned for it and that's exactly now what they're
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:51.320]  announcing condition systematic abituation finally I'm gonna show
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:57.200]  kids because young people I can get to do anything if I make it cool I want to
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:03.040]  make UPC code tattoos which are already coming about watch I want markings and
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:06.440]  you mentioned the sign of the devil and it's funny it's not funny but it's
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:10.800]  interesting the biblical references that kind of make a lot of sense but I want
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:16.120]  to make marking and tagging encoding a thing that's interesting and eventually
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:22.400]  I'm gonna say you hey Mr. Consumer you like your blink card from X bank isn't
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:26.800]  that great no need to swipe it if you're in the cab or at the drug store you
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:32.800]  swipe what if I then take this RFID chip and I put it in your hand I just got
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:37.240]  your medical by the way this is already all started and again I remember in
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:41.920]  Washington Post wash tech back when they had that in 98 they admitted that at
[03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:44.640]  big corporate meetings where they get all the big heads together they said
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:50.080]  through media let's habitualize body modification because our studies show
[03:15:50.080 --> 03:15:55.680]  it'll get people ready for microchips and and it is so incredible let's let's
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:16:00.840]  bring Watson in here briefly Watson what's your take and view on this and
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:05.520]  also comment on the street lights with homeland security systems listening us
[03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:10.520]  following us they've now pulled the video since drugs linked to your article
[03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:15.680]  yeah well I mean on on the chip subject we already carry around a chip that
[03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:20.240]  locates as everywhere we go we can use it to swipe to buy things like a credit
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:25.800]  card it called our cell phone so they've already got it to some extent on the on
[03:16:25.800 --> 03:16:30.360]  the IntelliStreet yeah this is a company that has received government
[03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:35.560]  funding to put in these street lights which basically include a sophisticated
[03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:39.720]  computer within the street light it's got a Wi-Fi connection it can be controlled
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:44.880]  remotely it's got sensors it's got cameras it's got loud speakers which
[03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:50.080]  mirrors what we have in Britain in cities where the CCTV surveillance cameras
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:54.360]  actually have speakers where the controls can park orders at people for
[03:16:54.360 --> 03:16:59.640]  dropping litter and stuff like that so I mean I found this purely by accident I
[03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:03.360]  was searching for homeland security on YouTube to try and find you know the
[03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:07.320]  latest video about how everybody's a terrorist I found this video which is
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:12.400]  literally being uploaded minutes before and it had got zero viewers so I was the
[03:17:12.400 --> 03:17:16.160]  first one to see it and it's about this company that's tired of their hip with
[03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:21.080]  the fed and they're trying to roll out this system where the street light is
[03:17:21.080 --> 03:17:25.240]  the surveillance system and it's ubiquitous throughout the city as soon as
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:28.800]  they got linked on drugs report they pulled the video it's like you know a
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:33.640]  kid gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar it's total criminality this
[03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:37.240]  is the promotional video and yet they're ashamed of it they've pulled it from
[03:17:37.240 --> 03:17:41.760]  YouTube because they don't like us drawing attention to fight this is part
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:46.240]  of the Homeland Security occupation and takeover of America and turning it into
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:49.840]  this high-tech police state grit but then it's worse than that they've jailed
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:54.240]  for two years a Border Patrol agent who had an illegal while he search team
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:17:58.880]  raises hands but then I had a TSA guy doing that to me yesterday and sticking
[03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:01.900]  his hand in my pants yes folks it happened I never got to it today I'll
[03:18:01.900 --> 03:18:05.240]  talk about it tomorrow and play the audio oh I recorded it you better believe
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:12.360]  I did and so all of that again this is so insane they want to search your car
[03:18:12.360 --> 03:18:15.920]  100 miles into the US now the Border Patrol does at random checkpoints and
[03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:20.000]  hardened checkpoints but then the illegals can't be searched again whatever
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:24.160]  you're told something's for is not what it's really for is Ron Paul said the wall
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:30.160]  is to keep us in not to keep the illegals out the global sorry go ahead no
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:36.480]  no if you I'm gonna look at the news obviously I'm on a news station you're
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:41.400]  very proud of Hicks Love in New York and right now we have a rash in the city of
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:47.680]  New York of Gropers and it's weird it's kind of an infantilized sexual abuse not
[03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:53.400]  rape thank God but almost childish it's strange it's against the law no matter
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:58.480]  how you look at it interesting thing every single night on every channel in
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:04.400]  every newspaper we see grainy surveillance photos of people in the act
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:10.200]  there is a sound of a woman actually being attacked you see her you hear the
[03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:15.960]  noise and through this systematic reporting and that's really what it is
[03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:22.880]  we're applauding the fact that isn't yes right that's like the show cops where
[03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:26.560]  it's always white trash tootless people the cops are always in the right
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:31.160]  creating the image that humanity is a bunch of scum the cops are great but
[03:19:31.160 --> 03:19:35.360]  what's interesting to note is nobody's been caught now with all of this
[03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:39.800]  surveillance we find out that just because I have a picture of let's say
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:45.160]  Alex Jones lifting something I don't necessarily find Alex Jones nobody
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:50.160]  turns you in but where where they're being caught is old-fashioned shoe leather
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:54.040]  and police work what happens is this maybe they're old-fashioned TSA workers
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:58.160]  they just want a little extra after the job TSA let me tell you something I want
[03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:03.960]  to thank you for this I my wife and I have a my I put a video up on this my
[03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:09.560]  wife was at the Tampa Airport we were coming coming to New York half of my
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:15.560]  hometown and I was there it was a slow day and they were saying come in come in
[03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:21.520]  to the magnetometer no problem come on in come on in my beloved wife a very
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:26.720]  attractive woman all of a sudden this boss hold tight he's standing up there
[03:20:26.720 --> 03:20:32.320]  all right literally I'm kind of doing some juicy looking hog wall I'm gonna
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:37.200]  need to handle the mangoes ma'am you come in here and you go over there she
[03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:41.040]  says wait a minute and we had again let me say this from the umpteenth time
[03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:46.360]  because of you and because of making me sentient and aware and armed with
[03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:51.800]  information about this backscatter radiation which is a cancer to this is
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:57.000]  in some vague kind of imagery this is radiation she all about it she said no
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:02.400]  no no I'm opting out at that point and by the way everybody will go through
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:08.160]  this if you're travel this guy how dare you little lady that's another thing to
[03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:15.600]  add to this the police these glorified skycaps I mean they're not all bad let's
[03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:20.160]  get that out of the way but all of a sudden these people and you have reported
[03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:24.600]  time after time Alex about these these law and pass of these people all of a
[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:30.240]  sudden they're federalized their G men federal agents with a gold badge all of
[03:21:30.240 --> 03:21:36.200]  a sudden there's this almost a systematic internal psychology that says if
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:42.640]  anybody questions your authority gives you lip dares remember you're the boss
[03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:46.760]  you don't serve and protect you're not looking out for anybody they have to be
[03:21:46.760 --> 03:21:52.440]  subservient and obedient and obeys it to you because you're the law you're the
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:57.440]  man and I'm telling you we're seeing more and more of this so she goes through
[03:21:57.440 --> 03:22:03.640]  this time after time after time this is happening and that's going to be the
[03:22:03.640 --> 03:22:07.600]  first victory now let me just say something right now this is the most
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:11.500]  important message I can give you because when you listen to to Alex and to Paul
[03:22:11.500 --> 03:22:16.360]  and you listen to your read your stories it is not incumbent upon you as a
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:21.600]  citizen to understand why you don't have to understand the motivation why would
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:27.360]  President Obama allow this why would Jenny don't ask why it's not up to you
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:32.560]  you're not it's their story next when something doesn't make sense when you
[03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:35.880]  tell somebody you know I think something might have been a false flyer or I
[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:39.760]  think somebody might have been an agent provocateur or I don't think this might
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:45.920]  be al-Qaeda people will come up with this crazy idea they'll say number one do
[03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:49.680]  you know how many people that would take to be involved in something to keep
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:55.800]  their mouths shut number two why why would somebody want to do this and I
[03:22:55.800 --> 03:23:01.120]  tell people all the time it's their story my job is not to figure out the
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:06.320]  motivation as a prosecutor I used to always tell juries this motive business
[03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:11.160]  you hear on TV this motive and opportunity I'm here to prove intent I'm
[03:23:11.160 --> 03:23:16.120]  not here to prove motive why somebody that's why hate crimes are unconstitutional
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:20.400]  in my book because thoughts and motivation are protected speech I can hate
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:24.680]  anybody I know it's did they do it or not do you have the proof does this
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:28.640]  person's story make sense of why there's five dead bodies in their basement so
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:32.440]  when you ask somebody when you bring up you'll see this because what happens
[03:23:32.440 --> 03:23:36.880]  Alex you are intellectually challenging their sense of right and wrong and
[03:23:36.880 --> 03:23:41.080]  also people don't like to be told they're kind of stupid they don't like you
[03:23:41.080 --> 03:23:44.800]  telling them yet again so what they do is rather than sitting back and say well
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:48.400]  thank you mr. Jones let me go on and read this article because you cite
[03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:53.560]  everything you say this isn't just Alex Jones the prophet this isn't the
[03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:59.000]  iraqular Delphic Alex Jones who just pulls ideas up it's always based you
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:02.680]  would fall watch this always based on something can't I was about to say I'm
[03:24:02.680 --> 03:24:08.720]  not that smart I've learned oh but stop government no I mean look take take
[03:24:08.720 --> 03:24:13.440]  Watson he's the same way all we've done is learned this criminal groups
[03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:19.440]  criminology so we know what to look for and it's any it's I mean it's history
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:23.800]  to that that these people are doing this all right first of all I'm gonna call you
[03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:27.320]  modern something I never thought I'd do this I love you man but I'm tired of this
[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:33.600]  one lie this lie you perpetuate all the time you know I'm not that smart you know
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:37.400]  Sam Irvin you're probably too young for this but during the Watergate hearings he
[03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:42.000]  always he used to always say you know I'm just a country lawyer I'm just I'm
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:47.760]  just he was one of those but so enough with that you have this almost and it's
[03:24:47.760 --> 03:24:54.280]  not even in encyclopedic but it's weird when you go into that Jones referring
[03:24:54.280 --> 03:24:57.600]  days to time so don't give me that nonsense about you're not that smart
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:03.200]  okay and and Watson is the evil genius that aside what people do Alex it goes
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:09.320]  back way to the beginning of what we said there is this sense of people don't
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:15.120]  understand human behavior whenever you listen you hear yet again a horrible
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:18.880]  story of a child whether it's Casey Anthony or OJ or I don't know who it is
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:25.000]  people cannot understand the savagery this this is savagery that people
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:29.480]  events that how people that share DNA with us they don't understand why people
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:34.880]  could want to fondle why white cops can do things why when you look at tapes of
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:39.960]  Occupy Wall Street and you see somebody standing there you see a guy about to
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:46.840]  retire wearing a white shirt take out a club or spray somebody it's not my duty
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:51.480]  it's not my job and it's not my responsibility to explain why anything I
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:57.040]  don't know but history you know Tolstoy said history would be a wonderful
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:02.720]  thing if only it were true since time immemorial when you let human beings in
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:08.880]  charge of a structure you will see this this this aphrodisiac of power
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:14.560]  literally evolved in any system go back to Caesar go back to get we've got to
[03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:17.640]  close it here with with Paul having a final comment you having one more final
[03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:20.880]  comment but just for those that just joined us you're absolutely hitting the
[03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:26.680]  core the these central core of the issue the heart of the matter is that
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:32.000]  people always say why why would they do 9-11 and I go okay why did Hitler fire
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:37.560]  bomb the Reichstag to take over why did we stage the Gulf of Tonkin to get into
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:42.200]  Vietnam problem reaction solution but I go that doesn't matter look at the facts
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:47.800]  of the story do they make sense and I do see that in serial killer cases and
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:50.360]  things you're a prosecutor you know much more about it and I'm glad you got to
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:53.280]  this point they always the defense always says because the serial killer
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:57.760]  won't talk well what's the motive why would he do something like this and and
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:27:01.360]  the defense lawyer is talking to those people like their children trying to get
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:04.960]  them to think why would you kill a three-year-old and torture him for three
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:08.440]  weeks in a basement knowing that the grandma sitting there can't get their
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.800]  mind around it and sometimes won't convict because they can't believe it
[03:27:12.800 --> 03:27:16.960]  even though they've got the dead kid and that's the problem people can't it
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:22.000]  Germans most of them did not know what Hillard was doing it was compartmentalized
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:26.120]  that's why Eisenhower made him go into the camps and themselves room experiment
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:30.440]  the Milgram experiment the Stanford prison experiment look at it it's
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:34.400]  documented I'm sorry no no no but I mean you're right most Germans if they
[03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:37.280]  weren't they're actually doing it couldn't believe it so Eisenhower made
[03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:39.920]  him go in and actually clean up dead bodies they were throwing up in things
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:44.880]  but it's the same thing now as the tyranny is even happening we've even
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:48.280]  warned them people didn't really do that with Hitler we've warned them they
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:51.840]  still can't believe it because they've already bought into the line and that's
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:54.880]  what's so dangerous they can't believe it's happening because deep down they're
[03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:58.760]  scared they feel powerless when they really have power so they they play a
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:02.240]  mind trick of well this isn't really happening folks there's no room for
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:06.200]  denial even your own instincts out there everybody's freaked out your own good
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:12.040]  old boy guts your own six cents is telling you mayday mayday mayday Lionel I
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:15.160]  want to really thank you for joining us I look forward to talking to you soon
[03:28:15.160 --> 03:28:18.800]  Paul watching you sir you've got a minute and a half then we'll let Lionel say
[03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:25.320]  bye go ahead no I've just had that regarding the article I wrote they have
[03:28:25.320 --> 03:28:31.400]  taken down the video so we need people to copy that duplicate that on YouTube
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:34.720]  because they'll probably just go around deleting them one by one and they're
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:38.880]  obviously very nervous about the fact that we've exposed their little link
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:42.880]  with homeland security and the fact that these streetlights are going to be used
[03:28:42.880 --> 03:28:48.200]  as a surveillance tool just like they're planning to be used in the UK as you
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:53.720]  know x-ray scanners that under arrest people as well by the way Paul just to
[03:28:53.720 --> 03:28:57.560]  add this caveat because it's so key Napolitano admits she reads our articles
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:00.880]  on drugs and doesn't like it even though we hadn't called her a troll she said
[03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:03.720]  they're calling me a troll I don't like it well we're calling you one now since
[03:29:03.720 --> 03:29:07.720]  you don't like it but but but yeah they probably called the company and said
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:11.640]  don't tell people that we're gonna claim it's a wireless connection because
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:16.200]  again I'll be on the night seven o'clock Watson great job final comments
[03:29:16.200 --> 03:29:21.080]  Lionel well first of all it's I want to thank you for letting me on I want you
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:25.200]  just mentioned I talk about this at Lionel media.com I'm on Twitter and I
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:28.520]  say this because I want to spread this information out let me just say in
[03:29:28.520 --> 03:29:33.120]  conclusion what motivates me and what motivates you and what should motivate
[03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:38.400]  everybody is not this idealistic thought of what a society should be like it's
[03:29:38.400 --> 03:29:43.160]  called the Constitution were it not for that were I not to have that frame of
[03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:48.320]  reference that reference document that tells me what's right and wrong you
[03:29:48.320 --> 03:29:51.720]  wouldn't know by the way the video is going up soon at info wars look for it
[03:29:51.720 --> 03:29:58.800]  alien genetic takeovers the name Lex Jones and the GCN radio network alien
