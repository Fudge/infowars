[00:55.320 --> 01:01.280]  fourth hour today they'll be on during the last hour today we have Native
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.040]  American leader Russell means joining us to talk about the fact that he exposed
[01:06.040 --> 01:09.760]  Obama before he even got elected as a complete puppet of the globalist and was
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.320]  attacked by the left where Mr. Means of course has been an icon he's been proven
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.880]  right we're going to get his take on the plunging dollar the empire in trouble
[01:18.880 --> 01:23.560]  how Native Americans had their children kidnapped by CPS in fact when they
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.920]  started the health departments they were modeled after the stealing of Native
[01:27.920 --> 01:32.440]  American children so we'll also get his take on that the next hour when he joins
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.800]  us from video Skype we'll be streaming that of course not just on the radio on

[01:51.320 --> 01:57.240]  deadly this scourge is so that is all coming up today right now on the drudge
[01:57.240 --> 02:04.960]  report they have top links to the local newspapers in New Hampshire who have
[02:04.960 --> 02:17.720]  seen the full affidavit used by the court to take the irish's newborn baby and so
[02:17.720 --> 02:22.000]  the denials all over it's just like when we released the mic report people for a
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.920]  week said it was fake or the homeland security reports or the clergy response
[02:25.920 --> 02:29.800]  team documents it's all real people like well why didn't you post the whole thing
[02:29.800 --> 02:33.880]  well mr. irish told me I could but I thought you know what I'm not gonna put
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.480]  where they live or their all their information and you know the other
[02:37.480 --> 02:43.480]  cps allegations the issue is that oath keepers was cited and gun ownership was
[02:43.480 --> 02:50.840]  cited for political demonization that's the issue mr. irish's landlord is in the
[02:50.840 --> 02:57.640]  newspaper saying he is a model tenant and that they are just nice good peaceful
[02:57.640 --> 03:02.560]  people in the year they've been living there no problems and then you read the
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.320]  affidavit which we have the whole thing and it's just it's standard I've been
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.240]  studying the cps for 15 years I have battled them in Austin I have seen them
[03:11.240 --> 03:18.680]  just out of hand as standard operating procedure lying about people and this
[03:18.680 --> 03:23.720]  fits the bill because it's all mild and nebulous and not clear and the way they
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.040]  were waiting for them at their home when he was coming back from getting his his
[03:27.040 --> 03:30.560]  wisdom teeth pulled and she had a concealed carry and it was in her bag
[03:30.560 --> 03:33.760]  and they got the gun out and said no this is your husband's he doesn't have a
[03:33.760 --> 03:37.600]  concealed carry so they arrested him that's how this all started two and a
[03:37.600 --> 03:44.320]  half months ago and so we now have the new headline up feds treat baby snatch
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.280]  protesters like terrorist the FBI admits to the local TV and newspapers that
[03:49.280 --> 03:56.080]  they called in bomb sniffing dogs for the protests of about 10 people that was
[03:56.080 --> 04:03.800]  spontaneous last Friday at 3 o'clock Eastern they're in conquered mass at the
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.120]  hospital and they said well there was no threat or no bombs we just we just came
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.360]  out here basically again anybody who protests the government child kidnapping
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.960]  operation is a terrorist and now I talked to Mr. Irish who was really upset
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.400]  about 30 minutes before airtime and he's been told he's not allowed to have
[04:21.400 --> 04:24.280]  visitation with his child even though they admitted it's his child and it's
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.840]  it's on them you know the seizure affidavit and the hospital records that
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.640]  yes it's his child now they're saying well for security issues you can't see
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.560]  your daughter and he said well why and they said well we don't have the file
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.760]  we don't know why you just can't have any visitation so they're already doing
[04:42.760 --> 04:48.520]  that that's coming up and we've got incredible economic news just off the
[04:48.520 --> 04:55.120]  charts we've got dollar falls as currency war concerns linger and we've
[04:55.120 --> 05:02.680]  got big aspartame news coming up today stay with us hundreds of nations have
[05:02.680 --> 05:07.360]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not

[05:11.880 --> 05:16.160]  from underneath the Americans at home I've tremendous influence on our
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.320]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[05:20.320 --> 05:25.560]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[05:25.560 --> 05:30.120]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.120 --> 05:34.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[05:38.240 --> 05:42.200]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.200 --> 05:47.760]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[06:07.520 --> 06:11.760]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.040 --> 06:20.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.480 --> 06:29.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.040 --> 06:33.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.160 --> 06:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.120 --> 06:40.960]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[08:36.120 --> 08:40.680]  minutes we're gonna have Jonathan Irish and Stephanie Taylor who had their
[08:40.680 --> 08:46.200]  babies snatched and we have the affidavit it's now in full in fact I've
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.680]  printed that during a break can you guys run that into me and then have Nemo
[08:49.680 --> 08:57.480]  post it up on info wars dot com because that is key to do that we were
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.800]  authorized last Friday with this baby snatching case to post the whole thing
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.440]  but I made the executive decision to only post excerpts of this for their
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.520]  privacy and then some of the media tried to spin it and say that it wasn't
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.680]  even true that oathkeepers wasn't mentioned well we have now gotten the
[09:17.680 --> 09:21.880]  authorization last night to block out all the phone numbers and names and
[09:21.880 --> 09:31.480]  things like that but it has the court case number 629-2010-JV239 and to post
[09:31.480 --> 09:38.200]  all the affidavits the court order everything where they cite we're gonna
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.720]  now add this to Paul Joseph Watson's latest article feds treat baby snatch
[09:43.720 --> 09:48.200]  protesters like terrorist we're gonna talk about that coming up and they're
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.000]  gonna be joining us here on the show but this is the type of stuff we deal with
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.560]  every time oh that's made up there's nothing about oathkeepers in there oh
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.240]  there's no myack report oh there's no clergy response teams oh the
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.400]  government's not issuing terror alerts for political gain and then the former
[10:05.400 --> 10:08.800]  at Homeland Security comes out and mess it look we're not making any of this up
[10:08.800 --> 10:13.120]  and people don't want to face the facts that people are being politically
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.360]  persecuted in this country for their views it's that simple and the update
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.280]  is today we have learned the New Hampshire DC yf is preventing Jonathan
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.520]  Irish and the baby's mother Stephanie they're clearly saying mr. Irish can't
[10:27.520 --> 10:30.960]  from ever seeing their child at all this is clearly a violation of basic
[10:30.960 --> 10:34.920]  visitation rights authorities cite security threats as the reason for
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.440]  blocking visitation without explaining what those threats are yeah and I told
[10:38.440 --> 10:42.120]  Watson for his update the main issue is that he said well what's in the file and
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.360]  they said well we don't even have a file Irish and his wife Stephanie his
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.080]  fiance and oathkeepers founder Stuart Rhodes will appear on the Alex Jones show
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.240]  today we will also be posting the full affidavit with personal information
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.600]  blacked out of the letter today and we now have it and it's now blacked out to
[11:01.600 --> 11:07.160]  protect the child and also some of the phone numbers that are in this thing and
[11:07.160 --> 11:12.320]  so you can go read it up at info wars dot com and present on a dot com Stuart
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.720]  Rhodes is coming on he's got it posted right now at oathkeepers dot org okay so
[11:17.720 --> 11:22.240]  it's real and the protesters that went out there had the police show up and
[11:22.240 --> 11:25.680]  threaten them that's on video and they called out the FBI with bomb sniffing
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.640]  dogs and the FBI to local TV and the newspapers there was no bomb threat they
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.600]  just did it yeah to imply anybody protesting as a violent terrorist how
[11:34.600 --> 11:40.760]  their citizens protest what's going on so that is coming up we're gonna have
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.240]  Stuart Rhodes mr. Irish and others on then Russell means native American
[11:45.240 --> 11:48.680]  leader is going to be joining us dr. Doug Rocky and we're gonna have Jonathan
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.760]  Irish in the fourth hour back on for an update on everything it's unfolding but
[11:52.760 --> 11:58.680]  this is a big national story the drudge report is linked to it as well and we're
[11:58.680 --> 12:05.480]  going to be covering all of that today here on the transmission you notice that
[12:05.480 --> 12:09.360]  if you're watching on prison planet dot TV we started this segment with the
[12:09.360 --> 12:16.960]  document cam shot of diet coke diet coke big league chew dentine fire big red
[12:16.960 --> 12:24.360]  sugar gum juicy fruit regular sugar gum bubble issues hubba bubba try dent all of
[12:24.360 --> 12:30.360]  it why am I doing this well I called Kirk Nemo Saturday and I said I want you
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.560]  to write an article about this a lot of the articles you see I basically send the
[12:33.560 --> 12:37.480]  guys the links they do further research and add to it and when I've been
[12:37.480 --> 12:40.520]  involved in the article you'll see at the bottom Alex Jones contributed to this
[12:40.520 --> 12:47.760]  article and I told Kurt I said he said well he said you want to do another
[12:47.760 --> 12:53.920]  story about Glenn Beck and I said yeah I've got the transcript of Glenn Beck
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.840]  saying his doctors this is from last Friday are looking for toxins in his
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.400]  blood and then he has the symptoms of basically being poisoned he said the
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.840]  last 24 hours I've been thinking about doctors saying we're looking for toxins
[13:06.840 --> 13:13.200]  we're looking for poisons in your body and then he goes on to make the joke I
[13:13.200 --> 13:16.200]  know what they are at studying progressives and collectivist and
[13:16.200 --> 13:20.240]  eugenicist and I'm being poisoned spiritually so he's making either a
[13:20.240 --> 13:24.640]  joke or he believes in some type of voodoo meanwhile the real poison is in
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.800]  plain view he told the New York Times and many other publications that
[13:28.800 --> 13:34.280]  Mormonism forbids him from drinking coffee but then he guzzles diet coke and
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.440]  even gives it to his children and I talked Sunday about how I was out at a
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.000]  park and saw a little party of kids all drinking diet sodas like it's something
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.480]  healthy their parents give them fulfilled with aspartame and so I said watch
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.400]  Kurt this story will get picked up big time and regardless millions of Glenn
[13:54.400 --> 13:57.840]  Beck listeners will end up reading the article and then they'll see all the
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.000]  links and they will discover that aspartame is deadly dangerous and that
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.480]  it was known that it was deadly dangerous and that it's not just in diet
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.520]  sodas now it is in tens of thousands of products Kurt's article says thousand
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.880]  six thousand that that's conservative it is tens of thousands and now it's
[14:17.880 --> 14:24.120]  suddenly in almost every sugar gum I mean you go to the store it's hard to
[14:24.120 --> 14:32.160]  find sugar gum this is a hubba bubba awesome original and in the last two
[14:32.160 --> 14:36.080]  years it's now being added to everything it's every form of gum it says
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.240]  aspartame is one of the ingredients we'll try to zoom in on that see if you
[14:40.240 --> 14:49.600]  can get that tiny print here's big league chew and it says corn syrup natural
[14:49.600 --> 14:59.560]  artificial flavors soy aspartame cornstarch color red 40 big league chew
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.720]  it's like bubble gum chewing tobacco here's denteen fire this is all regular
[15:04.720 --> 15:13.280]  sugar gum but it has aspartame added to it so what happened today well we wrote
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.760]  the story Saturday Kurt and I he posted it he put links to mainstream news major
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.760]  universities the federal government even Fox News reporting on it on aspartame
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.520]  linked to cancer brain damage all the rest of it it's highly addictive it
[15:28.520 --> 15:36.200]  breaks down into what alcohol and of course formaldehyde in the body that's
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.880]  admitted you know back during a prohibition and all the people going
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.360]  blind because of what alcohol they were making you know whiskey and moonshine
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.400]  with what alcohol people were going blind and mass well Glenn Beck's
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.360]  announced he's going blind with macular dystrophy the degeneration of the
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.520]  nerves in his eye and so we write an article with all the mainline medical
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.560]  studies literally scores of them linked and we haven't completely confirmed we
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.040]  saw it on the message board and I got some calls about it and it's almost
[16:05.040 --> 16:11.160]  always accurate but that his fill-in guest is fill-in sidekick while Glenn's
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.080]  off having to get all these tests and CAT scans and the rest of it because his
[16:14.080 --> 16:18.120]  hands are going numb his feet is losing his eyesight and the guy reportedly made
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.280]  jokes about it well look I mean we're linked to this in the article and I'll
[16:22.280 --> 16:28.560]  give viewers a prison planet dot TV shot rat study shows cancer aspartame link
[16:28.560 --> 16:34.880]  fox news don't remember 21st 2005 look this isn't a joke okay this isn't a
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.000]  joke and the fact that he gives it to his children isn't a joke and the fact
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  that many of you give it to your children look when I see somebody giving
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.360]  their children aspartame drinks or I see my cousin drinking a chewing sugar gum
[16:48.360 --> 16:51.640]  and I go you know that's got aspartame and he goes no it doesn't this is sugar
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.680]  gum I said give me the package and it was actually tried it white it's what he
[16:57.680 --> 17:01.000]  had back at Christmas when he came out of business from Chicago and I grabbed
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.080]  it away from him and I read on the back I said aspartame you see that he goes
[17:07.080 --> 17:10.120]  wow I didn't know sugar gum had it and I said look I'm not making this stuff up
[17:10.120 --> 17:14.760]  it's hard to find a brand that doesn't have it America wakes up to this people
[17:14.760 --> 17:18.120]  get angry mainstream news comes out admits it's deadly and what's their
[17:18.120 --> 17:23.000]  answer we'll just put it in almost every sugar gum and even sugar candies have it
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.800]  now children's vitamins sickeningly most of them
[17:26.800 --> 17:32.640]  like when I sit guys to the store send Marley back to H.E.B. to get children's
[17:32.640 --> 17:38.200]  vitamins and and cold tablets just have a read on the back most of them have
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.600]  aspartame even pills that you don't chew has it it's highly addictive and
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.640]  highly toxic like many other poisons are highly addictive so the drudge report
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.280]  links to this reportedly his fill in host while he is in a medical emergency
[17:53.280 --> 17:57.400]  you know we reach out to Glenn Beck but people like why don't make them back
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.120]  because he's been set up as the main patriot leader and we now know he's
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.040]  covering everything we cover so what I say here now ends up on his show okay
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.960]  what we write about ends up on the drudge report and so whether you care
[18:09.960 --> 18:13.520]  about Glenn Beck or not I've seen some sickening comments about I hope he dies
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.320]  from aspartame and all the rest of this no I hope he gets better I hope he gets
[18:17.320 --> 18:21.080]  his kids off of it before they get sick and go blind and then I hope he wakes
[18:21.080 --> 18:27.240]  up like Saul of Tarsus and becomes Paul and gets knocked off his horse and
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.280]  wakes up and goes and tells his 30 to 50 million listeners and viewers putting
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.600]  on which week you look at that hey get off this stuff see I feel good warning
[18:36.600 --> 18:40.400]  people I like warning people about sodium fluoride in the water that Beck
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.480]  says he drank buckets of well you're going blind buddy how do you like it you
[18:44.480 --> 18:49.640]  talk about how you guzzle diet coke it's not funny Glenn okay as you're now
[18:49.640 --> 18:53.960]  discovering losing your eyesight he says he can Glenn says he can hardly read
[18:53.960 --> 18:57.360]  he says he can't even read regular type he can't even read this article now
[18:57.360 --> 19:02.600]  without coke bottle glasses I mean it's not funny Glenn and of course he hasn't
[19:02.600 --> 19:07.960]  laughed yet reportedly his co-host has but the issue here is this is not a joke
[19:07.960 --> 19:12.920]  okay this is a life-and-death situation and I'm going to show you again one of
[19:12.920 --> 19:18.360]  hundreds of mainstream articles here's your own Fox News okay and it says a
[19:18.360 --> 19:22.600]  study in rats links the popular artificial sweetener aspartame to a wide
[19:22.600 --> 19:28.120]  range of cancers aspartame is found in low-calorie sweetener equal and many
[19:28.120 --> 19:31.160]  other sugar-free products under the brand-name Nutrisweet is the second
[19:31.160 --> 19:35.200]  best-selling non-sugar sweetener in the world researchers in Italy concluded
[19:35.200 --> 19:38.080]  that rats exposed to varying doses of aspartame throughout their lives
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.000]  developed leukemias lymphomas and several other cancers in a dose dependent
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.560]  manner okay now that's only one study when they tried to approve it in the
[19:50.560 --> 19:56.520]  70s it caused seizures brain damage blindness and cancer in monkeys okay
[19:56.520 --> 20:00.760]  Glenn you're killing yourself and so does everybody else that drinks it normal
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.320]  blood pressure naturally how would that make you feel I'm done from the Mexican

[24:04.000 --> 24:08.200]  I'm gonna get into the economy here in a moment that's really the huge news but
[24:08.200 --> 24:13.320]  but but getting back to Glenn Beck here he is last Friday's show a transcript he
[24:13.320 --> 24:18.040]  says you know his listeners that I was diagnosed with macular dystrophy and I
[24:18.040 --> 24:23.200]  could be blind within a year well I mean we we we write an article Drudge
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.920]  report posted with links to universities the federal government all the
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.280]  scientific reports mainstream news articles that many people get off
[24:33.280 --> 24:36.880]  aspartame and medical science admits this and they get their eyesight back it
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.400]  will give you temporary blindness or reduced vision if you keep doing it you
[24:40.400 --> 24:47.320]  will lose your eyesight and reportedly it's funny to the guest host I mean maybe
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.120]  he wants to blend to go blind so that I mean you know the co-host gets the show
[24:51.120 --> 24:55.480]  or I guess he'll help walk him in with a cane every day and here we are lovingly
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.360]  trying to warn and reportedly they're making jokes about it because see they
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.120]  can't admit I mean last week Glenn Beck's talking about how the Thabian
[25:04.120 --> 25:07.480]  Socialists wanted to poison the water to sterilizes and the White House
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.160]  science ours talked about it but that's you know that's bad but but nobody else
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.160]  in industry would do something like that they got aspartame approved they knew
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.120]  it made monkeys go blind and I read on the back of this diet coke it says the
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.800]  heart truth there's a little doggie on the back and it says join diet coke in
[25:24.800 --> 25:32.200]  support of women's health programs visit diet coke.com what a sick joke and
[25:32.200 --> 25:39.960]  here's the big issue it's in almost every chewing gum now regular sugar gum
[25:39.960 --> 25:48.160]  regular sugared gum look at this big league chew remember eating this when
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.000]  I was a kid chewing this I mean look at this I'm gonna dump this out on the
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.480]  table give me a document cam shot of that look at this look at this stuff
[25:56.480 --> 26:03.080]  right here I'll dump it out on the table look at that just literally laced with
[26:03.080 --> 26:10.040]  aspartame cancer going blind here have the kids chew it and I'm a weirdo for
[26:10.040 --> 26:16.400]  reading mainline science and warning you I'm the bad man I'm the bad person I'm
[26:16.400 --> 26:24.040]  the cook I'm the nut people are going blind they're dying and quietly coke and
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.400]  others are trying to move away to other artificial sweeteners so now aspartame
[26:28.400 --> 26:31.880]  isn't the number one seller in diet drinks it's number two and they've
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.080]  moved on to other things that reportedly aren't as bad still have some issues but
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.600]  they still want to market for it so let's put it in all the kids chewing gum
[26:39.600 --> 26:51.120]  let's put it in adults juicy fruit big red extra bubble licious aspartame
[26:51.120 --> 26:54.480]  bubble licious right here regular chewing and how did I discovered this
[26:54.480 --> 26:57.760]  few years ago my children beg in gas stations and grocery stores for some
[26:57.760 --> 27:04.240]  gum most the time I can't get him gum it doesn't exist now without it this is
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.840]  something we can do to help people right now is to get this article warning to
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.200]  Glenn Beck don't drink diet coke and even if he won't listen and goes as blind
[27:13.200 --> 27:19.560]  as a bat that's his issue but isn't it child abuse if people know about this
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.680]  stuff and they give to their children oh but that's okay the government doesn't
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.120]  care about that but if you are on the oath keeper message board they're gonna
[27:27.120 --> 27:30.760]  put it in affidavit and take your newborn baby girl because you might be
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.040]  dangerous no judge no jury you know no due process just a fake family court
[27:35.040 --> 27:41.320]  system but there it is and it just goes on and on and on just like we told you
[27:41.320 --> 27:46.080]  decade over a decade ago that they would implode the global currencies to
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.520]  bring out a new global currency and here it is all over mainstream news today
[27:50.520 --> 27:53.760]  just like we told you more than a decade ago that they were packaging and
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.280]  bundling mortgages and taking people's houses that were paid for through
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.640]  fraud now they're suspending many of the foreclosures around the country five
[28:02.640 --> 28:06.840]  big banks have totally suspended it because it's now admitted that they've
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.680]  engaged in massive can complete fraud but again the average person couldn't
[28:11.680 --> 28:16.320]  believe us 11 12 years ago when we had mortgage experts on to talk about this
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.320]  because there's no way the banks would do something that corrupt there was no
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.320]  way sodium fluoride water would hurt you there was no way aspartame could be
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.600]  bad okay glenbeck just do this and other people that are on aspartame number
[28:29.600 --> 28:33.400]  one it's highly toxic and very addictive that's the big secret about it that's
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.760]  why they stack it up in the garages like addicts they've always got to have it
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.800]  they carry you know big gulps around with them and literally worship it
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.600]  glenbeck was an alcoholic this stuff breaks down into alcohol of but wood
[28:46.600 --> 28:52.520]  alcohol of course you like it glenbeck you're an alcoholic and you're still
[28:52.520 --> 28:58.120]  an alcoholic you're still drinking and you're giving your children a chemical
[28:58.120 --> 29:04.480]  that breaks down into toxic alcohol derivatives okay I've sent you mainline
[29:04.480 --> 29:09.800]  news and government documents on it of course you're a lush and you don't want
[29:09.800 --> 29:14.720]  to stop drinking but you might as well drink Jack Daniels it won't make you go
[29:14.720 --> 29:22.040]  blind only toxic alcohol will do that I guess if you drink enough regular alcohol
[29:22.040 --> 29:28.440]  it'll do it but the point is this is just in plain view and it shows the
[29:28.440 --> 29:33.720]  denial that is systemic across society just like people couldn't believe two
[29:33.720 --> 29:36.080]  months ago in Bloomberg reported even though they admitted to federal court
[29:36.080 --> 29:39.400]  that credential and others are taking the death benefits of six million
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.200]  veterans as they die and not giving them their insurance I mean you understand

[35:23.840 --> 35:30.080]  is really all about now I want to recap this and then go to Stuart Rhodes and
[35:30.080 --> 35:39.640]  then Mr. Irish on Friday morning we got the full affidavit and we were
[35:39.640 --> 35:42.480]  authorized to post it and I thought man I don't want to put their phone numbers
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.440]  and their all their information out I said okay there's a couple different
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.680]  documents court order affidavit I said snip this out snip that out just post
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.880]  those parts and people got confused and said is this real well last night
[35:54.880 --> 35:58.080]  Stuart got the full document we already had the full document he had
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.680]  authorization to black it out and the whole thing has been posted at
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.400]  oathkeepers.org it's also being posted in Paul Joseph Watson's latest article on
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.960]  this at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com but here's the latest feds
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.840]  treat baby snatched protesters like terrorists and they told Mr. Irish
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.560]  today that he won't be allowed to see his daughter in regular visitation during
[36:21.560 --> 36:24.400]  this process so they're basically already trying to totally in parental rights
[36:24.400 --> 36:27.800]  because of a security threat he said well let me let me see the file they said
[36:27.800 --> 36:33.880]  we don't have a file we're just doing this and it's his fiancee you know they're
[36:33.880 --> 36:37.560]  basically common law married it's it's horrible what's happening they admit in
[36:37.560 --> 36:42.160]  the filings that he is the father and they're saying it doesn't matter and the
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.800]  big issue here is there's all this mud being sling sling by CPS I have worked
[36:46.800 --> 36:49.960]  these cases I have exposed these for years we made documentaries about it
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.240]  it is standard procedure for them to lie and to say things even worse than what's
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.360]  in this affidavit but his landlord of a long time is on record saying he is
[37:00.360 --> 37:06.120]  model he and his fiance are model tenants never problems never noise never
[37:06.120 --> 37:12.120]  any issues the opposite of what this affidavit says and the CPS can make up
[37:12.120 --> 37:17.000]  whatever they want about you but regardless of that it is in the affidavit
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.880]  that the court used to take the child that he's a gun owner bought guns which
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.360]  last time I was legal in this country and that he was affiliated with a quote
[37:26.360 --> 37:30.680]  militia as if a militias bad but this isn't even a militia militias aren't
[37:30.680 --> 37:35.240]  bad but oathkeepers so this is political persecution and we know that
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.120]  southern property law center is now officially part we put the documents out
[37:38.120 --> 37:41.920]  friday oathkeepers posted them as well and wrote a report about it where they
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.480]  are now training local police but also medical workers school teachers they're
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.680]  setting up spies and local news reported last week that that ADL and his quote
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.200]  training locals to identify extremists and so now they're saying we'll take
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.240]  your child if you are part or a supporter of a group that says we'll
[38:03.240 --> 38:07.360]  support the Constitution and our oath so joining us to Stuart Rhodes then we're
[38:07.360 --> 38:11.040]  going to mr. Irish and because I already have guest scheduled today mr. Irish
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.480]  will be back on uninterrupted in the last 30 minutes of the fourth hour today so
[38:15.480 --> 38:19.480]  we're gonna hear from him a little bit now but going over this information and
[38:19.480 --> 38:24.400]  as a constitutional lawyer from Yale as a former you know staffer of Ron Paul
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.280]  really has a keen mind to understand this break down exactly what we're
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.320]  dealing with here Stuart Rhodes well the problem is is first of all CPS is
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.960]  already very low threshold of due process as you already pointed out before
[38:38.960 --> 38:45.080]  but he added that the fact that even in a criminal trial you wouldn't be
[38:45.080 --> 38:50.640]  allowed to say you're in trial for assault and you are an NRA member it
[38:50.640 --> 38:55.240]  would be improper and irrelevant for the prosecution to want to bring that fact
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.560]  to the jury it's not relevant to the fact that to the question hand whether
[38:59.560 --> 39:03.800]  you assaulted your wife and and the same thing would go for for prejudice it's
[39:03.800 --> 39:08.920]  also very prejudicial and so in the same situation here and a lot of folks are
[39:08.920 --> 39:11.200]  running around going well wait a minute we want to know whether or not they
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.840]  actually did this whether they endanger their child I thought the point the
[39:14.840 --> 39:20.600]  point is is that both keeper affiliations even gunnership are irrelevant to the
[39:20.600 --> 39:24.760]  question of whether or not they're guilty of endangerment and and they're also
[39:24.760 --> 39:30.120]  very prejudicial but because of the low threshold of due process in CPS it's
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.600]  all the easier and they get away with doing these kind of things and so what
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.160]  I would want what I'm gonna bring is a first amendment claim that this is a
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.240]  chilling and suppression of free speech because every parent America if this is
[39:42.240 --> 39:46.880]  allowed to stand will always have to wonder if maybe they will be put on a
[39:46.880 --> 39:52.400]  list and eventually in a CPS document they were ever running with CPS they'll
[39:52.400 --> 39:59.200]  utilize their affiliations with our group or say the tea parties or a 912 group
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.960]  or being a Glenn Beck fan or whatever it is but who knows and so if you allow the
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.680]  the politicization of CPS what you've really done is weaponized CPS to what
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.640]  to do as a weapon against political opposition and political dissidents and
[40:13.640 --> 40:18.480]  this is exactly what would happen in say you know Stasi dominated East
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.360]  Germany or Stalinist Russia we have to worry about being fingered and with no
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.320]  due process at all having a rights trip for you because of your political
[40:27.320 --> 40:31.560]  associations or political beliefs that could you do anything wrong or not
[40:31.560 --> 40:35.280]  because you're committing a crime but because they don't like who you are and
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.040]  Stuart and Stuart this is such tyranny that when we got from law enforcement the
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.520]  Mayak and Homeland Security reports people couldn't believe it was real and
[40:43.520 --> 40:47.120]  for a week we had to you know prove that and now of course it's admitted and
[40:47.120 --> 40:51.960]  people couldn't believe this so I kind of understand why when we didn't post the
[40:51.960 --> 40:55.600]  whole thing for their privacy people couldn't believe it because this is just
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.680]  so amazing but as you broke Friday and we have an article up on info wars.com
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.320]  and prisonplanet.com about this countering violent extremism working group in
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.480]  fact pull up that info or story I believe the headline was Southern
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.120]  Poverty Law Center now part of Homeland Security and it goes through the
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.800]  Homeland Security Advisory Council and then I even have local newscast last
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.600]  week in Austin where I live as they are rolling out ADL Southern Poverty Law
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.200]  Center going into churches schools I mean just type in the name of your town
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.120]  folks in ADL advising schools ADL advising doctors ADL advising
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.520]  psychiatrists and counselors and now counselors in school are saying our
[41:38.520 --> 41:41.680]  mommy and daddy don't like the government and then they're using that as a
[41:41.680 --> 41:44.440]  way to take them and we saw this with Barry Cooper the former narcotics
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.160]  officer who quit and exposed government corruption they took his son three months
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.520]  ago and we showed the CPS order and it said his father taught him not to trust
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.280]  the government so so this is this has been ongoing Stuart we're now just getting
[41:58.280 --> 42:03.880]  the documents this is coming out in the open that's right this is what regimes
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.840]  do either they create a second track of lower due process for political opponents
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.440]  or they use was already there in this case they're using what's already there
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.640]  it's been CPS and the CPS has a low threshold of due process because
[42:16.640 --> 42:19.920]  supposedly you're not being charged with a crime or punished they're mainly
[42:19.920 --> 42:23.840]  interested in the in the safety of the child so when they're targeting the
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.560]  parent for something has nothing to do with the child's safety it's now it's
[42:27.560 --> 42:30.480]  not a different matter it's now something that's being used as a weapon against
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.040]  the parent and any smoke screen about care for the child drops away it's got
[42:35.040 --> 42:39.800]  no adjudice whatsoever this is also this is also double jeopardy I mean you've
[42:39.800 --> 42:45.120]  got a messy divorce ongoing with her you know ex-husband who won't finalize that
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.880]  whether according to her statements and you know there's classic back-and-forth
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.560]  stuff going on there this guy is you know living with her they're about to get
[42:52.560 --> 42:57.480]  married they go to have a baby and there's no proof they've done anything to
[42:57.480 --> 43:02.440]  this newborn baby no proof they've done anything previous and they go in and take
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.720]  the newborn baby and then cite you're part of a pro-gun group you're part of
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.200]  this oath keepers and then they falsely state that you're a militia and again
[43:11.200 --> 43:13.760]  that's not bad to be part of a militia but the point is they can't even get that
[43:13.760 --> 43:18.600]  right they can't even get the birth dates right of you know the parents and
[43:18.600 --> 43:22.520]  people I mean it's just a shoddily written up half of David and now the
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.480]  whole thing is up at info wars dot com prison planet dot com and oath keepers
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.880]  dot org I want to bring Mr. Irish and disease with us fully 30 minutes in the
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.360]  last hour but we also need to announce there is going to be a major
[43:35.360 --> 43:39.920]  demonstration is there not stirred that's correct this Thursday the day of
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.880]  the hearing 1 p.m. he can give you more details but believe it's Dover Massachusetts
[43:44.880 --> 43:49.000]  or Dover, New Hampshire and he can give you the name of the court but it's also
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.360]  the also be on our site over at dot org but 1 p.m. this coming Thursday I'd like
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.640]  every oath keeper every every person who believes in the Constitution no matter
[43:57.640 --> 44:02.120]  what your group is to come out and stand there and rally for that for the
[44:02.120 --> 44:06.320]  First Amendment well if you're right to free association and open association
[44:06.320 --> 44:12.000]  and still to me not afraid okay let's go to Mr. Irish because there's been big
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.360]  to developments we appreciate you joining us in your courage to stand up
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.720]  against this these monsters specifically before we get into the rally that
[44:19.720 --> 44:24.040]  everyone in that area must attend it's so vital stand together or hang separate
[44:24.040 --> 44:28.720]  as Benjamin Franklin said first give us the latest developments where they're
[44:28.720 --> 44:34.560]  already trying to basically extra judicially break your connection to the
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.840]  child they're now saying for security reasons but but with no no bona fides
[44:40.840 --> 44:46.480]  that you can't see your baby correct Alex and thank you guys for having me on
[44:46.480 --> 44:52.200]  the show and giving us the chance to clear everything up well I was actually
[44:52.200 --> 44:57.760]  in the shower this morning and received a telephone call on the phone and that
[44:57.760 --> 45:05.000]  my mother picked up and brought directly to Stephanie and Stephanie with
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.640]  everything is going on she knows to record every phone call and tell them
[45:08.640 --> 45:14.280]  they are being recorded and they proceeded to tell her that well Stephanie we
[45:14.280 --> 45:20.560]  want you to come into visitation but Jonathan can't come in and she continues
[45:20.560 --> 45:24.840]  to say wait a minute right here on the documentation on the court order it
[45:24.840 --> 45:30.520]  states that the parents with an S meaning plural both Jonathan Irish and
[45:30.520 --> 45:36.520]  myself Stephanie Taylor are to have supervised visitation with our daughter
[45:36.520 --> 45:39.960]  so this shows and let's bring Stuart in and then continue and we'll hold you a
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.440]  little bit in the next hour this shows the complete lawlessness here that you
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.040]  have the court order we have it saying the visitation of the parents you know
[45:50.040 --> 45:55.960]  mr. Irish and his fiance and they're saying security threat and then you ask
[45:55.960 --> 45:59.720]  them what's the threat and they said we don't have a file but clearly we know
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.600]  what this is feds treat baby snatch protesters like terrorists the FBI told
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.160]  local TV and print news WM you are nine that there was no bomb threat and no
[46:10.160 --> 46:15.080]  specific threats they just sent bomb dogs in to basically imply that the
[46:15.080 --> 46:19.680]  little protest of ten people were basically demons last Friday I mean
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.120]  Stuart you can we can really see the hitlerian demonization going on here
[46:24.120 --> 46:30.200]  this is incredible well also as he said this wasn't in the courts order so
[46:30.200 --> 46:34.520]  they're actually defying if this is true they're actually defying the courts order
[46:34.520 --> 46:39.120]  so they're stepping out even beyond what the courts allow them to do so yeah I
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.760]  mean but it's characteristic oftentimes of a lot of these these CPS workers
[46:43.760 --> 46:48.280]  they can't develop a guy complex but it's also easy said it's kind of a
[46:48.280 --> 46:52.880]  hysteria too now they're ramping up the hysteria and they're even feeding on it
[46:52.880 --> 46:58.080]  themselves now mr. Irish Jonathan continuing I just wanted to interject
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.240]  those key points who specifically were you talking with when they just said hey
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.080]  pal don't show up because I want to warn you they're gonna be after you now
[47:06.080 --> 47:10.800]  everywhere you go you've got to have a video camera and witnesses because they
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.160]  know this is a big national issue now you are in danger now who are you talking
[47:15.160 --> 47:22.880]  to I'm fully aware that we need to watch our backs on this the individual the
[47:22.880 --> 47:29.520]  first person that spoke with them with Stephanie and she spoke with the they now put a new social worker in
[47:29.520 --> 47:37.240]  in charge of this case her name is uh Betty Keegan and after I could have a
[47:37.240 --> 47:42.560]  shower I ran right over to Stephanie and I wanted to find out if she was still on
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.320]  the phone wanted to talk to her see what what had been said she was off the
[47:46.320 --> 47:54.080]  phone at that point again she had recorded it and she had she had told
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.000]  them that they were being recorded as we tell everyone they call it from a
[47:58.000 --> 48:04.360]  number we do not know or a blocked number as DCYF did well she tells me
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.120]  what they said about me not being able to see our daughter and Stephanie
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.880]  elaborated and explained that the court order says that we can that both of the
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.480]  parents will have supervised visitation they have no reason to deny the
[48:20.480 --> 48:25.600]  court order well I turned around and I picked up the phone called and now
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.120]  mind you this is no more than five minutes later that after no more than
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.640]  five minutes after Stephanie get off the phone I picked up the phone and called

[48:48.000 --> 48:51.680]  because I had asked to speak with Betsy Keegan and they personally at home for
[48:51.680 --> 48:56.400]  that two minutes and then finally Tom O'Connell picks up the phone and says can
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.720]  I help you and the phone was being recorded I said Mr. O'Connell I'm I'm
[49:01.720 --> 49:06.440]  legally obligated to tell you that this telephone call is being recorded for my
[49:06.440 --> 49:15.360]  safety and he says okay and I continue to say well sir I am I understand that
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.440]  Stephanie just got off the phone with Betsy Keegan I'm trying to contact Betsy
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.560]  Keegan I would like to know why I'm not being put in touch with her he says oh

[49:39.760 --> 49:44.440]  daughter he says well that's none of your business and I told him I said so
[49:44.440 --> 49:47.920]  that is my business because if you're allowing and again this is this is
[49:47.920 --> 49:50.680]  information you have to speak with Stephanie to elaborate on because it's
[49:50.680 --> 49:57.160]  not my place but I told them that if if they are allowing our daughter to visit
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.800]  with her her parents there is going to be a serious legal issue because of the
[50:02.800 --> 50:06.760]  back that okay but just to be clear here let's bring Stuart and briefly as we
[50:06.760 --> 50:10.080]  got a break we're gonna come back with both of you this is a big deal with the

[50:15.320 --> 50:18.280]  know don't it sounds like they're really trying to terminate parental rights

[50:23.640 --> 50:27.640]  the court's order to support what the judge wants to be done so that's what

[50:32.560 --> 50:35.480]  you think you're working on it when we come back let's talk about this
[50:35.480 --> 50:40.160]  overall issue of having the FBI with bomb dogs at the hospital when there was
[50:40.160 --> 50:44.840]  no threat no nothing just to create an atmosphere of hysteria and to demonize
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.920]  anyone that dare protest in America and to have the police coming over and
[50:48.920 --> 50:52.280]  threatening people standing on the sidewalk I mean this is incredible we're

[54:15.360 --> 54:20.800]  hour today the last 30 minutes but specifically Stuart look at this how
[54:20.800 --> 54:26.920]  they how they first put oath keepers in the affidavit and the court ratified
[54:26.920 --> 54:31.600]  that by taking a child that's confirmed folks affidavits up at info wars dot com
[54:31.600 --> 54:36.200]  oath keepers org it's in all of our stories on this now we've added it you
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.000]  can read the whole thing and now they've got bomb sniffing dogs there at the
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.400]  protest and they said oh no one's made a bomb threat or anything we're just here
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.840]  basically to demonize you I mean this shows this pattern of political
[54:48.840 --> 54:52.320]  demonization and now they're saying you can't see your newborn daughter because
[54:52.320 --> 54:55.680]  of a security issue basically saying he's dangerous this is part of the
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.880]  ongoing frame-up Stuart well it's really part of the same pattern and here's
[55:00.880 --> 55:06.680]  the key point is that the judge in the expatriate order to seize the child
[55:06.680 --> 55:12.520]  adopted the entire affidavit as his as the judges reasons for issuing the
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.880]  orders that it is said findings of fact see affidavit and so it didn't didn't
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.480]  qualify it didn't it say except for number seven which referenced
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.680]  oath keepers it adopted the entire thing and so that you know that incorporates
[55:25.680 --> 55:31.320]  to all the affidavit into the order as the judges findings of facts and so you
[55:31.320 --> 55:36.680]  know oath keeper references are part of at least part of the reasons giving given
[55:36.680 --> 55:41.440]  and also good ownership and that's part of the petition the affidavits are
[55:41.440 --> 55:44.840]  attached to the petition so the CPS is arguing that to the court and then the
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.000]  court adopted it and so you have to hear the government agencies and the
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.880]  government court of accepting an affiliation with a with a you know
[55:53.880 --> 55:59.080]  totally nonviolent probably legal First Amendment rights protected political
[55:59.080 --> 56:04.040]  speech organization as evidence for why kids be taken from the parents this is
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.320]  why the social this is so shocking and outrageous this is this is the this is
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.600]  the camel's nose under the tent if this is allowed to stand then everyone in the
[56:12.600 --> 56:17.200]  country will have to worry and wonder if they won't have their children taken at
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.400]  least in part because of their affiliation yeah it's a massive it's a
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.040]  massive attempt at political terrorization to create a massive chilling
[56:26.040 --> 56:30.640]  effect and mr. irish has his landlord and others saying they are a model
[56:30.640 --> 56:36.080]  couple totally nice he's very credible on the videos of him at the protest that
[56:36.080 --> 56:41.360]  we have posted on our websites but I don't know him I don't know if he's
[56:41.360 --> 56:46.320]  telling the truth I believe he is but regardless we know the CPS's history of
[56:46.320 --> 56:52.840]  congenital lying by design a and b they're trying to change the subject with
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.480]  their demonization of mr. irish and his fiance when that's not even the issue and
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.560]  and some people are getting distracted by this disinfo it's about why is oath
[57:03.560 --> 57:08.320]  keepers and militias and gun ownership listed in there as a reason to take
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.840]  children this is precedent setting if it stands yeah I mean this is the problem
[57:13.840 --> 57:17.800]  constitutional law a lot of folks don't understand is that even if the person is
[57:17.800 --> 57:22.600]  guilty like Miranda for example we get a Miranda rights term in that case it
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.400]  turns out he had raped the girl and he was convicted on the second door route
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.520]  and he served 20 years in prison but it still didn't make it okay the course of
[57:30.520 --> 57:33.680]  confession out of it and so even if the person is you know turned out to be
[57:33.680 --> 57:37.480]  guilty of something as you said the key point here is that your political
[57:37.480 --> 57:41.440]  affiliations are not relevant it's a big old belong there and does create a
[57:41.440 --> 57:44.680]  tremendous killing effect in the years against both the government and the
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.440]  industry that's the Soviet Union where the police were political that's what a
[57:48.440 --> 57:54.480]  commissar and the commissariat was and but to be clear mr. irish I mean on
[57:54.480 --> 58:02.440]  record you have said that that the DCPS things are a pack of lies I mean
[58:02.440 --> 58:06.760]  specifically I mean they can't even get birthdays right in here correct right
[58:06.760 --> 58:13.720]  on the front page they were saying that my my I'm sorry our daughter's birthday
[58:13.720 --> 58:23.680]  is 11 6 2010 which is November 6 2010 and it's not even November yet yeah I
[58:23.680 --> 58:27.080]  mean well this is what I've seen in all these CPS things I've seen it where they
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.200]  get names wrong of the kids and use a three-year-old filing on some other
[58:31.200 --> 58:35.040]  family and child with a newborn to take it they're just so lazy they'll bring up
[58:35.040 --> 58:40.880]  just any fake thing to the judge we'll be right back in one minute stay with us

[58:51.440 --> 58:55.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.200 --> 58:58.960]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.480]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[59:19.520 --> 59:23.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.600 --> 59:27.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.920]  Jones and the GCN radio network well you can say what you want about Russell
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.720]  Means Native American leader probably the greatest living leader out there the
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:28.000]  most prominent movie star I mean you name it and he's helping lead the charge
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.040]  for a you know Native American you know a country within the United States we're
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.840]  gonna talk about that before he leaves us at the end of the hour but the reason
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.080]  I wanted to get him on is I was watching an old YouTube video of him on like
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.920]  year and a half ago when Obama first got elected even before he got elected he
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.800]  said look the Republicans are bad but the Democrats are the same they're owned
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.080]  by the same people it's a fraud he got attacked by all these liberals you know
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.520]  aren't as street smart as him and I wanted to get him on to talk about all
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.280]  of this but also the Empire is now imploding the dollar is plunging today
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:03.240]  gold is way up again we're gonna be going over that with him but also I'm a
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.040]  student of history so I know that concentration camps were invented by
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:14.080]  the British more than 200 years ago for India but also for the colonies and
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.760]  during the war they put people like who was not a friend of Native Americans
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.200]  you know Andrew Jackson's mother and brother who died you know as they were
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.640]  about to die they threw him back out on the street that's how they do it they
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.440]  starve you to death then throw you on the street to die you know by the time
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.640]  you've you know basically look like a concentration camp victim and I read the
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.280]  writings of Adolf Hitler and the history he modeled his camps off of the
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.880]  British concentration camps that were then perfected by the US Army in the
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.280]  cavalry out west against Russell Means people and others but now the plantation
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.440]  model the police state lockdown naked body scanning model the CPS seizing
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.520]  over a million children a year model is exactly what was done in Native
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.720]  Americans and if you study Native Americans even tribes that submitted to
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.920]  the tyranny and tried to make deals with it with the New World Order types and
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.360]  spent around for a while they would take all their boys and girls brainwash them
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.800]  break their families up and it's also come out in the last year in major
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.880]  Canadian news that they're digging up dead bodies of mainly Native American in
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:23.800]  Canada boys where they just kill them in these orphanages that's mainstream news
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:31.920]  so what's been going on to black people black people white people everybody is
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.360]  now happening to everyone and we lost Russell Means with his video Skype
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.520]  connection we're getting back up and if we're not successful we'll get him
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.320]  via telephone but I wanted to get Russell Means breakdown on all of this
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:51.240]  information so Russell Means was born on the Lakota
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.460]  Sioux Indian Reservation he was the first national director the American Indian
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.480]  movement aim in which role he became prominent during 73 standoff of the US
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:03.160]  government and wounded knee in 87 he joined the US Libertarian Party and
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.120]  announced his candidacy for the presidential nomination he lost the
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.960]  nomination to Ron Paul since 92 Means has appeared in the last the Mohicans
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.920]  natural born killers and other movies he has championed the rights of
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.120]  indigenous peoples in other countries as well as in the US the televised
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.820]  speech in 2000 Libertarian Party National Convention Means said that he
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.200]  prefers the label Indian to more politically correct Native American
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.880]  everyone who was born in America is a Native American he said and he joins us
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.320]  now to talk about the state of the world but we're obviously talking about now
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.520]  Homeland Security saying gun owners landowners libertarians home Homeland
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.280]  Security now has ADL Southern Poverty Law Center involved I have the official
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.840]  document and they're now going to school teachers school counselors and
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.240]  trying to take people's children if they're anti-New World Order and so now
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.840]  what was done to the Native Americans to the Native Indians is now being done
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.240]  to everybody so I guess what comes around goes around sins of the fathers
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.560]  will come back on the grandsons and the great grandsons mr. Means good to have
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.200]  you with us thank you Alex great to be with you again what do you think of that
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.440]  information I just laid out it's right on point and I've been saying since the
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:21.760]  1980s that America that was my speeches to the colleges I would I entitled it
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.520]  America is becoming one huge Indian reservation I changed that title in the
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.800]  90s to America has become one huge Indian reservation and it's even more so
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.160]  today all policies of the United States government both foreign and domestic
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.480]  were bred and born on an Indian reservation that's land policy that's
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:51.440]  health that's education and of course economic and political and you're not
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.080]  just saying that I mean there's an entire historical fact behind that this is
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:00.520]  how they learned to get people dependent through the you know the government
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.840]  agents that that you know ran the programs to quote give the you know
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.520]  Indians food and blankets and it was all designed to starve you out and kill
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.120]  you and now they admit this is their global plantation model that's what the
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.720]  carbon tax they admit is is to shut off all of our energy the equivalent of
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:26.680]  shutting off the buffalo to the Native Americans right we lost this guy
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.480]  again if it does it one more time we're gonna get him on the telephone Russell
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.360]  Means again is our guest I want him to continue to flesh this out because
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:40.800]  Hitler modeled his camps off of the Indian reservations that is what Adolf
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.840]  Hitler did this is mainline history Hitler was obsessed with Western movies
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.560]  and books about the reservations and that was his plan for Russia with the
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.800]  Russians I was gonna kill him off and then you know decide who he wanted to
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.440]  live it's just it's just absolutely diabolical and if Russell cuts out one
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.420]  more time we're gonna get him via telephone here in just a moment but
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:09.880]  Russell means or may just go audio Skype with him but we're gonna talk about
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.240]  Obama and the state of the Empire and a lot more with Russell Means coming up
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.960]  also foreclosure freeze could undermine housing market because it's these
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.640]  mortgages are run by you know unscrupulous groups that are riddled with
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.960]  fraud White House doubts need to halt all foreclosures though it's now being
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:32.160]  discussed up to 40 states launch probes into foreclosure mess it's not a mess
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.120]  it's a fraud 420 banks demand one world currency international finance group
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.840]  seeks remedy to looming exchange wars financial regulators planning worldwide
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.280]  rules for large firms they create the crisis offer the global government
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.200]  solution Washington Post fed undaunted by uncertain prospects of more money
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:57.440]  printing so now they're gonna devalue the currency publicly okay let's go back
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.720]  to Russell Russell we got you on the phone now please continue flesh out
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.960]  what you were talking about you know the evidence that the entire world
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:12.320]  Fallujah the camps the the ID cards Iraq this is all the model perfected on your
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.920]  people exactly even the depth squads were first practice on us back in 1973 on
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.760]  the Pine Ridge Union reservation where I'm calling where you're calling me from
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:30.240]  and but my point is education it's the proving proof when I grew up in
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.800]  California Northern California California was ranked number one in the
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.880]  nation and the nation was ranked number one in the world in education then the
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.280]  federal government began to take it take over the funding and then the
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:52.520]  curriculum of all the schools in the U.S. it is now California is no longer
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:16:00.280]  number one it's number 43 in the nation and we have slipped in the last within
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:08.600]  the last 15 years from 17th as a nation 17th in education to 22nd and so it's
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:16.600]  almost complete now that the federal government has been brainwashing brain
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.840]  washing our children for decades and it's all taken from the reservation system
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:28.840]  the stealing of kids that is is one of the most horrific examples of what the
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.960]  federal government has been doing not only to us but now to the American
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:41.120]  children it is it's it's blasphemous that the chaining of young America are
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.560]  stensively to fight the drugs drug war and yet the incarceration we have more
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:55.040]  bodies more people in prison than all of China and China has a couple billion
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:01.240]  people and yet it's supposed to be a communist horror place and in yet America
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.840]  has more people in prison than China that's absurd that's absolutely absurd
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.960]  well that's like shipping in whiskey for the Indians and then when they get
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.680]  rowdy using as an excuse to shoot them it the government's on record shipping
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.880]  and almost all the narcotics and then when they catch you with it you go to
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.440]  one of their slave camps exactly exactly and it is a slave camp it's
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.880]  unbelievable you know my son I have a son that was in prison they wouldn't
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.320]  parole him because he was ramrodding the building of homes they called him
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.080]  Jankler homes because he was the governor at the time but they were
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:47.880]  building homes in with prison labor $1.50 a day and it wouldn't let him out on
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.560]  parole because he was the supervisor he was so accomplished that he was more
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.280]  valuable in prison than out and then the general public like idiots say good
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.960]  make those criminals work when you're working for 25 cents or even a dollar
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.880]  50 an hour no one can compete with that not even the illegal aliens and so the
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.080]  economy further implodes exactly in Colorado has become such a prison state
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.520]  you know they make all nothing but office furniture there so there's no
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.040]  business at all in Colorado the surrounding state making business
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.240]  furniture for instance so it did cut out that industry so we definitely have
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.600]  slave labor going on in this country and it's unconscionable that the American
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.240]  people don't do anything about all of what the Indian policies have been
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.320]  visited upon on their backs and on their children what's interesting is either
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.960]  way you slice it it's an Indian policy because from my study before they kicked
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.280]  it off in a scientific way against Native Americans in North America this
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:01.760]  was first developed in India which are really the indents exactly but the pay
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.480]  off now comes and I can't believe the name callers I you know I I call the
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:15.920]  Republican Party nothing but name callers and I called the the Democrats
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.240]  brain dead because they don't know what they are and they don't try to do
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:27.520]  anything except a rubber stamp whatever the bosses say but they're now and now
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.520]  they've announced they're going to print more money can you believe that the Fed
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:37.800]  is going to print more money when they're the only ones buying the financial
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:42.000]  instruments that the United States produces the bonds and the treasury
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.520]  notes because no one in the world wants anything of that is of no value and the
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:55.600]  dollar is of no value it's unbelievable how America is keeping their head you
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.680]  know it's the classic ostrich approach yeah they should get rid of the American
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.000]  Eagle as the symbol and have it be the ostrich exactly that's what it's become
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.880]  great point I'm gonna start using that the eagle has become the ostrich the
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:17.640]  American eagle it's it's it's it's sick you know I you know I'm wearing a t-shirt
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:24.640]  that says if voting could change anything it would be illegal and that's
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.200]  what really bothers me about the Tea Party movement and when it first started
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.880]  it was great it's all about the Constitution and Constitutional law and
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:40.640]  let's get back to that and then they start feeding in the crazies you know to
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.840]  make them look like it's a fringe outfit and they accomplished it well they've
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.400]  been caught they've been caught going back to this asinine liberty inhibiting
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:56.160]  and preventing two-party system it's impossible to have individual liberty
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:03.640]  with a two-party system it's amazing and they have been caught infiltrating the
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.280]  Tea Parties with people to say racist things and do things and they've labeled
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.240]  the Tea Party as the only resistance to the New World Order then they hand it
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.800]  over to the Republicans so they can pose as anti-establishment and get right back
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.400]  into power but now the whole country is sinking into a global depression they're
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.480]  announcing the one-world government run by the banks that are the authors of
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:29.400]  this collapse I mean this empire is long in the tooth what do you see happening
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:35.480]  Russell means well I see the United States of America with only its military
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:43.960]  power trying to hang on to some kind of international influence but when Israel
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:50.720]  thumbs their nose at anything the United States wants or desires or
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:58.320]  asks for they just thumb their nose a Europe Russia you go on down the line
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:07.200]  China has switched over to the Euro Brazil's Real has now become what the
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:13.320]  currency to buy it's backed by something solid the United States it's just backed
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:21.200]  by paper worthless paper it's unconscionable the entire machinations
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:27.240]  of the ruling class of America is so obvious it's so obvious that anybody
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.680]  with a brain I can't understand what's in the food that I was making American
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.720]  people so stupid in the lapping stock of the world well Russell since she raised
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:45.040]  that I have children's Flintstones pediatricians number one choice and it
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:53.600]  says right here on the container that it has aspartame and oh my god and then
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:02.600]  here is a allergy medicine alvert and it's got aspartame in it and then all
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:10.040]  all the major sugargums for children now hubba bubba big league shoe all of them
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.240]  now have aspartame and I have all the government's own reports admitting it
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:18.040]  gives you cancer and makes you go blind and Glenn Beck's going blind and admits
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.440]  he drinks Diet Coke but I guess it's funny he's just gonna laugh about it and
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:28.320]  go blind it's amazing how this the American people have allowed the
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:35.920]  government to treat the end result of drug-induced illnesses by the by the
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:42.720]  pharmaceutical corporations and they allow that to continue you know they're
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.760]  building dialysis centers they're putting more drugs to take care of the
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:53.160]  drugs that have already got you addicted and sick and ill and that kill you so
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:24:00.360]  they produce more more drugs so that you can die faster and die in more pain it's
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:05.680]  it's unbelievable how the American people have allowed themselves to be so
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:12.080]  duped well you know from the 1730s there are and anybody can Google this and
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.200]  pull up the university websites there are the the British Colonel ordering them
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.280]  to take infected smallpox blankets and then give it to the Native Americans to
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.720]  the Indians and you know let's give the tainted wood alcohol whiskey to them ha ha
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.080]  you know look at that engine go blind well now the globalists just do it to
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.760]  everybody Russell right and if they don't do it to them they imprison you for
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:43.480]  slave labor you know if you if you won't take their their drug-induced sicknesses
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:50.520]  they'll put you in prison it's it's our impoverished you like we don't have a
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.320]  middle class anymore you know and those that think there still is a middle class
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:04.040]  are you know by January February the dollar is going to be worth about I see
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:10.480]  the year is a dollar 40 now it's going to be about four dollars at the very
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.080]  minimum probably around February and March it the year is going to be worth
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:20.520]  about four dollars that's inflation it's it's unbelievable what the United
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.560]  States is doing to its own people and the Federal Reserve is selling it as if
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.160]  it's a good thing we're gonna fix the debt by inflating was it good for
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:35.080]  Argentina was it good for Zimbabwe why my Republic Germany Russell exactly it's
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.640]  it's you know he's the all those platitudes about history repeating
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.040]  itself America is the proof it just goes over and over and over again and
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:52.840]  American people are acting look at this this coming November election what's
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:59.320]  going to change nothing it's unbelievable that people are even
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:05.400]  believing the Republicans because Obama is worse than Bush he's continued
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.680]  Bush's policies and added more to himself not one presidential directive
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:19.320]  that Bush has laid out has been changed by Obama and he's added more and now he
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:27.080]  can he's he's directed the US government to kill anybody that they say is a
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.280]  terrorist just go shoot him well they're also rolling out the naked body
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.240]  scanners on the streets the courthouses the airports and they admit even the
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.920]  New York Times admits it gives you cancer and it gives the operators cancer
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.200]  and they have 500 mobile trucks 10 times more powerful than a chest x-ray looking
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:53.320]  through our walls this is 1984 this is psychopaths running the country yes it
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.520]  is totally totally 1984 you know there's an interesting sidebar to that you know
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:07.840]  Orwell when when TV came out back in the 40s he wrote the book they said 1940 and
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:15.440]  he labeled it 1948 and it was a factual thing that was going to happen based
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.360]  upon the advent of TV his publisher said look this book isn't going to sell
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.520]  turn it into a science fiction and give it a different title so he inverted 48 to
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.360]  84 and voila you had the science fiction prediction of what is happening
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.320]  right now and that's a true story and of course he was a member of the Imperial
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.160]  Police in India what we were talking about developed for Indians in the US
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.440]  then he was a communist and thought that was the solution then he found out it
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.480]  was run by the same people then he worked for OSS that's why his book was so
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:28:01.080]  accurate he worked for them right and he's uh it was it's amazing that the
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.560]  college students aren't that's not not required reading but what can we what
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.040]  can you say when 80% of the law schools in America do not teach the
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:16.520]  Constitution you know I have a daughter that just graduated from a law school she
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.560]  had to almost demonstrate just to get a class on the Constitution at the
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.400]  University of Minnesota law school of law
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.880]  unbelievable Russell means is our guest Russell means dot com links up on

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.440]  they've got it lined up now they're imploding the economy and the Pentagon
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.320]  comes out last month and says we're afraid of a total collapse but we've got
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.480]  martial law ready for the civil unrest we're gonna save you I mean it's
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.000]  amazing how they create the crisis offer the solution exactly and then
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.240]  there's still warmongering over in the Middle East trying to control that basis
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:13.640]  when when every other major country Europe Russia China they're all they're
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:19.560]  all making backdoor deals with the Middle East while America is killing its
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.960]  young people and the reason they can't beat the Afghans and Pakistan's is
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.680]  they've got the fighting spirit of American Indians but they've got grenade
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:35.360]  launchers that's the different grenade launchers and missile firing shoulder
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:45.040]  weapons it's a dirty war that cannot be won just like in Vietnam well Russell

[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.200]  a lot of good people in it but they were always at war with each other and the
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.160]  problem is that the Americas got colonized by the slavers first so the
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.560]  worst elements of society and we'll talk about that with Russell Means coming

[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.880]  this going and I appreciate everybody's previous support so info wars moneybomb.com
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.560]  there's a new video today out where I talk about the special 24-plus hour
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.320]  broadcast that is coming out and also support Russell Means is doing at
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.280]  Russell Means.com we'll talk about where that sovereignty movement is going
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.240]  before he leaves us at the five hour five minute after at the next hours we've
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.760]  got him on a little bit late today but Russell you got cut off talking about the
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.720]  Afghanistan situation the Pakistan situation being widened by the Nobel
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:25.000]  Peace Laureate Barack Hussein Obama I mean what a sick joke you were making
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.720]  parallels to Vietnam exactly you know he is the first Nobel Peace Laureate that
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:40.120]  when he made his acceptance speech he justified war it was unbelievable such a
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:46.720]  slap in the Nobel's face but if that's a phony organization anyway it comes up
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:51.120]  every once in a while with something worthwhile but most of the time it's
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:37:00.440]  it's for the elite but yes the situation in the Middle East is so blatantly
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:10.840]  obvious and the fact that the ruling elite of America refused to to economically
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:15.680]  take advantage of the green revolution you know they're not going to go there
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:25.640]  until until they have the oil unavailable and I'm not saying when the
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:32.440]  oil runs out I'm saying when it's unavailable the the fact that Russia
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:40.680]  has most of the gold reserves left in in the world at any time they wish they
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.920]  could flood the market with gold and just ruin the world economy of course
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.320]  they'd have to ruin their own economy at the same instance but I'm just saying
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:58.440]  people are so unaware of what's really really going on and you know the debacle
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:05.840]  of the government's treatment of the BP spill in the Caribbean for instance you
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:12.440]  know caught they've been blatantly caught lying and misleading the American
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:20.640]  people about that disaster it's just over and over again when American people
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.960]  are being not only slapped across the face but kicked in the butt and yet they
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:36.120]  asked for more let me go ahead sir well and then it's it's like the king
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:41.640]  wears no clothes the emperor wears no clothes and so all the American people
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:48.400]  are starting to take off their clothes it's just an absurd lifestyle I want to
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.240]  shift gears into just the overall mindset of these globalists they admit
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.600]  they want to cut off the resources to quote end industrial age so we're
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.480]  basically all dependent on them in the reservation aka the inner city slums that
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.680]  they've designed through dependence I mean it's the same model but but I
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.600]  remember over a decade ago experts explaining that they were packaging the
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.520]  mortgages and selling them and then changing the mortgage rules and now
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.120]  even CNN admits JP Morgan Goldman Sachs and others have been caught taking
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.720]  houses that were totally paid for that they didn't even have a mortgage for
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.640]  they've been caught selling to the Chinese the same mortgages over and over
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:32.360]  again and now they've had to freeze all Bank of America foreclosures because
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.040]  people are learning about this and just a few years ago the media would say oh
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:42.280]  it's Patriot liars it's Patriot you know propaganda it's paper terrorism these
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:47.280]  you know these the pro se citizens going in and pointing out that the law had
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.200]  been broken all these different ways with the mortgages now the people stood
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.080]  up and they're talking about freezing all foreclosures because of the total
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.360]  fraud and then that dovetails with the I don't know if you saw this but Bloomberg
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.040]  reported it should have been bigger news that Prudential and others admitted in
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.840]  court that they made a secret deal 11 years ago with the Pentagon with
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:13.200]  veterans affairs to to take the lump sum death benefits of 6 million dead and
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.680]  dying veterans going back to World War two Korea Vietnam and up till today and
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.720]  they take their money and the government made a deal to let insurance
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.920]  companies do this I mean it's the just like core exit the average life expand
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:31.440]  lifespan is 51 if you use core exit and the Exxon Valdez cleanup now they've
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.920]  used conservatively thousands of times or over 45 million gallons of it in the
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.880]  Gulf and Obama comes out and says there's no health problems I could play
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  the clip no health problems and this stuff isn't bad for you it's just an
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.480]  ongoing devastation and they tell us the oil has been completely cleaned up and
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.560]  later admit that's a lie I mean they're using DU all over the planet 14 times
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.000]  birth defects and cancers in Fallujah three to four times in our own troops
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.400]  they tell the troops go ahead and use it it's not bad for you what is this
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.720]  psycho it's it's just they're destroying their own nest there they've gone
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.320]  completely loony to just crime never before seen Russell can you comment on
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.120]  what you what you would call this spirit of pure wickedness I would call it
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:23.480]  medieval it's exactly the way you know before Timbuktu and and immediately
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.400]  after that was the only place they could get gold and silver was Timbuktu in
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.280]  Africa and so consequently the only ones who had money were the royalty of
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:41.440]  Europe and the the serfs that were allowed to barter and that's all their
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:47.680]  their monetary value was in bartering but there's a curious exception there
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:55.040]  when during medieval times the serfs and each every time the lords of the manner
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:03.600]  the royalty would increase taxes beyond 25 percent the serfs would rebel now
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:10.960]  here in America you are taxed average of men that average American is taxed 43
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:17.440]  percent of his income and that's conservative exactly and that's
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.920]  conserved that's very conserved I said the average America that includes the
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.480]  unemployed so and then the other thing is is what they've learned from the banks
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.240]  and the realty companies and the corporations the government is now
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:41.000]  using all kinds of phony values to perpetuate the printing of their own
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.320]  money and to make and to make it valuable so that they can continue on this
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:53.600]  illegal printing of bogus paper well we now know they're taking thousands of
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.200]  houses where they don't even have the deed and the homes paid off this is
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.200]  mainstream news I mean that they just did there they must think they're
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.720]  invincible but but they're not because it's shutting down I think they've gone
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:10.480]  I think but you know I talked about they perfected it on Native Americans on
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:16.240]  Indians as you prefer to be called and and but going back they really perfected
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.040]  it or started it with Europe if you look at surfdom and how they kept them on
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.000]  tiny pieces of land how they kept them at near starvation wrote manuals on it
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.040]  this was just a continuation and expansion of that same European royal
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:36.400]  system that's my point the other thing is is the phantom economics that the
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.280]  corporations have given birth to that the government has also been a part of
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.720]  for example right here in the state of South Dakota the the state of South
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.920]  Dakota's attorney general trades the Pine Ridge and all the Sioux Indian
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.680]  reservations there's nine of us in the in the state of South Dakota they
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.960]  traded on Wall Street through Dunn and Brad Street the value of the reservation
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.880]  the value of each individual on the reservation and we're all one welfare
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:13.480]  yet we still have a phantom value on Wall Street and so the tax base the tax
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:20.160]  base we are represent less than 10% of the states population yet we are 25% of
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:25.400]  the tax base and we don't pay real estate taxes on the reservation go go figure
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:32.360]  that out and so it's understandable now that these states excuse me have been
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.680]  using Indian lands and Indian population in phantom financial instruments yeah
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:42.680]  they're leveraging it and just and then make you just making stuff up exactly
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:50.240]  and so it's a it's a house of paper a house of cards whatever you wanted to
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.480]  label it but it hasn't any financial foundation and that's what America has
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:06.440]  been operating on for decades so is it is it bold arrogance imperial hubris or
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:10.720]  is it desperation that they're now getting so greedy they're grabbing
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:15.760]  houses they don't even own that are paid for you've hit the nail on the head you
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:23.160]  know I they're now getting desperate because the wealth has been absolutely
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:30.720]  used of the wealth of America has been used up and indebted so it's they have
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:37.040]  to go to this this paper monopoly money in order to and then these phantom
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.120]  financial instruments in order to keep their dominance and guess where all of
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.720]  that phantom and the real money is going into the military so they can at
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.600]  least still claim up a place of leadership somewhere in the world yeah
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:57.360]  nuclear blackmail exactly well Russell you know every day I get on the show and
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.440]  I see all the numbers everything we talked about now confirmed in spades
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.960]  worse than I could even imagine people say Alex you exaggerate no nine times
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.440]  out of ten it's worse than I can even articulate I'm always learning more it's
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.320]  it's so crazy that I can't even believe it I know what other people can't believe
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:20.200]  this stuff because it's so brazen it's so naked it's so openly insane and
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  self-destructive even for the controllers but they just can't help it
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.960]  because they're on power trips that we're in a depression they've now
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.440]  announced they're gonna hyperinflate the currency like why my republic is in
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.240]  bob way right and I don't think even the listeners of this show I don't think
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.280]  even I because we've had it so good so long realize the type of hell we're
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.120]  entering but there's two choices as Ron Paul has said we either go the way of
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:52.320]  using this pain to get some freedom back and get up on our hind legs or we
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.000]  ain't seen nothing yet these controllers are gonna use this to set up even more
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.840]  power and control and they're doing it right now Russell your comments on this
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:06.160]  do you agree with me that we're at a historic crossroads make or break it I
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:13.440]  agree with that and I and I also have to state that I think it's past the
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:20.120]  crossroads have passed because when you look at our our forced diets you know
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:28.800]  anything that has a grain any grain food isn't good for you you know there
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:35.520]  isn't any food produced in America that's good for you unless you eat it raw
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:41.560]  practically and you know I heard your your your commercial on your it that's
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:47.280]  the place you have the places the type of places you have to go just to stay
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.680]  healthy in this country and fortunately on the reservation the corporate
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:59.280]  corporation food people haven't reached us yet so we can still get some natural
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:07.480]  foods but we have government forced agricultural department food put on us
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:14.640]  every month high in sodium high in GMO high in every poison you can think of
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.320]  well how diabolical is it that people wake up to aspartame the last ten years
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.160]  people stop buying it so even Coke's offering Coke zero and other alternatives
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:31.040]  and now go to a grocery store 99% of the gum most the time I can't even find it
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.640]  that sugar for children has aspartame in it I mean I know I talked about this
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.320]  earlier but think about the cold-bloodedness they know this gives
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.120]  them cancer they know that's what gets me and these other corporate criminals
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:52.520]  that never are charged with anything it's an American I keep going back to
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:57.840]  irresponsibility of the American people because that is the very first rule of
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:04.160]  freedom you are free to be responsible you cannot have freedom unless you
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:10.320]  responsible and to allow yourself to be poisoned to allow your children to be
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:19.800]  stolen allow the incarceration of innocent well we lost his phone line I
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.400]  wonder if somebody's fiddling with it they admit this guy's under federal
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.320]  surveillance constantly we'll get Russell means back on boy you hear the
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.360]  media calling him a liberal a calming he's the opposite of that he's a
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.080]  libertarian barely lost out to Ron Paul running for libertarian president
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.240]  way back in the 80s and that's why they hate Russell means he's really he's
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.800]  Alex Jones but before Alex Jones was born and because he studied it I mean
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.880]  you you go to the research it's it doesn't matter if you're a you know white
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.120]  guy or a Native American or black or Asian or whatever you are I mean you
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.040]  know you're a human being and what we're facing is real every time he's on the
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.600]  phone lines do this I mean I remember the last two interviews with Russell means
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.560]  this this kind of chicanery was going on so we'll continue with him we get him
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.120]  back on the line one time the phones went dead Russell remember that one time

[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.000]  wasn't you were saying when they cut you off well I was talking about how the
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.400]  American people are not free to be responsible and that's the first very
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:50.480]  first rule of freedom is that you are free to be responsible and when you're
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:55.760]  so irresponsible to ignore the fact that your children are being stolen innocent

[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:08.000]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.120]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.760]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.600]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so

[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.320]  people to expose sterilization it came out government documents that tens of
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:28.760]  thousands of Native Americans Indians were sterilized and of course you know
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:34.040]  last week it came out about Guatemala and Hillary apologized you know shooting
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:40.160]  kids men women up with a hardcore live syphilis folks this is all ongoing and
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.720]  and people need to get this through your head and I'm going to briefly tell a
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.960]  story that I want Russell to get into this but I have a good friend whose dad
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.240]  was one of the heads of a major corporation I'll just leave it at
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:56.920]  that base in Houston and after his dad died we went to the funeral and he told
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:59.960]  me the story about how they were at the Grand Canyon when he was a little kid
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:05.600]  with his brother and sister and there was a drunk Indian stumbling around by the
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.440]  Grand Canyon and his dad looked at him smugly and he said son you see that
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.680]  that's why we got their land well that's why they're putting poison in your
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:20.440]  diet coke and your kids food you're being poisoned so they can get you so
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.520]  you can be their slave and it's this attitude of yuppies and some white
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.960]  people or I see with black folks anybody that gets some government power with
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.680]  corrupt police that they're on the winning team and it's a wink-wink look
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:38.080]  what we're doing to them Russell your comments on that well it's the classic
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:44.440]  colonial tool to brainwash you know once you're your once you're part of the
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:51.760]  in-group you know just witness the black people now there are blatant acts of
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:55.680]  racism being perpetuated against them but because they have a black president
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.880]  they think they're in so they're not saying a word they're not doing a thing
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.920]  and if they not helping anyone else either the American people are the same
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.800]  way it happened with the Italians it happened with the Irish it happened with
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.560]  all the immigrants that come to this country once they're in then they ignore
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:23.120]  their constitutional rights because they're in it is a weakness in the
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:31.840]  American fabric the only way American people can become responsible is to
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.360]  grab their constitution and declare their freedom from the American
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:43.560]  government and let's put them out of a job at the Supreme Court is blatantly
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:49.840]  corporate controlled it is on and on and on that the the United States government
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.720]  we know that the president United States government was incorporated in
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:00.400]  Puerto Rico and is it's not a constitutional government and that's
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.600]  why it's all capitalized those of us that understand this are the freedom
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:12.640]  fighters that are left in America and the American people has this fantasy of a
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.800]  constitutional government which we do not have we have to grab our
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:25.080]  responsibility I mean I realized as an American Indian that the United States
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.200]  of America is not going to live up to the Constitution of the United States
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:34.520]  I've proven it all the way to the Supreme Court so rather than continue
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.080]  knocking my head against the brick wall I didn't want my brain to turn to jelly
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:47.000]  so I reestablished the freedom of my people with the Republic of La Cota
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.200]  that's right you've declared we withdrew from our treaties with the United
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.960]  States of America and it's all backed by international and constitutional law
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.920]  we're gonna go to break and come back and briefly talk about that moment I'm
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:05.200]  gonna get you back up in the near future it's been too long to have you on sir
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.760]  but I can really feel your soul your strength your honor and I just want to
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:12.240]  point out to all those that think they're part of the end crowd the cops
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.080]  everybody else look we're all in this together whether you're a Native
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.880]  American Indian black white you better understand that that we're all being
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.880]  poisoned we're all under attack and that at a spiritual level we all who love
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:31.320]  freedom and decency and honor we need to come together against this tyranny I'm
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.160]  gonna get Russell means take on that statement I just made on the other side
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:40.960]  but look we better come together under freedom or we're all dead meat
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:51.680]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:56.120]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.200]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.720]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:07.280]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:16.000]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.760]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.640]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.360]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:40.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:45.040]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[01:59:53.040 --> 02:00:00.840]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:23.680]  Alex Jones
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.680]  well we've only got five minutes left with him I'm gonna get him back in the
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:42.360]  near future to talk about the you know free Indian nation and internationally
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:45.720]  it's been accepted and it's important for all of us to stand up to say I'm not
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.560]  under this new world order America's gone the globalist took it over whatever
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.920]  it ever was before it's gone now people better realize our country's dead before
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.000]  we can get it back well I'm I'm all for what they've done out in the area that
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.680]  Russell means is in briefly tell folks about that and then tell folks about the
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:08.520]  sterilization of Native Americans sir well the Republic of Dakota of course
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:16.560]  is now free and we are we have we have a strategy both local regional and
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:24.680]  international our strategy is to reinforce the constitutional rights and
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:35.640]  the responsibility of citizenship the the fact about how America is controlling
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:41.760]  the population from Indian policy one of the factors is through sterilization
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.040]  whether it's through the food or whatever but this was forced sterilization
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:54.680]  and sterilization by fraud 42% of American Indian women in a four-year
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:01.400]  period in the 70s was forcibly sterilized 42% of our women and George
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:10.200]  Herbert Walker Bush ran the program exactly exactly well good point and at
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:19.320]  the same time 36% of the women Puerto Rican women were sterilized I expose this
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:27.800]  on a morning talk show when we went on the longest walk in 1978 into in senator
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:33.880]  Aberesque a one-term senator before he resigned that's an interesting side
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:42.240]  story he was at a social event in on the hill in DC and CBS News or one of the
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.400]  networks caught him they asked him why are you not running again you only had
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.360]  one term in the Senate and he said he thought it was awful to cuff but they
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.000]  they televised that he said I can't wait to get out of this chicken shit off of
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:05.760]  it I was Senator Aberesque but he was an Arab elected to the Senate in the state
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:11.120]  of South Dakota and that was the that's why he was one of the reasons he wanted
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:20.600]  to get out because his two popular or unpopular endeavors were supporting the
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:26.200]  Arab cause and the American Indian cause two very unpopular issues in
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:35.320]  Congress so he got out now and on the Republic of Lakota you know the best the
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:43.040]  best website to go to is Russell means freedom dot com Russell means freedom
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:50.760]  dot com well Russell I want to get you back for a full hour in the next few

[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.800]  many crimes we cover in it but but now in light of people thinking about this
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:08.320]  again because of the Guatemala civilist situation injecting men women and
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.040]  children with it it's a good time to bring this back up to get into the
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.960]  specifics of how they would secretly sterilize Native American women so we'll

[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.280]  receiving reports that while Glen Beck was out of town for medical treatment
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:04.800]  going blind and other things as Phil and host made a sardonic joke about the
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.400]  health dangers of drinking diet cola with aspartame to remind everyone that
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.240]  this is a serious issue and not a joke here's Glen Beck's own Fox News reporting
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:19.240]  on how aspartame has been linked to a wide range of cancers in studies
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:23.640]  involving rats and we have a link to Fox News the whole thing is full of
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:27.160]  universities the government's own admissions the studies when they tried
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:32.280]  to approve it in the 70s and failed twice brain cancers going blind it
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:37.960]  breaks down into a form of wood alcohol what is bad you know moonshine do it
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:43.600]  makes you go blind okay they're sitting a game they're sitting a game and Glen
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:47.440]  Beck is falling apart like millions of other Americans and since we exposed
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.840]  aspartame in the last 15 years along with many others with Betty Martini and
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.960]  Dr. Russell Blalock and countless others scientists researchers you name it
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:02.560]  they now just come out with over 10,000 products with aspartame in it it's in
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:09.840]  TV dinners now for no reason it's just in everything and it is a soft kill
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.640]  weapon they don't just shoot Guatemalan children up with syphilis that's
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.240]  admitted they don't just give African children this year and last year CBS AP
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.880]  report live polio to kill them weaponized polio that's mainstream oh
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:26.400]  accidentally all over the world we just give them live polio they didn't put
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.400]  sv-40 in the polio vaccines the cancer virus to play patty cake with you
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.600]  they're not doing and of course these companies are just idiotic and are told
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.280]  hey here's aspartame the patents run out on it's really cheap it's really sweet
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.800]  kids will love it that's why they sign on and do it most of these corporate
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.640]  people don't even know because the government's given it its seal of
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.800]  approval and all these scientists have come out and talked about how horrible
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.680]  this is and and the reason I'm starting this interview for the next hour and a
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.600]  half with dr. Doug Rocky with this information is that it's part and parcel
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:03.680]  to this overall eugenics agenda ignore it at your own risk ignore it at your own
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.800]  peril now I wanted to get dr. Doug Rocky on he was on with this two weeks ago
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.840]  because I want to open the phones up I wanted to recap du what he did what it
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.560]  causes the health problems members of his team dead and dying himself you know
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:21.640]  very sick 20-plus surgeries later what it does and the fact that they're
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:27.920]  massively proliferating the use of it including here in the u.s. 14 time
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.920]  increases in cancers and deformities and fallujah three to four times in major
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:38.180]  medical studies of our troops this is a holocaust a holocaust and I wanted to
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:44.400]  open the phones up for military veterans currently serving or who were in who you
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.840]  know worked with du earlier remember you know back before they allowed it to be
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.680]  used everywhere how it was labeled completely deadly radioactive and
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:55.600]  poisonous how things have changed what it's done to you your friends your
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:01.040]  family you bring back just micro amounts of this in your in your clothes in your
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.920]  luggage it'll devastate your wife devastate your children this is a major
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.320]  health alert I mean I'm here doing what I can do I know I can prove du's
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.000]  completely evil from the army's own reports I know I can prove aspartame is
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.240]  totally doubt deadly this is so mainstream the drudge report links to
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.920]  our articles on it I know I can prove that they sterilize 42% of Native
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.920]  American women in the 70s alone that's declassified Senate hearings I know I
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.080]  can prove they're shooting little children up with live syphilis okay
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.560]  you're not in Kansas anymore I can prove that most mortgages are fraudulent
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:39.920]  and that they're stealing people's houses with 100% paid for homes I can
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.880]  prove and it's admitted that they signed a deal 11 years ago to take the death
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.960]  benefits of 6 million veterans as they die Bloomberg I can prove that the
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:53.200]  carbon taxes that are to shut down our economy and consolidate it and bring
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:59.200]  in feudalism okay we've got to get du off the battlefield we've got to stop
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.880]  using it we've got to get health care of the people that have gone through this
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.240]  so for this segment the next dr. Rocky will have the floor I'll try to shut up
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.000]  which is such a key issue and then we're going to take phone calls for the
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:18.560]  whole next hour from people exposed to du 1-800-259-9231 on this subject only
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:26.040]  1-800-259-9231 then the last 20 minutes or so we're going to have Mr. Iris who
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.240]  had his child stolen newborn baby and they sourced in the affidavit and the
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.520]  full affidavit now posted at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com because
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:38.320]  they're a member of oathkeepers okay this is big national news on drudge
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:41.680]  report as well so we're going to be talking about that with them and
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:45.560]  updates at the end of the hour end of the next hour but dr. Doug Rocky now

[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:36.600]  down thank you very much sir and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I don't
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:40.720]  know where to begin it this has been a nightmare for over 20 years that I've
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.440]  been involved in it continues to be a nightmare there is not a single day that
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:48.920]  does not go by 24 hours a day where I do not get a phone call or an email
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:54.440]  or knock on the door from a sick ill wounded injured veteran or their
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:16:00.320]  family members seeking help much less long trying to get my own help it's
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:04.480]  been an ongoing it's been an ongoing thing I mean when we look at what has
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:10.960]  happened the United States going back you know many many years ago with all the
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.720]  downwinders and the atomic bomb testing everything else and then we had all the
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.440]  Agent Orange from Vietnam then we kept going and we kept going with all the
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:24.480]  immunization mess the project Chad stuff which is again deliberate use of
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.480]  chemical and biological warfare munitions on civilians all over the United
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.040]  States and the military and that continues that we speak and then we get
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:43.280]  to do you desert storm what a wonder how how how do we in our right mind
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:46.800]  justify what we have done to the world of what we've done to our sons and
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.840]  daughters I mean Alex how can we help anybody justify what we've done are you
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:59.000]  there yeah well the cowboys are on that's all it matters you know that's
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.760]  part of the whole thing I think one of the most astonishing things about all
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:07.240]  this is that most individuals truly are more interested in a football game or a
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:12.040]  basketball game or a you know whatever they have a six pack of beer rather than
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.680]  dealing with the health and environmental of consequences military
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.800]  operations or what our industry that's just crashed our world aren't they I
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:24.880]  mean why don't you know I can't understand why people don't see this and
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.920]  they don't feel outraged do you well they're poisoned through the food the
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:34.520]  vaccines the aspartame the fluoride and their childlike they can't believe their
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:41.280]  government would hurt them or do something bad and if they ever face the
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.200]  fact that all of this is real that they're being soft killed along with
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:47.640]  their family they'd have to do something about it but more and more people are
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:51.480]  waking up and getting concerned no they have to I mean you know slowly I'm
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:55.000]  getting more congressional staff that are listening but I still have too many
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.480]  that don't want to do anything and the election coming up ladies and gentlemen
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.680]  this election coming up is critical you know what we're hearing all over on the
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.800]  ad here in Illinois is continuous much slinging he did this or he didn't do this
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.000]  or he wasn't nice or he didn't give me my Cheerios I want to know what they're
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.840]  gonna do to clean up the environment I want to know what they're gonna do to
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.440]  stop the slaughter of our sons and daughters and a slaughter of all the
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:22.600]  other children of the world I want to know what they're gonna do provide
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:27.280]  medical care for all of the military veterans that have earned it because we
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:31.680]  went on these missions that we never really needed to do but we got totally
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:38.520]  trashed I mean that's what needs to happen I don't know it's irritating and
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:42.280]  I know you Alex you must yeah I mean you're doing the radio show day in and
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.920]  day out and you hear people all outreach all over the world trying to do some
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:50.760]  try to make a difference you try to make a difference but the question I have is
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.400]  why aren't isn't it different to be in May why don't we see changes well we're
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:02.000]  seeing an acceleration of evil in a in an attempt to totally overwhelm us and
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:07.840]  make us capitulate we are seeing changes in the foreclosures being halted by
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:11.560]  five major banks including Bank of America the biggest mortgage holder in
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:14.680]  the country because it's come out that most of the mortgages were written up
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:21.160]  fraudulently and so yeah I mean the Empire is falling the dollars imploding
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:26.760]  I think I think I think we are seeing change I mean I'm sure you've seen the
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:30.880]  movie force 10 from Navarone as a parallel and then we'll go to break but
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:35.680]  they go into the dam and they bomb it and they're trying to bomb it to stop the
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:39.520]  German army going into the Balkans and they're sitting there waiting and they
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.760]  look at the bomb expert and they say why hasn't it fallen why isn't the dam
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:48.520]  ruptured he says give it a minute give it a minute and then it starts cracking
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:53.880]  and then it it totally implodes and so the dam now has water shooting out of
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:57.560]  it I mean we see the holes forming the problem is we're gonna get drowned when
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:03.160]  it collapses we'll be right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:07.040]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:10.720]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:14.720]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:19.160]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:23.600]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:28.360]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:32.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:35.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:40.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.280]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:46.920]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:51.720]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:55.960]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:03.400]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 the question is where should the American
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:09.200]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:13.760]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:17.400]  not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:20.760]  think they own our land they think they're on our water children our
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:26.360]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:32.160]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising we have the
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:35.560]  facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we have common law
[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:39.520]  knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:44.200]  you don't tread on me rise the Republic tyranny is upon us but liberty and the
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:47.880]  sleeping giant that is the American people is rising a new tool in the

[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:11.440]  to elaborate on Dr. Doug Rocky former head of DU weapons program for the Army
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.520]  and Army research in DU it does not require a majority to prevail but rather
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:22.760]  an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people's minds that was
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:29.920]  Sam Adams on the original fire starters of Liberty in 1776 doc I want you to get
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:32.920]  into the basics of DU that I want to get into calls next segment but I
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:37.760]  understand you know that you're wounded you're pained by this but but we are
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.080]  seeing big changes and it's good it's going to take time and the enemy is
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:46.600]  going to strike back but this is irreversible what's now happening I can
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:49.600]  tell you studying history and I can feel it in my gut as well and it's never
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.200]  wrong that the battle is joined and tyranny is in a fight for its life with
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.480]  the free spirit of humanity but but please continue getting into DU okay
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.640]  let's talk about depleted uranium specific first off the term depleted is
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:07.120]  a misnomer there's nothing really depleted about it you know uranium
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:11.720]  additions are actually the byproduct of the uranium enrichment process conducted
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:16.040]  by the U.S. Department of Energy for every 100 pounds of pure uranium that
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:23.120]  goes in the enrichment process 99.2 pounds of pure waste okay and that's
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:28.400]  what we call uranium hexafluoride which is in process for uranium additions
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.320]  uranium munitions consist of kinetic energy penetrators or bullets so we
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:39.240]  have the 5.56 millimeter the 7.62 millimeter and the 50 caliber those are
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.560]  rifle bullets are made out of the uranium then we have the 20 millimeter for
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:48.280]  the Navy failings the 25 millimeter for the Army Bradley fighting vehicle in
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:52.920]  the Marine Corps lab etc the 30 millimeter for on the gunships and
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:59.080]  everything in the 810 then we get up to the tank rounds 105 millimeter 125
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:03.840]  millimeter and the primary 120 millimeter now these are all gigantic
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:08.760]  slugs of uranium and what they're actually made up is uranium hexafluoride
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:13.200]  was the primary product went into it but what we end up with is that these
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:22.080]  isotopes uranium 234 uranium 235 which is the uranium 236 uranium 238 which is
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:28.960]  the predominant amount probably 99% of a plutonium, neptunium and americium so we
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:34.200]  have a toxic radiological compound that this stuff is made up of so what we end
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:38.720]  up with is the whole host of uranium additions the kinetic energy penetrators
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:42.680]  which are like bullets or giant rods of uranium think a gigantic dart you know
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:46.640]  if everybody's played dart that's what these look like except that the tank
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.840]  round of 10 pounds of uranium and the 30 millimeter round that's fired by the
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.960]  810 is three quarters of a pound of uranium fired at 4,000 rounds a minute
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:59.600]  that's one and a half tons of uranium on target per minute incredible amount of
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.440]  volume of uranium radioactive materials and then up and beyond that we have the
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:08.400]  eight of the petum now the eight of the petum think about a giant softball the
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:13.160]  other case into the softball is made of uranium to you and it's filled with high
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:18.840]  explosives incredibly effective against all personnel and animals and children
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.200]  everything else totally used by the Israelis and Lebanon totally used by the
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:27.880]  Israelis and Gaza by the US and the Balkans and again Iraq and Afghanistan and
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:33.800]  by the way the prevailing winds out of Gaza blow right into Israel and the
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:38.640]  winds also blow from the north for part of the year right out of Lebanon and I
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.080]  mean it's just it's it's it's the equivalent of a gun that you fire your
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:47.080]  enemy but it fires a soft kill weapon back at you because as you know sir the
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.760]  rounds ignite as they leave the barrel and are shedding massive amounts of this
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.520]  uranium that's absolutely correct see one of things that the people would like
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.920]  everybody to believe that this stuff doesn't do anything until it hits the
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:01.760]  target that's pure nonsense it's shedding immediately and that's what we
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.200]  prove in the blocks of videos and photographs you go back and pull up the
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.960]  stuff that we did for a CBS evening with Dan Rather you can pull up the stuff on
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:14.200]  60 minutes on dateline nine line the BBC the Canadian broadcasting you can see it
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:17.240]  all there you can pull up the videos and actually look at it yourself and find
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:21.880]  out it works you know so what we do know the very earliest work that I know of and
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:24.440]  the work that I use for it the one I was director of the depleted uranium
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:29.120]  project for the US Army I use all the research reports when the United States
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:33.760]  gave Israel the rain munitions to use against the Egyptians during the Arab
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.680]  Israeli war in 1973 and so our 1974 report which confirmed all the health
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:45.320]  and environmental effects was written as a consequence of given Israel the UC
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.840]  radio munitions to use in that era of Israeli war 1973 medical reports I've
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:54.640]  got for the UN troops and the other people that have were on site totally
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.360]  confirmed the medical problems are all there the environmental problems the
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.000]  on-site contamination that exists to this day out there the Sinai is all
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.320]  confirmed so that's where we had the earliest stuff and then again we had an
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:12.160]  inventory but we didn't really start to use it till operate Desert Storm in 1990
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:18.520]  1991 so when we set up Desert Storm in early spring of 1990 to get the US
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:23.080]  military in there to control the oil we did all our baiting and switching to get
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:28.560]  Saddam to give him the approval to go into Kuwait after Kuwait was stealing
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:32.120]  Iraq stay there long segment coming up we're gonna have you finish up on the
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:37.320]  basics of DU then we're going to phone calls from victims of DU and so they

[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:45.440]  don't know how much do you want all you can get I'm Alex Jones I want all of you
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:52.640]  good guys to live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on
[02:32:52.640 --> 02:33:09.640]  the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633 leading a frontal
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:16.400]  assault on the lives of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:23.320]  network we're going back to dr. Doug Rocky dr. du the former head of the
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:28.320]  army's program I think we get a better informed expert on this though he sent
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:31.040]  me these big stacks I want to go through before we go to your calls here in a
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:40.080]  moment Department of Army technical bulletin TB 9-1300-278 suppressed
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:46.800]  copy dated 28 September 1990 so we'll talk about how these went public and we'll
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:51.480]  get into all of this but before we go any further there's other secret
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:54.560]  atmospheric testing and weather manipulation that's now been partially
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:59.520]  declassified and it deals with chemtrails not condensation trails but
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:03.280]  planes engaging in weather modification with a barium salts and
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.800]  limited dioxide also very toxic nothing compared to DU but overall very bad in
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:11.600]  the aggregate as it bio accumulates and the video is going to be shipping out
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:15.540]  October 22nd you can get it discounted with my other films as well if you'd

[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.240]  Dr. Rocky you got cut off getting into the Gulf War and we'll get into these
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:55.560]  documents and then straight to the phone calls the toll free number to join us
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:35:04.680]  or you get to Danny, Dante, Noah and others 1-800-259-9231 for folks that
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:08.680]  have been affected themselves with their family members by DU veterans that
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:13.400]  were in Fallujah having problems or anywhere else in Iraq folks from Iraq
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.680]  who are people who have family there that have seen 14 times increases in
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:23.880]  cancers and birth defects 1-800-259-9231 Dr. Doug Rocky please continue. Well
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:27.720]  what we have then is uranium emissions of all types we have the bunker busters and
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:31.320]  all this stuff when these things are used they create over extremely fine
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:37.680]  uranium dust which is radiologically and chemically toxic and now that creates
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:41.280]  air, water, soil and food contamination the Army's own documents state very
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:45.600]  clearly after this is used it causes food and water contamination makes food
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.200]  water unusable for eternity so we have all of that so now what we're having is
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:55.480]  cross-contamination by ingestion that's through food eating and drinking we have
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:59.320]  inhalation through breathing we have absorption through the skin and it goes
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:03.320]  right through the skin just moves right in and then obviously we have wound
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  contamination through open wounds of the dust get in there and the shrapnel so we
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.960]  have all of this stuff so we have all the direct medical effects now the US Army
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:17.680]  orders direct orders require immediate radio bioassays now the Somalia order
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:24.080]  which is from October 1993 Colonel Peter Myers Dr. Peter Myers wrote it as we
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:28.560]  were getting ready to use uranium and Somalia and Africa in 93 and again
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.720]  required a radio bioassay within 24 to 72 hours of exposure not days week months
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:40.960]  or years later within 24 to 72 hours and the reason for that is what we do know
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:45.960]  and we wrote the medical directives is that if you wait until after 30 days
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.440]  post exposure in other words if you say you know today whatever today is we
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:55.560]  waited 30 days to start the radio bioassay the radio bioassay won't detect
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:58.600]  what your body actually got hit with because what's mobile now in the year
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:03.920]  and it's less than 1-1,000 of what actually was in the body so in other
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:06.920]  words they delay the testing and therefore there's nothing there to be
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.080]  found and therefore there was no exposure this was a deliberate decision to
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.960]  deliberate act that was made many times and then Dr. Rodsker and Dr. Michael
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.800]  Kilpatrick formalized it along with Colonel Bob Cherry, Colonel Eric Dixon,
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:24.600]  Colonel Mark Melanson from the US military so we have all of these
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.640]  problems come along no two ways about it absolutely identified there's probably
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.880]  been a dozen medical orders and the other thing we need to know is when we
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:37.320]  require the medical care and medical orders for our own military by Geneva
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:41.080]  Convention under God we have to provide the same medical care to everybody we
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:46.560]  expose which is millions upon billions of people so the orders are there to do
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.120]  it now the most recent orders were written by General Peake who was the
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:54.720]  previous secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and General
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:58.840]  Erich and Secchi who is the current director of the U.S. Secretary of the
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:02.320]  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs so the two past secretaries of the U.S.
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.120]  Department of Veterans Affairs and the last president are the officers that
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:09.400]  wrote the orders and they need medical care immediate medical care for D.E.
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:14.720]  exposures and it doesn't happen and to me that's unconscionable and my
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.440]  continuous phone call to them meet with silence well doctor we see this
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.640]  shallow fake patriotism of salute the flag at a baseball game or football game
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:30.440]  cry when you see the troops on TV but then take their benefits make them pay
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:34.480]  for their own health care let them die a DU shoot them up full of experimental
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:41.800]  vaccines I mean it's amazing that that this is still ongoing and that they know
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:44.880]  what this is doing and they're engaged in a cover-up and when the troops come in
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:48.960]  I know you've seen this a hundred or thousand times yourself I'd like you to
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.160]  speak to it when they come in wanting medical treatment they're told you're
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:56.040]  just mentally ill here take some prozac that's exactly correct they give them
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:59.520]  the prozac and the psychotropic drugs and they ignore the medical problems
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.640]  even though they know exactly what the medical problems are and then then what
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:07.360]  next and we know we've got the suicides and we got the family destruction and
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.280]  we've got all the crime rates and everything else and I'm tired of
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:14.920]  dealing with it now once you use uranium munitions the Army Regulations 700
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:19.920]  dash 48 section 2 dash 4 is very very specific what must be done now this
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:23.720]  Army Regulation I wrote but General Eric Secki who is now Secretary of the
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:27.640]  U.S. Department of Veterans signed off on that on it as a commanding general make
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:32.760]  it a mandatory so what we do know must be done wherever uranium munitions are
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:38.800]  used quote as soon as exceptional risk permits the core joint task force
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:43.200]  division commander radio safe radio and safe officer will identify
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:47.520]  segregate isolate secure and label all radiologic contaminated equipment
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:51.600]  procedures to minimize the spread of radioactivity will be implemented as
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:57.200]  soon as possible that's every place okay we have to bring
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:01.360]  explosives ordinance disposal use the explosive experts in there and during
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.040]  desert storm you know what you guys wouldn't go near it I finally got three
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.280]  guys trained up for it and they got killed at Camp Doha and still got their
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:14.080]  medals and you know their certificate for medals in my briefcase you know they
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.040]  were given posthumously but that do a lot of good the explosive ordinance
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:21.200]  disposal you don't surrender all the equipment safe because when this is used
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:26.920]  we have incredible incredible not only radiological and chemical toxicities we
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:32.360]  have all the explosives hazards so that has to be done we continue what I and
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.360]  this is comes down to everything else the unit this is all direct quote from the
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.280]  Army Regulation that posted on your website people can read it and
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:43.160]  everybody the military needs to read this and understand it every mother father
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:47.760]  son sister daughter brother child if anybody the military old enough to read
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.680]  needs to understand this quote the unit team individual responsible for
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.080]  equipment rather friendly or foreign at that time or damage timides responsible
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.800]  taking all action consistent with this regulation and the army pamphlet 700
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.240]  dash 48 that I also wrote that state down and dirty procedures that's the cook
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:09.740]  book of what you do quote all equipment to include capture to combat
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:13.120]  radiological contaminated equipment which surveyed packaged replicated and
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:17.400]  decontaminated and then released in accordance with the technical bulletin
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:23.560]  that you cited a moment ago 139-1300 278 the pamphlet 700 dash 48 all the other
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:28.280]  relevant guidance that we put together safety precautions are incredible I
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.520]  mean they're very outlawed you do have a picture you can post on your website I
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.520]  think Jared's already done that shows you the minimum equipment to use work
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.920]  around the stuff and everything else when we start getting down to the
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:45.320]  environmental hazards both radioactive material and waste will not be locally
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:50.920]  disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction of place or
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:58.440]  abandonment and both we left that we contaminated not only Iraq Saudi Arabia
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:05.280]  Kuwait the Balkans Somalia Afghanistan but be at this Hawaii
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:17.200]  Indiana Florida Nevada California Washington State and the thing that
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:21.500]  bothers me the most and I think you know you've done history and everything and I
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:25.520]  think everybody remembers this on the eighth of April 8 early early a man has
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:29.000]  left the live that doesn't remember what all reviews right yes
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.400]  Concord, Massachusetts where our nation was born is one of the most highly
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:36.800]  depleted reigning contaminated cities of the world because the star of the planet
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:41.600]  is a national environmental disaster where the military is trying to clean it
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:44.240]  up Albany, New York is also the same thing
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:49.280]  Johnsboro, Tennessee is the same thing I mean these are totally contaminated
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:53.560]  areas because you're any medicines with incredible medical problems and we see
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:56.280]  the same thing in Hawaii a school field barracks and out there in Hawaii
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:59.440]  pristine environment where the US military did nuclear weapons testing
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:03.400]  but David Crockett and dehumidification totally illegal and left the
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.800]  contamination and now as we speak I mean as we speak right now I got emails a few
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.280]  minutes ago before we came on it's a mess and they're refusing to take care of it
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:16.760]  all right we're gonna get more into this I want to go to calls you've got a lot
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:21.560]  more to cover Dr. Doug Rocky but we're gonna talk to DU victims former
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:26.360]  military and others Danny Dante Noah Jason and others specifically for
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:29.840]  military veterans who've been affected by this you can actually hear what's
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:34.000]  happening to humanity and then ask yourself what type of government
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:42.720]  injects children with syphilis and smallpox and polio what type of government
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:46.600]  sprays nerve gas on our troops and projects shad and tells their wives they
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:52.200]  died of the flu psychopathic killers practicing evil like a doctor practices
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:56.200]  medicine what's government run health care about the death panels Bill Gates
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:00.480]  now admits it Newsweek cover the case for killing granny wise poison and all
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.880]  the major children's gums now aspartame even in the sugar gum you're being
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:09.360]  attacked folks they know what they're doing Dr. Doug right he's got a lot more
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:12.640]  to cover but let's start getting your calls now Danny in Arkansas you're on
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:18.040]  the air hey yeah you're I can barely hear you can you speak right into the
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.240]  phone okay while he figures out his phone system we're gonna put Danny on
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:25.760]  hold we're gonna come back to him I could tell he doesn't have his hands
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:29.400]  free plug-in or whatever I can barely hear him Dante in Jersey you're on the
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:31.520]  air
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.320]  okay what's going on is I'm not being sent the network audio okay I am not
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:46.280]  receiving audio so so clearly Dr. Rocky can you hear them no I can okay we may
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:49.480]  have to get their numbers and transform to our phone system Genesis is having an
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:55.960]  issue okay well I can do the show but there's no there's no audio from these
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:01.080]  people on my end okay I'll guarantee you that Dr. Rocky while we continue to
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:04.920]  figure this out continue where you left off about the contamination all over the
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:09.040]  country and Danny Dante Noah Jason and others we're gonna get to you if we have
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:13.080]  to give you our phone number here at the office go ahead okay so what we've got
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.840]  is use uranium emissions and testing and manufacturing everything else and we
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:21.840]  have to use uranium emissions to combat operations which has left wholesale
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:26.840]  contamination throughout now when we use uranium emissions again either armor or
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.240]  any vehicles we shoot it up it just totally destroys it totally contaminates
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:36.520]  it the army regulations again 700-48 and the army common task train require
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:40.640]  require that you wear full protective equipment when you go near it that's a
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:44.360]  gas mask with the HEPA filter which is not going to do a whole lot of good and
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:48.160]  then protective clothing special clothing so you don't get it out of your
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:52.640]  clothes so you got all that contamination everything that's crossed over one thing
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.080]  that we verified and I've did this as a director is depleted uranium project for
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:01.160]  the US Army years after we came back from combat operations I go to different
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.960]  army installations or facilities and I'd absolutely find the contamination there
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:09.040]  it doesn't disappear it doesn't go away you know one of the things that we came
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:13.640]  up recently you know again another major line is that all this oil that spilled
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:18.000]  out of this rupture oil well down the gulf somehow disappeared magically it
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.960]  disappeared that's pure nonsense it was dispersed or it settled out but it's
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:27.040]  still all there and it's causing a medical disaster and it will cause a
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:32.280]  medical disaster and that's what we have with depleted uranium so we have all
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:36.920]  of that when we continue on with all this stuff the internal briefings and
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:42.800]  again I think that you've been able to post this Awakeyama briefing and J. Edgar
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:46.440]  what Colonel J. Edgar Awakeyama did a briefing for the Pentagon and senior
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:51.520]  leadership prior to start of the current individuals you know operation
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:56.560]  deserts you know deserts form led into what we know Gulf War two they totally
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:01.280]  confirmed all the health problems totally confirmed it but at the same time
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:06.160]  going back to 1991 and you've got this where you can post I had the Los
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.080]  Olivos memorandum which was a direct order to lie on all health lie and all
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:14.600]  our reports to maintain proponents in you know sustain the use of uranium
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.120]  emissions while a lot while avoiding all liability for the health and
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:22.560]  environmental effects I mean it's I mean when Alex when you think about it the
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:27.440]  direct order to lie but that matches what we found now about the Tuskegee
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:32.120]  is as simple as Tuskegee study and what has been what just the last week we
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:37.320]  found out about the definite stuff down at Guatemala it just shows how
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:41.000]  incredibly ruthless they are this is not by accident from all the evidence we
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.680]  have this is a program of eugenics and population reduction yeah I mean you
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.760]  know one of things that I learned in the military for 40 years that I had to come
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:54.360]  to grips with it is what I really learned what we do and how we deal with it
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:59.640]  what decisions do I have to make and I can come up to the ethical and moral
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:04.720]  domain you know we have to do what's right we can't allow the uses of stuff
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:08.080]  anymore we have to clean up the environment we have to provide the
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:12.400]  medical care and so what I wrote the requirements for the US military and we
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.000]  did the research for them and wrote the requirements they have to understand the
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.400]  Army Regulation Seminar dash 48 the pamphlet the modification to tease the
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:26.360]  1990 version of TV 1913 hundred 278 1996 version we did that all based on
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:31.440]  solid knowledge and so what you'll see today and I had the inquire earlier
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.680]  today from Europe and they were saying well they're still saying we need more
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:38.640]  research we don't know wait a minute the Army Regulation requiring thorough
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:44.720]  environmental remediation in medical care the orders from medical care have
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:48.720]  already been written that's because the decision was made this stuff is so
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:53.400]  nasty we can't use it and once we do use it we have to provide the medical care
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:57.720]  and up but they just totally ignore it so we look at all of these incredible
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:03.680]  incredible things air water soil and food contamination water contamination in
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:07.520]  Europe now one of the concerns we have is the contamination from the Middle East
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:11.880]  is getting up in Europe is going to affect the milk the water supplies it's
[02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:14.440]  going to get in the food stream to get right in the whole food stream we
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.520]  absolutely know the contamination has reached from the Middle East that's a
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:23.440]  rack wage Saudi Arabia we actually know it's reached Northern Europe and in the
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:27.840]  Great Britain we know the contamination throughout the United States has
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:31.440]  transferred all over we know the contamination from the ECS Puerto Rico
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:34.720]  reach the main island of Puerto Rico that's right they've got radiation
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:38.080]  testing facilities all over the world and every time a new war kicks up the
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:41.400]  testing facilities in England and others pick it up that far away because the
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:45.280]  jet streams carry that stuff around and around the world yeah when I was down in
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:48.360]  Vieca's we're doing the investigation on vehicles Puerto Rico this some years
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:52.520]  ago obviously you know they they were concerned and they asked me to come down
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:55.840]  there and I start working with them and God bless those guys down at beacus I
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.840]  mean Bob ribbon Nilda Matino I mean all these are incredible people that have
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:03.680]  been trying to do their work we were literally airborne and the military is
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:06.960]  firing this stuff on the range on beacus and we're watching the clouds come up
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.640]  from the range where they're firing it going over to the main island of Puerto Rico
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:16.840]  we just literally watch it from the air it's right to be completely well we have
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:22.200]  opened up our phone lines because of audio issues or whatever it is so we're

[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:36.800]  oppressive world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:40.280]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system global
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:44.440]  governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling

[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.360]  I apologize to the callers let's go to Danny and Arkansas the first caller we
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:24.560]  couldn't really hear Danny welcome sir thanks Alex can you hear me yes I can
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:29.680]  hear you go ahead all right I have a question for Dr. Rocky I was I went to
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:33.560]  basic training and AIT at Fort Leonardwood up in Missouri and where we
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:37.160]  used to always do our road marches everything was right next to this big
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.880]  field where we would sit there and watch the 810 Warthogs come in blow up the
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:48.360]  tanks and we were walking right next to it and then after I got out of the army
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:56.080]  in about 97 right after that I was diagnosed with sarcoidosis diagnosed
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:01.120]  with what would that be related to the depleted uranium what was the diagnosis
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:11.080]  it was non-facinating granulomers and they called it sarcoidosis it was it
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:16.320]  would swell up my lymph tissue around my lungs and made or I couldn't breathe
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:21.840]  basically they never could nobody could ever tell me what it was I thought it
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:25.720]  was the chemtrails but you were on before and you said that they have
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:30.560]  respiratory illnesses and I wonder if that could have been every one of those
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:37.160]  you know how much to each one of those Warthog bullets why sir three quarters
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:41.960]  of a pound and 4,000 rounds per minute when they're fired with the you the
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:45.320]  calcified granulomas and everything in lunch is exactly what's happened to me
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.200]  but they cannot 40% of my respiratory again that was totally confirmed that
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:55.720]  totally acknowledged as far back 1973 and 1974 after the Israelis is that
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:59.400]  against the Egyptians that's where I use that medical evidence to get my
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:02.920]  disability from the beat and so that's a death sentence to have a march around a
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:07.040]  proving ground while warthogs with their Vulcan cannons blow the daylights out of
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:11.640]  old tanks with you absolutely I mean you're not supposed to stop first off
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:14.920]  do you was not supposed to be fired was never supposed to be fired any place
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:19.800]  within the United States or any any place except on a direct combat engagement
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.240]  in the combat action it's not supposed to be used in place that's a requirement
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.000]  but that's totally ignored and then the requirements I mean we've already gone
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.960]  over very specific requirements once it's been used in combat wherever you're
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.920]  at you're supposed to get the immediate medical care is there anything Danny can
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:41.920]  do for this attack on his lungs well yeah he just he goes back to the US
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:46.640]  Department of Interpreters and Dr. Victoria Casano who is the director
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.160]  environmental service for the B.A. she has copies of all the orders regulation
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:53.720]  she understands that because I fast everything directly to her staff I've
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.240]  talked to her personally and they're required to give him medical care for
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:01.280]  medical medical care the respiratory effect from D we're confirmed to
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:05.040]  confirm that walkie I'm a briefing to confirm that everything else and we're
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:09.200]  posting all those documents at info wars.com does that answer your question
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:13.960]  Danny that does that that gives me somewhere to start I've always wondered
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:18.400]  what it was where it came from and now I know where to start nobody else would
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:22.520]  ever have any information God bless you sir let's talk to Jason in
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:28.040]  Deutschland joining us from Germany Jason go ahead how you doing I was here
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:32.720]  man good yes sir go ahead yeah just like a little background first I wasn't a
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  mechanized infantry battalion in a desert storm and we were involved in
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:42.800]  combat and we used quite a bit of the DU rounds and we used them out of the
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.040]  Bradley guns because you know they were so so effective he found that out very
[02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:52.120]  quick and I'm coming up now on the 20th anniversary of it though we're trying to
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.560]  arrange a get-together and through various social networking sites and what
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:59.360]  have you we're we're trying to get in contact with everybody who's in the
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:03.680]  Union what we're finding out is about 20 25 30% of the the guys are already dead
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:09.760]  and they died they've died of upper respiratory lung digestive problems
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:14.560]  cancers and what have you and you know I don't think you could take any
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:20.040]  population of the guys who were 18 to 23 years old back in 1991 and find out
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.000]  that many have died of similar diseases you're not supposed to have 20 30% dead
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.380]  at 40 stay there I'm gonna come right back to Jason in Germany with Dr. Doug
[02:58:28.380 --> 02:58:33.080]  Rocky as we start the live fourth hour transmitted on AM and FM global short

[02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:05.920]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.440]  most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:15.440]  existence of a secret network of FEMA cams now being expanded nationwide. This

[02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:07.480]  Network. Network.
[03:00:07.480 --> 03:00:11.040]  We're doing a test today. We're live into the fourth hour.

[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:28.040]  infowars.com if you want to see what goes on at prismplanet.tv. We're testing it
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:32.360]  for the 24-hour-plus live broadcast coming up Thursday. We're going to attempt if
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:36.840]  our servers can handle it to broadcast the entire 24-plus-hour transmission at
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:43.640]  prismplanet.tv. Now, going back to Dr. Doug Rocky, hearing Jason in Germany who
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:48.600]  were going back to in a moment where he said over 20% of his unit and they were
[03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:53.080]  20-something years old and they were there just 20 years ago or 19 years
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:57.720]  ago are dead and that's the numbers you've gotten from the VA. That's very
[03:00:57.720 --> 03:01:03.080]  similar. So this is what the globalists think of the troops that serve and
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.840]  don't forget in all tyrannies they hate their military and police the most and
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:11.200]  they want to decommission you. So they love the fact that you're using soft
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:15.080]  kill weapons so after you get out and are older and become wiser but have
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:18.960]  combat experience you're so debilitated you can't resist their takeover. Dr.
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:23.240]  Rocky, what's it like hearing this from Jason? Well, he just confirmed again what
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:26.160]  we already know. The United States Department of Veteran Affairs publishes
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:30.280]  the Gulf War Veterans Information System report. Now, they quit publishing them
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:36.240]  back in 2008. In 2008, the number of Desert Storm in 2008, that's two years
[03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:43.080]  ago, over two and a half years ago that have died, was at 78,559. That's over
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:46.400]  two years ago. Now, the numbers are continuously going up. If you watch the
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:50.720]  ArmyTimes.com website or any other military, you realize these kids are
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:57.560]  dropping dead on a daily basis. When we looked at the total number, we had 78,000
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:02.360]  from Operation Desert Storm. Now, we're going to go back again two years ago, two
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:09.280]  years ago to be a report, 1,129,340 individuals had gone over to Iraqi
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:14.400]  Freedom and Endurant Freedom. As of February 2008, that's two years ago, the
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:22.640]  number that had died, but the people that went into the Gulf with Desert
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:27.800]  Storm 2, or you know, we call it Gulf War 2, Iraqi Freedom 9, er, Iraq
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:38.040]  Freedom and Endurant Freedom, is 170,408 had died. 170,000. Now, we know those
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:41.880]  numbers have gone way up. We know that the medical reports from the US
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:44.720]  Department of Veterinary Affairs for Operation Desert Storm will have over
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:50.880]  300,000. That's over 40%. Now, we have serious medical problems. We know from
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:57.240]  Iraqi Freedom and Endurant Freedom that we're looking at close to 50% have also
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:01.120]  very serious medical problems. These are not related to bullets or bombs. These
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:04.760]  are all the target exporters, primarily uranium emissions. And doctor, I know you
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:09.200]  could go forever on this. I want to get a comment back from Jason in Germany.
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:12.760]  Recap what you were saying and talk about what this discovery is like for you.
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:17.600]  Well, I mean, throughout the last two decades, I've heard, you know, for the
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:22.360]  various contacts of guys who've had other problems with rashes and, you know,
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:26.720]  persistent diarrhea. And we're talking like, you know, years-long diarrhea. And,
[03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:32.000]  you know, you kind of blew it off, I guess, because, you know, a lot younger. But
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.360]  now when you're confronted with these numbers face on when you're trying to
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.160]  organize a reunion, it's pretty, pretty shocking. Yeah, when you're 18 or 20,
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:44.640]  when you're 18 or 20 or 22 and you think you're bulletproof, and most young
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:49.040]  young men think that, you know, they love using you. They knew full well what they
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:54.000]  were doing. Go ahead. Yeah, I mean, I mean, we use this stuff extensively. I
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.600]  read it at the beginning. I mean, we fired off. I don't even remember. I mean,
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:00.920]  thousands of these rounds. I mean, they were so effective. And I mean, you had that
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:04.480]  choice or HG rounds and everybody knew which ones, you know, destroyed the
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.600]  Iraqi tanks. So, you know, we used it. And, you know, you got out, you would dismount
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:11.640]  the Bradleys and you would clear an area after the fact. And, you know, you weren't
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:15.240]  even thinking about, you know, what you might be breathing in back then. And now
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:19.320]  you find out that, you know, all your friends are dead. And it's very, very
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:22.760]  shocking and very discouraging that it's denied by the U.S. government or at least
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:26.800]  ignored. The same. I'm here with the same numbers out of the same 82nd Airborne. My
[03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:31.560]  own cousin was a combat medic in the 82nd Airborne. And again, they're also trying
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:35.000]  to put together just like you said, a reunion. And he's coming up with 15 to
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:39.600]  20% of his units all day. That's good. That's what we're running into. It's
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:44.880]  disgusting. Jason, Jason, um, I want to let you finish up on the other side
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:50.760]  briefly with what this makes you think about this government and who's running
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:54.320]  this and you're warning to other military and police that serve the New
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:56.920]  World Order satanic world government system. And there's no other way to
[03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:59.920]  describe it. This isn't the devil. I don't know what is. We'll be back with more

[03:08:48.520 --> 03:08:52.960]  joined us, I'm gonna try to hurry through these calls now. Noah, Bullseye, Angela,
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:59.720]  Joe and others. If you're a veteran affected by DU 888-201-2244, it's one
[03:08:59.720 --> 03:09:06.520]  thing to have the former head of the Army's DU program on. A physicist, scientist,
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:10.580]  expert, one of the top in the world, or all the government's own Pentagon
[03:09:10.580 --> 03:09:13.920]  documents admitting how deadly it is. But it's another thing to actually hear him
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:17.560]  call in and say exactly what Doug Rocky said two years ago here and a month ago
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:22.160]  here. That it's the cancers in the lungs, the respiratory problems, the
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:26.960]  urinary tract where it precipitates out and bioaccumulates, the kidney failure.
[03:09:26.960 --> 03:09:33.200]  And I was asking Jason, we're gonna go to other callers, what is it like to know
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:38.160]  that they knew specifically and that they're just giving you a sentence of
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:41.880]  death? What does that say about the people running this thing? Of course
[03:09:41.880 --> 03:09:44.120]  they're gonna take your mortgage even though you've paid it off and steal
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:48.320]  your house. Of course they're gonna take six million dying veterans death
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:52.040]  benefits from their families. Bloomberg, reporting on it. Of course
[03:09:52.040 --> 03:09:56.640]  they're gonna inject Guatemalan children with syphilis. What is the back of my
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:00.440]  film in-game blueprint for global enslavement say? They want you dead, okay?
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:05.840]  They say it. They're doing it. I'm sorry this is scary. I'm sorry it's hard to
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:10.880]  believe. I'm sorry it's a nightmare. But it's real and you can't choose reality.
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:13.640]  You can't say well I choose not to believe that. It's like Glenn Beck's going
[03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:18.080]  blind. He admits he guzzles Diet Coke. The government even admits it makes
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:22.000]  people go blind. And then his show today, the film host, was reportedly making fun
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:26.040]  of us as we're trying to lovingly warn him and others that they just like, I
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:30.960]  want to die. I want to breathe DU. I want to form babies. You know, I want all
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:37.720]  this. I want to be cursed. I'm a giggling yuppie. It's not funny. Over 20% of their
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:43.920]  unit who are like 40 years old now from Desert Storm 191 dead. Jason, finish up
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:49.200]  your point. What's your view on this? Yeah, I'm totally with you there, Alex. I mean,
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:53.520]  they chip away at the stone and before you know it a huge chunk is missing and
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:57.600]  it's there for everyone to see. I mean, you know, I took an oath to protect,
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:01.840]  to protect the Constitution United States and it's shocking. You take year
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:04.880]  in denial for a while. At some point you got accepted for reality and what's
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:08.320]  going on. And I mean, most of the guys are pretty much on the same sheet of
[03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:11.800]  music now. I mean, if it doesn't, if it didn't, they weren't going that way
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:15.760]  before. I mean, this type of data, raw data in front of their face. And now we
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:20.480]  know why for five years they'd been quietly more than that. But for five,
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:25.400]  setting up all of Homeland Security to fight veterans that are going to quote
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:29.360]  bomb police stations because they're going to stage terror attacks and
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:32.320]  blaming on vets, but they're also going to be mad vets. They're going to come
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:35.040]  after the government. But why would they go after police departments? They're
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:38.720]  trying to get the police organized against veterans now. As all these
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:42.000]  internal Homeland Security reports that we've gotten from law enforcement show,
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:45.720]  you are the enemy. Doesn't that make perfect sense? Dr. Doug Rocky, your
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:50.600]  comments on that. I didn't want to go there. I have to understand. I've been
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:52.840]  trained and involved with law enforcement my entire life. And they're my
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:57.800]  brothers and my sisters. They're being wasted too because the training they've
[03:11:57.800 --> 03:12:00.600]  been given is ineffective. The equipment they've been given is
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:04.480]  ineffective. And all you have to do is look at the confirmation. My buddies, my
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:09.760]  brothers, my friends, my students, that one of the World Trade Center at 9-1-1
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:12.280]  for the New York Police Department, the New York Fire Department are sick and
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:15.400]  dead. And they're dying and they're fighting for medical care. And I mean,
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:19.160]  the stories in the news media again this last week is, well, this is what we're
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:25.440]  offering you guys. Take it or leave it. My God. Incredible. But we understand why
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:27.960]  the government's trying to gear up against vets because they know the vets
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:32.480]  are waking up. What's the attitude of the former soldiers that you
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:37.040]  valiantly fought with, Jason? Are they getting angry? Yeah, of course they are.
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:39.880]  I mean, you're talking, these are infantry guys. I mean, they're a pretty
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:43.600]  patriotic bunch to begin with. You know, we all joined for our own
[03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:46.640]  reasons in college, whatever, but there's a speak of patriotism in every
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:50.160]  single one of them. And you know, some guys, it's more than others. And some of
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:53.360]  them hold on to it a little bit longer. But there's the frustrations there. And
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:57.120]  the ear is there now too. I mean, everybody's listening and everybody's
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:01.200]  beginning to give credit to arguments like yours. And you're gaining ground, man.
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:04.760]  And it's a great job that you're doing in the doctor as well. Well, we've got to,
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:09.560]  God bless you, Jason. We've got to gain ground. You think my children are safe in
[03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:13.160]  a country, in a world run by people that would march their own troops into
[03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:17.120]  the clouds of DU knowing it's a death sentence? You think any of us are safe?
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:21.400]  This is just the stuff we know about. What else is going on? We've, I mean,
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:26.400]  look, I don't deserve thank yous, okay? I want to be clear about this. I'm trying
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:31.320]  to survive. When I see an evil threat that's diabolical, I resist it because
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:37.240]  the best defense is a strong offense. We've got to get DU removed from the
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:43.720]  battlefield and treatment for the veterans. Doug Rocky. That's it. Summed it up
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:48.120]  completely. I mean, we got some more vets on the phone. Yes, sir. Let's take them.
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:51.160]  Noah in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:56.280]  I'll call. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Go ahead. I just want to bring everyone's
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:14:00.080]  attention to just two things. First of all, I'm an ex-Marine. I served in
[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:07.000]  artillery from 1996 to 1998. And I have an 11 year old autistic daughter. And I
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:12.920]  want everyone to Google this news article. Military parents battle the system to
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:17.760]  help autistic children. Because at the end of the second paragraph, it says,
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:23.200]  according to Defense Department data, the military has doubled the rate of
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:26.640]  autism in the civilian world.
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:32.240]  Dr. Rocky, we know what's happening to children. It's all there. I mean, when we
[03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:35.560]  look at the Department of Interpreters Acknowledgement, again, Bruce says very
[03:14:35.560 --> 03:14:39.760]  quote, birth defects in the children whose parents were exposed. So we're seeing
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:43.880]  all these toxic exposures affecting the neuro, affecting all the RNA, DNA, and
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:47.800]  we're seeing all the birth defects, not only US military children, but the
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:51.440]  children around the world were expected. That's a given. It's an absolute
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:57.200]  given. And what we have learned also is when military personnel start yelling
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:00.680]  and screaming about their children, if they yell and scream too loud, man,
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:07.800]  they're dumped so fast, make your head spin. Anything else? Yes, sir. I wanted
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:13.760]  to make one other point on November 17th. George W. Bush is going to be giving
[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:17.520]  a speech at the University of North Texas. And I hope a lot of people show up
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:18.800]  and protest with me there.
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:27.000]  God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. Boy, it's hard to take these
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:30.560]  calls, but it's important to put this out that there's everybody really
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:35.520]  understands just how serious the situation is. Who's been holding the
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:37.240]  longest after Noah, guys?
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:42.880]  Joe in California, another veteran. Joe, you're on the air with Dr. Doug
[03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:49.440]  Rocky. Yes, I was a combat veteran in Desert Storm. The first one.
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:52.440]  Hello? Yes.
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:58.200]  Yeah, and this is very important. You need to ask these veterans, were they
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:05.600]  field vaccinated? Oh, yeah. Wow. I mean, all my unit, they were field
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:09.080]  vaccinated. We were forced to shoot ourselves right through the uniform.
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:12.440]  We'd break the needle, shoot yourself through the uniform with a field
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:18.280]  vaccination. All my unit got sick. All their kids, the kids that were born
[03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:24.240]  afterwards are messed up. I did not get the vaccination. And my kid is
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:24.760]  normal.
[03:16:25.920 --> 03:16:29.240]  This is this is completely the US Department of Veteran Affairs and
[03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:35.480]  the report issued by Jim Benz. This is November two years ago. Again,
[03:16:35.480 --> 03:16:38.240]  totally confirmed all the health picture of the immunizations. This is
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:42.400]  well, no, the immunizations were attacking that not only from the
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:48.400]  cancer. Here's another point. I used depleted uranium. And, you know, I was
[03:16:48.400 --> 03:16:54.160]  very careful. I was not trying to target kids or civilians, right? But now I
[03:16:54.160 --> 03:16:59.600]  read a report after I get back that the kids and the women are going and
[03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:05.200]  picking up the radioactive shrapnel and getting poisoned by it. It's still
[03:17:05.200 --> 03:17:08.720]  there. Totally contaminated air, water and soil and all the children. We get
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:12.920]  down in Fallujah, we get down in Basra, the medical reports coming out of
[03:17:12.920 --> 03:17:15.280]  Basra. Not only for the US military there during Desert Storm, but the
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:18.520]  military they're coming out there currently in the civilians. It's a
[03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:21.800]  medical disaster. And I've talked to the physicians there and actually
[03:17:21.800 --> 03:17:25.960]  spoke at World Conferences, United Nations and all over Europe with
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:31.040]  positions out of Basra. You're right. It's a complete total disaster. And
[03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:33.920]  just because you didn't target it doesn't mean it because once it's
[03:17:33.920 --> 03:17:37.920]  there, it's there until it's removed. It stays there forever and you can't
[03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:41.040]  really clean it up. That's what I found out when I wrote Army Regulations
[03:17:41.080 --> 03:17:45.040]  at 700-48. That's why I told them they can't use it anymore. And that was
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:47.160]  the end of my life as far as the military is concerned.
[03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:50.560]  Well said.
[03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:59.080]  I appreciate being able to have my voice heard after 20 years of coming
[03:17:59.080 --> 03:18:03.080]  back from Iraq and finding out, you know, I did it for oil. I did it for
[03:18:03.080 --> 03:18:09.760]  big oil. Well, you also did it for world government and they hate our
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:12.800]  veterans because they know you're good men and women. That's why they soft
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:16.520]  kill you. But hopefully we can get this out to the young people and they
[03:18:16.520 --> 03:18:20.960]  won't join so they can be basically experimented on and slow killed. Thank
[03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:24.280]  you so much, Joe. Bullseye in Texas. Another veteran here on the air with
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:30.520]  Dr. Doug Rocky. Yeah, how are you doing, Alex? Good. Glad to be speaking with
[03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:34.600]  you. I was in Northern Iraq through Turkey in operation to provide
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:39.080]  comfort. I was in an Apache helicopter unit. We got there about a week
[03:18:39.080 --> 03:18:44.920]  after the American Marines ran the Iraqis out. We moved directly into
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:49.920]  the buildings that the Marines, you know, bombed and shot up chasing the
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:55.040]  Iraqi army out and we lived in those buildings for six months. Did anybody
[03:18:55.040 --> 03:19:01.840]  warn you, sir, about how deadly that was? No, no. Absolutely not. We didn't
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:07.000]  hear anything about it. About 30 days after I arrived there, I developed a nice
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:15.440]  wonderful case of diarrhea. I still got that today. I still carry that today.
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:18.560]  You'll have that for the rest of your life. I mean, what's happening? Again, the
[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:21.920]  Department of Veterans Affairs for Estates were specifically in the
[03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:26.160]  clinicians' guide for DU that the Explosive Diary is one of the exact
[03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:33.240]  medical problems from the exposures. I'm not surprised. They've got me at 100%
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:40.720]  disability now. I'd like to jump forward 10 years to 2001, where I got a letter
[03:19:40.720 --> 03:19:45.160]  in the mail from the VA. This is kind of, okay, they wanted me to come in for a
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:51.200]  PTSD screening. I never showed any signs or anything, but they were
[03:19:51.200 --> 03:19:55.200]  screening everybody back then. It was a big George Bush thing, I think. It's all
[03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:59.040]  about veterans on the street. Anyway, I go in there for the screening. The guy
[03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:05.400]  talks to me for 20 minutes and sends me home with Prozac. I take it for two days
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:08.640]  and that stuff is crazy. I don't know how people take it, so I could take it. I
[03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:14.720]  went in 30 days later, 20 minutes after that second appointment, he tells me he's
[03:20:14.720 --> 03:20:21.480]  his age, and he uses my name, and he says, you have a saint complex. All saints
[03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:26.960]  are dead. You need to become one of the lying, cheating, thieves of this world or
[03:20:26.960 --> 03:20:37.080]  leave this world. Who said this to you? The head army psychiatrist at the
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:46.560]  Temple Texas VA Hospital. Well, there is a cult of these people that sounds about
[03:20:46.560 --> 03:20:49.800]  like how they talk. Dr. Rocky, you ever heard anything like this happening for?
[03:20:49.800 --> 03:20:53.640]  Every day. One of the problems we're running into with the PTSD in
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:57.880]  psychologists, psychiatrists, is they want to medicate all of the problems away.
[03:20:57.880 --> 03:21:00.800]  They don't want to deal with the true medical problems involved in the
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:06.080]  neurotoxicity from all the complex toxic exposures, not just the EU. So they figure
[03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:09.440]  well, we'll dumb them on down by giving them the meds. Now, the problem we're
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:12.840]  running into in army times is written about this. It's been written up a lot.
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:16.400]  We've done a lot of reports. When you start combining all these medications,
[03:21:16.400 --> 03:21:20.920]  you combine pain medications with the other medications for the physiological
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:24.520]  problems, and then you combine the psychotropic drugs, you can end up with a
[03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:28.840]  total nightmare, and that's what we're seeing. The Army Times editorial here a
[03:21:28.840 --> 03:21:32.600]  few weeks ago called for that to stop. I've been, you know, continually yanking
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:36.200]  out our chain. A lot of other people happen there because of the reports. Well, the
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:41.720]  Prozac insert admits it causes suicide. So here, take this, but the main reason
[03:21:41.720 --> 03:21:44.840]  they put you on the drugs is so they can say you're a mental patient to take
[03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:50.120]  your Second Amendment rights. Right, right. Well, they found, and it's even in
[03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:57.720]  my records, he found that I did not have PTSD. Caller, you still there? Canceled
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:02.440]  all my pain meds. Then they said they were worried I was going to get
[03:22:02.440 --> 03:22:08.040]  addicted to them, and they canceled them. I've had nonsense. So don't need to worry
[03:22:08.040 --> 03:22:12.520]  about that. I know about two years after that, they sent me another letter for a
[03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:18.160]  standard hearing test. You're going to like this one. So they're still going after you, but
[03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:22.560]  yeah, so I got figured, let me go stick my toe back in the water and see what we
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:25.240]  can do. Well, listen, Bullseye, God bless you. We'll do another one of these
[03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:28.320]  broadcasts soon, hurrying through the veterans' calls, but we're hearing the
[03:22:28.320 --> 03:22:31.800]  same story over and over again. Angela in Oklahoma, you're on the air with Dr.
[03:22:31.800 --> 03:22:39.720]  Doug Rocky. Go ahead. Hello, guys. My father fought in Korea, 1987. He had a
[03:22:39.720 --> 03:22:44.480]  nosebleed, and then he started just bleeding all over the place. After months
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:49.920]  of this, we went to the VA down there in California, and they had asked us, can we
[03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:54.600]  have permission to take your dad's blood? And when I walked in, because I asked for
[03:22:54.600 --> 03:22:58.680]  a conference with everything the doctor that was involved, me. Sure, what happened?
[03:22:58.680 --> 03:23:06.760]  People from Mayo Clinic, from all over the world, scientists came to get my
[03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:10.600]  dad's blood, a slide of his blood. Not only was he from Oklahoma,
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:16.080]  chocked off all blood, which his family was exterminated, coming here from
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:22.120]  Mississippi to begin with. They told us that my father was just as lucky as
[03:23:22.120 --> 03:23:27.080]  went in the lotto. His chances of getting what they called at the time was
[03:23:27.080 --> 03:23:33.320]  erythrolukemia. He finally died of erythrolukemia. My father's case was one
[03:23:33.320 --> 03:23:37.920]  of the very first cases that the VA had. Yeah, there's now all these new
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:42.440]  cancers coming out, and they're becoming very common. So what's the bottom line?
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:46.640]  What do you think he was exposed to? My dad told me he was a medic. He was
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:51.680]  pulling the soldiers out from stacks of, you know, pulling their dog tags from, you
[03:23:51.680 --> 03:23:54.520]  know, just pulling it from their neck. He was collecting them. He said bombs were
[03:23:54.520 --> 03:23:59.400]  going off all over. He said it was Agent Orange or Agent Green, something like that.
[03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:02.200]  He just told me all these bombs were going off, and they ordered him to go
[03:24:02.200 --> 03:24:06.920]  there when they were exploding and collected dog tags. They probably did
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:12.040]  some type of project Shad on him, which we know they've done, you know, for
[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:16.600]  decades. God bless you, Angela. Sorry about your father. Dr. Rocky, remind folks of
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:20.680]  Project Shad. Project Shad, you can check it up, go on the Internet, do a search
[03:24:20.680 --> 03:24:25.640]  project, and then Shad, SHAD, is delivering use of chemical and biological
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:30.840]  radiological materials on US citizens, US military. It began back in the 1950s and
[03:24:30.840 --> 03:24:35.120]  continues to this day. The most recent one were, I mean, totally, where I was
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:39.080]  totally involved in. I got exposed with Dr. Fort McClellan in Alabama, where they
[03:24:39.080 --> 03:24:42.520]  used Baxillus School Bay guy. I was involved because I was on site and
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:48.320]  there when it happened, and then we know that's been done again out in the
[03:24:48.320 --> 03:24:52.240]  Southwest, and then we've actually had a confirmation has been done up to the
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:57.400]  Northeast. So we see Project Shad. Our own team came up to Project Shad. We had a
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:25:02.960]  big outbreak here in the Midwest with Salmonella, and they were claiming it was
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:07.200]  coming from a subway. Well, there was no food that would carry Salmonella, and the
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:11.040]  Army experts that are not involved at all said, well, Project Shad is still going
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:14.000]  on. We're doing it to our own guys here in Illinois, isn't that nice? And then they
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:18.720]  use it to pass a takeover of small farms and ranches. Unbelievable. That was
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:23.680]  powerful info. So some of your intel is that was a Project Shad op. Well, yeah,
[03:25:23.680 --> 03:25:26.360]  that's what I heard directly from too many people that were directly on
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:29.720]  the inside. I mean, it made sense because there's no way for this stuff to show up
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:32.640]  otherwise. You're incredible, Dr. Rocky. All your connections are just
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:36.880]  unbelievable. I wish they weren't. No, I mean, you're the, you're the, you're the
[03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:41.200]  Dr. D. You've trained most of law enforcement in this country. Let's talk
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:47.840]  to George in Mississippi. You're on the air. Hey, Alex, I was a Bradley gunner in
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:57.120]  Operation Iraqi Freedom. So that was seven years ago, right? 2003. And what
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:04.320]  happened to you? Well, I just want to take another aspect of this. We had a
[03:26:04.320 --> 03:26:09.720]  briefing right before, right? We had a lieutenant get all the Bradley gunners
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:16.600]  and the tanks, the tank crews and gave us a briefing on depleted uranium. Because
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:22.880]  I mean, we were just loaded down with it. This was before the invasion. He told
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:28.120]  us that you'd get more radiation from a microwave oven than from this stuff.
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:32.840]  And then it was totally safe. I'm serious. I'm gonna forget that.
[03:26:35.200 --> 03:26:39.120]  Yeah, I mean, I'm just telling you what, what we were told. No, no, I know.
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:44.760]  Listen, listen, during, during, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, I had calls and
[03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:50.400]  even one guy I've known for years. And I was told, you are a stinking liar.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:54.840]  There's no radiation. It's a, you know, it's no problem. And I have all the
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:00.240]  Army's own reports just because the military told them the same thing. And so
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:03.480]  they don't want to believe me. But when they die, they'll believe, but I'm
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:09.960]  sorry. Go ahead, sir. Well, uh, this was our, our NBC expert, he was a lieutenant
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:15.480]  NBC nuclear biological chemical. And you know, it's straight from the so-called
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:20.320]  expert telling us this. Okay, well, this is the head of the DU program. And I may
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:23.840]  have to hold you both over. We got other guests, but this is so important. Dr.
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:27.840]  Rocky, you wrote the book on it. Well, the training first off, this young
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:31.000]  gentleman was on a Bradley fighting vehicle was required to have 40 hours
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:34.320]  of depleted uranium training. When I wrote the training, I coordinated
[03:27:34.320 --> 03:27:38.280]  everything with the infantry school of Fort Benning, Georgia. In fact, we were
[03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:41.400]  down there and we wrote the red team manual on the use of uranium emissions
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:45.680]  in the Bradley fighting vehicle with 25 millimeter. Nobody's supposed to sit on
[03:27:45.680 --> 03:27:48.520]  top of the ammo inside the Bradley. You're supposed to have 40 hours of
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:53.000]  training. There's handling requirements, medical requirements, PPE
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:56.720]  requirements. Then the other thing too, and this comes on down to the same
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:28:00.560]  thing in this idiot. I'd love to have his name because I just, you know, I'm
[03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:03.080]  still in here. I'm an R retired army officer, and I'll just call the chemical
[03:28:03.080 --> 03:28:06.240]  core commander up right away and say, Hey, this is what your guys are teaching.
[03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:10.720]  First off, a microwave oven is non ionized radiation. It's an RF wave,
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:15.680]  microwave. And DU is ionized radiation, which is alpha beta gamma and x-ray.
[03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:19.760]  Totally different things. So when this guy tells you that they're comparable,
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:24.240]  he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. And that just indicates a total
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:26.360]  deliberate failure and deliberate lies.
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:32.000]  Well, look, Dr. Rocky, I've confirmed in seven years ago, they told them all to
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:34.400]  tell them this, and most of these guys just believed it.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.200]  They do because they want to. They don't want to believe that all these guys
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:41.680]  have lied to them, put them to their death and give them no equipment that
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:45.560]  operates and put them in areas where they shouldn't be. I mean, I didn't want
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:48.240]  to believe it either, you know, for over 30 years while I was in the military,
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:52.120]  and until I was faced to do it when I became, you know, their number one guy
[03:28:52.120 --> 03:28:56.920]  and had to figure out what was happening. It scared me. It scared me totally.
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:01.640]  And then it was reality, a reality check, as you mentioned, and reality still there.
[03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:04.840]  Even if you deny it or don't know reality, folks, it's still right there.
[03:29:06.600 --> 03:29:10.360]  You know, somebody can be hopped up on PCP and jump off a 50 story building
[03:29:10.360 --> 03:29:13.840]  because they think they're a bird, but they're not a bird. And, you know, all
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:18.720]  this talk about, oh, we have these policies around using DU, which don't
[03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:22.160]  even really protect you, as you've said. That's almost like, you know, putting
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:25.840]  somebody in an eggshell, you know, armor and having them jump out in front of an
[03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:29.200]  18 wheeler going 100 miles an hour. I mean, it's all just window dressing,
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:32.400]  isn't it, doctor? Great. Let me give you a direct. Hold on. Hold on. We're gonna do
[03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:35.280]  five more minutes. Then we got Stewart Rhodes, the head of Oath Keepers and
[03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:39.000]  Mr. Irish, because he's an Oath Keeper supporter, had his child taken. We're
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:42.520]  gonna give you the latest on that. We're gonna come back with George in
[03:29:42.520 --> 03:29:47.600]  Mississippi and Dr. Doug Rocky to put bookends on this, but unbelievable.
[03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:52.080]  Yeah, this stuff isn't bad for you, boys. Here's their own reports. We're on the
[03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:58.320]  march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:08.240]  American people draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a
[03:31:08.240 --> 03:31:12.680]  monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority
[03:31:12.680 --> 03:31:16.960]  rights, not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:20.760]  dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[03:31:20.760 --> 03:31:26.520]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:31:26.520 --> 03:31:32.360]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the
[03:31:32.360 --> 03:31:35.760]  facts, we have the Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.

[03:33:08.840 --> 03:33:15.480]  Leading up frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on
[03:33:15.480 --> 03:33:21.560]  the GCN radio network. We're getting Jonathan Iris who had his newborn baby
[03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:27.960]  girl snatched because they said he had bought guns and was associated with
[03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:33.600]  oath keepers along with Stuart Rhodes popping back in at about five minutes.
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:39.200]  George in Mississippi without myself interrupting you, tell us exactly what
[03:33:39.200 --> 03:33:43.720]  you were briefed, what you were told going into Operation Iraqi Freedom seven
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:47.760]  and a half years ago. Then I want to get Dr. Doug Rocky's breakdown again from
[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:51.720]  this is the guy that literally wrote the book for the Army on it on what they know
[03:33:51.720 --> 03:33:58.800]  it does. Go ahead, sir. This briefing was very informal. This was literally
[03:33:58.800 --> 03:34:03.600]  like two weeks. This was in Kuwait right before we invaded and this was just
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:09.300]  you know they just had us out in the middle of the desert in a group with the
[03:34:09.300 --> 03:34:13.040]  tank crews and the Bradley crews. Just the crews not the soldiers that
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:17.280]  ride in the back. The Bradley's the armored personnel carrier. We have
[03:34:17.280 --> 03:34:20.920]  anywhere from eight to ten troops in the back of that thing with all the
[03:34:20.920 --> 03:34:25.880]  depleted uranium rounds that they're literally surrounded by the metal coffin
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:30.320]  basically. And this stuff's very soft. It's very heavy but it's very soft and
[03:34:30.320 --> 03:34:36.840]  flake soft, correct Dr? Absolutely. Yeah so you're in a metal box that's in the
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:42.040]  desert nothing but dust too so you just constantly breathing in this dust. But
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:46.720]  anyway look here's the thing that the biggest lie was they never told us
[03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:53.160]  because it is as I understand it's mildly radioactive in the state of you know
[03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:57.640]  if it's just sitting there in an unexplained ground after you fire it
[03:34:57.640 --> 03:35:02.440]  it becomes highly radioactive if I'm not mistaken. Well Dr. explain to him it's
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:07.720]  that it gets into micron particles that are able to pierce the cells and so you
[03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:11.840]  have the exposure of the radiation at point blank range systemically that's
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:16.720]  why most the calls were from the 19 year old war where 20 plus percent of the
[03:35:16.720 --> 03:35:20.480]  troops are dead from it. Now we're just now you know having the new troops say
[03:35:20.480 --> 03:35:24.440]  yeah I've got diarrhea yeah I'm sick but it's gonna get worse and worse for them
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:28.040]  Dr. correct me if I'm wrong. Let's put it real simple okay and if this gets a
[03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:31.480]  little offensive to somebody I'm sorry. When you're sitting on top of the
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:34.960]  depleted uranium round in the Bradley fighting vehicle you get 300
[03:35:34.960 --> 03:35:41.320]  milligrams per hour of strictly 300 milligrams okay that's how much you're
[03:35:41.320 --> 03:35:47.960]  getting all right that's the exposure. Now the maximum total dose of individuals
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:51.960]  allowed to sit on top of they have to understand this is right up next to the
[03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:58.760]  male testicles or the female gentilia within 20 minutes you have exceeded
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:06.760]  the yearly dose okay now you were supposed to have had four or a full 40
[03:36:06.760 --> 03:36:10.240]  hours of training as Bradley crew but that is required that's in the Army
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:14.680]  regulations in the training and it didn't happen it probably didn't even give
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:18.680]  you didn't even pass a common task training on a DU they probably didn't
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:23.280]  even tell you about that was in the common task manual. They're not going to
[03:36:23.280 --> 03:36:26.840]  they can't tell the soldier because they tell the soldier that the truth the
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:29.920]  soldier is going to tell him I'm not getting in that equipment I'm not going
[03:36:29.920 --> 03:36:34.360]  to use it I'm not going near it and that's why they don't tell anybody and
[03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:37.200]  then once they do and they find out they get a problem my phone rings off the
[03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:40.640]  hook and I've stopped on a spree and I've stopped at church and I've stopped at
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:46.280]  school and I've stopped in the grocery store help me help me help me because
[03:36:46.280 --> 03:36:49.640]  nobody in the military is going to tell you the truth the VA is not going to tell
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:54.560]  you that their own clinicians guide states very specifically quote something
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:57.520]  you need to know about veterans clinicians guide a veteran specific
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:01.440]  issue in which they say quote some of the physical symptoms which occur as
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:05.680]  result of exposure depleted uranium are sleep problems mood swings symptoms in
[03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:09.640]  the upper and lower respiratory system neuropsychological symptoms including
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:13.760]  memory loss, chronic fatigue, immune system dysfunction, skin rashes, hair loss,
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:17.800]  aching joint headaches, abdominal pain, sensitivity to life, blurred vision,
[03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:22.920]  menstrual disorder, gastro-testinal system, terepia, diarrhea, nervous disorder such
[03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:26.400]  as numbness of the limb, vocal, chemical sensitivity, and birth defects and
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:30.280]  quote. Unfortunately doctor I've got to stop you there thank you for your time
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:34.200]  and energy all the documents you sent us are going up on info wars.com and the
[03:37:34.200 --> 03:37:38.240]  photographs and the Army's own reports but you didn't even get into the fact of
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:41.920]  once it hits something then it aerosolizes and is breathing the lungs
[03:37:41.920 --> 03:37:48.840]  bottom line when they're telling... Sorry George go ahead. I was just saying now
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:52.880]  that was my point is even after you fired and it hits like an enemy tank or
[03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:58.040]  building isn't it like a thousand times worse at that point? That's what we rely
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:01.960]  about. It really finds us it goes right into the body you can't keep it out and
[03:38:01.960 --> 03:38:05.120]  there's where all the direct health effects are because now it's inside the
[03:38:05.120 --> 03:38:08.880]  body in direct contact with the cells throughout the whole body and that's why
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:12.120]  the physiological effects were so devastating and sometimes delayed and
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:17.640]  sometimes immediate. But it also sheds during the projectile process out of the
[03:38:17.640 --> 03:38:20.840]  barrel. All the way through the whole barrel of the contaminate the Bradley
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:23.880]  that's what we found on the Bradley in the Abrams the barrels were thoroughly
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:28.200]  contaminated. We put special precautions in place which obviously they never told
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:33.960]  you George. We're the clean those barrels. Yeah but they didn't give you the
[03:38:33.960 --> 03:38:38.760]  proper equipment or anything to do it with them. Oh no just... All right George we're
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:42.720]  out of time. Dr. Rocky thank you for spending an hour and 40 minutes with us.
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:46.120]  God bless you sir for your continued service and hopefully we're gonna get
[03:38:46.120 --> 03:38:49.440]  some some justice. Everybody who has family in the military get the
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:54.360]  information take the video from this show posted at prisonplanet.tv and get it
[03:38:54.360 --> 03:38:59.360]  out to everyone you know. Warn them that using DU weapons is a slow death death
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:05.080]  sentence. Dr. Rocky thank you so much sir. Thank you sir. You bet. Shifting gears
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:12.640]  now in the in the first hour we got an update from Mr. Irish and of course Mr.
[03:39:12.640 --> 03:39:19.400]  Rhodes of Oathkeepers and Jonathan Irish they're gonna have a protest coming
[03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:22.720]  up Thursday. Stuart Rhodes is gonna fly to New Hampshire to do this where they
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:27.320]  took the newborn baby and they put in the full affidavit that's now up on
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:32.440]  infowars.com and oathkeepers.org so you want the whole thing there it is saying
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:36.800]  because he was a gun owner and a member of Oathkeepers or a supporter of
[03:39:36.800 --> 03:39:41.720]  Oathkeepers political, political persecution and we'll get more updates
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:46.320]  throughout the week and we'll get both the gentlemen on from the ground at the
[03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:52.400]  protest but it's just incredible that all of this is happening and I just wanted
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:39:58.480]  to briefly get him I briefly wanted to get him back up. Who do we have? We have
[03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:06.080]  both of them. Okay great let's go to Jonathan Irish and of course the
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:09.720]  founder of Oathkeepers Stuart Rhodes. Gentlemen we've only got about 10 minutes
[03:40:09.720 --> 03:40:14.000]  here and I appreciate you coming on. Any new updates or new developments Mr.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:21.400]  Irish since we talked to you three hours ago? I just had to hang up with an
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:30.400]  attorney who called me. He left an incorrect digit for a telephone number.
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:33.600]  I couldn't get back to him. I have to call him back as soon as I get off the
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:37.000]  phone with you guys and there's also several other attorneys that have been
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:42.360]  trying to contact me as well including I believe Aaron Nappin. Well here's
[03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:46.840]  what you need. You need family court expert hard-nosed lawyers that are known
[03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:51.080]  to know how to take down the CPS. The CPS follows all the laws and they violate
[03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:54.960]  the laws procedures everything. There's major watchdog groups that fight them
[03:40:54.960 --> 03:40:58.720]  that's who you need and they'll know how to go in there and annihilate these
[03:40:58.720 --> 03:41:03.440]  people politically and with the law but they're also going to try demonization
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:07.960]  tactics against you and other things. Let's go back now and stay right there
[03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:11.480]  Mr. Irish we'll let you go soon. We'll get you live of course on throughout the
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:14.640]  weekend at the demonstration coming up but Stuart Rhodes for those that just
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:18.760]  joined us recapping you have the headline up at Oathkeepers.org we have it
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:24.080]  up at infowars.com confirmed court did rely on Oathkeeper Association to take
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:30.200]  baby the full affidavit in court order up on the site Stuart Rhodes. Yeah that
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:35.360]  confirms what we've been saying in this last four days that the order of the judge
[03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:41.760]  you know ordering CPS to take custody of the children confirms that people
[03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:47.000]  relied upon the affidavit and in fact incorporated the affidavit and adopted
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:50.800]  everything in the affidavit as part of the findings and facts of the court and so
[03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:55.600]  you have not only the CPS asserting that the association with those keepers as
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:41:59.440]  one of the reasons but you have the court adopting it and so this is what
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:04.160]  has to stop and has to change. I hope the judge will have the sense
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:09.080]  to go back and look and see that this is wrong and amend the order to
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:17.000]  explicitly exclude the mention of Oathkeepers and the association with
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:21.120]  those keepers as grounds for the order. If the judge does not do that we're
[03:42:21.120 --> 03:42:25.560]  going to sue. We're looking into exactly how we're going to set what our steps
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:30.120]  will be but regardless we'll be there on Thursday in support of both due process
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:35.200]  and also the person who would like to assemble and to associate freely. I'm
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:38.880]  glad to hear that that the John is getting to the local council. John is
[03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:42.760]  definitely both because before he squared away or like you said I get up with a
[03:42:42.760 --> 03:42:46.560]  person in the claims but they need local counsel who is known by the court and
[03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:50.680]  is known right there in the Hampshire because they handle the actual claims.
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:54.240]  Of course you're a constitutional Yale graduate lawyer work with Ron Paul in
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:56.800]  your own right so you're no slouch when it comes to that but law is so
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:01.720]  specialized. I'm not an expert in a family law. Exactly so you need you need
[03:43:01.720 --> 03:43:07.160]  specific experts. I don't know where I can but he doesn't need an expert in that.
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:12.440]  That's right. Absolutely. Mr. Irish there's donations I know coming in to
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:18.120]  oathkeepers.org. People need to specify that it is for your legal defense but do
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:21.040]  you want to say anything to all the folks out there that are supporting you and
[03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:26.120]  this being a national story? Again I have to root Stephanie and I have Stephanie's
[03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:30.160]  in still the middle of an interview but I'm going to speak on her behalf and
[03:43:30.160 --> 03:43:34.040]  again reiterate we cannot express our gratitude for all the support that
[03:43:34.040 --> 03:43:43.160]  everyone has given and you know we we just we appreciate it so much and trust
[03:43:43.160 --> 03:43:50.600]  that when this is all done and over with our children will know who who is
[03:43:50.600 --> 03:43:57.440]  responsible for helping mommy and daddy bring them home. I'm sorry it's just this
[03:43:57.440 --> 03:44:03.840]  has been this has gone on for so long and I I I've pushed everything into this
[03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:08.880]  to the side and I I've been I've pushed all the emotions to the side it's
[03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:12.560]  getting hard. It's got to be exhausting I couldn't imagine the hell you're going
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:17.680]  through with this newborn daughter snatched but you know hopefully by
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:22.000]  exposing this thousands of other children won't suffer similar fates but
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:25.720]  again we all just need to pray to get your daughter back and that justice be
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:30.560]  done against these monsters because I know how wicked the CPS is.
[03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:36.520]  You said that wicked doesn't even describe them. Well I hate to scare people out there but it's the truth.
[03:44:36.520 --> 03:44:39.920]  A child is five times more likely according to the Justice Department's
[03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:43.880]  own admissions to be abused in government custody than anywhere else. They
[03:44:43.880 --> 03:44:47.960]  are the most dangerous monsters and all the time they just get away with living
[03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:52.880]  nightmares that we just got to pray for everybody involved in all of this.
[03:44:52.880 --> 03:44:56.000]  Stuart Rhodes any other comments you want to make about this of course we'll get
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:00.000]  updates from you throughout the week. Well one thing I'd like to say is that in this
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:05.120]  fight first and foremost is the family's fight to get their child back and so I
[03:45:05.120 --> 03:45:10.460]  encourage everyone to refrain from any hot-hitting comments and for
[03:45:10.460 --> 03:45:13.920]  solicitations and violence or anything like that. It does not help the scammy
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:17.560]  whatsoever and so on my side in particular if I see them like that or
[03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:20.600]  believe immediately I'm going to assume the person is saying that I'm an easy
[03:45:20.600 --> 03:45:24.680]  fucking sewer and this rally on Thursday we're going to be firm but it's a
[03:45:24.680 --> 03:45:29.480]  peaceful rally. I just got a message from the captain in charge of security for
[03:45:29.480 --> 03:45:33.920]  the courthouse and I'm going to put one of my former retired police chiefs in
[03:45:33.920 --> 03:45:37.400]  charge of being a lay assignment with the police. Make sure they know it's going to be a
[03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:41.680]  peaceful rally and I encourage everyone to come out but do so with with with with
[03:45:41.680 --> 03:45:45.400]  know exactly because you've got so many former and current police they're going
[03:45:45.400 --> 03:45:49.080]  to know how to spot provocateurs they better stay far away from this rally
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:57.400]  coming up Thursday. Absolutely we'll work with the police if not to find them to show up so that's what concern I have but it's not that big a deal we'll be okay.
[03:45:57.400 --> 03:46:00.840]  The other thing is that I know John is working on getting his own legal defense
[03:46:00.840 --> 03:46:04.400]  done set up. As soon as he does that we'll put a big button, a big banner on his site
[03:46:04.400 --> 03:46:22.400]  and if he gets a website together we'll do the same thing for that. Meanwhile if those do want to donate and if they can just go to Oath Keepers make sure you're saying it's for, it's directly for his defense against the child abuse claims. Otherwise we'll think it's just for Oath Keepers working on the prescription claims and make sure you're somebody that's due out.
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:29.360]  Alright Stuart Rhodes will continue to talk to you as things unfold. I'm going to let you go because I can tell you're on the road but all the
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:42.360]  reportage on this is at infowars.com, prisonbunna.com, Oath Keepers.org. It's important now that we've been authorized to put the full affidavit out that people get this and send it out to all the media that's been putting out this info showing that Oath Keepers wasn't mentioned.
[03:46:42.360 --> 03:46:52.360]  It is confirmed by three newspapers and the local TV and the affidavit we have. Oath Keepers and gun ownership is mentioned. Correct Stuart Rhodes? That's correct, absolutely correct.
[03:46:52.360 --> 03:47:03.360]  Okay so the establishment wants to attack Mr. Irish and his wife and tell disinfo about them, they want to tell disinfo about us, you know because we didn't post the whole document trying to protect their privacy.
[03:47:03.360 --> 03:47:14.360]  We did black out their phone numbers and stuff like that but you know the issue is this is real just like my act, just like everything else we've covered. This is real. This is real. This is really going on in America.
[03:47:14.360 --> 03:47:27.360]  They really do have Southern Parvy Law Center involved with local psychiatrists, school teachers, everybody spying on you through your kids. This is real. Okay this is really happening. The banks are really imploding.
[03:47:27.360 --> 03:47:40.360]  The mortgages really are being scammed and they are stopping the foreclosures because it's coming out. Okay gold really has gone to an all time record again today. The New World Order is real. This is all real.
[03:47:40.360 --> 03:47:54.360]  Stop living in denial. Finishing up with Mr. Irish. God bless you for your strength sir. I've watched videos of you. I think you're a good guy. I've talked to you. I've seen their classic tactics and we've already caught them in a lot of lies.
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:48:03.360]  So we're standing beside you and definitely defending your First Amendment. So tell your fiance we appreciate her and we'll continue to get updates from you as disinfo.
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:19.360]  Thank you very much and God bless you all and thank you all for your support again. You bet. Okay ladies and gentlemen, I've got a bunch of foreclosure experts on who a decade ago broke down what's happening with foreclosure freeze could undermine housing market.
[03:48:19.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  They have been engaged in so many different scams even taking houses that are paid for shelling mortgages over and over again stealing escrow not transferring deeds just scamming especially lower middle class people that don't know how to defend themselves and the corrupt courts have been involved in this.
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:53.360]  But so many people are standing up and getting involved that that's coming to a grinding halt. I want to hit on some of that. The economic news is just unbelievable. I mean, it's all coming through. It's all happening. Everything we've covered in the last 15 years is now being just completely verified.
[03:48:53.360 --> 03:49:17.360]  And I don't have, you know, some type of feeling of satisfaction being right. I have a feeling of desperation of stone cold focus of just being braced by being buffeted but at the same time it's bracing or it's like being thrown to cold water.
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:28.360]  Just realizing we're in a hellhole. We're in a psycho land with a bunch of mind control people watching football and sports and garbage and sex and drugs and mindless me me me.
[03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:36.360]  Meanwhile, they're blind to the kill grid going in all around them and just.
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:47.360]  It just freaks me out that Glenn Beck is reaches, you know, 3040 million people or more every week and he's going blind from aspartame. There's no doubt all the major medical reports admitted.
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:50:00.360]  And we write an article Drudge report links to it and the the his co-host while he's out of town getting medical treatment makes jokes about it about our article and yeah, Diet Coke's bad for Glenn.
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:17.360]  You know, it's not funny. None of this is funny. All almost all the kids gum and candy and their little vitamins and where's that box I had of I had a box in here of anti allergy medicine.
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:30.360]  Here it is alvert. It's got a little happy kid on the front bubblegum flavor aspartame inside. And then I got Flintstones with it. When I was little, I ate these for that aspartame. My mama would give them to me.
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:36.360]  I mean, come on, man. And I got to hear jokes out of people when it's killing you.
[03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:51.360]  Big red, big league chew, juicy fruit. I mean, we linked in there even to Fox News articles admitting cancer and rats that ate it and it's funny to you.
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:51:01.360]  You know, the world government didn't funny dying of cancer, losing your eyesight. It's not funny. You're under a dark spell.
[03:51:01.360 --> 03:51:10.360]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just 90 days.
[03:51:10.360 --> 03:51:16.360]  It's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all credit card debt medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[03:51:16.360 --> 03:51:26.360]  When I first joined, I was being sued. So I use the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed with zero debt in 90 days.
[03:51:26.360 --> 03:51:32.360]  Your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program of its kind. Don't be alone with creditors gang up on you.
[03:51:32.360 --> 03:51:38.360]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.
[03:51:38.360 --> 03:51:42.360]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[03:51:42.360 --> 03:51:50.360]  Call zero debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256 and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[03:51:50.360 --> 03:52:00.360]  800-477-9256 or zerodebtguaranteed.com, 800-477-9256 or zerodebtguaranteed.com.
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:05.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:52:05.360 --> 03:52:10.360]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:10.360 --> 03:52:12.360]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:12.360 --> 03:52:18.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth.
[03:52:18.360 --> 03:52:25.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:31.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:35.360]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.360 --> 03:52:39.360]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:39.360 --> 03:52:45.360]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:45.360 --> 03:52:50.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[03:54:03.360 --> 03:54:07.360]  By the way, it's going to go up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[03:54:07.360 --> 03:54:13.360]  We have the video of Glimbex Radio Show where for 15 minutes, or 14 and a half, be technical.
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:19.360]  They just said I'm a complete lying piece of scum filth. Basically, I'm a complete conspiracy monger.
[03:54:19.360 --> 03:54:22.360]  And that aspartame isn't bad for you.
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:29.360]  And then they make jokes about Rumsfeld plague. He's the guy that got it approved back in 81 when they couldn't get it approved in the 70s twice.
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:36.360]  And they make it all a diversion and claim that I'm saying Rumsfeld personally snuck in and poisoned Glimbex.
[03:54:36.360 --> 03:54:42.360]  That's how they hope that I guess he goes blind and all his listeners go blind to drink it.
[03:54:42.360 --> 03:54:46.360]  When the article is linked to Fox News articles about this.
[03:54:46.360 --> 03:54:52.360]  The article we wrote, the government reports, universities, Fox News, AP.
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:55.360]  I'm going to have Watson write an article countering them.
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:55:01.360]  And I'm going to have him put like 50 university links about blindness in there.
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:06.360]  I mean, we're going to throw the sink at these guys and show them how they've been manipulated.
[03:55:06.360 --> 03:55:12.360]  How they wouldn't, they'd say, oh, info wars, they're nuts. They claim Rumsfeld poisoned Glenn's Coke.
[03:55:12.360 --> 03:55:16.360]  No, he didn't sneak in and put it in Glenn's Diet Coke. They got it approved.
[03:55:16.360 --> 03:55:23.360]  I mean, imagine his listeners, 10, 15 million of them listening, thinking that I'm saying Rumsfeld snuck into their office and poisoning.
[03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:29.360]  That's what they're saying. It's 14 minutes long. I only got to see three minutes of it. It was incredible.
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:34.360]  That's what they do. They make jokes about DU. They make jokes about all of it.
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:39.360]  And Glenn Beck will go blind and worship the government and give it to his kids probably.
[03:55:39.360 --> 03:55:46.360]  He'll probably come back and make fun of us. He'll go blind, drink and diet Coke going, oh, I love it. It's so good.
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:52.360]  Alex is scum. These people are just psychopaths, man. What is wrong with you people?
[03:55:52.360 --> 03:55:59.360]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up at the very end of this special four-hour transmission because gold rises to record closing price on speculation.
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:03.360]  Dollar resumes slump. The Fed has announced again today they are going to devalue the dollar.
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:11.360]  They've already been doing it, but this all out. We're going Argentina. We're going Weimar. I mean, boom, boom, it's happening.
[03:56:11.360 --> 03:56:21.360]  And gold has gone up to 13,350 plus. Congressional staffers are gaining from insider's trading. That's going on.
[03:56:21.360 --> 03:56:29.360]  And here's a Curtin-Emo article. Gold rises as banks for currency war gains momentum, which the Trilateral Commission said in 75 they would do.
[03:56:29.360 --> 03:56:35.360]  Once they had their global system in place, they would have fake currency wars with G20 concerted devaluation coordinated.
[03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:46.360]  They'll claim it's an accident, as we told you, and then call for a new global architecture run by them to stop it when they're the ones already running the global architecture of the G20.
[03:56:46.360 --> 03:56:52.360]  Ted, we only got about two and a half minutes. You've still got gold. What you bought now? It's always two weeks ago because you buy every two weeks.
[03:56:52.360 --> 03:56:55.360]  So you run out of the stuff you had two weeks ago. Now it's two weeks later. You're running out of that.
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:57:00.360]  It's a lot lower than gold and silver currently are. Tell folks briefly your specials today.
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:05.360]  Yeah, well, I haven't changed my prices. $289 for the Frank coin. You get the international forecaster for a year.
[03:57:05.360 --> 03:57:08.360]  The British sovereign currently right now is $362.
[03:57:08.360 --> 03:57:13.360]  The walking Liberty haves just an explosive deal, $10.83.
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:19.360]  Creature from Jekyll Island Books for $26.45. You get a silver dollar.
[03:57:19.360 --> 03:57:25.360]  It was silver at $23 now and 39 cents. That's just a phenomenal deal.
[03:57:25.360 --> 03:57:28.360]  And then just pretty much everything across the board.
[03:57:28.360 --> 03:57:37.360]  The junk silver is really a good buy right now. The bars of gold, the maple leaves, the Krugerans, the Eagles.
[03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:42.360]  You can't get them in large quantity, but the buffalo coins are a great buy.
[03:57:42.360 --> 03:57:45.360]  We've got such a wide variety of stuff, Alex.
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:51.360]  We carry everything out there in the market. People are sitting there thinking about putting their IRAs into gold.
[03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:57.360]  We're handling that stuff. It's one of those times where the U.S. Mint is running out of plant chance.
[03:57:57.360 --> 03:58:04.360]  Premiums are rising. Call us at 800-686-2237, Alex. Now is the time to get in.
[03:58:04.360 --> 03:58:12.360]  800-686-2237. Don't screw around, folks. These are great smoking deals on gold and silver.
[03:58:12.360 --> 03:58:15.360]  On the silver half dollars, I think that's the best deal Ted's got.
[03:58:15.360 --> 03:58:21.360]  800-686-2237 and the tiny amount of money Ted makes, as I happen to know.
[03:58:21.360 --> 03:58:25.360]  There's like 3-4% markup on these and that's when gold was lower so he's passing that on.
[03:58:25.360 --> 03:58:27.360]  I mean, that's nothing.
[03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:34.360]  800-686-2237. You can also get a creature from Jekyll Island with a free silver dollar for $19.95.
[03:58:34.360 --> 03:58:36.360]  $6 shipping. I mean, that's losing money.
[03:58:36.360 --> 03:58:42.360]  Great job, crew. Russell Mainz interview coming up now in FullWars.com.
