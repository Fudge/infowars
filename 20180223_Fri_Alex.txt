[00:00.000 --> 00:12.860]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[00:12.860 --> 00:16.360]  to the violence of the sun.
[00:16.360 --> 00:21.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.360 --> 00:38.160]  Our biggest problem is that we adapt to tyranny.
[00:38.160 --> 00:47.040]  Our biggest problem is we have been conditioned to go along to get along and then incrementally
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.360]  be dehumanized.
[00:49.360 --> 00:56.160]  I was thinking before I went live, watching the President speak at CPAC, he just concluded
[00:56.160 --> 01:02.160]  we're going to be hearing excerpts of that, Wayne LaPierre of the NRA, Vice President
[01:02.160 --> 01:08.480]  Pence, what a great Vice President, just awesome, just so well spoken, so gentlemanly, so Christian,
[01:08.480 --> 01:14.720]  so focused, so dedicated, so real, amazing, but side issue, and Pence is really growing
[01:14.720 --> 01:20.240]  on me, because we're getting to know him.
[01:20.240 --> 01:28.720]  See mainstream media gets between us and other people, and that's what hit me is there's
[01:28.720 --> 01:36.000]  Trump's approval rating now at 50%, and that's out from Rasmussen and similar things show
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.680]  he's upticking on other big so-called pull systems.
[01:42.680 --> 01:46.880]  It's more like 65, and that's why they're panicking so hard, just like I told you during
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.600]  the election, I've studied the polls, you can study them, I'm not going to go back into
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.600]  how it works, but they oversample on purpose, nine to 15 points on average for Democrats,
[01:55.600 --> 01:57.800]  and that's why you have that major disparity.
[01:57.800 --> 02:05.960]  They just say America is a Democratic Party system, and they just sell that line.
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.600]  Well, we're not Democrats and we're not Republicans either.
[02:10.600 --> 02:14.320]  We want freedom, we want America, we want common sense, we want free market, we want
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.480]  the American dream, get off our back.
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.000]  That's who we are, that's who we are, and there's old people and young people and Christians
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.760]  and libertarians and black people, white people, gay people, it's just folks that don't want
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.760]  to be in a box and know the Democratic Party are a bunch of corrupt criminals working with
[02:33.760 --> 02:41.720]  a bunch of disgusting blue blood Republican trash who have been parasiting off of us
[02:41.720 --> 02:45.600]  and trying to dumb us down so they can control us and then writing white papers admitting
[02:45.600 --> 02:55.480]  it, and I felt raped this morning, but not in a victim way, with a revulsion of how much
[02:55.480 --> 03:02.280]  I disdain CNN and the New York Times and the Washington Post and MSNBC because they're
[03:02.280 --> 03:08.200]  consciously liars, they're consciously criminals, they're consciously with psych warfare trying
[03:08.200 --> 03:14.320]  to create as much racism and sexism and division as they can, and again, it's in the WikiLeaks,
[03:14.320 --> 03:20.400]  it's in their white papers, it's in, they all write academic reports on it, Gruber gets
[03:20.400 --> 03:27.040]  up on TV and says, I'm here to lie to these dumbasses, God, they're idiots, and that's
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.960]  what's frustrating to me is that they superimpose, they do everything they can to keep you from
[03:33.960 --> 03:37.280]  actually hearing what I have to say, they do everything they can to keep you from what
[03:37.280 --> 03:43.760]  Trump's actually saying, they do everything to get in between all of us, even though Trump's
[03:43.760 --> 03:48.400]  super popular, even though M4 is super popular, everything we go on has the highest ratings
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.760]  ever, they've got 10 different TV shows modeled after yours truly, but then misrepresenting
[03:53.760 --> 04:01.560]  who I am trying to destroy me while they try to keep me from telling you who I really am.
[04:01.560 --> 04:07.360]  Think about that, more than 10 shows right now, I'm talking to Michael Savage, he goes,
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.960]  is that homo and God based on you, and I go, yeah, he goes, really, really, some people
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.320]  think it is, I'm like, no, they say it is in hundreds of articles, and again, it's this
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.680]  thing where you're being destroyed, there are these characters based on you, and they're
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.840]  not even who you are, they steal your identity, and then Joe Rogan has his biggest podcast
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.760]  times double ever, and they try to censor it and block it and not let it go out, so
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.320]  I can't even talk to you.
[04:37.320 --> 04:47.240]  And what made me think of this was watching Trump speak, but also just realizing that
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.040]  the whole facade's coming down, I mean, they can't hide it, it's this whole fake CNN town
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.040]  whole thing, and then they're lying saying it is it fake, the whole thing's completely
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.240]  scripted, they always have been, just like the debates.
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.200]  The scientists at InfoWars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[05:05.200 --> 05:10.760]  and joint support, discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies, bodies contains one
[05:10.760 --> 05:15.720]  of the most potent forms of turmeric available, turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.240]  and is one of the most studied herbals today, it is well known in traditional medicine for
[05:20.240 --> 05:22.400]  its soothing properties.
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.680]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.880]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and
[05:31.880 --> 05:33.640]  so much more.
[05:33.640 --> 05:39.240]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.840]  root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[05:43.840 --> 05:49.760]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[05:49.760 --> 05:52.640]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[05:52.640 --> 06:16.640]  Try bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[06:22.640 --> 06:42.520]  I will say this folks, everything that's turning out, now it's amazing, it's come full
[06:42.520 --> 06:43.520]  circle.
[06:43.520 --> 07:01.600]  That is the chance of Lock Her Up and Hillary for Prison 2016 that all originated right
[07:01.600 --> 07:04.080]  here on this transmission.
[07:04.080 --> 07:08.520]  And that's why they're trying to block us and trying to censor us because we put out
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.680]  memes that are truth-based and that's why they're viral.
[07:13.680 --> 07:17.860]  And I think that's going to be InfoWars' new slogan, not just that there's a war on
[07:17.860 --> 07:22.800]  for your mind, but InfoWars, the truth is viral.
[07:22.800 --> 07:29.520]  In fact, you have Friget trademarked that right now, thank you.
[07:29.520 --> 07:35.440]  InfoWars, the truth is viral and you can't stop the signal.
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.920]  InfoWars, you can't stop the signal.
[07:37.920 --> 07:42.880]  And the reason I opened the broadcast up with that is it really hit me today and when I
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.080]  say this, everybody's going to go, and you told us the grass is green and the sky is
[07:47.080 --> 07:48.080]  blue.
[07:48.080 --> 07:49.080]  I know that.
[07:49.080 --> 07:53.800]  I'm only telling you what you already know, but we tend to, again, adapt to the tyranny
[07:53.800 --> 07:57.280]  and just kind of go along with it because we don't want to be troublemakers.
[07:57.280 --> 08:02.480]  Well, if you look at where this goes incrementally, it goes to a very hellish place with open
[08:02.480 --> 08:06.960]  censorship against nationalists, against Christians, against libertarians, and then
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.920]  everybody else, and it's already started where they're just censoring everybody.
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.400]  Anybody super popular who is an establishment, particularly if they're liberal, but more
[08:16.400 --> 08:21.360]  of a classical liberal, they're being taken over, they're being attacked because if you
[08:21.360 --> 08:28.680]  got 20 billion views on YouTube, you know, we've only got like 6 billion, that's bigger
[08:28.680 --> 08:29.680]  than anything out there.
[08:29.680 --> 08:34.080]  If you're smiling like PewDiePie, and they came to him again two years ago and said,
[08:34.080 --> 08:39.840]  you give us control of your channel, and you partner with YouTube, they're already running
[08:39.840 --> 08:44.320]  ads, they're already making 70% of money, or we're going to shut your ass down, and
[08:44.320 --> 08:50.280]  he didn't go along with them, and they started shutting him down and demonetizing him.
[08:50.280 --> 08:52.440]  Think about how criminal that is.
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.560]  You sign a contract, you follow their rules, you're the most popular thing in the world.
[08:58.560 --> 09:05.640]  Students are like, who's that, believe me, you go to a high school or a junior high,
[09:05.640 --> 09:08.560]  and you're PewDiePie, it's like Elvis Presley showed up.
[09:08.560 --> 09:11.400]  Same thing with me, by the way, that's what really worries the globalists.
[09:11.400 --> 09:14.840]  I mean, I go to a high school of instance stuff from other schools with my children
[09:14.840 --> 09:22.440]  at it, and I mean, I walked in a hamburger place near a high school when I left early
[09:22.440 --> 09:29.160]  one day, it was like 334, and high schoolers came in, and I was mobbed like I was Elvis
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.160]  Presley.
[09:30.160 --> 09:37.560]  Now, that's what scares the globalist, because young people aren't buying into this stuff
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.520]  where they get sat down in a seat and they're told there's not two genders and all white
[09:42.520 --> 09:46.880]  people are bad, and by the way, it was Indian kids, it was Chinese kids, white kids, black
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.280]  kids mobbing me at this place, and I'm not bragging, I'm giving you the good news.
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.760]  But, but here's the bad news, if we just accept the massive censorship that's already kicking
[09:58.760 --> 10:04.480]  in, it's going to become total, and they're going to de-platform all of our finances,
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.120]  and I'm talking about you, you noticed the big banks announced last week that they are
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.480]  now going to target the NRA, gun shops, and gun owners, and not let you do business with
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.480]  them.
[10:15.480 --> 10:21.760]  Now remember, if you're a gay couple and somebody didn't bake your cake, you get $500,000.
[10:21.760 --> 10:28.160]  If you're a libertarian or a conservative, oh, we have policies, you can't, they're
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.640]  talking about trying to not let Cabela's have credit card service, or the NRA, that's
[10:33.640 --> 10:34.640]  in the news.
[10:34.640 --> 10:35.640]  Do you understand?
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.600]  That's what Hitler did to his political enemies starting in 33, 34, 35, 36.
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.760]  He first took political control in Germany, killed off the SA, people that brought him
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.320]  into power, and put the SS in, his Pretorian Guard.
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.760]  Then he started going after the finances, and shutting down people's businesses, and
[10:56.760 --> 10:58.720]  then hurting them into ghettos.
[10:58.720 --> 11:03.960]  We're already being herded into electronic ghettos, a term Matt Drudge coined, at least
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.920]  I first heard it from him, and hooked it up, and he's the one that came from.
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.480]  Maybe he could correct me, but I mean, it is internet ghettos.
[11:13.480 --> 11:20.200]  And that's what we've been put in, because we're the winners, because we're number one.
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.880]  Drudge is the biggest website in the world, not just news.
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.160]  And what does the WikiLeaks say, what are the new documents that came out last week
[11:28.160 --> 11:29.160]  say?
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.160]  Just type it in.
[11:30.160 --> 11:36.720]  Soros is all over the news saying ban Drudge in Europe, just ban the URL.
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.680]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[11:43.680 --> 11:51.920]  Because we're promoting America, and real freedom, and real diversity, and real tolerance,
[11:51.920 --> 11:57.240]  and promoting what's successful, and what's sexy, and what works.
[11:57.240 --> 12:02.000]  America with all its accession problems, compare it to Venezuela or North Korea.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.200]  Yeah, there's a new meme out there, think I'm Hitler, and want me to take their guns
[12:08.200 --> 12:13.080]  away with Trump, amazing.
[12:13.080 --> 12:21.520]  So think about the condescending, arrogant garbage from CNN and MSNBC, when they stage
[12:21.520 --> 12:24.600]  the debates, and give Hillary all the questions, and then get caught lying about it, and giving
[12:24.600 --> 12:34.320]  it to Donald Brazil, or how they stage fake polls, where they admitted that they polled
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.600]  Democrats three to one in some of these polls.
[12:39.600 --> 12:47.200]  They were taking 70% calls, admitting it, on phone polls from Democrats, and then wonder
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.200]  why Hillary, they said, was up at 67%.
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.680]  That's ridiculous.
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.920]  When the New York Times says there's a 97% chance Hillary wins, horsemener wasn't even
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.880]  a real poll, they admitted it was, they are experts say this, they pull it out of their
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.080]  rear ends.
[13:09.080 --> 13:15.240]  So Donald Brazil says she doesn't know how she gave him to Hillary, but remember, she's
[13:15.240 --> 13:20.160]  in the WikiLeaks giving him to Hillary, CNN giving him to her, then she got caught lying
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.720]  about it, and now she doesn't remember how she gave him the questions, and then we forget
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.880]  the real question is, why were you given the questions?
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.360]  See, it's never a debate about what's in the WikiLeaks, it's always, oh, the bad people
[13:32.360 --> 13:37.600]  that gave them to us, it's like somebody peeks over your fence and sees you burying your
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.400]  dead husband or your dead wife, and the police show up and go, why were you looking over
[13:41.400 --> 13:42.400]  their fence?
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.280]  Yeah, we found a dead body, we don't care about Mr. Smith and the dead body, you're going
[13:46.280 --> 13:52.080]  to jail for peeping Tom, you piece of crap.
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.920]  And we have staged questions on screen, CNN has been absolutely caught in a beautiful
[13:58.920 --> 14:08.480]  derailment here, they've been staging these town halls since they started CNN in 1981.
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.840]  I've had my reporters get into them, they first screen you, they check the parking lot
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.640]  for bumper stickers, they put you through a screening process, and then they give you
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.680]  questions, and if you act like you're not going to follow it, you don't get in.
[14:23.680 --> 14:29.760]  And it's incredible, CNN are such liars, that's why I quit being interviewed by them, because
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.640]  they would always say, oh, we've got a car coming to get you, and you're going to be
[14:32.640 --> 14:38.160]  live, yes sir, you want to be live, you'll be live, and it probably happened 15 times
[14:38.160 --> 14:45.720]  when I'd show up, and I'd go, this host isn't on for two hours, oh, you're right, we're
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.040]  taping it, and then they go for 20 minutes, and then they edit it down where it doesn't
[14:50.040 --> 14:53.680]  even make sense, they'll ask you one question, cut back to the person, and then cut back
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.320]  with another answer that wasn't even the same topic.
[14:57.320 --> 15:01.680]  Remember Katie Couric got sued for that.
[15:01.680 --> 15:13.320]  I recorded the old Seahag Megan Kelly doing the thing to me.
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.560]  They would edit stuff 10, 15 minutes apart on totally different subjects where I sounded
[15:17.560 --> 15:23.680]  like a lunatic on air, but total jump cuts, you know, you don't want to edit it when there's
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.840]  a cut every second, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, cut back to Kelly, cut to a shot of the kids,
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.800]  cut to a shot of Newtown, cut to, well, I'm talking because it's edited, just like refrigerator
[15:32.800 --> 15:38.080]  magnets, you can write whatever you want with those things, and they just take them and
[15:38.080 --> 15:40.880]  move them all around.
[15:40.880 --> 15:52.640]  So we're going to go to break, when we come back, CNN has now been caught not just staging
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.520]  all this stuff, but then lying about staging.
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.400]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow, and like all of you out there, I had problem
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.400]  sleeping.
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.480]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck,
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.920]  maybe a headache or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[16:11.920 --> 16:15.760]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you could move the patent and fill to give
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.120]  you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.

[20:03.040 --> 20:18.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:18.040 --> 20:27.560]  So CNN has been caught staging a town hall.
[20:27.560 --> 20:30.440]  Of course they staged them.
[20:30.440 --> 20:32.800]  And then they said, oh, we don't even hand out questions.
[20:32.800 --> 20:41.360]  And then they have blown up HD video of saying here is your question typed out by CNN.
[20:41.360 --> 20:42.360]  That's what they do.
[20:42.360 --> 20:44.200]  You're there as a prop.
[20:44.200 --> 20:45.520]  You're there in a production.
[20:45.520 --> 20:53.680]  Here CNN got caught staging with a movie director, Muslims at a vigil after a terror
[20:53.680 --> 20:56.240]  attack in London.
[20:56.240 --> 20:59.160]  And because the Muslims weren't going out and protesting terror attack, they never
[20:59.160 --> 21:02.760]  do against the infidels.
[21:02.760 --> 21:07.120]  So they just go get some people and it turned out many of them were actors and weren't
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.120]  even Muslims.
[21:08.120 --> 21:09.440]  They were Sikhs and people.
[21:09.440 --> 21:10.880]  They just dressed up like Muslims.
[21:10.880 --> 21:18.120]  I mean, this is next level, ladies and gentlemen, and they do it over and over and over again
[21:18.120 --> 21:21.320]  like your idiots.
[21:21.320 --> 21:23.880]  And it turned out it was a film crew doing it.
[21:23.880 --> 21:26.600]  Much of CNN is a PR company.
[21:26.600 --> 21:31.320]  They've been paid over $100 million by Qatar.
[21:31.320 --> 21:34.240]  I've had CNN producers on that went public years ago.
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.480]  Who was that attractive blonde reporter?
[21:39.480 --> 21:42.920]  And then she just went into private life and got married.
[21:42.920 --> 21:43.920]  The lion.
[21:43.920 --> 21:44.920]  Yeah.
[21:44.920 --> 21:50.000]  Amber, we need to get her on because she was there.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.160]  They're like, per show she was doing, they were paying them $300,000 to cover up and
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.640]  to lie about the people they were torturing and killing.
[21:59.640 --> 22:01.800]  And she said, I'm not doing it.
[22:01.800 --> 22:05.920]  She'd go over there and have footage of them machine gunning people and then CNN would
[22:05.920 --> 22:07.800]  tell her to put out the opposite.
[22:07.800 --> 22:12.000]  I mean, do you understand the criminal nature of these people?
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.800]  And Amber Lyon wouldn't do it, even though she was award-winning.
[22:14.800 --> 22:17.080]  You name it.
[22:17.080 --> 22:18.640]  Bye-bye.
[22:18.640 --> 22:26.600]  They basically told her to resign, so she just left because she had integrity.
[22:26.600 --> 22:35.600]  Cheryl Atkinson published that the ATF was shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second
[22:35.600 --> 22:36.600]  Amendment.
[22:36.600 --> 22:40.920]  To get gun control passed as a false flag.
[22:40.920 --> 22:44.080]  They did to shoot all the poor Mexicans, but they sure as hell shipped the guns down there
[22:44.080 --> 22:46.000]  to the criminals so they could kill them.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.160]  If I give you a gun to go kill people, I'm just as guilty.
[22:49.160 --> 22:56.040]  And she got let go at CBS for that, didn't she?
[22:56.040 --> 23:00.440]  Because she had integrity.
[23:00.440 --> 23:08.360]  And you look at these scumbags on CNN and Cuomo saying, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[23:08.360 --> 23:13.240]  If you read WikiLeaks, you're going to go to jail.
[23:13.240 --> 23:20.080]  And reportedly, he's such a bully thug, he's a huge guy, like 6, 7, his brother, I mean,
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.960]  they are criminals in my view.
[23:22.960 --> 23:25.480]  And the people that know him up in New York say, oh my God, they are.
[23:25.480 --> 23:28.960]  His brother's like, if you're a Christian or a gun owner, get out of the state.
[23:28.960 --> 23:32.720]  And people went, man, that's really rude of you, man, I'm in it, get out.
[23:32.720 --> 23:39.560]  We run this state now, you get out of here, shameful, fugs.
[23:39.560 --> 23:45.400]  And he's just so threatening when he just looks at the camera and he goes, by the way,
[23:45.400 --> 23:47.760]  you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, I am.
[23:47.760 --> 23:49.360]  And I'll tell you what you need to know.
[23:49.360 --> 23:50.360]  The arrogance.
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.000]  I'll tell you what you need to know, tuts, and I'll slap you around if you don't get
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  in line.
[23:56.000 --> 24:05.800]  And he gets to drunk drive and hit and run in front of people at a big town party, running
[24:05.800 --> 24:11.440]  into people's cars in Main Street, falling out drunk, but he's a combo, so he gets the
[24:11.440 --> 24:20.880]  thuzer what he wants the thuz, thug, piece of crap, and I'm sick of these people.
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.200]  You don't bully me.
[24:22.200 --> 24:33.600]  You piece of garbage, you un-American filth, seeing in all you scum, you scum.
[24:33.600 --> 24:39.200]  America is wise to all of you filthy, lying, degenerate pieces of crap.
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.560]  And we'll read what we want, and we'll watch what we want, and we'll do what we want.
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.040]  And thugs like you get in our face and try to muscle us, you know what'll happen, scum.
[24:49.040 --> 24:58.440]  Come down here to catch us and run your big dirty thug mouth and see what happens, boy.
[24:58.440 --> 25:04.240]  Running his mouth about the president, he's a thug, how the president's effeminate and
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.240]  all this stuff.
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.240]  Let me tell you.
[25:06.240 --> 25:12.600]  Let me tell you who is effeminate, is traitors like you that serve evil, and to go around
[25:12.600 --> 25:16.400]  trying to bully people and seeing in going to that woman's house that's our listener
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.320]  we learned, she was listening while I was talking about her, and go and try to threaten
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.080]  her and say you're a Russian agent and try to intimidate her from her political activities.
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.440]  You're the thugs, you're the scum.
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.480]  You're the people trying to say gun owners are responsible for people dying.
[25:33.480 --> 25:39.000]  It's the media hyping up mass shootings that is 100% affecting the mental illness of these
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.840]  drug heads and people, and the sheriff's department, not just the sheriff that knew the shooting
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.280]  was going on and stood out there for four minutes because it looks like he was a big
[25:47.280 --> 25:57.360]  fat coward, but also the sheriff's department, and I know Roger Stone's son's on the sheriff's
[25:57.360 --> 26:00.160]  department and I'm sure there's some nice people, but give me a break, just because
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.480]  he has dinner with the sheriff, I'm mad at Roger, I disagree with him.
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.560]  I think that sheriff's a big Democrat, he's a big Hillary bootlicker, and they knew what
[26:10.560 --> 26:16.000]  was coming and they all stood down, and the FBI stood down, and now they get to trash
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.200]  the second amendment some more, and the sheriff's department sat there, and that's what the
[26:22.200 --> 26:25.400]  students told us who've been on the show.
[26:25.400 --> 26:28.400]  They just pulled up in their cars and waited for more backup to get there.
[26:28.400 --> 26:32.520]  I mean, I'm not a hero, but I guarantee you, somebody's going around here shooting people
[26:32.520 --> 26:35.480]  or a school, I'm going to find them and I'm going to put bullets in them, or I'm going
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.760]  to die trying, instinctive, instinctive, how did we become so cowardly?
[26:40.760 --> 26:45.800]  Well, it's called being a Democrat, it's called being a sack of garbage, it's called being
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.120]  a selfish piece of filth, that's what it's called.
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.720]  But their whole house of cards is coming down, isn't it?
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.960]  Their whole stinking house of cards, and so they're now going, okay, we are going to try
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.280]  to openly censor anything nationalist or anything anti-globalist because our world
[27:04.280 --> 27:07.840]  governments in crisis, oh, I thought none of that existed, oh, I thought it's all fake
[27:07.840 --> 27:14.280]  news, I thought that the global elite worshiping AI gods was something I made up.
[27:14.280 --> 27:17.840]  Just a year ago on the Joe Rogan Experience, it was national news, how crazy this stuff
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.680]  I said was, and then six months later, Elon Musk, word for word, said it all, I go to these
[27:22.680 --> 27:25.880]  big meetings and they're planning to kill everybody, and they're planning to bring in
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.440]  a one world government, make us merge with computers, put chips in our brains, and then
[27:29.440 --> 27:36.520]  they, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, is AI a threat to Christianity?
[27:36.520 --> 27:42.240]  That's what they're pushing, that's their whole plan, that's their religion is forcing
[27:42.240 --> 27:47.160]  you under it, and you know what, I'm going to raise the alarm because I don't want to
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.840]  be a slave to this, so a bunch of scum can sell out our species to these robber baron
[27:52.840 --> 27:59.360]  globalists with delusions of grandeur, and so thugs can sit there like Como and it's
[27:59.360 --> 28:05.200]  thug brother, and thug around threatening everybody and bullying everybody so we roll
[28:05.200 --> 28:11.480]  over to him, Scarborough can have, you know, dead girls in his office with their brains

[28:19.360 --> 28:26.360]  the big men, they're the big thugs is what they are.
[28:26.360 --> 28:31.760]  She got Mika Brzezinski's dad who was a war criminal, mass murderer, oh he didn't get
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.960]  his pants bloody, but he was a mass murdering anti-American piece of garbage, and now the

[32:11.400 --> 32:16.680]  cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting
[32:16.680 --> 32:21.800]  mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't
[32:21.800 --> 32:28.320]  run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.800]  that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen
[32:33.800 --> 32:39.560]  species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on
[32:39.560 --> 32:44.240]  the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these
[32:44.240 --> 32:51.080]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force
[32:51.080 --> 33:03.880]  from Infowars Life. Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[33:03.880 --> 33:10.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:33.880 --> 33:40.880]  In this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[34:03.880 --> 34:10.600]  If you want to know more about what's going on from Paul Watson during the break as they
[34:10.600 --> 34:18.520]  give me this new article that he published on infowars.com and newswars.com. And guess
[34:18.520 --> 34:23.280]  what it says? CNN is directly lobbying YouTube to shut down Infowars. And how do we know
[34:23.280 --> 34:33.160]  this? CNN, the fake news network, and the Nazi-like censors. I mean, that's what the
[34:33.160 --> 34:40.040]  Nazis did, so the shoe fits. Is going around misrepresenting what we've said and what we've
[34:40.040 --> 34:47.000]  done, number one. And then number two, telling everyone to go flag our videos as community
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.600]  guidelines violations so that they can ban Infowars. Let me tell CNN and let me tell YouTube
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.600]  what I've already told the audience. I know you're listening and I know Media Matters
[35:00.600 --> 35:06.680]  is listening. I am going to start suing media companies and organizations. I've met with
[35:06.680 --> 35:11.960]  all the lawyers. It's all lined up. I have to do it to defend the First Amendment. And
[35:11.960 --> 35:16.280]  we've got so many big cases that we're just looking at the right ones. And you know, I've
[35:16.280 --> 35:21.320]  been added to lawsuits against Google by Google insiders and things about what's going on.
[35:21.320 --> 35:29.040]  And so there's a lot of shoes about to drop. But there isn't a jury in the world. I don't
[35:29.040 --> 35:35.200]  care, liberal conservative, that isn't going to find in our favor. And it's going to be
[35:35.200 --> 35:43.040]  watershed because you can't attack and demonize somebody and then misrepresent who they are
[35:43.040 --> 35:48.960]  and then disappear their responses to it. So you can then say something was in the video
[35:48.960 --> 35:56.800]  that wasn't there. They're saying that I said that no one was shot in Florida and that I
[35:56.800 --> 36:03.840]  put out videos saying they were all crisis actors, which I've never said. And they started
[36:03.840 --> 36:08.720]  last week by banning the number one video on YouTube with millions of views in one day
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.760]  of people just pointing out that this guy is in the drama club and is an actor and is
[36:13.760 --> 36:18.400]  a spokesperson. Just like we're saying CNN had a town hall. They just had a bunch of
[36:18.400 --> 36:26.040]  prescripted people there reading off scripts. So we said you've got four kids out of 3000
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.440]  who are 99% of who's put on television. And then the other young people say, hey, they
[36:30.440 --> 36:37.360]  gave me scripted questions and then CNN says they're liars. So I haven't said David Hogg's
[36:37.360 --> 36:41.640]  a liar. I haven't said any of them are liars. I said they're anti gun zealots, their parents
[36:41.640 --> 36:46.360]  are and their PR operatives now being used to go out for a second of it. That's a total
[36:46.360 --> 36:55.080]  fact. And I just learned they removed the video and gave us a strike and say that they are
[36:55.080 --> 37:00.520]  going to remove the other ones. And CNN says they want us banned. Just like we have the
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.880]  New York Times and YouTube on hidden camera from Project Veritas saying our main job is
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.640]  to shut down Alex Jones and anybody promoting American flags. That was another quote. Just
[37:11.640 --> 37:16.960]  just our enemies are people that like American flags. Wow, that's a foreign globalist for
[37:16.960 --> 37:23.480]  you. Basically anybody like Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Paul Watson, American flags. We shadow
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.360]  ban them. They don't know that no one can see them anymore. It's real funny. These dumb
[37:27.360 --> 37:33.720]  ass rednecks. Those are quotes. Because you like second amendment and freedom and don't
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.680]  want to live in Venezuela. You're an evil white person. And because we are telling the
[37:38.680 --> 37:46.120]  truth and it's so devastating to them. They misrepresent what we did. They say, well a
[37:46.120 --> 37:54.280]  video last week that was number one before YouTube caught it bad job, ban it quicker.
[37:54.280 --> 37:58.240]  They thought about total censorship, but Cal State like it wasn't good enough. It wasn't
[37:58.240 --> 38:05.480]  quick enough. You understand the type of lawsuits I've got when I've got Twitter, Facebook,
[38:05.480 --> 38:14.560]  Google, YouTube, parent company, Google on video saying we censor Alex Jones. And then
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.520]  when you do it, you then go out and say, I said something I didn't say. See, that's
[38:19.520 --> 38:30.680]  the real art of censorship is you don't just silence the victim. You then go and misrepresent
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.400]  the victim so you can destroy them. So what you do is you tie their hands, you stick a
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.120]  gag in their mouth. And then you attack and you attack and you attack and you attack.
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.440]  So here's the article and everybody to make it go totally viral. This is incredible and
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.800]  we'll add this live video feed. We'll grab this and put it into the articles. People
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.360]  can get my response. Alex Jones responds to CNN's calls for it to be banned on YouTube.
[38:55.360 --> 39:00.400]  And they mean business folks. People say, oh, I don't like Milo or I like Milo or why
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.520]  is Milo on because they're trying to ban him on Twitter. They're trying to destroy him.
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.280]  They're trying to shut him down even if I disagreed with him on most things, which I don't.
[39:10.280 --> 39:18.880]  I would want to lift him up because they're scared of him. So here it is. Info wars is
[39:18.880 --> 39:27.960]  two strikes away from being banned from YouTube. And then you salivate CNN over this with with
[39:27.960 --> 39:34.680]  Anderson Cooper, the CIA operative. And then they have hog on. They're going, I'm not a
[39:34.680 --> 39:42.880]  crisis actor. Info wars. Stop it. And people at dirty Alex Jones said there wasn't a shooting
[39:42.880 --> 39:51.320]  there. And it's a Cooper said so. He's a good CIA man. And it's all Phil mud up there at
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.760]  CNN who wants me banned because he can't stand it. He wants to run around and say he's going
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.400]  to kill the president. And then I'm sitting there saying, Hey, buddy, the military is
[40:00.400 --> 40:08.800]  watching your ass. He's going to dish it out. Phil mud isn't going to take it. So they want
[40:08.800 --> 40:18.760]  to shut you up. You're seeing it. And they misrepresent the video. They imply that I'm
[40:18.760 --> 40:24.600]  saying the shooting didn't happen. And then, Oh, but you can't see the video because we
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.120]  went and complained and got it banned. And we're asking everybody to go complain. And
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.560]  this is the no platforming. Hey, we're going to shut down all the gun shops. We're going
[40:32.560 --> 40:35.800]  to shut down Cabela's. We're going to shut down the NRA. We're not going to let gun owners
[40:35.800 --> 40:39.720]  do business. We're not going to let credit card companies work with with with with with
[40:39.720 --> 40:50.440]  gun sellers. This is called hardcore bullying authoritarianism. So that thugs like Como
[40:50.440 --> 40:54.880]  member, he said, I can read the WikiLeaks. You're not allowed to you'll go to jail if
[40:54.880 --> 41:07.800]  you do the condescension, the in your face. And it's incredible. So again, they misrepresent
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.760]  what I've said, just like they do on Sandy Hook. But you've heard it the last week. You've
[41:11.760 --> 41:17.320]  heard what I really said. You've heard what we laid out. There it is. Remember, it's illegal
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.960]  to possess WikiLeaks Clinton emails, but it's different for the media to CNN's Chris
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.840]  Como. Let's play a clip of him. Again, they don't want you to even see this because you
[41:27.840 --> 41:31.640]  realize how dumb it is. They don't want you to hear Jonathan Gruber saying, you're stupid.
[41:31.640 --> 41:36.840]  I'm ripping you off. You're a scum. I'm going to feed on you. They don't want you to hear
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.000]  Feinstein going, we're going to ban all your guns. Oops. Our plan is to totally ban all
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.440]  guns. Oops. They're trying to take down clips of Chuck Todd saying, I like the New York
[41:45.440 --> 41:49.640]  Times. Let's just repeal the whole second limit and ban all guns. Oh, that didn't go
[41:49.640 --> 41:55.880]  over too well. They have articles out. Trump's a kook. He says, we're coming for your guns.
[41:55.880 --> 41:59.160]  Nobody wants to take your guns. Nobody wants to get rid of your second amendment. That
[41:59.160 --> 42:06.360]  is crazy. So you need to support us, folks. You need to buy the products. You need to
[42:06.360 --> 42:11.320]  share the articles, the videos and understand that when they ban us on YouTube, they're
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.160]  going to go around everywhere else, but everybody else can upload us. Everybody else can put
[42:16.160 --> 42:21.160]  together the videos. It's your patriotic duty for free speech to get a YouTube account,
[42:21.160 --> 42:26.640]  to get a Facebook account, to get all the other platforms, Snapchat, everything and just
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.200]  hammer this info out. Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, because it's a war. If they can shut
[42:32.200 --> 42:39.000]  us up, they're coming for everybody. They're already here. I need everybody's help. I need
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.320]  everybody to make a big deal out of this. Because again, this is how they do it. This
[42:43.320 --> 42:47.600]  is how they engage in their anti-American attempt to kill the First Amendment. They
[42:47.600 --> 42:55.600]  hate it more than the Second Amendment. Thugs, absolute thugs, will be right back critical
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.920]  in jail straight ahead.
[42:59.920 --> 43:06.200]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com. In a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[43:06.200 --> 43:12.680]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Bull. This is a heart and brain
[43:12.680 --> 43:18.360]  pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because
[43:18.360 --> 43:24.720]  it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing
[43:24.720 --> 43:30.400]  to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.680]  the formulae. And I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.680 --> 43:42.800]  On GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[43:42.800 --> 43:48.200]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[43:48.200 --> 43:56.000]  hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill, now available at m4warsstore.com and
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.720]  your purchase fives the operation.
[44:00.720 --> 44:03.200]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[44:03.200 --> 44:08.320]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of n4wars, and I
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.560]  just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[44:13.560 --> 44:18.480]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the n4wars. It might seem like
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.520]  a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right
[44:23.520 --> 44:25.040]  now are absolutely amazing.
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.160]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.600]  tread on me. And it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake. And then it's got the American
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.920]  flag n4wars.com on the right arm. I mean, that's a great way just to meet like minded
[44:38.920 --> 44:44.760]  people and spread the word and also exercise free speech. And the newest one is trigger
[44:44.760 --> 44:50.760]  warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield
[44:50.760 --> 44:56.600]  sign and then n4wars.com on the back. That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively
[44:56.600 --> 45:05.040]  at n4wars.com. Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling. Go ahead.
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.880]  Yes. Hi, Alex. First, I just want to mention if people just go and try the products, they
[45:10.880 --> 45:16.520]  will be ordering all the time. I've ordered several of the products over and over because
[45:16.520 --> 45:21.040]  it's amazing. In particular, silver bullet. As soon as I start to feel like I get a little
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.760]  stick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.200]  I'll still feel a little stick, but it won't last as long. And I just ordered the body,
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.440]  the alpha power and the pollen block. Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.280]  like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of people
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.160]  buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products. So thank you.
[45:43.160 --> 45:48.360]  But when you mentioned the silver bullet, colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.440]  percent review. It is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.000]  the country discounted high quality colloidal silver. It's not a silver bullet. It's the
[45:56.000 --> 46:02.720]  closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet. Introducing Floor Life, the new probiotic
[46:02.720 --> 46:08.240]  line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife. After years of research on the human microbiome,

[47:03.560 --> 47:29.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:29.480 --> 47:36.760]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[47:36.760 --> 47:37.920]  Jones.
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.880]  CNN, just like Jonathan Gruber, thinks you're all stupid and thinks you're all idiots when
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.560]  they told you Obamacare is going to be free and you can keep your doctor and all the rest
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.200]  of it. When they gave the questions to Hillary Clinton for the debates and then got caught
[47:51.200 --> 47:56.640]  lying about it, when they got caught staging, you know, Muslim events, protesting Muslim
[47:56.640 --> 48:00.240]  bombings, which Muslims don't ever do. So they had to stage it. A lot of people weren't
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.600]  even Muslims. They were actors. CNN got caught doing all that. So Phil Mudd, when he's over
[48:05.600 --> 48:08.840]  there saying he's going to kill the president and, you know, when they've got clapper on
[48:08.840 --> 48:12.120]  saying that they're going to take the president out, they don't want anybody to be able to
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.360]  respond. They want to make you watch it at the airport. They pay the airports to pump
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.240]  it in. They pay the public schools in first period of many public schools to make you
[48:21.240 --> 48:28.120]  watch canned CNN propaganda. So this is the globalist run, sorrow state run, force feed
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.360]  media. And just as I started the show saying CNN wants to keep you from seeing what we
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.320]  actually say and do, I had no idea that we have been hit with a community guideline strike
[48:38.320 --> 48:42.880]  and that there was a big story out today because we don't even really follow news about us
[48:42.880 --> 48:46.440]  because there's so many hundreds of articles a day usually can keep track of it, the full
[48:46.440 --> 48:54.840]  on attack. And they said that we bullied David Hogg and they reference another video that
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.400]  was number one that somebody else put out saying he's an actor. We simply said they're
[48:59.400 --> 49:07.440]  in the drama class. They're PR people. He is a journalism student and he is an anti-gun
[49:07.440 --> 49:15.800]  person in an adult role as a public figure trying to take a major civil right. And so
[49:15.800 --> 49:21.120]  we have a right to talk about it. And CNN has been caught coaching people and has been
[49:21.120 --> 49:26.680]  is in the middle of a huge controversy right now staging that town hall and prescripted
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.120]  questions and they've been caught and the questions people kept some of the questions.
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.080]  So all this is coming out. It's on infowars.com. It's on newswars.com. It's on drugsreport.com.
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.560]  Florida school shooting survivors. CNN told me I need to stick to the script. And they
[49:42.560 --> 49:49.880]  came out and said that the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school student survivor Colton
[49:49.880 --> 49:56.640]  Hab is a liar. CNN has said he's a liar even though people go no, here's the questions
[49:56.640 --> 50:02.880]  they gave me. Even though we put images up of the questions that say here is your question.
[50:02.880 --> 50:10.680]  So they're staging this whole thing and we're saying this is scripted. They're staging town
[50:10.680 --> 50:17.200]  halls. There's out of 3,000 students. They're picking four anti gunners to then have scripted
[50:17.200 --> 50:26.480]  responses and to put out anti gun talking points. I mean, who is denying that? Who is
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.120]  denying their reading off teleproper? Who is denying they've been given scripted questions?
[50:30.120 --> 50:40.600]  Who is you can't deny that? And so what does the bullies over at CNN do?
[50:40.600 --> 50:48.600]  What do they do? They say info wars is two strikes away from being banned for bullying
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.040]  children, little innocent children no one's ever heard of, not public figures reading
[50:53.040 --> 51:00.160]  off teleprompters. And if you criticize their speech, you're saying no shooting happened,
[51:00.160 --> 51:10.440]  which we never said. And you're bullied. And oh, you can appeal it, but it's a couple lines.
[51:10.440 --> 51:16.440]  And here it is here. Here is a document cam shot, please. Community guidelines status.
[51:16.440 --> 51:20.360]  The community says I'm bad. Just like the old Soviet Union, somebody in the community
[51:20.360 --> 51:24.640]  said that, you know, you were a capitalist, you got to get sent for 10 years, reeducation
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.840]  to the gulag archipelago. And what was the video? David Hogg can't remember his lines
[51:29.840 --> 51:34.280]  in TV interview, and he can't remember. And they're coaching him saying it's okay. It's
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.600]  okay. That's what CNN's in the middle of a giant controversy right now. One of the biggest
[51:39.600 --> 51:44.120]  stories in the country is them saying it's not a scripted down all when they admittedly
[51:44.120 --> 51:58.640]  script the things. Am I bullying CNN now? CNN students told me stick to the script.
[51:58.640 --> 52:10.000]  Network wrote the questions. It was shocking. Let's play the clip first of David Hogg that
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.560]  they don't want you to see. Just like they're trying to block our videos that are shot over
[52:14.560 --> 52:20.000]  the shoulders of reporters on iPhones, on smartphones, when they're going, oh, there
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.720]  was multiple shooters. We saw them shooting and they were running around. No, I was with
[52:24.720 --> 52:30.720]  Nicholas Cruz and he wasn't shooting anybody. Oh, do not put that out. No, no, no, no, no,
[52:30.720 --> 52:36.160]  no, no. Just like we told you, in Vegas, the whole thing was going to fall apart and it
[52:36.160 --> 52:40.920]  did. I put that back up on screen from Drudge for me because I want people to understand
[52:40.920 --> 52:46.560]  what's happening. But oh, CNN makes it, oh, Alex Jones said that the smash shooting didn't
[52:46.560 --> 52:51.880]  happen. And they mentioned somebody else's video that was number one that they banned.
[52:51.880 --> 52:56.280]  And I said, on Tuesday, I said, watch, they banned that video. Now they're going to try
[52:56.280 --> 53:05.320]  to ban everything. And here's the key. And we're going to Paul Watson. Once they have
[53:05.320 --> 53:11.000]  banned your video, they can say in the video, you did all these terrible things you didn't
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.640]  do. See, that's why it's key. They burn your book. And then they say, Alex Jones wrote
[53:16.640 --> 53:21.160]  a novel of how much he loves Satan and how he, but then we actually read the book if
[53:21.160 --> 53:27.000]  they didn't burn it, it says, I love Jesus. But see, they have to destroy my speech and
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.240]  then they can misrepresent all they want and make you watch CNN and force feed it to your
[53:32.240 --> 53:36.560]  kids and have it in the airports and ram it down your throat and restaurants and everywhere
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.320]  because you're going to listen to Anderson Cooper and Como, he's going to tell you when
[53:41.320 --> 53:46.880]  you can read WikiLeaks from him. You aren't allowed to because they're the bosses and
[53:46.880 --> 53:52.760]  they run your life and they run your world. This is so huge. A next level censorship with
[53:52.760 --> 54:00.360]  CNN saying everybody, let's shut info wars down. Let's all go flag it and say as a community,
[54:00.360 --> 54:05.880]  we don't like it to ban it. That's the socialist globalist plan in Europe. You say that a Muslim
[54:05.880 --> 54:11.600]  killed somebody. Even when it's the case, you get arrested in Germany. Police chiefs
[54:11.600 --> 54:19.960]  that say 99% of the gang raping is Muslim men. They get fired. You stand up to Muslim
[54:19.960 --> 54:27.600]  rape gangs. You're fired. You don't say it's the Muslims and you've got scripted anti
[54:27.600 --> 54:34.120]  gun kids with their parents on TV, young adults, high schoolers, high school seniors. And I
[54:34.120 --> 54:42.000]  can't say, look at this bumbling scripted interview. I guess I'll get banned for saying
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.800]  that CNN states the town hall too or gave Hillary the questions. You did it all. You
[54:46.800 --> 54:52.240]  did it all. You're a bunch of lying dirty scumbags and you can't stand hearing what
[54:52.240 --> 55:03.360]  lying filth you are. Just like they attacked this young man, we're going to play in a moment.
[55:03.360 --> 55:10.760]  He was there. Other people said they didn't want to be scripted. So they left. See how
[55:10.760 --> 55:17.560]  that works? See how that works? See how that works? You see how that works? You're going
[55:17.560 --> 55:23.440]  to let them win? These are real authoritarians. These people mean business. And see a lot
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.440]  of the other media kind of watches him full wars, gets censored and goes, well, it'll
[55:27.440 --> 55:34.280]  be less competition for us. Idiots. Idiots. They will shut you down next 100%. If everybody
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.840]  doesn't rally around in full wars, this is an attack on everybody. Okay, so here is,
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.840]  here is David Hogg, not being able to get his line straight. Here it is.
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.000]  Because we had had a fire alarm earlier that day and that was a drill. So we thought this
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.560]  was a drill too, just another one. Because we have a lot of fire alarms, a lot of fire
[55:52.560 --> 55:59.560]  drills at the school. After we heard the first gunshot, we initially thought it was a drill.
[55:59.560 --> 56:11.800]  That was a bad choice. Actually, that was a bad choice because the janitor, sorry. Honestly,
[56:11.800 --> 56:17.800]  when I was going out, I was kind of, I was, when I was going out, I was in shock.
[56:17.800 --> 56:29.040]  So most of my friends that made it out, one of them went into a bathroom in the same,
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.560]  I believe in the same hallway as the shooter. One of them went into the same bathroom, I
[56:35.560 --> 56:41.920]  believe, as the hallway shooter. He was in there at the same time and he was in the bathroom
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.760]  and he didn't know if he was going to live. This guy is an anti-gun spokesman who is
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.600]  force fed to everybody. He's a young man in a man's world. Ooh, you're not supposed to
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.600]  say man. And then now at Purdue, in places they say in the English department, don't
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.800]  say man, I'm sorry. I'm going to be banned for that too. And I'm not joking. These are
[56:59.800 --> 57:05.720]  authoritarians. Now, when we come back with Paul Watson, we've got Colton Hab who isn't
[57:05.720 --> 57:10.600]  scripted. Who isn't reading up a teleprompter. Who isn't trying to get his, his, his, his
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.960]  line straight. I mean, this, this makes me so angry, ladies and gentlemen, because they're
[57:15.960 --> 57:22.880]  trying to rob all of you of your speech. And you've got a guy all over television. You've
[57:22.880 --> 57:29.760]  got these kids going up and telling people, burn her, burn her to Dana Lowe. She's saying,
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.640]  you're a killer. So they can say, you're a killer. They can dump hot coffee on me the
[57:34.640 --> 57:38.600]  left and whatever they want. They can say kill president and everything. That's okay.
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.680]  And if we just say, Hey, they're using these kids to put out their gun, their anti gun
[57:43.680 --> 57:48.800]  message. Oh, we got a ban you right now. CNN says ban Alex Jones, ban him, ban him, ban
[57:48.800 --> 57:49.800]  him.

[58:58.880 --> 59:03.400]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We
[59:03.400 --> 59:07.720]  know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick. Again, in every culture, this
[59:07.720 --> 59:14.360]  has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is. But
[59:14.360 --> 59:20.920]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life

[59:36.680 --> 59:41.400]  formula out there. And it's amazing. Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com.
[59:41.400 --> 59:46.000]  What you can do for your family. And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.440]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[59:53.440 --> 01:00:04.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:19.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:26.640]  This is an absolute maximum red alert. It's not because CNN's coming out saying ban infowars.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:35.040]  It's that they're openly calling to have a competing news organization shut down. It's
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.720]  CNN saying kill the president. It's CNN having guessed on saying the guy that shot Scalise
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.160]  wasn't a bad guy. He was standing up against the evil. I mean, the racism, the division,
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:53.640]  the brainwashing, the Gulf War, Arab dictatorships that give a millions of dollars like Qatar
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:01:01.400]  on record. I mean, this is a criminal organization. And they're calling for people to go community
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:07.200]  strike and claim that we're bullying the students. And then they say, Oh, another video got
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.960]  taken down. That was number one this week where they said that no one died or whatever.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.840]  And Jones's videos are similar. No, they're not, you liars. But once you get them taken
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.280]  down, you can make up whatever crap you want. So I'm going to say this to everybody very
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:31.400]  clear. This is America 2018. CNN on their front page and on television is calling for
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:39.920]  another news organization in the United States to be banned. If you can say ban info wars
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:48.440]  from YouTube, that's what they're calling for banned. They've been calling for Trump
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:56.760]  to be banned off Twitter. And Twitter says they're considering it because they don't
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.840]  want you to be able to fight back. Ladies and gentlemen, do you understand this isn't
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:07.440]  just Oh, try to get somebody to sue me or something like that or misrepresent what
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.080]  we say? This is don't play a clip of David Hogg, who's a senior and who's in the media
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.960]  department and who's in the acting department. We're not saying he's an actor in that there
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.640]  was no shooting. We're saying he's got scripted anti gun lines out of 3000 students. They're
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.840]  force feeding these four. They just got caught staging the town hall. They got caught giving
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.640]  down in Brazil the questions for Hillary. This is CNN in the WikiLeaks being run by
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.440]  the Democratic Party. So they're making their move because we're kicking their butt with
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:47.480]  the truth. And now there are major congressional talks about hearings about fake news. They're
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:53.720]  the fake news. Unbelievable. We're going to Paul Watson in a minute. We're going to break
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.200]  right now. I just want to set the table here. Here is a clip of one of the young people
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.880]  and everybody's got to do this when I say go out as human intelligence and go to city
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.600]  council or go to CNN events or go to these liberal churches. You're going to record
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.320]  them saying the most insane stuff. You'll have white preachers saying we need to go
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.360]  ahead and just kill all the white people. And they'll say we're going to go ahead and
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.000]  take the cross out. This is mainline Methodist churches. You name it are like Bill and Melinda
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.440]  Gates are the Christ of our time. Give money. We're going to give Bill and Melinda Gates
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:31.160]  the offering today. This is major churches in Austin mainline churches. First churches.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.200]  I've had family go to where they get rid of the one preacher and bring in new ones and
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:45.160]  it's like North Korean propaganda. They're making their move. And that's why I imagine
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.240]  if we had 50 students go down there and say, oh, yeah, I'm going to read your question
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.560]  because once you know how the scam works, you know how to get around it. And then you get
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:01.400]  up during that live feed. They cancel it when they start going to the questions and everybody
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.120]  doesn't go with the question they're given. Why be directed by these people? It's legal.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.520]  It's lawful. And look, they're going to either kill me or shut me down. They're making their
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:15.740]  moves right now. I am honored. This is an extreme honor to be public enemy number one
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:24.600]  after Trump. I am so, I am so blessed. This is an incredible honor. And it's an honor
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.200]  to talk to you and it's an honor to work with everybody, but I can just read the tea leaves.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.040]  They're coming. And you know what? I'm coming to head on collision, baby. You want to fight,
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:39.240]  you better believe you got one. And if we fall like the Alamo out of that will become
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.560]  the greater victim. That's how it works. That's what romance is all about. That's what struggles
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.400]  all about. This is the stuff history is made of. We'll be right back with Paul Watson and
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.960]  the students who witnessed the censoring and the scripting at CNN, which they're desperate
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.600]  to shut down and not have a discussion of.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:05.160]  Top scientists and researchers agree. We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:12.640]  water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid. So what do we do about it? Well, for
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.520]  starters, don't just sit there and take it. Fight back with the all new supercharged

[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:46.440]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.680]  He reminded me, Rupert Murdoch came out last week and the CEO of Newscore and said, shut
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:58.920]  down all alternative content and only force feed mainstream news. And they said, start
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:06.800]  with info wars. They actually say, start with us. So see, Trump's got a big problem because
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.280]  Rupert Murdoch was for Hillary, but now he's cozyed up to Trump. These are the very people
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.840]  stabbing him with one hand while patting him on the head with the other. And I'm putting
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.920]  headlines up if you're a radio listener. Rupert Murdoch pressured Facebook for changes
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.360]  to help news publishers. And then he read into this and it says, shut down info wars.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:35.600]  You can pull up the headline CEO of Newscore calls for internet censorship plan. And then
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:43.560]  notice Soros comes out and says, any nationalist talk, any nationalist talk, anti EU talk,
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:50.560]  ban it from the internet. And then he went further and he said, we want drudge banned.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:08:00.240]  They use the term ban, drudge, ban, ban, ban, but drudge up. Why do they not want drudge?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.400]  Oh, it says that all the liberal media is plunging. All their ratings are dropping. The left
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.840]  doesn't want Nancy Pelosi. The left doesn't want Diane Feinstein. They can't even get
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:17.560]  endorsements or money now from their own people. Scroll down. Oh, and look, clips of people
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.080]  saying that the town hall was scripted and the proof. Oh, no, we can't do that. Oh, and
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.600]  they're telling Jimmy Kimmel, tone down the politics of the Oscars because all of our
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:33.800]  ratings of tank, they're dying. And so I always explained, they're going to move to shut down
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:42.880]  our speech and go authoritarian. But how is this bad? Most of the New York Times traffic,
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.880]  it turns out, comes from drudge. He sends them more than Facebook. And how do they respond?
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:54.120]  We want to shut Matt drudge down. You give us all our traffic. We hate you. You're a
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.920]  man. Remember, Matt drudge is a Russian because he linked hundreds of times to RT and he linked
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:06.680]  thousands of times to you. Jerks. So this is so huge. It's on infowars.com. It's a total
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:13.360]  red alert. If they can set the precedent with the community guidelines to say criticizing
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.120]  seniors in high school that are political and who have clearly been scripted in what
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.480]  in the talking points, we're not saying their actors faking. We're not saying people didn't
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:30.440]  die. But CNN is implying it, but not letting you see the video. Oh, CNN took down another
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.400]  viral video that said it was all fake. And now Jones has similar ones that are also being
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:41.280]  taken down. This is what they're doing. This is how they're shutting it all down. This
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.920]  is what's happening. And you've got Rupert Murdoch and George Soros working together
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:58.840]  saying specifically shut down access to info wars and shut down access to the drugs report.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:03.520]  The next step is coming and killing us and arresting us or vice versa. You understand
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.160]  that, right? They don't just shut people up because they're going to leave them out there.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.760]  They know they can't shut us up. They know it's going to cause a Streisand effect. They
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.960]  know we're going to just get bigger. It's underground because people aren't supposed
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.960]  to see it. They're not supposed to hear it. And what are we doing? This is all totally
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.800]  makes sense. Here's the clip. Florida school shooting survivor from Fox News. This is the
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:34.840]  great evil you see. They don't want you to hear Tucker Carlson either. I know for a fact
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.280]  all those people have been threatened to stop being so hardcore or they're going to be off
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:46.160]  the air. But then Fox lost half its ratings trying that crap. So they backed off. See.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.800]  So there's major pressure to bring in censorship and people don't want to do it. You think
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.560]  YouTube really just wants to ban everything and really be authoritarian? The average person
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.960]  no. The average person at YouTube knows full well what I'm really saying. We're not intimidated.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.880]  Tucker responds to legal threat from Podesta lawyer. Yeah, it's just incredible. So let's
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.840]  go ahead and go to this clip and I'm going to Paul. Here it is. This is Florida school
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:17.040]  shooting survivor who CNN, by the way, has been calling a liar. Oh, but is that bullying
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.040]  him? You know what CNN? You have a right. He's in the public venue. He's got the evidence.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.080]  Everybody else knows what you did. But you're allowed to say he's a liar. You got free speech.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.200]  Am I going to go to YouTube and the community guidelines and say, Oh, CNN said this young
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:41.520]  man is a liar. I never even called hog a liar. I said his whole family's anti gun. He admittedly
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.160]  is trying to intern at CNN and traveling there. He's all these different things and the kids
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.680]  are all going off talking points. It's true. But even if it wasn't true, it's covered under
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.360]  the First Amendment. Here it is. What did what had happened was is the four days ago
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.520]  I had gotten contacted by a lady named Carrie Stevenson from CNN. She had asked me originally
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.400]  to just read a speech. It was going to be at the town hall at the BB&T Center. So I
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.920]  agreed. I felt like it would be the right thing to do. Be able to go speak my part as
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.720]  well as open eyes to a few things that I thought that can make this situation a little better.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.560]  Yeah, that's what they do. They get you to the event. They get you to the event. Because
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.560]  I've been involved with CNN many times and then it all changes. But let's continue
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:36.280]  on to Paul from there three days ago. So the next day after that, we had gotten, I got
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.520]  an email back from her and she asked for more of questions rather than a speech, which I
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.520]  was solely fine with. So I wrote was less of a speech and more questions that I wanted
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.440]  to ask at the town hall. The day after that, it was more of just questions. She asked for
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.960]  just questions that I would like to ask. So I gave her my questions and then yesterday
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.200]  at about 5.15, I made contact with her and she had asked if I just asked her one question.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.440]  So what they had actually done was wrote out a question for me because in my interview
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.280]  with CNN, I talked about arming the teachers if they were willing to arm themselves in
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.440]  the school to carry on campus. And they had, she had taken that of what I had briefed on
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.960]  and actually wrote that question out for me. So I have that question here if you'd like
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.840]  me to ask it for you. Well, but I just want to make sure I have this straight. So you
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:31.360]  sent them along in effect essay on what you thought, but they put their own words in the
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.760]  question and they weren't the same as the words you had sent in. They were the producers
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:40.920]  words. Absolutely. They had taken what I had wrote and what I had briefed on and talked
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.680]  about and they actually wrote the question for me. But not with your words. I mean, they
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.720]  put their own words into your question even after they'd asked you to send questions in.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.920]  But that seems dishonest. It definitely did and that's kind of why I didn't go last night.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:03.040]  Originally I had thought that it was going to be more of my own question and my own say
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.400]  and then it turned out to be more of just a script and she had actually said that over
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:15.240]  the phone that I needed to stick to the script. I just read the CNN article again. There's
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.360]  also a video report. You guys download that and they say that we say they're all crisis
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.760]  actors and that it basically didn't happen. I am so angry because we've now reviewed the
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.960]  video that's on our computer and it was, it was Owen Schreuer. He said no such thing.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.880]  Gosh, that is so evil, man. I'm so tired of them misrepresenting and then deleting it
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.160]  so they can lie about it. Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson. Paul, thank you for joining
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:55.280]  us and putting us out. This is just amazing and it doesn't hurt me personally, Paul. It
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.320]  gets to me to know that we're dealing with people this evil, Paul. This is huge.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.380]  Well, I mean, you predicted it, Alex. When you were on with Milo, you said they would
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:08.120]  conflate wild conspiracy theories about the shooting not happening with us questioning
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.680]  the public statements of this kid who's got his First Amendment right to lobby for, you
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.640]  know, gun control and we've got our right to combat that. But no, you know, that's harassment.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.480]  That's bullying apparently. But this other kid who said the question given to him was
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.080]  scripted, CNN can publicly shame him and call him a liar. And that's completely fine. You
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.600]  know, in Russia, Alex, the government censors dissident media outlets in America, apparently
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.520]  CNN thinks it's their job to do that.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.960]  We're gonna go to break. I have to sue. And I've already met with the lawyers. I'm not
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.680]  a litigious person. I have to sue them all. I don't have even plugged. I've done an hour

[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:19.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:33.920]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas. And if infowars
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:42.080]  is the cure to fake news, CNN is the disease. Michael Zimmerman who manages our YouTube accounts
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.880]  just walked in and handed me another little juicy. They just hit us with another strike.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:57.840]  One strike away from taking down 12 years of videos on one channel over 2 billion views.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.920]  And with glee, CNN with all its fraud and all its stage debates and all its stage town halls
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:10.680]  and all its stage questions is calling for us to be shut down saying we're saying nobody
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:18.560]  died and of course not showing me say that. You know, that's what journalists do. If I
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.200]  tell you, Hillary says let's all be nasty bitches, I can play a clip of her saying it.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:30.040]  Or I say Jonathan Gruber said thank God you're so dumb. Or I say Obama said if you think
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:37.000]  you built a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else did it. He said that. So they
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.880]  already don't let our subscribers get the videos. They've already got a shadow band.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.800]  I mean, the channel is a let me just give the listeners a little intolerable to Paul.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.440]  It's a feeder channel for everybody else to post it on theirs. They they have a shadow
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:56.400]  band. We have them on video saying only people that go directly to the page and hand click
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:02.000]  on it can see the videos and now they're starting to block those. I said I like the super deluxe
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.080]  video attacking me and they didn't understand it blew up in their face. So they messed up
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.880]  the video and took it down and it was viral. They put it back up, messed up on YouTube
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:16.480]  and we have videos of them admitting this behind the scenes. Project Veritas shot. I
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:24.000]  mean, does anybody understand this is open and shut civil rights violation criminal racketeering.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.600]  If if you get $500,000 is a gay couple because somebody wouldn't bake your cake. What happens
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.720]  when I've got your executives behind the scenes talking about how they're screwing
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:43.120]  me over and everybody else is free speech and how you want to shut me down. It's not
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.840]  that I'm bad. It's not that I'm a bully. It's that the bosses want him shut down. Paul Watson.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:57.720]  They have congressional hearings in the in the intelligence committees and they say number
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:02.200]  one story of the Internet's info wars. Paul Watson, Congressman Quigley, he looks at the
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.680]  heads of Twitter, Facebook and Google and they go, sir, at lunch, we saw it and shut
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:10.960]  it down. And we're bringing in AI to do it live time in the next month, sir. Well, a
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:17.040]  couple months later, it's here, baby. It's here, baby. They're having hearings where
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.480]  at lunch, they're trying to stop this man right here. You see him? Watch this on our
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:27.920]  own. That man right there. And why? Because he's eloquent and he is smart and the girls
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.920]  love him and they're scared of him. So let's go to the guy. They're so scared of that congressional
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:40.160]  hearings about Paul. We just got another one for our video interviewing the students and
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:47.680]  playing clips from K H O U and other stations. People saying there were multiple shooters
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:54.360]  and that they were with Cruz when the shooting was going on. That's bombshell. We said, we
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:24:02.760]  don't know what's going on, but this is newsworthy. That bullied the students, Paul talking to
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:10.520]  the students, talking, playing clips of two students interviewing a student. Oh, and what
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.680]  did snopes say? They said he was a fake actor. We hired course it turned out he was real.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:20.120]  See everything they say we're doing, they're doing Paul. The magnitude of this is incredible
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.960]  and they're making their move. We just we are one strike away from being banned. Don't
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:31.440]  these idiots get this is Streisand effect, baby. Go ahead, Paul. Listen, Alex, they took
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.440]  down the video because of CNN's campaign to censor another media network, by the way,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:43.280]  for harassment and bullying. This is in the same week that CNN sent a reporter, Drew Griffin,
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.800]  to the home of an old lady to harass and bully her over Russian collusion claims. Everybody
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.880]  seen the clip. It was widely condemned by everybody in the media. They said it was harassment
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.880]  and bullying. Now that clips obviously on YouTube somewhere on CNN's channel. Maybe
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.040]  people should think about flagging that video because that actually is harassment and bullying.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.120]  Oh, but we know YouTube has one role for us and another role for people in the Facebook
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:16.160]  that's millions of people are on sites calling for organizing for murdering the president.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.520]  Exactly. So Jimmy Kimmel can talk about tragedies and make money out of them and that's fine.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.000]  Anybody else does that. Even people who try to raise money for charities, they get shut
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.680]  down. Alex, they're talking about fake news and conspiracies about tragedies and the moral
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:36.120]  panic surrounding that. The mainstream media circulated a fake news story about this tragedy
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.960]  for about 24 hours when they claimed the shooter was a member of a white supremacist group.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.720]  It was a fake news story. YouTube reacted to that by taking down a video, which is by
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.080]  Tim Poole. He criticized the media for falling for that fake news story. They took down his
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.640]  video. So if you take on the likes of CNN for their fake news, the conspiracies, fake
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:04.040]  news about tragedies, they target you as well. So again, they're all on the same team. Alex,
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.280]  in this article, they literally salivate over the fact. Oh, we flagged these other videos
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.480]  and two more strikes and they're out. Now it's one strike, as he said. Oh yeah, I forgot.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:20.280]  CNN is not just telling everybody to go flag. They admit their trust because we're talking
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.680]  about the young people, the young adults they have on as their PR people that go up and
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.960]  basically intern for them. They're mad that we're going after basically their PR people
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.400]  and just pointing out that they're PR people. We're not saying the shooting didn't happen.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.840]  This is so criminal. That's what I'm saying. CNN is a criminal organization. They're not
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:47.280]  just fake news. They are the enemy. They are terrorists. They are they are the disease.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.720]  Alex, I mean, you don't need to like info wars to see that this is a massive concern.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.640]  Obviously, there are center right media organizations that haters. Okay, once we're gone, they're
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.240]  next. Everyone needs to be concerned about this. It's not just CNN. Wall Street Journal
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:09.440]  two weeks ago came out with an article about how they were lobbying YouTube to censor to
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.680]  demote our content on the algorithm. We know YouTube's already doing that by placing CNN
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.520]  and the others on top of our content. So they're already trying to push us down. But no, that's
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:25.520]  not enough. We need to be gone off the platform, de-platformed silence just like in Russia
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.120]  where the government does it. CNN does it in America. And the CEO of Newscore came out
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.480]  and admitted the biggest reason for it. He said in a, quote, dysfunctional media environment,
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.040]  they are going to make more money if they silence independent voices. He literally said, quote,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:48.240]  the potential returns for our journalism would be far higher and brazenly admitted the primary
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.240]  reason is to make more money for them. Obviously, it's because we're challenging and destroying
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.400]  their narrative, which is why CNN is doing it. And they're so brazen about it, Alex.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.760]  That wasn't even the only article in which they're promoting this new campaign to silence
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.240]  us off the internet. There's another article as well. This is a full board lobbying effort
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.600]  by CNN and everybody should be absolutely outraged over this.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.960]  And they're now bringing out the Sandy Hook folks saying that again, we're saying this
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.880]  shooting didn't happen. And misrepresenting, you've always said Sandy Hook happened. We've
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.720]  only had debates from both sides about it. They misrepresent that they're doing it again.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:29.920]  They say in the article that, oh, another video saying the shooting didn't happen was
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.000]  taken down and they try to imply it's us.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.920]  No, exactly. They're conflating us challenging this student being coached on his opinions
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.840]  being an activist, which he isn't fair enough. I don't care. We can address his arguments
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.720]  without being completely censored. This is absolutely incredible. Every media organization
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:53.120]  in America should be up in arms about this. We need to fight back.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.520]  This is Soviet Union level stuff.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.280]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.720]  filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides,
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.880]  bacteria, viruses and much more, right? And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.200]  Get the original most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey. And now GCN

[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:22.280]  has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:28.800]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life

[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:11.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:44.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:55.560]  You're listening to Alex Jones. We have gotten two strikes from YouTube and CNN admits that
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:01.000]  they did the strikes and that they are trying to file other ones to have us shut down, openly
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.920]  calling for competing news organizations to be shuttered. Imagine if we started a campaign
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:16.840]  to have CNN's cable license revoked or to have CNN's doors closed or to have CNN banned.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.640]  But so you don't have to do that because they have to pay people at airports and hotels
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:29.160]  to watch their crap. They're reviled. They're known as fake news worldwide, fake town halls,
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.480]  fake events, fake interviews, bullying old women, Como saying, you know, you're not allowed
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.760]  to read WikiLeaks. Only we are. You'll go to jail if you don't. They are total dystopic
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:47.000]  authoritarian bullies. And now in one day, two strikes, and they're salivating, as Paul
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.040]  Watson pointed out, saying that one more, we're going to be shut down. They are the
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:59.600]  ones filing it. So, Paul, this is beyond the Soviet Union. I don't even know how to have
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.400]  a headline strong enough when we, I guess, post this is one of our last videos on YouTube
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:14.880]  for the lawsuits. How do you even say CNN joins news core in call to ban competing news
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.400]  agencies? I mean, you've got Rupert Murdoch. You've got his CEO, as you said, in the Wall
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:27.400]  Street Journal. And that was the headline. Hold on to your tinfoil hat. YouTube is coming
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.520]  for you. Pull that up last week. And it was the Wall Street Journal in talks with Google
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.320]  saying shut Alex Jones down as the test case. This was in the Wall Street Journal. And I
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.600]  came in here and just mentioned it. Like it's, oh, no big deal. There's about 300 newspapers
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.380]  today saying shut me down. And then they misrepresent what I say because I'm the bad guy. See, first
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:53.120]  you demonize the person, then people go, oh, I guess you can ban him. And then it's everybody.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.200]  Now put the headline back up. There's it is. And then that story links to the Wall Street
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:04.880]  Journal. It says, hold on to your tinfoil hat. Alex Jones, YouTube is coming for you.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:13.680]  And then scroll down. Click on right there. And they say, we're going to battle state
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.320]  sponsored. So Alex Jones is a Russian. No proof. Total lie. And so they said they meet
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.520]  with all these executives. Scroll down is that the Wall Street Journal link. They're
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.280]  right there. The Wall Street Journal. And I went and read the Wall Street Journal itself.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:34.320]  And it's incredible. YouTube takes aim at conspiracies and propaganda. So they just label you and
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.640]  then you disappear. And then what is it? Oh, it's students saying there were multiple shooters.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.880]  Multiple news clips. And then we have one of the students on and then that's bullying your
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:50.880]  band. Oh, you say that some of these kids are PR people for the anti gun lobby when they
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:55.380]  admit they are. Oh, that's bullying your band. You say, why are there four kids all over
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:01.160]  TV out of 3000? Oh, that makes too much sense. You're banned. And then they don't we don't
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:05.760]  sense her. Oh, no, we're just doing this because Alex Jones says no shooting happened, which
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.320]  I didn't say. And then in their trade publications, they don't even say that CNN says that to
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.400]  their viewers. This bad man was bad to the children. And he said that you know that they
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.640]  were that nothing happened. We're not going to show you him say it though. It's too evil
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.640]  for you to see because he didn't really say it. And there's other kids a liar that says
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.400]  that we gave him scripted questions. Don't listen to him. There's video of us doing it
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:38.240]  many other town halls. And then in the trade publications, as Paul said, remark goes, we're
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.480]  going to make millions more. I suggest we have a consortium and only maybe 100 publications
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.160]  are allowed and I'm reading this. I'm advising the president that this will be the new system
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:56.280]  we have. Well, the president's under attack by the very same censorship triangulation.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:05.120]  I mean, think you are witnessing 21st century book burning in live time. And the best part
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.840]  is then they misrepresent what you say. They don't just shut you up. They then gag you
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.360]  and then put you on trial in front of the public and the public runs up and throws coffee
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.880]  on you or runs up and shoots you like that. And then it's loving like I'll walk down the
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.360]  street in Austin, all the folks in the collapse of their areas of the country that they come
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:35.920]  here and left us go boo, boo, get out of here, go, go. It's all bullying. It's all, it's
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:41.680]  a bunch of thugs, man. And they can't believe it when I go, Hey, listen, I bet you're a
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.560]  big loser. I bet you're not successful in anything. That's why you're so hateful. You
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:52.000]  know, did you ever think you came here to get away from people like you? Oh, oh, oh,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.480]  you're upset now that I'm in your face. Yeah, you can't shut my mouth up. You piece of crap.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:04.600]  You want to tell me to go away? You want to tell me to shut up? But imagine they got our
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.360]  kids in the school. See, that's where they're really bullying the daylights out of them,
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.760]  telling them they're another gender harassing the hell out of them. Serious child abuse
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.400]  trying to screw your kids up as much as you can. And you just let them Oh, don't don't
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:23.720]  bully me. Give me social support. Make me feel like I'm inclusive. I'll do whatever
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.000]  you say. Okay, the new English department says, don't say the word man. Okay, I won't
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.840]  say that either. And we're taking down the Martin Luther King statue. He, he was anti
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.920]  gay, which he wasn't even. Oh, okay, take him down. Because if they can say take down
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.160]  Martin Luther King, take down Alice Jones, take down, they couldn't do anything. Paul,
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.200]  I appreciate you coming on while I've been running. I am just this is so crazy. The levels
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.880]  of lies, other great points you've been making. How do we counter strike this? Because they
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.560]  got money to burn. I mean, I can get cases of civil rights action and show the racketeering
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.440]  1000 times beyond the, you know, the gay cake situation, the gay wedding cake. I mean, we
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:08.960]  are being racketeered against. This is organized crime. And we have to respond because this
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.800]  is precedent setting. And as you said, the Wall Street Journal is in there with the
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:18.200]  CEO of this core saying it's all about money. We're going to shut everybody down. And all
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.640]  these so-called liberals don't get, Hey, if they can ban Alex Jones, they're going to
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.320]  ban everything you dumb schmucks. Paul, go ahead.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:33.120]  Oh, Alex, the argument you're I see, Oh, YouTube's a private company. It can do what it wants.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.840]  No, YouTube's working with government to crush the First Amendment. That's the issue. Okay,
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.680]  we need some kind of telecommunications act, Alex, to regulate these companies because
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:45.920]  they are monopolies. If you're not on them, those platforms, you're not on anything at
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.800]  this point. Google is the internet. Okay, we need need some kind of law or telecommunications
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:57.760]  act. But that Wall Street Journal guy, Jack Nickass, he did the same thing that CNN did,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.120]  Alex. He got a bunch of infowars videos, took them directly to YouTube and say, Oh, doesn't
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.200]  this one violate your policy? What about this one? They've got people whose sole job or partly
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.760]  their job within these news organizations is to try and get info or censored. They've
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.760]  got dedicated teams at this point. They can flash up another article, Alex, which is Senator
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.480]  Warren's YouTube algorithm may be open to manipulation by bad actors. This was Senator
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:28.040]  Mark Warner of Virginia whining about how people had negative opinions about Hillary
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.360]  Clinton on YouTube. And that's why she lost the election. God forbid people were questioning
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.600]  her health, Alex. I wonder which video he's referring to on that score, maybe the one
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.760]  that we did that got six, seven million views. So he's calling on YouTube to barriers in
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.840]  the algorithm. That's not enough just to barriers because people will find us anyway, if people
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.840]  really want to find us. No, we have to be de-platformed, gone entirely off of the whole damn show.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.560]  And then if we try, and then if we try, Paul, to go to a march for the lady that got killed
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:03.240]  by the illegal alien, there are armed communists not letting our reporters on the Capitol grounds
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.440]  in front of the police.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:12.640]  Incredible. And YouTube, they also ban videos put out by national government, the Polish
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.880]  government put out a video talking about the migrant crisis. They banned, they censored
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.960]  that. They censored my video for talking about Islam. No nudity, no swearing, not even targeting
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.360]  any individual, just talking about an idea.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.120]  Remember the Congress lady from Tennessee put out a very, think about, I love my family
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.000]  and I love America and I'm running for reelection. They banned that. Remember? Just a wholesome
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.960]  woman going, I love my family. It's like they said, the state of the union. MSNBC said,
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.040]  oh, did you hear him talk about family and churches? And actually said, you don't get
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:52.880]  that anymore. That's gone. Talk about hunchback demons. What dimension of hell did these people
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.400]  crawl out of?
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:03.080]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life. After
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.240]  years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Floralife
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.000]  probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.600]  directly into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.120]  most probiotics. So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.680]  your gut health and your wallet. Floralife supports your body's core, where you need
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.520]  it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism. Did
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.600]  you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:43.320]  gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health. Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.320]  for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration

[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:18.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:23.320]  I didn't do this on purpose. Milo decided to hang out a few more days here in Austin
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.960]  and we invited him back in studio to talk about censorship and have a serious discussion.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.200]  Milo Yiannopoulos because they started out with him in the middle of the election last
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.920]  about a year and a half ago to ban him on Twitter. And then he was the precedent setting
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.640]  case and then now he's been banned everywhere else and they just run around on the media
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.560]  celebrating how wonderful it is to be censors. Well, we just joined us. These articles were
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:52.640]  so chilling last week that I couldn't even believe them. I saw Paul Watson's article
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  about it, CEO of Newscore admits the plan to shut down all other competing news agencies
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:03.280]  and that's setting up a consortium of the top 100 companies or so. So they'll all cover
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.880]  each other and then just kill the Internet as it's known and that they were meeting with
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.520]  Newscore. I was meeting with Time Warner and with Google and with a bunch and it's
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.000]  y'all and I saw the article and I linked to the Wall Street Journal and it said it
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.320]  all there and they said and we'll sell this as if we're cleaning up the Internet and getting
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:28.840]  rid of the Russian agent Alex Jones. More defamation, more insane cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.720]  Milo is here now, so boom, one strike comes in, another and then yeah. In the article,
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.760]  CNN says they're doing the strikes because we're bullying children and then all we did
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:43.160]  was say, hey, we interviewed, we showed local newscasting or multiple shooters and we interviewed
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.280]  one of the other students who said the same thing and we just had nice polite interviews
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:51.520]  but they say that, oh no, those interviews are saying that the shooting didn't happen.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.680]  So Milo, this is next level stuff we're dealing with. Paul Watson, you guys just free for
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:02.800]  all here. What do we do about this? We need a new telecommunications act, a true open
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:08.840]  free Internet act. Keep the Internet free act. It's the left coming in doing all of
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:14.400]  this and they're so authoritarian and now they're putting notices up under our videos.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:20.000]  They started it with Russian videos saying this was state sponsored as if CNN as if global
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.760]  sponsored. I mean, what do we do Milo? You have been the test subject of this. Now they're
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:31.560]  announcing the big, giant rollout against us, congressional hearings, you name it and
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:38.000]  it's surreal that what they accuse you of isn't even true but they won't show the video.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.080]  Notice because it's so evil. Yes. Oh my God, Jones said nothing happened at the thing and
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.320]  I didn't say that. In fact, we even predicted, I mean, this is next level. You and I spoke
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.440]  about the subject of Florida on air together two days ago and the way that we phrase things
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:50:00.040]  was remarkably cautious. We were disciplined and careful and light touch and the majority
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:06.280]  of the big claims in the interview came from a student at the school. So here's what's
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:12.800]  happening. You know, the big media and the tech companies respond with a warning shot
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.720]  which is a strike on a YouTube account. It's the first sign that they have already decided
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.440]  that they don't want you around questioning things. And here's the really big thing that
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:26.960]  will happen to you after the ban comes, which you don't think about beforehand. It removes
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:32.520]  your right of reply. It removes your ability to respond to smears. The first thing that
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:37.040]  happens. It's obvious is it removes your reach. Everybody knows that you lose YouTube account.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.160]  The audience there is gone. But perhaps the more important thing long term is that people
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:46.160]  can then lie about you on YouTube and you cannot respond because your audiences these
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:50.200]  days are fragmented not by media company. You don't have New York Times readers and
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:57.120]  Washington Post readers. You have platform faithful audiences. So there are people who
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.400]  almost who get almost everything from YouTube. There are people who get almost everything
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.800]  from newspaper websites. There are people who get almost everything from Twitter. And
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.440]  if somebody makes an allegation against you on YouTube and you can't respond to it on
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.800]  YouTube, the YouTube audience, which may be a colossal slice of your platform of your
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:17.360]  people will never get to hear your response. They'll never get to hear your side of the
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  story.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.360]  It's bad now.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.240]  And that's what they do. You could teach a college course on this deception off the
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.760]  CNN articles because Paul, that's exactly what they're doing. They say that we're saying
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.560]  nothing happened. And then they talk about somebody else's video that got removed and
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:36.200]  they say, so Jones's videos, we've complained and we're almost there. We've almost got him
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:40.920]  shut down. So I mean, it's criminal, Paul, that they are racketeering against the First
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.920]  Amendment.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.480]  And while the New York Times floated a trial balloon on this back in November, the headline
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.760]  is YouTube's rapid response partisans game the news of tragedy, which is similar to the
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:56.440]  Cuomo thing on CNN, where he says, you know, only we can read the WikiLeaks. And in this
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:02.520]  article, they conflate me with this actual racist who responded to the Sutherland spring
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.760]  shooting by saying it's either a Muslim or a black guy before anyone knew anything about
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.760]  it.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:11.720]  Then they mentioned me. And they get into this whole question about, oh, how do you manage
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:15.120]  to get your tweets to the top of the search engine, like you mentioned with the whole
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.640]  congressional hearing? How do you manage to reach so many people on YouTube? I told them,
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:25.720]  there's no strategy. It's having an argument. It's resonating with people. It's not being
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:31.080]  boring. And they can't compete with that, Alex. There was an MTV news video. MTV news
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:35.920]  it used to be at least a big social justice warrior channel. They did an interview with
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:42.960]  Tim Kaine a couple of weeks ago. It has 200 views. I mean, they can't resonate with anyone.
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:49.880]  So they have to show Facebook smarter than Google Facebook. You had videos back during
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:55.960]  the election with 37 million 25. I mean, you have like 30 videos or 40 videos. I was looking
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.360]  going, that's 37 million. That's 29 million. And they were growing. Maybe like 300 billion
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.760]  now. Once they get that, they never stop. We're talking in weeks. They were getting
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.720]  same thing happened to me. They just all gone. But what Facebook does is instead of banning
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.560]  you, Facebook turns down the volume on you. They have an algorithm that can deemphasize
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.760]  your posts so that you don't appear in the news feed. So somebody could be subscribed
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.280]  to somebody could comment on your page every day. They could love you and Facebook knows
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.800]  they love you because they know how active they are on your page, but they still never
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.680]  see any of your stuff in the news feed because Facebook hasn't outright banned you. It's just
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:31.160]  turned the volume down and see YouTube executives brag. Oh, we shadow banned Jones. We got to
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.480]  go to his actual page to find it. And then these idiots never don't even know we've done
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.640]  it. No, we know you've done it. We see the numbers. They're also in the news. Like we're
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:44.280]  not humans going. Our strategy will increase profits and shut down all competition. They'll
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:49.240]  be no more internet freedom by 2020. That's our corporate plan. We just met with the top
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.600]  15 CEOs. I mean, this was in the Wall Street Journal last week, Paul. And then the left
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:57.960]  goes, ah, they're going to ban Alex King. He's still got a tinfoil hat on though. No
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:01.840]  one's coming for you. Oh, we're going to ban you, you son of a bitch. I mean, these are
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.960]  frosty idiots, Paul. And of course, it's like, yeah, apparently they're going to ban you.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.360]  Oh, by the way, we're banning you. Yeah. I mean, the Wall Street Journal piece, this
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.960]  Jack Nickass guy in his article, he openly said he'd compiled a list of quote fringe
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:21.800]  and divisive content and then presented it to you to mean imagine that being your job
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:26.240]  to collect things which are offensive. By the way, that's authoritarianism. The New
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.880]  York Times has a liaison with YouTube that tries to, our major job is blocking all shows.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.960]  But, but so, wait, think about this though. It's just like the Soviet Union. That's their
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.720]  job. They make lists of who to disappear. So, because you know, that's what's coming
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.280]  next. Every major, they're going to kill us. Every, I mean, you know, the, they know we're
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.480]  not going to shut up. They want to just cut us down to size before they really come after
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.040]  us. I think they can strangle us digitally. They can strangle us commercially. They can
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:54.160]  strangle us in a million different ways. They don't even have to go through the ugly business
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.360]  of doing it in real life. I think that they are perfectly able to do it with turning down
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.120]  the volume. They've never been able to shut us down because the audience gets it and gets
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.000]  around it. I understand they've really de-platformed you and then they all celebrate it and everything
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.960]  and you act like you're dead, which isn't true. That's why you're here. But I'm telling
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.680]  you, audience, I've been so upset. I haven't plugged in two hours. I need support. I need
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:20.400]  support big time. I need you to go to infowarstore.com. Great supplements, great books, video, t-shirts,
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.400]  things you need, super high quality toothpaste. I've been so busy I haven't come up with
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:27.200]  the new specials. So all those specials, it's going to end up selling out everything. I
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.840]  didn't want to sell out of everything. I was going to go back to regular price until more
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.160]  came in, but I'm just going to keep this up till it sells out, which looks like it'll
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.800]  be a few days. Super blue fluoride free toothpaste with little silver and iodine. We've got the
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:43.000]  brain force. We've got 50% off, Icarin, the liver and kidney cleanse. We've got the cell
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.800]  force, which is an incredible deal. It's going to be called DNA force plus as soon as we
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:53.680]  re-launch it. It's way better than the old DNA force. So infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.920]  or AAA2533139. But whatever you do, thank the local stations that are picking up the
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.640]  show. Understand it isn't about info wars. The reason I've dropped everything and gone
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:08.600]  to this when I had a huge show lined up is because this is a big deal, folks. Newscore
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.360]  and CNN have announced together that they're moving to completely end everybody on the
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  internet and only make it a corporate platform. Do you understand that? They are making their
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.320]  move. They first turned Facebook, Google, YouTube, all this into these huge utilities,
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.960]  and then they're rolling them out. Paul, this is an emergency situation, and they're going
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  to move against the president. They're so pissed his approval ratings are up. They're
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:37.320]  so pissed the country's coming back. This is the civil war, Paul. What do we do?
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.920]  Well, we need to lobby for some kind of new telecommunications act. As I've said, I mean,
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.440]  people within the Trump administration have seemed sympathetic to that at different points.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:51.200]  So that's what we want. The thing about YouTube, Alex, is it takes hard work to build up a
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.960]  YouTube audience, a subscriber base, and you have to have a personality to be successful
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.680]  on YouTube. People who work in the mainstream media, Alex, don't have personalities. Okay,
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.800]  it takes talent. It takes having a message that resonates with people. They're boring.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:12.720]  They're lazy. No one wants to watch them, which is why they're so resentful and jealous,
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:16.720]  which is why they're deliberately targeting YouTube and trying to shut us down. It's not
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:21.520]  just that overall all agendas, it's also personal. They hate us because they're boring and no
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:22.520]  one wants to listen to them.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:28.480]  That's right. They're self-righteous thug scum who just absolutely have been caught in every
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.880]  form of corruption and lying and manipulation imaginably. It's like Tucker Carlson said last
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.520]  week, how much would you have to be paid to watch CNN? As it turns out, they paid to make
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.480]  everyone watch it in the hotels and the airports. Paul, great job. Thank you so much. More with
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.920]  Milo and Steve Pachennick coming up. Stay with us.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:53.560]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to stay a few minutes here first, just encouraging

[01:59:51.400 --> 02:00:09.400]  You're listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:24.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Dr. Steve Pacenek joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:31.480]  Milo Yiannopoulos riding shotgun with us. I am extremely angry right now. I am not
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:38.680]  putting on an act on air, okay? I started sweating when I saw this news today, not because
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:45.920]  of my own personal company or operation. You read about the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.480]  and you read books and history books. It's upsetting. You feel for those people in those
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:57.840]  times. History is the ultimate soap opera, but it's real. We're living history. News
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:03.040]  core last week said they're meeting with top executives and had met with the top executives
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.640]  to have the Internet freedom end. They said, end it. They said, shut down all the other
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.040]  sites where no one can get to it on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, any of these platforms.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.360]  Taking the U out of YouTube. And then seeing an income and they said, we're going to do
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:23.480]  it by making examples of Infowars. And then I saw the, the left saw planning this. It
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.440]  was all these articles. Yay, YouTube's coming for you, Alex Jones. You're going to be banned.
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:35.680]  And then they make it up that I said nobody got shot at the thing. And then they CNN starts
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:43.560]  flagging and admittedly flagging to shut us down. That's racketeering. That is, that is
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:51.200]  a thousand times not baking a cake for the gay couple, Milo.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:57.760]  What I think you have to see this in the context of a wider war between legacy media and the
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:04.040]  institutional bodies in America more generally, and upstarts like you, me, Breitbart, we had
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:08.920]  extraordinary unprecedented power to reach and affect and influence people in the last
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:13.200]  election. The media recognized perhaps two years too late, but they finally have got
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:17.480]  the message this year that their stranglehold over popular opinion, their ability to shape
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.480]  and direct popular.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.760]  It's already over.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:20.760]  Is gone.
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.480]  They can try to hurt us, but don't they get it? They are hated.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.240]  Absolutely. But that doesn't mean they're not still powerful. And they're powerful in
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.480]  ways that you don't always immediately think of. It's not just what they broadcast every
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:34.400]  day. It's not just the fact that they still have large audiences. Even if those audiences
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:37.880]  are skeptical about what they say, they still have power because they still have money and
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:43.280]  connections. And with those money connections, they can go down kicking, screaming and desperately
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:47.200]  begging for their lives and damaging like a dog that's about to die. That's most dangerous
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:52.360]  just before death. They can go down kicking, screaming, scratching, biting and yelping
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.960]  and damage everybody who they think damaged them on the way down on the way to dusty death.
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:02.000]  They will do as much. They will inflict as much misery and pain and decapitate as many
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.520]  of the people they consider responsible for this as they possibly can.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:11.400]  I cannot believe that they're this. They're in the Wall Street Journal saying we met with
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.080]  all the tech execs. We're gonna in the Internet as you know it. And they're saying we're gonna
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:21.200]  ban everybody and we're gonna start with Alex Jones. It's what's weird is they used to lie
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.000]  about all this stuff and they still lie about it. When it comes to censorship, they're like
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.640]  we had our world government summit and now instead of like denying it was always they're
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:32.360]  like we're gonna have world government. We're gonna end the family and you know just.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.840]  It's the complacency born of arrogance. It's complacency, arrogance and elitism. It's a
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.900]  supreme overconfidence that I think you often see in ruling regimes teetering on the brink
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:44.160]  of collapse who don't necessarily know it.
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:49.160]  That is it though. And we're not just saying this. It's from the NFL to the Oscars to
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:53.800]  the Olympics. It's all in free fall. It's cardiac arrest.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:57.400]  They haven't quite worked out that they're dead yet. Some of them have and they get furious
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.240]  and they're biting, kicking, scratching and punching. CNN knows. CNN knows it's in trouble.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.680]  But some of these other big companies don't realize they're in trouble. The establishment
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:09.600]  in general doesn't think it's in trouble. Individual companies will see their own viewers
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.480]  turn against them. They'll see the financials. They'll see the ratings fall. They'll see
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:20.000]  all the signs of trouble. But the establishment in general, as a uber blob of the media company.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Yeah, the media is just a throwaway twerp. I don't care if the news divisions hated intensify
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.400]  race war operations. That's in the WikiLeaks. There's a top professor advising Hillary. It's
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.600]  actually a British professor. That's why they say, we need to go to cultural war and
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.280]  intensify operations. We're losing control of them. They must be kept in the dark and
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:46.640]  desperate. These are close, in the dark and desperate. Get that, span that mile, old fellow.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:52.280]  They're a very good British accent. Actually, you're good at that. I want him off the air
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:05:01.040]  immediately. The Lordship. Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life. Cell Force focuses
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:07.280]  on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:12.680]  They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:18.160]  by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:24.720]  don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.920]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:36.000]  oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.920]  on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:47.760]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force

[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:44.360]  Asking through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:49.320]  We are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen. And if the globalists
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:53.520]  want to go under my skin, they've done it. Milo's here, riding shotguns. Steve Pachanin
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:57.840]  will give us his analysis on a bunch of big topics that are critical, that are so huge.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.800]  They can't stand the type of information you're about to hear. They don't want you to know
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.680]  the inside baseball, the angles, what's going on in the White House, all of it, okay? They
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:08.320]  don't like the fact that the hostage rescue team called up and told me what went on with
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:12.520]  the gun deal and the Muslims using it as a cutout to get the weapons, to try to embarrass
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:17.680]  Trump and it was all part of the Saudi Civil War. Directly from the FBI. Okay, that's what
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:24.600]  happened. They don't like that. They cannot stand that. They can't stand the fact that
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.080]  I can get information from the top generals just like that. Boom. Here's this information
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:35.160]  for you, Alex. And it's always accurate. Never BS. Because real information, truth is viral.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:38.600]  That's what's powerful. And they're crapping their britches right now. But it's not about
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:44.000]  us. The brazen Wall Street Journal. And I covered this last week, but I'm kind of punch
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.880]  drunk to it. Like, we're taking over the entire internet with Google and we're going to shut
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:53.320]  down everybody starting with Alex Jones. And Paul Ross is like, you ought to make a bigger
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:58.680]  deal out of this. And then they're like, Jones, YouTube's coming for you. And then now CNN
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:05.000]  says we're actively trying to get Alex Jones banned for bullying children. And then the
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.400]  video is students that are young adults saying they saw multiple shooters. And some of it's
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.840]  often the news, it's clips. And then we're saying, we don't know what happened. We're
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:19.360]  in, I think a shooting could happen. But if somebody doesn't think, think something happened
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.040]  when you got lied about babies and incubators and get us in Iraq war, it's your right to
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:28.880]  sit there and to say that and do that. So I know I'm ranting, but I've tried to explain
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:33.840]  this feeling. It's like coming home to your apartment because I haven't had any robberies
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:42.280]  since I live the house or apartment. And all your stuff's been torn through. And on top
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:46.280]  of it, whoever was in your house up at the weekend, people break in, you know, just stay
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:49.520]  in there. I guess cause they know you're out of town or something. And then somebody pisses
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.280]  on your rug for no reason, right at a big Lebowski. You're like, wow, you know, and
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.280]  you pissed on my floor. You didn't just steal my computer and TV and, you know, eat stuff
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:01.400]  out of the refrigerator. You, you, you, you're pissed on the floor. And, you know, that's
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:07.680]  what CNN's like. Fake news, fake town halls, fake script interviews. They've all been caught
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:12.720]  going harassing old ladies at their houses, saying they're Russian agents. All this crap
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:16.040]  to try to bully the American Cuomo going, you're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks. You'll be
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.960]  arrested if you do. I am allowed to. I mean, the condescension of a narcissistic middle
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:28.200]  patient like that. I mean, a drooling knuckle dragging 75 IQ thug, a thug, like a stupid
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:35.720]  brother, but no, I'm serious, Milo. So I, I feel raped and I don't feel like I'm a victim.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.840]  I'm pissed. I want to unscrew somebody's head politically. I mean, this is a real group
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:46.240]  of flaming authoritarians that brag and celebrate that they banned you off Twitter and have
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:52.200]  financially tried to ruin you and they celebrate everywhere, pissing on you constantly. And
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:57.520]  people say, why are that Milo guy? It's fashionable to tear him down because I'll be Milo next
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:01.960]  week. Like I said, Wednesday, and now I am. And all these other idiot, libertarian and
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:10.320]  conservative hosts that don't get this morons. Why did I give Rush Limbaugh $300,000 when
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:14.720]  they were about to take a show off because I could get advertising at half price and
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:19.480]  support the first amendment. Win, win, have my cake, eat it too. And I made a bunch of
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.800]  money for our operation. That's right. I went and propped up Rush Limbaugh and a bunch of
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:30.320]  other people did because if they could shut him down, they're going to shut us down, people.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:34.960]  You hang together, you hang separate. Remember Benjamin Franklin? He's on the $100 bill.
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.400]  He launched the whole country. You know who he is? Damn, these people don't have any instincts,
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:45.440]  Milo. None. This, I'm not mad for me. We've already been demonetized. They already censor
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.880]  us on YouTube. It's that they're nakedly openly saying, we're censors and we're going
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.360]  to shut everybody down. And then the public, the dumb liberals go, oh, good, shut him down.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:00.760]  You're going to be shut down. You drooling morons. I'm sorry. Milo, you go ahead and
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:07.360]  then I'm going to poach in it. It's just this, this is, this is like, like watching someone
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.440]  rape your grandmother. I mean, they are raping the country. And the great part is they're
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:15.920]  all collapsing. Everyone hates them, but they won't get out of our lives. And then now seeing
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:22.400]  it in is in two articles saying, we're actively campaigning to have info or shut down. I mean,
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:29.120]  total racketeering $500,000 to somebody wouldn't bake the gay wedding cake. What do I get?
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.960]  What do you get with the organized criminals up there? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Then
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.760]  I'm going to poach in it. I'm out of control. I just did the raping Milo and you have been
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.360]  raped and raped and raped by these damn people.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.880]  This is what frustrates me about libertarians and conservatives and even people who otherwise
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.460]  agree with it, with free speech and are passionate about free speech. They think that standing
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:53.760]  up for somebody else when they're being censored is the same as agreeing with everything they
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.360]  say. We're not like the liberals. We're not just going to club together for whatever. We're
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:59.800]  individualists. We're on the right. Nobody's asking you to agree with everything Alex says
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:04.840]  or everything I say. What we're asking is that you come out loudly in defense of free
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.120]  speech and against censorship because if you stand by and do nothing when my Twitter account
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.600]  is taken away and you stand by and do nothing when Alex's YouTube account is taken away,
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.640]  what on God's earth makes you think that when they've taken the targets at one end they're
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.800]  not going to go and attack the other end next? What on earth makes you think that you're
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.800]  not next?
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.200]  I've seen it time and again. I've seen it with Breitbart, with Sleeping Giants. That campaign
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:34.840]  that's had 4,000 advertisers remove their ads from Breitbart.com without a peep, without
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:38.440]  so much as a word from the rest of conservative media. Because conservative media, they're
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.040]  worried, oh, what about us next? They've gone for Breitbart. We'll just stay quiet. You've
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.640]  got the Federalists. You've got the Daily Caller. What are they doing to protect themselves,
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:47.640]  to ensure-
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.320]  I tell you what they're going to do. If they're successful, they're really going to have their
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:54.440]  downfall. And Trump has to know this. Everybody's going to get the info to him because the very
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.760]  same people that are censoring him and trying to block him and trying to de-platform him
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:03.520]  on Twitter, they have serious discussions about that. They are openly sneaking up to
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:08.520]  him, Rupert Murdoch, in this perfect storm. Rupert Murdoch and his CEO, did you read it
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.120]  or what they said? They're going to shut everybody down. They're working with Google.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:15.920]  They've gone for the tough fighters. They've gone for the biggest targets first because
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:18.920]  they know everybody else will crumble immediately afterwards. They've gone for you, me, and Breitbart
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.640]  because we were the three biggest targets. If they can beat the three of us, the rest
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.160]  will crumble without a fight because the rest of them have no stomach and no appetite for
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:28.160]  the fight.
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.320]  I agree. I'm not going to just be patronizing. I've gotten so upset with this and I can't
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.480]  remove all the stuff that's going on behind the scenes because obviously you talk about
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.080]  the stuff, then it actually amplifies what they're doing and the operations are running.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:47.880]  They are offering people large sums of money to say lies. The problem is that people aren't
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:53.920]  even taking the money. Then the money goes up, up, up. The crap that I've learned they're
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.680]  wanting them to say is unbelievable. That's what they want to shut me down and then they're
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:01.640]  going to bring out all the big BS.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:04.840]  We discussed this at dinner the other night. We talked about one particular story, but
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:11.600]  there are lots of them about both of us. It's the cost of doing business and being high-profile
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:14.720]  and rising quickly. You're going to have disgruntled employees. But when you have a media that's
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:21.400]  complicit in spreading lies by offering money and inducements to encouragement and inducement
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  and incentive-
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:23.400]  It's criminal.
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:28.200] ...to tell wacky stories that are lies that are entirely defamatory. This is a press complicit
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.320]  in slandering their commercial opposition. There are laws against that already, but-
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.960]  Tortious interferences should be more.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:35.960]  It's flat-out racketeering.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:42.600]  Yes, it is. What the journalistic outlets are attempting to do is circumvent the law by
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:48.800]  inducing people to lie about their commercial enemies with checkbook journalism.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:54.840]  They're also trying to say credit card companies delist the NRA. People go, well, I'm not the
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.400]  NRA. I'm just a small gun shop. They're getting the lead elephant again. God Almighty, don't
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.480]  you people get it? They go in the bar. They pick the biggest six-shooter guy. If they can
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:04.840]  take him out, everybody else runs.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:05.840]  Exactly.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:06.840]  And that's why-
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.680]  It's an attack on you, folks. And that's why, you know why they haven't shut us down?
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:12.960]  Our listeners. And I'm just kissing their ass. It's true. When they call up and thank
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:17.240]  me, thank me, you're what changed America. And it began to take the country back. You
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:22.680]  standing with us and not buying all their attacks, Megyn Kelly, all the crap, you standing
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.440]  with us is the only reason we're here. And while we're trying to support other people
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:29.960]  that are under attack, because we understand we're in a war, and there are rules how to
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:35.360]  win wars. The enemy is a bunch of dirty, corrupt oppressors and occupiers. That's why they
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:38.320]  claim we're all Russians, because they're the globalists. They're the outside power
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:43.400]  coming in here to try to run America and trying to break our will. And we're the Americans.
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:48.840]  We're coming back 1776, part two. It's a real war. We're never giving in. We're going to
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:53.400]  win. We're unstoppable because this audience, no matter what happens, they kill me. You
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.000]  are the power.

[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:04.440]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:09.980]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:14.960]  and normal breathing. This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:20.680]  that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:26.200]  symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.520]  studying the effects in public trials, in their public trials. Now we are introducing
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:37.240]  the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:42.440]  of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:46.880]  help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:59.800]  pollen block available now at InfoWareStore.com or by calling toll free. Triple A 253-3139.
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:06.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:15.480]  We just got hit with another strike but they hit David's private, his own account. Total
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:21.680]  gentlemen, David Knight. The ally from the InfoWare's News Center in Austin, Texas, I'm
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:26.360]  Alex Jones and that's why we have our own video feeds, why we have our own audio feeds
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:31.160]  but behind the scenes they're trying to go to all of our big server companies including
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:37.000]  overseas and trying to shut those down. I'm not complaining okay and it's smart not to
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:42.640]  get into all their tactics for a lot of reasons. I'm just telling you this is a war people
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:50.880]  and these are authoritarians and David Knight just got hit and he's a total gentleman. I
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:54.040]  mean if you want the total gentleman smart show that's David.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:59.160]  Just like PragerU, I mean Dennis Prager is... Oh they're trying to shut him down. He's
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:07.320]  the most mild-mannered, gentle, nicely whatever guy, he's not like us, he doesn't scream and
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:11.960]  yell and have whatever. We're both out there on the edges of culture fighting like in the
[02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:16.840]  front lines. Dennis Prager is establishment of the establishment right? But dead on. Dead
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:21.320]  on but he has this PragerU thing, Prager University on YouTube with these very nicely
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:28.760]  produced, very well polished. Let's show some of it. Absolutely gentle, well judged, completely
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:33.800]  factual little videos that blow people's minds. Stuff about like... He'll show like if you
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:40.120]  don't have 2.2 people born for the parents society collapses every time or he'll show...
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:44.240]  I mean it's powerful. I'll phrase this stuff about the wage gap, big important subjects
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.320]  and YouTube has gone off to him because he's effective and because he reaches a lot of
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:52.360]  people with these videos relentlessly and they did that thing on YouTube you know where
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:56.400]  they take away your sharing options and take away comments, they take away all the virality
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:00.480]  of the video. So technically you can still post the video, technically you can still
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:05.360]  have the video online but it is hobbled, it is kneecapped, it cannot go anywhere. Which
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:11.080]  is the authoritarian tactic they know to press. It's like the Nazis in Soviet, you always
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:16.560]  start slow and get people to adapt to the oppression so that when you finally march
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:19.760]  down in a ditch to blow your head off, you go along with it.
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:25.440]  Four times out of the five steps the populace is like okay, by that time you know.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:30.600]  Alright I want to go to just genius points, we're going to get into why Dr. Pachennick
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:36.040]  was originally joining us, worried about them using sex operatives to try to compromise
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:43.560]  the president. We'll also get into just the epic media wars going on right now. Again,
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:48.080]  I don't want to be gone so journalism here, this is happening, okay. The announcement
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:55.240]  has been made by News Corp. that they met with all the tech heads, this was last week
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:58.800]  this was announced and that they are going to go ahead and in the free internet as we
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:03.960]  know it, not letting anyone have their own website that's shared on any of the big platforms.
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:07.440]  And they're already targeting all the leftists that aren't political, that have popular channels
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:11.600]  or taking them away or they're making them go under YouTube control. This is a mafia
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:18.600]  takeover. And it's so historical, it's so big, I mean this is history book stuff in
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:23.720]  how naked and brazen it is and how they even go, we're going to use Alex Jones as a test
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:28.840]  case and we're going to ban him and the left's celebrating everywhere, Alex will soon be
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:34.120]  banned everywhere and then they see it in, he said the children didn't die, which we
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:40.880]  didn't say, he said, he bullied children, he said see it in as fake town halls which
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:48.040]  they do. And now let's go to Steve Pacinic, best selling author, researcher, ran a lot
[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:52.160]  of different government operations in the State Department with the CIA and others.
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:56.120]  He's been involved in regime change of authoritarian governments. What do you make of this doc
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:01.200]  and what do you make of the point we've gotten to, does this signify they're getting their
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:04.480]  butt kicked and they're just acting confident when they're in the Wall Street Journal in
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:07.840]  the New York Times, we're just going to ban everybody and the free internet is not going
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:11.560]  to be free anymore. Used to, they would try something like that and not be real honest
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:17.520]  about it. Now it's some very bizarre psychology, but you are a psychiatrist and a lot of other
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.200]  things, Dr. Pacinic, so can you tell us what in the hell is going on here? I mean, it looks
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.440]  like a classical authoritarianism and death rose to me, but my God, if the public doesn't
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:30.120]  get upset because we're just kind of used to the censorship that's been going on, but
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:33.760]  those were five foot waves. These are 200 foot tsunamis coming in right now. I mean,
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:40.120]  this is just epic level. What do we do? First of all, let me put some things in perspective
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:45.680]  and I'm glad that Milo is there and talked about this. There is a concept within the
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:53.440]  British army called for long hope. Do you know what I'm speaking about Milo? For long
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:59.200]  hope means that in Britain, they used to use the Scottish officers of the Scottish men
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:06.480]  to go and man the embankments and be the first ones to attack the enemy. In other words,
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:12.680]  they were sacrificial lambs in many ways while the British eventually came in. In some ways,
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:17.480]  Alex Jones, the persona in the show has always been for long hope.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:20.240]  Yeah, no, we're the people that hit the bar bar.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:25.360]  Right. That's what I'm saying. Right. And what I'm trying to explain, and I want you
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:31.120]  to calm down a little bit for selfish reasons only because this is a long war. This didn't
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:34.440]  just start yesterday. This didn't just start a couple of weeks ago.
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:39.000]  Oh, Hillary was planning it. They admit this whole plan was about four years ago was hatched.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.200]  Remember, since 9 11, I've been demonetized, delegitimized. I mean, I've been through this
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:51.240]  so many times that right now Google demonetizes me, shuts me off the air. Now the question
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.920]  is, what do you want to do about it? If you act as the victim, which is what's happening
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.240]  now with all due respect, then they keep on coming after you. But when you realize that
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:07.560]  Fox or Murdoch is 88 years old and he has a problem, he can't run his institution, his
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:14.520]  sons were indicted in England. And guess who took over Fox? It was Disney. Bob Iger, I
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:20.160]  happened to know from Disney took over Fox for a $52 billion acquisition. So what does
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:26.720]  that mean? That means Fox and its subsidiaries, including National Geographic, are in terrible,
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:32.480]  terrible shape. National Geographic can no longer make videos about animals. They're
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:38.800]  making videos about what fighters in Afghanistan, other things. What I'm getting at is you change
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:48.120]  the position from being for long hope to proactive and that what you require is a kind of a strike,
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:53.800]  a strike among all of us, 11 million of us who will not go to Disney, who will not buy
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:59.560]  the Disney products, who will not buy anything to do with Disney. And what happens is at
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:05.800]  the same time, you call a strike on the cables, particularly the cable systems that are putting
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:13.120]  in CNN. You see, CNN isn't funded by audience. It's funded by a very tricky system. That
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:18.080]  means that any cable system that's put in, including your own or somebody else's or
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:25.560]  Fox and CNN, they all compile together and they get a percentage of that. If in fact,
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:26.560]  your audience or I-
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:30.760]  That's right. It's like a TV tax. It's a cable tax that you have to pay for CNN. People
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.440]  don't understand that. It's like BBC. You are paying for this slath.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:38.800]  Not the only respect in which it's like the BBC, but it's interesting how these organizations
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.960]  that cannot survive on advertisers or the goodwill of their viewers have to have these
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:48.520]  stitch-ups in the background to stay active. Milo's exactly right. So what happens is you
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:54.200]  refuse to pay the tax, you cut the wires on the cables and many of your listeners understand
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:59.400]  what I'm calling about. You short the cable system so that there is no particular audience
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:06.040]  and no cash flow. Once you hit the cash flows of Disney or the cable tax and those, now
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:11.040]  you become very effective and then you begin to understand two things.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.640]  The one, Google has a very strong relationship with the United States government. This will
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.760]  be something I will reveal to you, but it's not a great city. Good is just quiet. Google
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.560]  and the National Geospatial Agency, which is an intelligence organization, have a very
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:33.120]  close relationship. The NGA is basically an institution that was recently created in order
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:39.520]  to monitor all internet activities, not just on the first level or the second or what we
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.400]  call the three-dimension of the internet. The three-dimension of the internet means
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:48.200]  the life space of it. No, I don't get it. We got to go to break, Dr. Puccini. And by
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:52.120]  the way, when I see the whole victim thing is, we are being victimized. These are evil
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.880]  people. We have to raise the alarm and then the solution. Are you happy washing your hands
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:01.160]  with harsh chemicals? Are you happy doing laundry with detergents? Are you happy paying
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:06.320]  high prices? Find your happiness with pure soap. These all-natural, earth-friendly pure

[02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:50.160]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public,
[02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:59.800]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWars.
[02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:19.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:25.840]  One reason I've been successful is I cover a lot of news, but I also parrot key talking
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:33.480]  points that I come up with myself, not Russia or wherever, and they hate that, and they
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:36.920]  know that my talking points end up all over the place, and our guest talking points end
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.960]  up everywhere. So I'm just letting the audience know the value of InfoWars and why I have
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:45.680]  been yelling basically for three and a half hours or three hours since I've been on air
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:54.280]  because we have to understand we're dealing with hardcore scum, and if these companies
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:58.960]  would work with Communist China and others to suppress information, they'll do anything,
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.520]  and they'd rather work with the Foritarians than they'd rather be here in America. I mean,
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:08.120]  take the Murdochs, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, most of their money's offshore,
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:14.760]  and they own Fox, try to control conservatism, that doesn't work, and so like Dr. Pachennick
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:19.600]  said, you've got the carriage carrying rights and all the rest of it, where these channels
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:26.720]  that no one watches, the CNNs and stuff, are force fed, you are paying for this trash,
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:31.080]  and so you should let table companies know. In fact, I do it myself, I told my wife, I
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:36.200]  said, stop buying from Amazon, he's trying to shut us down to the Washington Post, and
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.960]  she goes, but you sell stuff on Amazon, and my wife's smart, but I said sweetheart, I
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:45.680]  said sweetheart, there's all these Chinese counterfeits of our stuff and people, if
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:50.240]  I don't have a platform on Amazon, I can't then control what's sold there, but I go,
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:58.760]  I don't promote it, I have a legal toehold there, so that I can then make sure that Amazon
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:02.960]  doesn't hurt me with the enemies, okay, and so-
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:08.320]  Well, that's how you're obliged to behave under monopoly conditions. If Amazon has
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:15.440]  a virtual monopoly, or indeed a de facto real actual monopoly, which is rapidly a
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:19.920]  acquiring in not just online sales, but now with Whole Foods and whatever, offline sales
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:25.560]  in certain product categories, you're obliged to do business with the enemy if you don't
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.560]  want to be annihilated by counterfeiters and by rival products. You have no option but
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:34.880]  to have a presence on Amazon, whose parent company's publication is dedicated to your
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.960]  destruction. That's what happens at a monopolies, that's why we have monopoly laws.
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:45.640]  Exactly, and Dr. Petitnick, I understand, you're a smart, analytical guy. I'm upset,
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:49.880]  but I'm letting the dog off the leash. It's not fake what I'm doing, but I'm letting
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:56.720]  myself be upset because this is a raping, and again, I knew it was coming, it's the
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:02.360]  whole way they do it, they say, Jones is saying no kids died and it's all completely fake,
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:05.880]  and I didn't say that. If people want to say it, that's their right to say it. Then they
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:10.080]  say, that's why we're taking them down, and then CNN says they're filing the complaints
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:14.320]  and are trying to take us down, and then they're over there trying to take David Knight's,
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:18.320]  his own YouTube channel away, and the guy's a complete gentleman, they're a bunch of criminal,
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:21.480]  frickin' lion scum, man, and I'm sick of their crap.
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  It's the same playbook, they took me off Twitter because they said that I had led a racist mob
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:30.520]  against Leslie Jones. I didn't send a single racist tweet, I didn't say a single thing.
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.280]  You said this movie's gonna flop.
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:35.520]  This movie's gonna flop, and I defended her in the movie, and then online I made a couple
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:40.160]  of jokes about the fact that she's ugly, which she is. I never said anything remotely racist.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.160]  Other people on the Internet did that, but they said that I was responsible, that I'd
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:46.640]  done it, and that I'd led a mob without providing a single piece of evidence, which is exactly
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:50.160]  what they do to you when they say you're Russia-controlled, you said this about Florida, they don't provide
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:55.280]  any evidence, any clips because they can't because you didn't. What they do is they associate
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:56.280]  you with-
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:01.720]  Half my family fought the damn Russians during the Cold War. It's a load of crap.
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.640]  Yeah, they associate you with genuinely unsavory characters, which is why Richard Spencer's
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:09.760]  name appears next to mine in every news report, because they want to suggest that I'm the
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:12.240]  same as him, and they do the same things with you.
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:15.480]  Yeah, because you guys, you don't really look the same, but I think people are so dumb.
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.360]  Oh, they do that all the time. Dr. Pachennick, you ran psychological operations at the State
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:25.120]  Department, you're a famous guy. I mean, like I said, one time we were gonna have a guy
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.280]  from the right stuff on Chuck Yeager, and people are asking, who's Chuck Yeager? I mean,
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:32.120]  it's like, people don't know who famous people are, they've done stuff for our country, and
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:35.200]  you know, interesting how much, saying, Stu Pachennick's Chuck Yeager is not that cool,
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:40.320]  but he's done a lot of cool stuff. But I mean, does it not freak you out to see that we're
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:46.200]  like becoming, this is like Soviet Union crap, and these people are like, it's like, it's
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:50.000]  a clear and present danger. Trump needs to move against them. He needs to break up these
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.280]  monopolies. Instead, he's got Rupert Murdoch, reportedly, has basically crawled up his rear
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:56.280]  end.
[02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:01.920]  All right, well, let's go back to a couple of years. We were talking about the end of
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:08.280]  the newspapers for a long time. This was for years on coming. We saw the New York Times
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.800]  streaming, we saw the Fox News streaming, we saw CNN.
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:15.760]  Yeah, but they're trying to take us down with them.
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.960]  I understand. The key that has to be turned around is number one, you've got to pick the
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:27.360]  points which are vulnerable. As I just told you, Disney took over Fox. That was a big
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:32.640]  mistake for Murdoch because Murdoch needed the money. He can't run it anymore. His son,
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:37.320]  who was compromised in England, is now the head of it. But by Beiger and understands,
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:42.920]  if you refuse to buy Disney products, refuse to go to the Disney movies, refuse to go to
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:48.520]  the Disney channel, the children don't listen to Disney, and all of this counterpunching
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:55.040]  occurs very specifically. In war, you always have to find the center of gravity. The center
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.480]  of gravity right now is Disney, which is highly vulnerable. The reason I know it's
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:06.440]  vulnerable because ESPN went into the toilet. I know Bob Beiger very well. Tom Clancy and
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:11.800]  I had problems with him. We know he is not the brightest guy in the world. We know he's
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:15.600]  desperate, and we know Disney is spinning out of control.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:20.600]  So you look at Disney, and you taste thought to tell your audience, don't buy the Disney
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:26.640]  products. Then we shift over to the cable news system and the cable tax. And then form
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:30.600]  your audience that you no longer want to be in the cable business. So what are people
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:35.920]  doing? They're literally cutting the cables to say, we're not watching this anymore. And
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:36.920]  if you have 10...
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:40.880]  And everything else is plunging. The NFL, the Oscars, they're now saying, oh, don't be
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:44.160]  political. But they, exactly. So here's what I'm saying. Here's what I want the audience
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:49.160]  to understand. This isn't about info wars. They admit we've been chosen as the test case.
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:55.040]  They're going to try to block everybody now from a local florist to a rock band, to a
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:01.200]  hip hop group, to a preacher, to an author, you know, a former spy chief like yourself,
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:06.280]  stuff like that. I mean, this is a total culture takeover of the internet. And no one even
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:11.040]  recognizes it because they've got the left to think, oh, we're going to take out Milo
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:16.960]  and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge. And no, they think we're so stupid. They write battle plans
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:21.080]  in the Wall Street Journal, how they're going to take everything over. And they put on screen.
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:29.680]  I'm a former KKK leader on CNN. I protest the KKK. This is the level of their crap. And
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:33.760]  they don't want me to be able to respond. So all the reason I'm freaking out is it's
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.520]  this huge brazen announcement and they're doing it. And they've already put these strikes.
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:40.960]  They're taking our channels down. I guess as we, as we speak, I just want people to
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:45.760]  know this is the most serious yet. They've been testing the perch for a long time. This
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:51.000]  is the main assault, Dr. Pachennick. And people have to know they're coming after everything.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.280]  This is outrageous, Dr.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:59.360]  The key to this is also look, you pull back and you've got to calm down a little bit.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  What they want from you is exactly the response that you're giving them. They want you to
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:09.600]  get so upset that they're getting joy and delight from something that really has no
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.480]  meaning whatsoever in terms of the real bottom dollar.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:15.840]  They're already dead. They've already fallen. They're already a joke. They're trying to
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.360]  pull us into the crypt with them.
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:25.800]  Well, that's exactly it. You have a very viable product line. Your liquidity is going up.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:32.080]  You're going out to incorporate and have a worldwide dissemination of news. Let me assure
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:37.000]  you, there are people within the system that will not allow you to go under. As simple
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:43.280]  as that, you have been in a very effective outlet for many of us within the government
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:48.720]  or whatever you want to call it. That has been fighting the alternative deep state.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:55.240]  You will not go under. I can assure you for the same reason that Google is tied in, hip
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:00.880]  and neck, to the National Geospatial Agency. They cannot get away from that in the same
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:07.920]  way that Bezos is tied in, which is CIA with hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts.
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:15.320]  Bezos knows that. Amazon can fall very quickly. That's what the issue becomes. They're afraid
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:17.040]  because they're vulnerable.
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:23.040]  You're not part of the entourage. As Milo said, you and I and he, we're not part of
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:29.760]  any of us. We have been the black swan for over 12 to 17 years, but you've survived.
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:35.680]  Me and him will not survive. Fox News will not survive because Roger Ailes left. I knew
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:41.800]  Roger when we worked together. In short, what's happening is you have to allow the animals
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:47.320]  to die and let them scream as they're screaming as you're building up your network all over
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:48.320]  the world.
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:52.800]  That's what Milo said is that they're a dying animal. We'll be right back and get Milo's
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:55.640]  take on that.
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.120]  The Full Wars Wipe is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found an extraordinary
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:05.360]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:10.680]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing. This
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.680]  is pollen block.
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:17.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:23.040]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:29.520]  and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects in their public trials.
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:35.640]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:40.440]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:45.440]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:51.440]  with fast-acting pollen block available now at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free.
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:44:02.280]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:09.440]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill,
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:14.600]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:15.600]  beyond that.
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:21.840]  And frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:28.480]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.440]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers. Non-GMO made right
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:39.880]  here in America 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:44.640]  is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:52.720]  in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:54.800]  fuzz the operation.
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:02.240]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by infowarslife.
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:07.400]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same. Fluorolife
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.160]  probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:17.760]  directly into the intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:22.280]  most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:26.800]  your gut health and your wallet. Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.680]  it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism. Did
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.760]  you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why. Increasing
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:41.840]  gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health. Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:46.720]  probiotic for everyday maintenance care, and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.840]  gut restoration program. Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:53.840]  today. That's infowarslife.com.
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:46:00.120]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:05.120]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:10.560]  I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:15.240]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars. It might seem
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:20.280]  like a simple thing, but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:25.880]  right now are absolutely amazing. Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the Don't Tread
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:30.800]  on Me, but said it says Won't Tread on Me, and it's a big Deglo snake, Gadsden snake,
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:34.800]  and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on the right arm. I mean, that's a great way
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.280]  just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech. And
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:45.920]  the newest one is Trigger Warning t-shirt. Trigger Warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:51.520]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back. That is the new shirt of the
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.680]  mind available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:25.640]  I'm going to find me a reckless woman, raise her blades and die, Skinner. I'm gonna steal
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:30.480]  me a silver stallion. But before I find a reckless woman, I got to steal me a silver
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:35.560]  stallion. You know, the thing is, I'll tell you a little secret here, and I'll go back
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:40.040]  to Pachennic in a year because I'm ranting. I thought about not doing the show 10 years
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.800]  ago because I wasn't trying to expand. I just wanted to be a talk show host that exposed
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:48.640]  globalism and thought other people would stand up and other smart people would take action,
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:53.200]  which has happened. And then they just mess with me so hard and try to destroy me. I said,
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:57.640]  well, I'm going to get really big in their face. And now I could never quit because they
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:01.640]  wouldn't just let me go into abstention or you. They're going to just lie and lie and
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:08.120]  never stop. I don't know how they found so many petty people who have a hard on specifically
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.360]  for America, for free market, and for just being decent and telling the truth. I mean,
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:18.040]  I don't know. What's wrong with them, Milo?
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:23.040]  There's something weird about every major CNN host. I don't know where they grow these
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:29.360]  people, but it just, I just get that sort of like, I get the ick. You know, when you
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:32.240]  just, you're like, when you're dating and somebody does something really disgusting
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:35.560]  and suddenly you can never see them sexually again. Or when you see somebody on television
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:40.080]  and they just make you shudder and cringe and you get that sort of flash of disgust and
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:41.080]  fear and horror.
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:47.680]  Yeah. Why doesn't Brian Stelter know and he, he, he releases these photos. There's a bunch
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:53.280]  of, I found that for, there's new ones to type in Brian Stelter. Let me just, there's
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:59.240]  one where he doesn't type it. He looks like it, the clown. I mean, he doesn't know that
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:05.840]  that is like, I am a full-born maniac, the dancing clown and there's, and there's clowns
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:12.200]  in the popcorn down here. And you look at it. You're on the balloon. The thing is, he
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:17.440]  releases these photos himself. This is official photos. He looks like that.
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:18.440]  On purpose.
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:23.480]  Seriously, Dr. Pachennick, you're a psychiatrist, but you can, you know somebody when they've
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:29.720]  got that lunatic, nars, whatever the face is, it's like a, I mean, if I saw a star and
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:36.360]  they're like, I'd be like, get my firearm. I mean, you know, it's like, I'm a total
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:49.000]  saint of that. Brian Stelter, I'm Brian Stelter.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  Stop it.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  CNN likes you.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.720]  Stop it. Well, that's the thing. That smile is, I'm not really showing you this, but
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:56.720]  that's what I really want.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:01.880]  What I really do, Stelter, son of a bitch. Sorry.
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.120]  Rank your three spookiest CNN hosts. Who's number one?
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:06.120]  Stelter.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  Cooper.
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  Three.
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:11.560]  Como, just cause he's a knuckle dragon, fuck. I love to see you.
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:18.200]  Not a bad, not a bad list. Don't, don't, don't let me, I'm going to go back to, as a psychiatrist,
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:22.720]  that look on Stelter's face that he does everywhere says, I'm invincible. I'm in a lunatic power
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:30.840]  trip. I mean, I know, I'm not supposed to, we have the, what's the rule that goes back
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:35.240]  to goldwater? I'm supposed to diagnose somebody from afar, but looking at Stelter, what do
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:36.240]  you make of him?
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:37.240]  His behavior?
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:41.960]  He's not relevant. I mean, people who are dangerous, he's not relevant. He looks like
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:45.920]  a serial killer. Yeah, you can put his face on a horror movie package.
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:50.440]  It's all due respect. I've had a whole ward of serial killers. They're usually pretty
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.440]  quiet.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:52.440]  I know, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:53.440]  He doesn't say anything.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:54.440]  He's not helping people up.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:55.440]  I don't know. Sometimes.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:09.120]  Again, the Stony, the Sandy Hook and this Parkland, they're all false facts. And what
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:15.840]  you're looking at is the nonsense of the vestiges of the press trying to be relevant
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:21.160]  as well as the FBI and a, and a crooked, what you're really looking at is this ghost dance
[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:22.160]  go on then.
[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:28.480]  Well, the ghost dance goes on as long as the collusion between the state and the federal
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:33.480]  and the local individuals who want money is going to continue. And I don't think that's
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:40.000]  going to be very long because what's happening in effect is that they've focused away. The
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:45.280]  entire news spectrum has focused away from the real issues and pending war in the Middle
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:52.120]  States. I've got an internal disruption in the White House where someone may be leaving,
[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:56.640]  like McMaster, go to Fort Benning. There may be a problem of John Kelly leaving. So you've
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:03.320]  got all this distraction, intentional or unintentional going on, but you are becoming more and more
[02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:04.320]  relevant.
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:09.920]  So as Milo, let me ask you this very question. When would a Milo have come onto an Alex Jones
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:14.160]  show 17 years ago? Think of how much progress has been made.
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:17.320]  Now I know you're being positive. I'm just saying, without the audience,
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:25.280]  I'm talking about such a paradigm shift in this country that a certain individual is
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:30.680]  bright as Milo with his own background, with a British background, and Paul Watson can
[02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:36.900]  come on an American show and articulate very clearly what we Americans want in the heart
[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:44.520]  land. You're not talking about Harvard. You're not talking about Berkeley. Yeah, right. You're
[02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:47.400]  talking about Texas and Austin. Now you can go around and that's what we call the heath
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:50.000]  of phrenics, it's a phrenic, but they are not the teachers.
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:55.440]  That's what I'm asking. Looking at that face filter always makes, I've noticed lunatics
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:53:01.440]  like who are delusional, like they make that face. I know some crazy people and they make
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:02.440]  that face.
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:06.480]  They walk around like that constantly. We have a name for it. It's like, you know what?
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:13.480]  That's not even the bad ones, guys. Get going, Dr. Milo, you host for a minute. I gotta go
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:18.640]  find the right photo. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll be back in two minutes.
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:22.480]  We will be putting no more. Dr. Pritchett, I want to get into sex operatives in the
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  president. Start telling us about that. Fine. Go ahead, Dr.
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:29.160]  What did he say Milo? I'm sorry.
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:33.280]  Sex operatives and the president. He'd like your view on that.
[02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:42.200]  I don't think there are many sex operatives in the president. The president had a hiss.
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:47.880]  It's an easy way, isn't it, to get at Trump by spreading around stories of his dalliances
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:53.080]  because it's so eminently believable. I know, but it's so irrelevant, Milo, as you would
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:54.080]  know.
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:57.960]  Well, none of his fans care. Would a single person who voted for Donald Trump give us stuff
[02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:01.920]  that he'd been in the Beverly Hills Hotel with a model? No, they'd say, go Donald.
[02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:06.320]  That's exactly it. That's his person of life. We're not interested. What we are interested
[02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:10.800]  is, number one, why is there an effective infrastructure deal? Number two, what are
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:15.440]  you going to do about the fact that DB is going to be indicted and we don't need a war
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:21.600]  in the Middle East and Iran has already taken over Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, and we're
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:27.000]  going to have a two-front war, which we have to decide very quickly as McMasters being
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:31.400]  thrown out of the White House and John Kelly may be thrown out of the White House. So those
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:36.360]  are the things, Milo, that we really have to think about quickly because the mainstream
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:40.600]  media doesn't give a damn they don't understand it. You understand it, Milo. You come from
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:45.040]  a background where you understand it. You come from a country that's been attacked.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:49.960]  This country has never had the hardships that England had to endure. Not only before World
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:55.200]  War II, the World War I, World War II, you lost over 3 million of your men in the first
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:55:03.120]  90 days of World War I. Americans have no concept what that means. And if it's true,
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:08.800]  17 kids died and I doubt that. How do you compare that with 69,000 kids who are dying
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:15.320]  on heroin every day? We are having thousands dying on heroin. How do you compare that with
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:16.320]  the fact that...
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:19.880]  Are there 70-plus veterans that commit suicide? I think mass shootings happen. They misrepresent
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:23.200]  what I say. I know they do the fake baby incubator stuff, so those go things going.
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:28.360]  All I know is they're de-platforming us saying, I said that, not my guess, and doing it. And
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:29.720]  that is very dangerous to free speech.
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:36.360]  Alex, you can incriminate me because I went to the Harvard Supervisor, so Paul Train,
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:42.120]  the Harvard psychiatrist who did that phony profile, Adam Lanza, and they admitted it was
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:47.600]  phony. The guy trained behind me at Harvard. And that area, Mass Mandel, is gone. And Yale
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:53.160]  Medical School is in trouble. They were the same ones who said that Trump was crazy. And
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:57.560]  we warned them. If you continue, you're going to get lawsuits. So in effect, what you're
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:02.640]  doing, step back a little bit. Milo understands that I want you to... You're much more effective
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:07.960]  when we attack specific targets. Right now, the specific target is the White House. It's
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:09.680]  in turmoil. We don't see it.
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:12.840]  Well, let's come back and talk about that and get your take and Milo's take. Because
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:17.160]  it was Roger Stone said six months ago, McMaster's in trouble and all this other stuff. So he's
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:21.840]  been dead on about that. You talk about the turmoil from your information. I mean, how
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:26.200]  do you think Trump's doing? Or what's your word on them? We'll come back and get the
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  Chenix take on that.
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:32.720]  It seems to be a state of perpetual crisis in there, doesn't it? It's sort of united
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:37.320]  only by the transcendent iron will of one man who is singularly responsible for the
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:41.000]  train's wheels keeping on turning. But everything else around him sees...
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:42.520]  The Trumpian juggernaut.
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:48.240]  Right, indeed. Otherwise, it seems to be a state of sort of perpetual fear, crisis,
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:55.600]  and paralysis. But, I mean, I come from the... I come from the... Stop it.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:59.680]  I'm Brian Seltter. I'm Brian Seltter. I see it in the corner.
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:03.400]  I come from the point of view that the less the government does, the better. So a White
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.720]  House which doesn't get us into any more wars and doesn't pass any new legislations,
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:07.720]  all right by me.
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:10.240]  Where do you think the winder goes on here? As long as it's back?
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:11.720]  Do you really want to wind up other...
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:14.800]  Yes, so that when somebody's... Actually, I can't say that because we go out to radio
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.320]  stations, but I just think you could be wound up at the same time as getting... Never mind.
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:21.240]  All right, we're going to go to break out briefly. They're trying to shut us down. We're
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:25.200]  under total attack. We've got great supplements. I never hear about the new specials this week.
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:28.640]  So we've got all the 50% off, basically, all the top selling products. It's about to
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:34.080]  happen in volwarstore.com. If you find us, we can continue. If not, Brian Seltter will
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:35.080]  win.
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:39.560]  Buy lots of products. Brian Seltter is going to have his way with you.
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:46.560]  I don't know what will.
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.160]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling? Go ahead.
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:56.160]  Yes, by Alex first. I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:01.680]  will be ordering all the time. I've ordered several of the products over and over because
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:06.240]  it's amazing. In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:12.520]  sick, maybe a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet. I'll still feel
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:17.400]  a little sick, but it won't last as long. I just ordered the body, the alpha power and
[02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  the pollen block.
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:22.480]  Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then fund the whole operation
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:26.120]  because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:30.720]  them buy a lot of the products. So thank you. But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal
[02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:35.960]  silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review. It is our highest reviewed product
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:40.000]  because it is from the top lab in the country. Discounted high quality colloidal silver.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:46.480]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[02:58:46.480 --> 02:58:50.800]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com, but instead
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:55.080]  of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:58:59.600]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:03.880]  know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick. Again, in every culture, this
[02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:10.600]  has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is. But
[02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:17.120]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life
[02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:22.840]  force that is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints,
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:26.320]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:33.400]  for energy, this ladies and gentlemen is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:39.040]  out there and it's amazing. Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what it can do
[02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:43.160]  for your family. And again, I want to thank you all for your support. You are funding
[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:50.160]  the Information War in 2018.
[02:59:50.160 --> 03:00:18.160]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:18.160 --> 03:00:24.280]  Just before you take the pills, you put this on and drift away into the eternal sleep.
[03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:27.680]  You know, I know a lot of you on Facebook, you know, there was almost a military coup
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:33.680]  against Obama and they killed a lot of people that were looking into it. This country's
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:39.320]  in a lot of deep crap. So we sit here and we see all this going on and I just hope
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:43.520]  the public, while we joke around, I do it too. Audience can smell when I joke around,
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:48.520]  but you know, I'm going to go crazy if I don't joke around because this is hardcore crap
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:54.880]  and Dr. Pachennick, I really appreciate you coming on with us. I am worried too about
[03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.960]  Trump and sex operatives because you know, red-button American, his wife's beautiful,
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:04.400]  wonderful. Obviously, she's quite the, let's just say if she was a car, she's not street
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:13.800]  legal. So the point is, the point is, the point is, is that they're trying to destroy
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.960]  our great president and you're right, there's a bunch of weasels in the henhouse there and
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:23.600]  we just hope Papa Wolf can deal with them. But seriously, what's the intel on Trump
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:28.280]  right now and the sex operative stuff? Because I am worried about that, you know.
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:33.880]  What he's worried about is, my look correctly said, nobody cares whether he had sex or
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:36.560]  is having sex. That's not even relevant to his president.
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:39.560]  It better be. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:44.320]  The only good thing Bill Clinton ever did was with that cigar. I mean, you're going
[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:45.320]  to be president.
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:49.040]  Stop, stop. I apologize. It's a Christian show. Go ahead. Dr. Pachennick, sorry.
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.800]  With all due respect, I think the real issue right now is, there's a lot of pressure going
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:00.400]  on internally, as Milo said, and that is McMaster will probably have to leave and hopefully
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:06.760]  they'll bring him into Fort Bragg or make his active duty command status enhanced or
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:11.600]  allow him to go somewhere else. At the same time, what we cannot afford, and that's a
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:17.120]  serious consideration, and that is John Kelly leaving. We cannot afford to have a military
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:18.120]  general.
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:23.480]  You were right. That was a sophisticated sign up against Kelly that I was buying into when
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:26.040]  you straighten me out. It turns out he's been really good.
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:31.360]  He has been phenomenal, and it wasn't something I tried to sell. It was something I was just
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:32.360]  trying to sell.
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:35.760]  No, no, I make mistakes. When I'm wrong, I'm going to admit it. It turns out Kelly, because
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:38.560]  I'm not used to having access to the White House, so I don't get involved in all the
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:45.120]  fights when they have the access, and this is so much intramural BS that goes on there.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:50.720]  Well, what happens is, the person who has to go, and I've said it from day one, and
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:55.040]  I've said two things, and this is why your show is more important than you realize. It's
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:56.840]  very prescient.
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:01.760]  Number one, the person who has to go from day one, I said, is the Orthodox Jew, Jared
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  Kushner.
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:07.480]  And you said he's on the Chinese payroll, and now Mueller's saying, oh, not Russia,
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:11.160]  China, which is off his mandate, but you called it a year and a half ago.
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:17.280]  Right. And I said that he has to go because he has a criminal offense against him. He
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:25.000]  knows he's received two loans from Bank Lummi in Israel and a major Israeli insurance company
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:32.200]  plus he's on the ropes for 1.9 billion with the Chinese. The Chinese just threw out the
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:37.600]  company and bang, and they took it over directly and sure. This is a criminal who's in the
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:44.320]  White House who has been incompetent, duplicitous, and totally dysfunctional. At the same time,
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:50.320]  we've had the civilian military conflict, which is unnecessary. He cannot have a security
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:56.520]  clearance. We have a man who's literally absorbed all of the petty fights and continues to stay
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:02.960]  in there, John Kelly, simply because he serves our country. And so it is with General Nims,
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:04.960]  and so it is with other generals.
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:10.720]  We will try to put in some other people, like Vodal or Pompeo, whose director of the CIA
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:16.600]  was number one at West Point, number one at Harvard Law. And we need this in the White
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:22.680]  House. Otherwise, we cannot exist on a second-by-second as it is.
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:27.280]  And it is true that McMaster, we've confirmed this. We broke it and it came out later. He
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:33.080]  just gets drunk and just shoots his mouth off like he's got a 70 IQ or something. So
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:34.080]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:39.840]  On a list, you're correct. But from the day one, we had a problem with him, but we knew
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:44.320]  we had to move him out because of dereliction of duty. What we were waiting for was the
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:49.800]  temperance, the amount of time that was required to have Kelly stabilize the White House, and
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:54.440]  at the same time see what happened to Porter and Landasty, plus that was...
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:59.360]  Fill your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life. Digestive
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:03.800]  enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:08.400]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent discomfort
[03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:12.720]  from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut. Digestive
[03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:16.840]  enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those
[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:22.280]  naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:26.840]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:31.320]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:36.320]  helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your
[03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:37.840]  muscles.
[03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:42.320]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you
[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:47.680]  can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by Infowars

[03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:18.040]  On the front lines of the Information War is Alex Jones.
[03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:23.440]  Well I tell you, Metallica knows how to say it, out of my way. Satan, get behind me. See
[03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:25.900]  it in. Behind me.
[03:06:25.900 --> 03:06:27.320]  You're repeating yourself.
[03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:33.480]  Milo, you've been a real champ sitting here while I freak out. I can't handle it anymore.
[03:06:33.480 --> 03:06:38.360]  This is the best seat in the house. I get to see it first hand. I get up close and personal.
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:40.680]  I don't have to watch it on TV. You kidding?
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:48.600]  Well reading this CNN thing, they say that I say no one died and that I bullied children.
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:55.680]  And these are, meanwhile, hand-picked, anti-gun zealots in the acting class. All this stuff.
[03:06:55.680 --> 03:07:00.680]  Spewing this, and then they're in a political world, and then they misrepresent what I've
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:05.880]  said, don't show it, and then are banning us on YouTube. Infowars is two strikes away
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:11.040]  from being banned from YouTube. Well they just did two more. So I guess we're going
[03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:16.200]  to get the word in one channel with billions and billions and billions of views, and all
[03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:24.600]  that work, and all those archives, and all those interviews, gone, and hat the conservatives
[03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:28.800]  out there like, good, stop taking over the whole Internet. Alex will be more room for
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:32.720]  us not having no idea the shark has just took a bite out of me. Now it's going to come
[03:07:32.720 --> 03:07:33.720]  and eat them.
[03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:38.280]  The two mistakes that conservatives are making, one is that if they take you out, there'll
[03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.200]  be more space for them. What they don't realize is that's literally not how an attention
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:44.640]  economy works. It's not how any economy works. You make the market bigger by being the leader
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:47.000]  and you're a huge, and there's still plenty of space to do.
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:50.320]  Elvis made rock and roll bigger. Led Zeppelin made rock and roll bigger, not smaller.
[03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:51.640]  Exactly. It's not like you're the-
[03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:54.880]  Rock and Roll's dying because the music industry's killing it because the CIA decided to kill
[03:07:54.880 --> 03:07:55.880]  it.
[03:07:55.880 --> 03:08:00.480]  You're not the only thing in town. It's not like you're the only thing on television and
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:04.760]  there's no room for anybody else. There are 100, 200 million Americans out there who don't
[03:08:04.760 --> 03:08:07.640]  have anything quite right to listen to because they either don't know about you yet or you're
[03:08:07.640 --> 03:08:12.440]  not to their taste or whatever. But there is a gigantic market for regular high quality
[03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:16.240]  conservative programming. If they're more successful, you are, the more opportunities
[03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:20.400]  there are for a Breitbart TV, for a Daily Caller TV, all of this comes with increased
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:23.240]  success at any of the people in the movement. They make the same mistake about you as they
[03:08:23.240 --> 03:08:27.320]  do about me. Take them out and maybe I'll get my shot. No. The stronger we are, the more
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:28.320]  likelihood that the-
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:32.160]  Exactly. And they don't get that it's a non-zero-sum game.
[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:35.800]  Exactly. And the other thing that they don't understand is, as you say, and as we discussed
[03:08:35.800 --> 03:08:40.740]  earlier in the show, they believe that there's a sort of cutoff point, that there's a dotted
[03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:45.160]  line beyond which they can throw people to the wolves because, well, the leftists sort
[03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:48.640]  of write about them. They are a bit crazy. They are a bit edgy. They do go over the top.
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:51.640]  They don't have bow ties and nice manners and they don't shop to their dinner parties.
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:56.200]  So we'll let them go as a stop to the left, as a cost of doing business, because we don't
[03:08:56.200 --> 03:08:59.480]  really like them anyway because they're more popular than we are. And then the left will
[03:08:59.480 --> 03:09:03.040]  stop at a certain point. The left will not stop at a certain point. The left will come
[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:06.520]  for you next and you will be the ones that, you know, next it will be Breitbart, then
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:11.280]  it will be whatever, whatever. And then all the way down the bottom of the food chain,
[03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:16.960]  the unread, unloved, but establishment-friendly, weekly standard and national review, they'll
[03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:21.320]  go last. And the left will be licking their lips while they take them. And all because
[03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:22.320]  these people didn't.
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:24.120]  They'll be on their knees with no one else to help them.
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:30.800]  And you do not have to believe or agree with any of what we say. You just have to have
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:34.960]  a brain and realize that free speech is an absolute. You either stick up for it or you
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:39.840]  don't. And as soon as your values are compromised and you allow people who believe most of the
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:44.040]  same stuff you do and who are effective at spreading those messages to a different audience
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:48.360]  from yours. If you allow people who are allies, whether you like to call them allies or not,
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:51.960]  to glue our allies in the service and the defense of freedom to fall, you will fall
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:52.960]  next.
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:10:00.680]  And that's common sense historically as well. But, I mean, take this. Dr. Pachennick ran
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:05.800]  the camp, David Accord, the only good Middle East peace still ever. He ran overthrows of
[03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:12.040]  governments. I mean, he gets called into federal court for, you know, serious stuff he's been
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:16.960]  involved in. So when he starts saying, this is fake, that's fake. I mean, look, they said
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:21.080]  that they were throwing babies out of incubators. It's made up. The point is, is that Norat stood
[03:10:21.080 --> 03:10:25.200]  down on 9-11. I mean, we all know this, the 28 pages proves everything we said. The point
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:28.680]  is, is that Trump reportedly straight shooting, trying to end all that. But he's got all these
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:33.520]  agencies under him trying to run Bay of Pigs operations to embarrassing. I mean, it's a
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:38.400]  nightmare situation trying to clean this country up. And we've kind of pushed the globalist
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:44.040]  out into the light to admit who they are now. And so that's a great positive. So I agree
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:51.040]  with Pachennick that, that we are moving into positive waters compared to where we were.
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:59.080]  But still, when you know the anatomy of the fraud, and you know, these people are scum.
[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:04.840]  It's like, you talk about the gross thing a girlfriend does, or your case, a boyfriend
[03:11:04.840 --> 03:11:09.280]  or something, and then it's just something clicks and builds up and you're dumb. This
[03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:14.960]  is like 10 trillion times that. I, I get triggering now as I get older, I get more OCD. I didn't
[03:11:14.960 --> 03:11:20.800]  used to be, I can't look at Brian Skelton's. I can't, I don't watch these Kepler shows
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:25.080]  and tackles every night. And I don't watch these shows and tackles. I can't do it. Don't
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:29.480]  you know Homeland's all about you? And they admit it. And I don't give a damn about, hey,
[03:11:29.480 --> 03:11:33.360]  X-Files episodes about you. I don't watch it. I mean, because I'm sick of looking at
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:38.400]  this ugly head. The point is that, but if you think I'm sick of looking at me, man, I'm
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:41.720]  really sick of these people. I want them out of my life.
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:44.400]  You should watch the X-Files. It's a very flattering portrayal. He ends up being a good
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:46.280]  guy. That's what I heard.
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:50.920]  Look, he's, he's handsome. He's wealthy. Scully's got kind of a thing for him and he's proven
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:54.240]  right in the end. I think Chris Carter's got your back on that.
[03:11:54.240 --> 03:11:57.040]  No, Chris Carter says he's a listener and says I'm not a racist. He's snowy. He has
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:02.600]  a lot of courage. I'm not talking about myself. I'm saying the bizarreness of this huge war
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:08.120]  to misrepresent what we are. And then I can't even have a platform to respond. Like you
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:14.200]  said, is, is cultural rape of the truth? And then I wonder, what's the end game? Cause
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:17.800]  I know I'm not that important. They actually thought I was weak. That's what they thought
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:21.240]  Trump was weak. And that's why Hillary was like, Oh, actually give Trump the coverage.
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:26.760]  Cause I'll beat him easier and it backfired. They thought like, Oh, look, Trump likes Jones.
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:31.840]  That gave him Bonafides. They didn't even, they don't, but the Chenix, right. They don't
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:37.040]  know what they're doing. It doesn't make it any less scary that you've got Cuomo going,
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:43.520]  I'm allowed to read WikiLeaks at CNN. You'll be arrested. He doesn't even know how insane
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.940]  he sounds. So what I'm saying is they're in power. They've got the money. They are crazy.
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:53.960]  They are in F, but what do we do? Dr. Pachinic, what do we do?
[03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:59.920]  I mean, in defense of the CIA and wrecked rock and roll, remember Julius Copeland was in
[03:12:59.920 --> 03:13:03.560]  police and that was the son of the deputy director.
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:09.120]  I know the CIA helped launch rock and roll and then use, and then that was seen as, as
[03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:11.800]  to empowering. So they went with hip hop in the nineties. I've been with people that have
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:14.900]  been in the meetings. I know you were involved in some of that. You want to talk about class
[03:13:14.900 --> 03:13:19.440]  of, let's talk about government control of music. Go ahead and say something right now.
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:25.880]  Right now, while you're talking, general Kelly is going to make a decision within seconds
[03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:30.640]  of minutes of this show. Either he's going to allow Jared Kushner to stay in or he's
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:36.000]  going to throw him out. My bet is he's going to throw him out. Once Jared Kushner goes,
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:42.040]  we have another sequence of turmoil, but more importantly, if you look at the Google and
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:48.400]  let your people show it, the vulnerability of Google is huge. As I said to you, so was
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:54.160]  Fox when Disney took it over. What you have are vulnerable enemies trying to take you
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:56.960]  over because they can't defend themselves.
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:59.960]  No, no, no, I know they're coming after us cause we're kicking their ass up and down
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:00.960]  the street.
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:05.360]  They don't have the capability now. Google is literally has problems with its cloud,
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:10.880]  the Gmail, with everything internally. If you just say to anonymous, come on in and
[03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:14.080]  help us out and attack Google. Watch what happens.
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:18.840]  All right, then I'll say it. I'm not perfect, but we're under attack and whatever happens
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:25.200]  to us is fine, but I want anonymous to attack every, all the globalist. I want CNN, anonymous
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:31.720]  attack, legally lawful, of course, go after these anti free speech monsters and dogs of
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:40.000]  war peacefully and lovingly, non-violently anonymous. Help me. Help me. I'm weak. I told
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:57.600]  you that you're not taking over. We've lost him. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones has been
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:10.480]  retired to a padded room.
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:17.680]  Alex, thanks for just something very simple. The amount of energy that you have not only
[03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:24.360]  in one show, but in shows that you've done for 17 continuous years. I want to see anybody
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:29.240]  on CNN collectively have that kind of energy that you exude in seven years.
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:32.960]  Well, you're nice, but they're scripted vampires. Let's fit. Dr. Pichett, you're awesome. Come
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:36.160]  back with us on the Sunday show, Monday show. You're wonderful. We'll come back and finish
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:43.760]  up with Milo, but the very positive transmission. Thank you, CNN. Thank you, CNN, from Russia.

[03:19:57.920 --> 03:20:17.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:17.400 --> 03:20:37.200]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide. I was just listening to some of
[03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:41.520]  the clips of Trumpet CPAC. I was going to be playing these today. I was going to be
[03:20:41.520 --> 03:20:47.460]  all this amazing news to cover and Milo's here. Perfect plans. And then, yeah, the best
[03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:52.480]  laid plans of mice and men often go astray. And then it's CNN. CNN, we're trying to get
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:59.360]  Alex Jones banned on YouTube. He says no kids died in this video. And then the videos banned
[03:20:59.360 --> 03:21:05.920]  and I didn't say that. It's, it's, it's, it's, do you think I'm over? See, I made a big deal
[03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:10.120]  about when you got banned on Twitter. They're like, oh, big deal. Screw that guy, that flamboyant
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:15.440]  son of a bitch. You know, what the hell man? They just banned him for saying he didn't like
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:22.000]  the Ghostbusters movie. That is super un-American. That is dangerous as hell. Excuse me.
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:28.480]  Well, it's, it's an example of the tech companies and media companies linking up and coordinating
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:32.320]  in full force to take out the people they consider the most dangerous to them. So Twitter,
[03:21:32.320 --> 03:21:36.800]  which has notoriously opaque policies will selectively enforce. And the left says they
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:41.320]  own gay people. So you're a good looking, smart, gay, libertarian type guy. And they
[03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:43.800]  were threatened when you were getting your average video, 10 million views. So they've
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:48.240]  been trying to destroy him, which makes you a hero. Some of my listeners are super conservative
[03:21:48.240 --> 03:21:52.960]  and I get I'm conservative, but I understand I empathize and I'm not like a Pharisee. Okay.
[03:21:52.960 --> 03:22:00.160]  And so, but, but I mean, you getting back down, you, you were patient zero for the destruction
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:03.360]  of free space, man. If people don't support you, they're idiots.
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:09.480]  Well, thank you. But, you know, what these technology companies will do is apply their
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:14.560]  own rules selectively, only to punish conservatives. And then the media can use something Twitter
[03:22:14.560 --> 03:22:20.480]  said about you, like we banned him for targeted harassment to then accuse you of being a harasser.
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:24.080]  Well, no evidence was ever provided that you harassed anybody. It was just that Twitter
[03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:29.520]  banned you and gave a reason. And CNN says I said no kids died, which is horsemaner.
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:33.640]  Well, that's an extra layer. That's an extra step. The extra step, you know, social networks
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:39.680]  will enforce some bizarre, ill-defined rule and ever after you have been branded a harasser.
[03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:44.960]  And again, and the member journalism where they show what you said, a quote, no quote,
[03:22:44.960 --> 03:22:49.160]  no video, no video. There's a secret video that has disappeared and he said it and he's
[03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:52.720]  gone. The video is not there anymore and you can't see it and we're not showing it to you.
[03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:57.240]  But trust us what it said, you know, no. And there's a thing. I should be able to say that
[03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:03.520]  if I wanted to. There's courts and lawsuits. But I didn't. I don't think that. Even if
[03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:08.000]  you'd said it, who cares? The person who has to stand up for that, the person who has to
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:11.120]  justify that, the person who will bear the responsibility for that, the consequences
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:16.520]  of that speech is you. And now they've got families, I'm told. We've got the clips weighing
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:22.680]  and going, we're second zones. How dare him say kids didn't die in Florida. But I can't
[03:23:22.680 --> 03:23:26.640]  respond. I'm not allowed to talk about it. It's bullying. This is what's going to happen.
[03:23:26.640 --> 03:23:32.000]  You know, we're talking about, you know, platform segregated audiences versus in the old days
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:34.360]  where people would just get the New York Times and all the news would come from the New York
[03:23:34.360 --> 03:23:38.040]  Times. These days, you have an audience that's segregated by platform. People who prefer to
[03:23:38.040 --> 03:23:42.080]  get their news from specific places online. If and then if they start lying about you
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:45.600]  on YouTube, your YouTube audience will never hear the correction. They will never.
[03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:48.640]  That's why folks have to come to Info Wars and it's crazy. When we're under the most
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:52.000]  attack is when I don't, when I don't plug. When we have the biggest events, the biggest
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:56.680]  audiences is when I don't. I'm an idiot. I just need everybody to, we've got products.
[03:23:56.680 --> 03:24:01.080]  I need you to go there and commit it. The first amendment and buy products at m4store.com.
[03:24:01.080 --> 03:24:04.800]  InfoWarsLife.com. It's not a sales tag to keep saying last day of the sale. I've been
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:08.280]  so busy trying to launch the TV satellites, all the stuff we're doing, trying to hire
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:13.400]  the new crew and hire extra people and launch more shows and develop new broadcast and talk
[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:18.080]  to radio and TV stations that I haven't come up with a new special on the toothpaste on
[03:24:18.080 --> 03:24:24.080]  the Ickerman on the cell force on the brain force. We're talking 53% off on cell force.
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:28.640]  We're talking 50% off on the fluoride free toothpaste with iodine and close silver fortified.
[03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:32.760]  Those, those recent, what I do is I do big sales, but then when something's about to
[03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:35.960]  sell out, it's not coming in for a few months. I'll leave it back at full price and make
[03:24:35.960 --> 03:24:39.920]  some money. We need to find the operation. I get so busy that I don't. A lot of this,
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:43.800]  these sales will go until Monday, but some of them have to end because it's about to
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:47.960]  sell out. So when I tell you this stuff, it's not a tactic. Oh, the sales been extended
[03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:52.520]  extended extended. I haven't been been so busy. I haven't gone and looked at inventory
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:55.360]  and what we've got and what's come in. We've got two new products that have been in for
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:25:00.760]  a month. I am so busy. I have not even cut ads for them because I have a true lust for
[03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:05.520]  information in the news instead of the plugging in the products, which I do have a lust for
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:09.640]  high quality products. So you can see that info or store.com. I need you to go there.
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:13.600]  I need you to buy the products. You've been doing it. I love you. I appreciate you. I'm
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:18.720]  not complaining. I'm just saying I'm like a dog and a fight. Dogs like to fight and
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:22.920]  I've got ears bit off and eyeball hanging out. I love it. I'm just chomping and biting
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:26.960]  everything, but you know what? I need a blood transfusion. We're all roll over and maybe
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:31.280]  that's the good roll over eyes point this guy and I'm in Valhalla. Uh, you know, so
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:37.640]  I'm just saying you guys, so you all get it. So just you flood me with money. I will did
[03:25:37.640 --> 03:25:41.880]  all my stress at defeating them and the lawsuits and the harassment and the black op teams
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:45.640]  and the PIs and all of which by the way is all enjoyable. It's kind of fun for me. It's
[03:25:45.640 --> 03:25:52.480]  like a video game. You do that and you just go, George Soros, you're blocked. Alex Jones
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:56.600]  physically isn't protected and spiritually is under attack, but at least when it comes
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:26:02.120]  to temporal finances, the free market still has some voice and Trump shoe. So I need you
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:07.520]  to play your race of spades info or store.com info or store.com. You the enemy is openly
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:12.680]  saying they want to ban us. The enemy is already demonetized as they've already cut our YouTube
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:17.880]  videos down from, you know, the average video, 300,000 of the average video, 30,000 literally,
[03:26:17.880 --> 03:26:22.240]  but it doesn't matter because and here's some of my big frustrations tomorrow. We continue
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:26.080]  on to Hagman's awesome. He's just stay with us, but I need you to get into a band coming
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:32.360]  up. I've got to say this though. I don't like giving out. I'm so truthful that I give out
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:37.200]  the intel and when Paul pointed out, we were beating everybody. They ran that headline
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:41.940]  everywhere and they said, Oh, it's true. They are beating us. And that's what and I've given
[03:26:41.940 --> 03:26:46.520]  out so many secrets that their corporate people haven't even figured out, but I want to tell
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:50.920]  the audience what's going on. But then I noticed that I think they're as smart as I am or
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:55.320]  smarter, but they're actually not that smart, Mila. And that's why I don't want to actually
[03:26:55.320 --> 03:26:58.880]  sit there and tell people some of the stuff and where we're winning and what's going on
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:02.560]  and what we figured out because then they figure it out and they go target it.
[03:27:02.560 --> 03:27:07.560]  I've been through the exactly the same thing. It's a real struggle because you you're saying
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:12.200]  to your audience, look, we are on attack on so many fronts. It is so they are making it
[03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:19.120]  so expensive and complicated for us to just exist. But once you, you know, you give specifics
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:23.680]  about what some of the, you know, specifics about some of the attacks, other people can
[03:27:23.680 --> 03:27:28.600]  replicate them. Other people can join in on the assault. You know, it's like Breitbart
[03:27:28.600 --> 03:27:32.720]  never mentioned the sleeping giants attack because they didn't want to draw more attention
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:36.520]  to it and have more people or whatever, which was smart. Unfortunately, it seems to be working
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:39.560]  anyway. And they've got like 4,000 advertisers to withdraw from Breitbart. I keep bringing
[03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:44.240]  that example up because it's the best one I know and one people will have heard of.
[03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:48.640]  You and I in our respective organizations in our careers are under assault on like 50
[03:27:48.640 --> 03:27:53.040]  fronts at once all the time. And it's a it's designed to wear you down. It's a it's a war
[03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:57.640]  of attrition designed to exhaust exactly at our listeners and emotionally if they just
[03:27:57.640 --> 03:28:04.040]  flood us with prayers and support and finances, it, it, it literally people are resort literally
[03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:08.920]  it literally just, instead, I don't want to be worrying about money. I need to be attacking
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:13.800]  the enemy at the main guns. Speaking of the devil, you, which is money, you, you, you
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:18.160]  got your new book coming out. They have, they are vitriolically trying to celebrate your
[03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:23.120]  destruction and people ask, why is that, you know, okay, fine. He's a good guy, but whatever
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:28.440]  good Lord, you know, we're all going to go to hell that devil Milo on the point is you
[03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:32.160]  are a guy that has courage. And you know what? I'm not saying you're silly and ignorant
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:35.360]  like the quote from full metal jacket, Joker silly and ignorant, but he's got guts and
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:38.680]  guts is enough. You're not silly and ignorant. You're a smart guy, but you're effective. They
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:43.440]  fear you. People need to go to dangerous.com preorder the new book. And we'll talk about
[03:28:43.440 --> 03:28:47.320]  that when we come back with Doug Hagman, who's a total angel and who's awesome and so smart
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:51.480]  and lets me run over to the fourth hour. He's been preparing for for days to cover. So he'll

[03:30:54.560 --> 03:31:00.880]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[03:31:00.880 --> 03:31:07.280]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[03:31:07.280 --> 03:31:15.200]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot

[03:31:49.400 --> 03:31:54.440]  are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[03:31:54.440 --> 03:31:59.360]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support

[03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:09.960]  of the most potent forms of turmeric available. Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[03:32:09.960 --> 03:32:14.480]  and is one of the most studied herbals today. It is well known in traditional medicine for
[03:32:14.480 --> 03:32:19.680]  its soothing properties. Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes
[03:32:19.680 --> 03:32:25.200]  for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function,
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:29.960]  immune system and so much more. Regular turmeric root from the store only contains
[03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:34.720]  one to five percent of active ingredients. But our turmeric root extract contains over
[03:32:34.720 --> 03:32:40.320]  ninety-five percent of the active ingredients. Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs
[03:32:40.320 --> 03:32:46.880]  such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[03:32:57.920 --> 03:33:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:17.200 --> 03:33:22.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:28.640]  so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:32.120]  You know, we have a lot of great hosts that come and contribute to InfoWars, but Doug
[03:33:32.120 --> 03:33:36.280]  Hagman is one of my favorites. I've been listening to him for ten years on coast to
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:41.800]  coast for longer, twelve, fourteen years and then he has his own great show and just the
[03:33:41.800 --> 03:33:47.960]  production and everything. But I hear a lot of the stuff he talked about and I didn't
[03:33:47.960 --> 03:33:52.640]  disbelieve him. It's just I've learned. I love people that really have sources and it's
[03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:58.920]  not BS. And he's got such incredible sources and he's a real trooper because I asked him
[03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:02.080]  to come to the show once a week and have the time I take it over. But I have talked to
[03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:06.080]  Doug and I've had a bunch of family stuff going on because of the behind the scenes
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:10.080]  stuff they're doing. I'm not complaining. It's just unbelievable. I want to develop
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:15.720]  him doing a nighttime show. We've talked to you about doing a show, but Doug is just
[03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:19.680]  amazing, such a humble guy as well. And he's here with us now and I wanted to pick his
[03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:24.800]  brain supposed to be hosting the whole hour about the intel we're getting and the attempt
[03:34:24.800 --> 03:34:30.520]  to kill the president last week. We got from high level sources and these are real sources
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:36.560]  and just put in this sledgehammer of and I didn't see it. You don't see the attack when
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:42.400]  you're not involved in it. The Intel's rolling in ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, Kepler and
[03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:48.960]  Comedy Central. They're saying we said nobody died at the shooting and they're saying I
[03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:52.280]  attacked children and then they don't show a clip. So they're not just trying to ban
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:58.440]  us off YouTube and CIA Anderson Cooper proposed Kepler clip in a moment. They're making their
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:04.720]  move and then it all clicks and I get embarrassed because I'm supposed to be on top of stuff.
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:09.680]  But yeah, you get tomorrow's news today a lot of times here, but sometimes we are the
[03:35:09.680 --> 03:35:15.800]  news after we get run over. They have announced with News Corp and with Time Warner, they're
[03:35:15.800 --> 03:35:19.760]  taking internet over, they're ending free speech in the next year. Everyone's site will
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:25.800]  be not allowed on any major platforms, period. And they haven't and they're saying info wars
[03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:32.840]  is the, I saw the Wall Street Journal a week ago, I didn't believe it. We can have it go.
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:39.640]  And now CNN is saying we're filing complaints to ban info wars. They bullied children and
[03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:44.320]  said no one died and then they won't show the video or the quote. And now that it's
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:51.560]  all flooding in, they're shutting our channels down right now. And it's all over the news
[03:35:51.560 --> 03:35:55.520]  that I said no kids died and they won't show the clip because it didn't happen. I mean,
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:36:04.520]  this is quantum leap fake news, Milo. This is quantum level and it's another level from
[03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:07.680]  what they've been trying over the last couple of months.
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:12.920]  So exactly. So I appreciate you staying late and I apologize five times to Doug Hagman
[03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:19.440]  for running over. He's a champion. Doug, I'm just, I'm not being a victim here. I'm shocked
[03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:24.440]  by the level of the brazenness because they go in the Wall Street Journal. We've met,
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:28.240]  we've decided to start with info wars, the takeover of the internet where only big corporations
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:31.640]  can be seen. We're going to say they're all Russians and we'll make billions more. And
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.520]  then a week later, it begins and it's all based on law. I mean, I've read history books
[03:36:36.520 --> 03:36:41.280]  about the Soviet Union, the Nazis and stuff. They were child's play, but they're being
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:47.440]  rejected. No one's buying into it. It's just so epic. Doug, what do you say to this, my
[03:36:47.440 --> 03:36:48.440]  friend?
[03:36:48.440 --> 03:36:54.360]  Well, Alex, thanks and Milo, big fan. You know, it was something that as I listened
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:59.400]  to you and I'm hearing what you're saying, I thought of a good friend of mine, coach
[03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:05.520]  Dave Daubemire. And he had said, he had told me a number of years ago, the truth becomes
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:11.520]  hate speech to those who hate the truth. And that is so true today. The fact that they're
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:14.860]  attempting to shut you down, that they're trying to shut us down. They're trying to
[03:37:14.860 --> 03:37:23.240]  silence all conservatives. We're in a war. We're under attack. Absolutely. And the very
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:27.840]  thing that's happening to you has been happening to us and is happening to us. Everything that
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.440]  we say on our show that I say, for example, on the various shows, you're including your
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:36.560]  platform. I see contemporaneously in lawsuits filed against me. I've got a file or I've
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:41.520]  got to defend against the lawsuits of frivolous lawsuits for defamation and everything else.
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:47.920]  Lawfare is unrestricted. The abuse of process within the court system is just beyond anything
[03:37:47.920 --> 03:37:52.800]  that I've ever seen before. It's ratcheted up now and now we've got to essentially go
[03:37:52.800 --> 03:37:53.800]  in the offensive.
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:58.320]  I was about to say, Pachennik's right. He used to run the open throw governments. We
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:03.080]  got to start hitting hard. I mean, I'm just not somebody that goes out and assaults people
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:06.640]  politically, but I'm very good at it. I'm going to take the gloves off. How do we take
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:08.840]  the gloves off, Doug? You know, when asked Milo?
[03:38:08.840 --> 03:38:16.040]  Well, I think what Milo said, I think it's the vulnerability or the vulnerable enemies
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:21.560]  there. We've got to rally the troops, I guess. That's the only way we're going to survive
[03:38:21.560 --> 03:38:27.120]  in this. We've got to stick together. We've got to just circle the wagons and all together.
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:30.720]  That's it. Otherwise, we're going to hang separately, you know, the old saying. So we've
[03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:35.320]  got to work together to fight the censorship, I believe, because if we don't do it.
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:39.680]  I mean, they're communist cops. They say, kill cops. We can't even send reporters to
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:45.560]  the Capitol. Communists with guns won't let them go in. I mean, it's just in the cops,
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:50.040]  the local cops, these are groups that want to kill them, say, sorry, Alex, we can't
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:54.000]  help you. We've been told not to. I mean, I'm pissed, man.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:57.920]  The good news is that the vast majority of the American public does not agree with what
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:01.720]  they're doing, whether or not they share your politics. I agree. I'm just realizing we're
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:07.240]  in the middle of like the Bolshevik Revolution, but it's globalist. We if we don't recognize
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:10.600]  this like the Russians didn't recognize it up front, we're done because I know we think
[03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:14.960]  we're winning and we got some things going with Trump. But man, I think we've just mobilized
[03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:18.520]  the scum and then we realize we are up against true filth.
[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:22.960]  Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to I just had to postpone a talk in Phoenix that was supposed
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:25.920]  to happen tomorrow. The reason I'm able to stay an extra day. I remember they canceled
[03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:26.920]  it.
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:30.920]  The reason I'm able to stay with you is that my talk in Phoenix has been postponed because
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:35.800]  Antifa found out the the promoter found out the venue showed up at the guy's house, threatened
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:40.680]  his girlfriend, papered the streets that they were going to call and call and call and harass
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:45.160]  everybody involved, everybody associated because they're trying to make the price targets the
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:49.280]  most dangerous warriors. They're trying to make them untouchable. So you can't do business.
[03:39:49.280 --> 03:39:54.640]  You know, exactly. So what do we do, Doug? I mean, I'm not a I don't want to I don't
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:39:58.000]  want to spill their blood because they're cockroaches. I just don't know how long the
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:03.280]  president puts up with this. How long we do I'm ready for the military to go in and because
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:08.640]  they've all commit, commit arrest. Everybody that's on the Chinese payroll. I'm ready,
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:09.640]  man.
[03:40:09.640 --> 03:40:14.440]  Yeah, I totally agree with you on this. We've got to fight back. We cannot show any any signs
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:19.560]  of weakness whatsoever. In my view, anyway, we can never settle whether it's in a in a
[03:40:19.560 --> 03:40:25.520]  law fair venue, we can't settle. We cannot settle for anything but full full frontal
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:30.000]  attack at the White House. Sorry. Secret service, no law enforcement injured. Somebody tried
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:34.840]  to attack the White House. I'm sorry. Sorry. Just so much breaking this fake this up guys.
[03:40:34.840 --> 03:40:40.880]  Secret service, no very clear. It looked like she was trying to drive up that driveway on
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:45.520]  the southwest side of the White House, which enters the complex here for people who are
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:49.920]  coming in to either work here or you know, members of Congress will come in through that
[03:40:49.920 --> 03:40:55.360]  entrance as well and drive into West Executive Drive to come into the White House. We don't
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:59.120]  know why she was trying to get in there or if it was some sort of accident or medical
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:00.920]  condition. We're trying to find that out for you.
[03:41:00.920 --> 03:41:01.920]  Yeah.
[03:41:01.920 --> 03:41:07.600]  Just be a person off their medication or diabetes, who knows, or maybe a jihadi attack. Sorry,
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:11.880]  thanks for having me. Go ahead. No, no, that's an important story. I think, look, the war
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:16.280]  is on right now and it's on against you and I. It's on against everyone, every conservative
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:21.320]  out there, every true stellar out there. And of course, I'm not sure I can even add to
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:27.440]  what you and Milo had said. This is an incredible environment, which we find ourselves. And
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:32.000]  I think what we, again, we need to fight back, but we need to do so in a very intelligent
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:37.880]  and very precise manner. And we cannot allow ourselves, I think, to get too far off the
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:44.520]  mark in terms of how we fight. We can't, certainly we can't show our hand. We cannot, I like
[03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:53.240]  what Milo said, the fact that if we give too much information out, the others can replicate
[03:41:53.240 --> 03:41:56.920]  the attacks, what works, what doesn't. A lot of we yell about things, you know, it's
[03:41:56.920 --> 03:42:03.880]  the bottom line is we're dealing with real authoritarians in open calls to ban us. That
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:08.120]  has not happened before. And they're trying to do it right now and are doing it. I mean,
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:13.200]  all I'm saying is we have to are the listeners. What you said, rally the troops. If people
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:18.960]  don't recognize this as the biggest assault on free speech in US history, I mean, this
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:24.840]  is un. The problem is that the various branches of the left, all of whom cover for and advocate
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:31.320]  for each other. The worst, most violent bits, Antifa, are excused by the leftist establishment
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:36.920]  and funded by the same leftist donors who fund the leftists. CNN and others say Antifa,
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:41.080]  it's okay to be violent to somebody. Almost unprecedented. And my worry is we're all out
[03:42:41.080 --> 03:42:44.080]  here saying we hate violence. We hate violence to the left. We hate violence in response
[03:42:44.080 --> 03:42:47.240]  to ideas and speech. All we want is to be able to express ourselves. I don't know how
[03:42:47.240 --> 03:42:50.680]  long this country can bear being under that much oppression and authoritarianism.
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:58.260]  Now we're armed to taste some. Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life. Cell Force focuses
[03:42:58.260 --> 03:43:04.520]  on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:04.520 --> 03:43:09.920]  They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production
[03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:15.400]  by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:21.960]  don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:27.160]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:33.240]  oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:38.160]  on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:45.000]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:53.480]  from Info Wars Life. Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:57.920]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from InfoWarsLife.com. But instead
[03:43:57.920 --> 03:44:02.080]  of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:06.600]  From all the wives, tales, and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We
[03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:10.920]  know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick. Again, in every culture, this
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:17.560]  has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but
[03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:24.120]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life
[03:44:24.120 --> 03:44:29.840]  force that is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints,
[03:44:29.840 --> 03:44:33.320]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's
[03:44:33.320 --> 03:44:39.920]  for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth
[03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:44.920]  formula out there. And it's amazing. Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:49.240]  what it can do for your family. And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:54.440]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:44:54.440 --> 03:44:58.920]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found an extraordinary
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:04.160]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear
[03:45:04.160 --> 03:45:09.440]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:14.520]  This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[03:45:14.520 --> 03:45:19.880]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:25.840]  nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production. And again, studying the effects
[03:45:25.840 --> 03:45:30.680]  in published trials, in their published trials, now we are introducing the fruit of the research,
[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:36.640]  a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and
[03:45:36.640 --> 03:45:41.760]  the fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal
[03:45:41.760 --> 03:45:46.920]  distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now
[03:45:46.920 --> 03:46:16.640]  at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-A-253-3139.
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:21.080]  In the history of InfoWarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:26.120]  Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others, with its unique delivery system and
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:31.280]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects. This formula is the
[03:46:31.280 --> 03:46:36.720]  platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:42.400]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest-quality
[03:46:42.400 --> 03:46:47.040]  lab standard. That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest-secured, you're
[03:46:47.040 --> 03:46:51.120]  finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars. That's InfoWarsLife.com and vitamin mineral
[03:46:51.120 --> 03:46:57.960]  fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[03:46:57.960 --> 03:47:17.040]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:20.040]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow
[03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:21.520]  the United States government.
[03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:28.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.520 --> 03:47:34.520]  You still think that you have people brought down to the World Trade Center? Does anybody
[03:47:34.520 --> 03:47:40.520]  else see a problem here? If the government has something to hide, why are they so afraid
[03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:48.520]  to answer a few questions? This story does not end up.
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:48:02.560]  Now for the next huge total internet takeover. I'm not just saying they're announcing the
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:08.520]  end of the free internet. They've always faked debates about net neutrality. We had net neutrality
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:13.000]  before Obama came in to take over the internet, gave liability protection to the big telecoms
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:18.920]  and big computer companies and big social networks to censor. Then Trump wasn't for
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:24.760]  that and repealed it, but now it's nebulous and Rupert Murdoch is, when I say crawled,
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:29.280]  I don't want to be gross, but brown nosing is one thing. We're talking about a possum,
[03:48:29.280 --> 03:48:32.680]  have you ever seen a possum going to dead cow on the side of the road? I'm not saying
[03:48:32.680 --> 03:48:37.960]  Trump's a dead cow. If Rupert Murdoch could be crawling up the rear end of the president,
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:44.440]  he would be doing it. I say that to troll people, but it's daily conversations. Murdoch
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:49.680]  is just groveling now when he was a Hillary supporter. I'm in this nightmare position
[03:48:49.680 --> 03:48:52.960]  where I know Trump's good, I know he's awake, I know he's involved, but these are the people
[03:48:52.960 --> 03:48:56.520]  wanting to censor him. They already tried to take Fox left as it failed, so they went
[03:48:56.520 --> 03:49:01.760]  back to what made him successful. Now Disney's taking it over and Murdoch is in the news with
[03:49:01.760 --> 03:49:08.200]  his CEO going, newspapers are going to do great, because we're going to shut everybody else
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:11.680]  down and you'll only be able to get our feeds on the internet now. And I'm like, what in
[03:49:11.680 --> 03:49:21.160]  Hades? And then Google is taking directives from Murdoch and his CEO because now they
[03:49:21.160 --> 03:49:25.720]  have right wing cover. So I'm saying the knives are out folks, they're carving the Christmas
[03:49:25.720 --> 03:49:30.120]  pig up here, and I don't just say this, oh, it's all of you, they're going to get all
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:35.120]  of you, I don't even care about me. Okay, I'm a little bit fatalistic. I had this mission
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:40.640]  I have to carry out, I'm not going to give up, but I'm not suicidal, I want to live forever,
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:46.360]  but at the same time, it's kind of like a job to be honorable and work hard. And I'm
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:52.400]  just telling you, they've incrementally censored, diddled, manipulated this and that, banned
[03:49:52.400 --> 03:50:00.400]  it over here, but now it is, we're turning it over. And it's here. So asking Milo, asking
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:05.160]  Doug Hagman, Doug, if you'll come on Sunday, I want to get you on with me, the Sunday show,
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:09.400]  I don't know, we need to freak out, we need to check them with a head cut off, and then
[03:50:09.400 --> 03:50:15.360]  target, but I'm just letting the listeners know this is history book stuff. I keep saying
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:16.360]  that Milo.
[03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:22.520]  No, it is. And this is an example of one of those moments in time where regime change,
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:26.800]  if you like, happens quietly and slowly and almost while nobody is noticing. The incremental
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:31.560]  erosion of rights in America has started to accelerate in the last five or 10 years, the
[03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:35.160]  assaults on the First Amendment, the assaults on the Second Amendment. The voices who are
[03:50:35.160 --> 03:50:41.120]  calling attention to those assaults being snuffed out on social media. I think it's
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:48.440]  relatively unprecedented in a large, free, democratic nation for all of the institutions
[03:50:48.440 --> 03:50:53.160]  in that country, the academy, journalism, the media, the entertainment industry, politics,
[03:50:53.160 --> 03:50:54.160]  every one of them.
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:59.120]  That's what it is to see them all involved in criminal activity and lies. It's like,
[03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:04.720]  it hurts you, not for you, but the sense of, it's like, Jesus, my country's this overrun.
[03:51:04.720 --> 03:51:07.440]  I thought I knew how, but I thought it was a few controllers.
[03:51:07.440 --> 03:51:10.880]  But this is why you're upset. It's why you get upset on the show. It's why you speak
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:16.240]  with such forcefulness. Because the thing that really upsets you and produces general
[03:51:16.240 --> 03:51:19.520]  outrage, not the kind of outrage you see on Twitter, but real outrage, is a sense of
[03:51:19.520 --> 03:51:25.480]  injustice, a sense of unfairness. And when you see these various powerful, massive, interconnected
[03:51:25.480 --> 03:51:31.280]  organs of American society, militating against some of the only people who are...
[03:51:31.280 --> 03:51:32.760]  And taking radical...
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:38.040]  It produces indignation, because you feel the injustice, and so does the public. That's
[03:51:38.040 --> 03:51:39.360]  why they voted for Trump.
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:44.320]  Exactly. And even though they're over-sampling up to 15 points for Democrats, he's at 50%,
[03:51:44.320 --> 03:51:48.840]  that means 65. What are they going to do, Doug? I guess this is their desperate act,
[03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:54.080]  because I mean, openly going at Hitler level censorship, people overuse Hitler. This is
[03:51:54.080 --> 03:51:58.400]  it, Larry. To do this is a bold move, Doug.
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:05.640]  Yeah, and my question to both of you conversationally here is, can we play by the rules? What are
[03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:07.000]  the... First of all, what are the rules?
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:08.480]  They're always changing.
[03:52:08.480 --> 03:52:15.280]  Yeah. And if... Can we afford to play by the rules? Because if we do, we're going to be
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:16.280]  silenced anyway.
[03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:21.640]  And that's it. They're forcing us to really do... They think they're nasty and dirty because
[03:52:21.640 --> 03:52:25.040]  they get into that. Good people don't like to use those weapons, but we're the masters
[03:52:25.040 --> 03:52:26.560]  of it. Is that what you're saying, Doug?
[03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:30.040]  This is why conservatives typically don't succeed in cultural fights, because they know
[03:52:30.040 --> 03:52:32.720]  how to fight dirty and because they're honorable issues not to.
[03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:38.600]  Yeah, well, I'm not doing this to be threatening. I think I'm going to go ahead and access the
[03:52:38.600 --> 03:52:44.000]  dark side. No, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Doug, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:50.400]  Peel back the fake face minority report style. Like, Mission Impossible.
[03:52:50.400 --> 03:52:55.280]  I'm going to be nice. Doug, it does trigger parts of the brain. Go ahead, Doug.
[03:52:55.280 --> 03:53:01.160]  No, I'm there. I'm right there with you. Look, I don't know what the answer is. I do know
[03:53:01.160 --> 03:53:04.720]  that we're all, again, as you said, not to rehash this, but we're all under attack. We've
[03:53:04.720 --> 03:53:05.720]  been under attack.
[03:53:05.720 --> 03:53:09.080]  We're in a corner and we're not going to roll over like people in Nazi Germany. You sons
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:15.160]  of bitches, you're about to get it. Feel mud, all you people. That's who's behind all this.
[03:53:15.160 --> 03:53:18.160]  Sorry. Go ahead, Doug. I apologize.
[03:53:18.160 --> 03:53:22.680]  No, don't apologize. I feel the same way. I really do. And the way I'm looking at this
[03:53:22.680 --> 03:53:31.640]  is attempting to formulate some sort of a response, because when you shout and no one
[03:53:31.640 --> 03:53:36.600]  listens, when you call 911 and no one comes, what do you do? We're being forced in that
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:42.120]  corner. And again, I go back to that statement, the truth becomes hate speech. Those who hate
[03:53:42.120 --> 03:53:46.200]  the truth, what are they trying to silence? What are they so afraid of? Are they that
[03:53:46.200 --> 03:53:47.200]  afraid of us?
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:50.400]  And I do say they are. They're that afraid of the truth coming out of them.
[03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:55.200]  Put them all in the American dream. Right. It's interesting you say that when you call
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:54:01.560]  911, excuse me, it's 999 in England, so it always gets messed up in my head. 911, which
[03:54:01.560 --> 03:54:08.000]  is what you have here, when you call and nobody comes, the American people have seen the corruption
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:11.760]  of law enforcement, people coming to hear my college talks and the police standing down
[03:54:11.760 --> 03:54:15.480]  and allowing Antifa to do half a million dollars worth of damage to Berkeley, a hundred thousand
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:16.960]  dollars worth of damage to the college.
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:20.520]  They've seen the people employed, paid, who are supposed to be dedicated to keeping the
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:25.240]  public safe, stand back and let people get beaten up and pepper sprayed to protect the
[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:28.880]  feelings of leftists. They've seen, literally.
[03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:32.680]  My feelings are hurt. I'm going to hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:36.560]  And that, of course, was a professor, was a member of the faculty at Berkeley in a black
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:37.760]  mask with a bike lock.
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:43.320]  And he's a little, he's a thing, I'm not against betas, but he's a little beta rat trying
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:48.480]  to be an alpha male. And then alpha sit back because we're confident. I think what Doug's
[03:54:48.480 --> 03:54:51.280]  getting in is, what is the big dog, fat dog, get off the porch?
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:58.400]  When do you, yeah, it's sort of, you get nipped by little minnows so many times, you know,
[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:01.680]  sooner or later you have to bat them away in some fashion.
[03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:05.800]  But I had a top globalist off record, tell me, he goes, Alex, you think all these nicks
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:09.560]  make people wake up? That's because you should join us. You're awake. He goes, the public
[03:55:09.560 --> 03:55:15.640]  is going to become conditioned and evolved to accept this. And I just can't believe humanity's
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:16.640]  crap.
[03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:22.880]  I think there's a spirit in human beings, a need for freedom, a desire to express themselves.
[03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:26.680]  And I think the first and the first and second amendment, this country has been so successful
[03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:29.320]  because it's founded on principles that are innate to the human spirit.
[03:55:29.320 --> 03:55:30.320]  That empower individuals.
[03:55:30.320 --> 03:55:37.040]  Exactly, which is what we're defending classic Americana and these, they're openly pushing
[03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:42.600]  classic tyranny. And how is it not clear, Doug?
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:46.200]  It should be clear to every thinking American. The problem is we don't have enough thinking
[03:55:46.200 --> 03:55:51.480]  Americans. We don't have enough people, I think, that care enough. You know, it's almost
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:57.000]  as if not enough people have yet been affected by this. The silent majority, I look, I really
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:01.200]  believe there are a number of great people out there. The majority of people in the United
[03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:07.760]  States are great people. They're freedom loving people. But they're too humble to take action
[03:56:07.760 --> 03:56:12.040]  because they think taking action is arrogant. No, it's survival. Awaken and take action
[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:13.040]  now.
[03:56:13.040 --> 03:56:14.040]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:18.760]  No, you're exactly right. We've been playing too nice. We've been playing by several roles
[03:56:18.760 --> 03:56:23.240]  that they keep changing that we really don't know what they are. So now I think we have
[03:56:23.240 --> 03:56:29.840]  to become more offensive, offensive to get the truth out there. We have to demand accountability
[03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:33.640]  of our officials. I know that sounds like some sort of a trite statement.
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:39.840]  No, but if you march down to the congressman's event or woman's event, if you go there and
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:45.240]  it's not just my one reporter being attacked by 15 guys with guns and the police look on,
[03:56:45.240 --> 03:56:50.440]  and I actually had to call the military off, actually, on those anti... That's insane.
[03:56:50.440 --> 03:56:52.400]  The military is not going to public this much longer.
[03:56:52.400 --> 03:56:56.440]  It does seem to me that libertarians and conservatives in this country are going to have to do what
[03:56:56.440 --> 03:57:01.080]  they've typically been squeamish about doing, which is showing out on mass in public to
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:02.080]  protest it.
[03:57:02.080 --> 03:57:06.200]  I've watched Antifa punch somebody when they hit back. They complain. It's like, you're
[03:57:06.200 --> 03:57:09.640]  supposed to... This is my video game. I'm supposed to kick your... No, I'm going to break your
[03:57:09.640 --> 03:57:10.640]  job, brother.
[03:57:10.640 --> 03:57:15.040]  Yeah. But you know, conservatives, you know, libertarians, Republicans, whatever, have typically
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:18.280]  been reticent to show out in large numbers on the streets. Protesting is a left-wing
[03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:22.160]  thing, right, that women's march all the rest of it. It seems to me that we need to put
[03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:23.160]  that aside now.
[03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:27.280]  I agree. America is in an emergency. It is in a civil war. They're trying to shut us
[03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:28.280]  down online.
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:31.120]  I agree. That's the answer. I'm hitting the streets now, every day.
[03:57:31.120 --> 03:57:33.760]  That's a big sign, too.
