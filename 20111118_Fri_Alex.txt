[01:05.960 --> 01:16.400]  Biosphere World Heritage Site takeover has basically metastasized into I was at the Carlsbad
[01:16.400 --> 01:24.040]  Cavern National Park yesterday and ran into a cornucopia of Big Brother activities in fact it
[01:24.040 --> 01:34.800]  was an orgy of control freakism and anti-human global indoctrination with now the the National
[01:34.800 --> 01:41.120]  Park Rangers festooned with firearms and tasers walking around like it's a supermax prison with
[01:41.120 --> 01:48.440]  their eyes in slits just literally thinking that terrorists are under every table so we're going
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.400]  to be breaking that down today Aaron Dykes is going to be riding shotgun with us and bringing in
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.040]  the latest news as it breaks obviously throughout the week we've been having Gerald Salin say on
[01:58.040 --> 02:05.800]  because of the MF global I was watching CNBC just about an hour ago and they had the anchor
[02:05.800 --> 02:09.440]  there at the desk a male gentleman I meant to write down his name but didn't have time I think
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.080]  they were calling him Jamie something and of course they had the attractive Asian young lady
[02:15.080 --> 02:22.840]  who's on in the morning along with Kramer and one other person and the host who was anchoring to
[02:22.840 --> 02:30.240]  the people out on Wall Street Kramer and the other people he was saying that it looks like this
[02:30.240 --> 02:37.560]  MF global is some type of theft and crime and that now the 600 million that they claimed they knew
[02:37.560 --> 02:43.400]  where it was now it's gone and this is sending the markets down and then they come back to Kramer
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.200]  and the other talking heads they were like no no no no no this is not a big deal this is not
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.560]  illegal I'm sure it's just an accident and about five minutes later the other anchor
[02:53.560 --> 02:58.920]  host said yes it's no big deal it's just rumors and nothing to them nothing to them you could
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.360]  tell somebody had popped into his ear and told him do not say this is destroying confidence do
[03:04.360 --> 03:12.680]  not say people don't like being swindled and they cut back to the the female anchor field anchor
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.280]  and she's like yes this just happens when you're involved in commodities no big deal of course
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.880]  Salente's been in it since the early 70s I've made a novice study of it this was money in his
[03:23.880 --> 03:31.400]  in his what's the term they use segregated account it's like a bank account and they took it and
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.160]  they took 33,000 other people's money he won't say how much it is above 100,000 but it's a lot
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.680]  more than 100,000 now Aaron Dyches is writing shotgun once we've got a lot of other news everything

[08:15.320 --> 08:22.040]  here in northern arizona on the united nations globalist takeover of our national parks and other
[08:22.040 --> 08:30.040]  public lands i'm retracing some of the steps that i was on 14 years ago when i made america
[08:30.040 --> 08:35.240]  destroyed by design we've been shooting a lot of high def video of what's happened when i get back
[08:35.240 --> 08:40.760]  to austin next week we'll have that for the nightly news and for the syndicated radio transmission
[08:40.760 --> 08:47.640]  that you're tuned into right now in the meantime via my iphone i filed a report from carlsbad caverns
[08:47.640 --> 08:55.320]  yesterday where it was a a out of control police state exercise and i think that in a few years if
[08:55.320 --> 09:03.720]  this doesn't stop the the national parks will be like entering an airport with the tsa i saw the
[09:05.160 --> 09:09.720]  national park rangers some of them wearing the firearms and tasers walking around with their
[09:09.720 --> 09:16.040]  arms out like they were tough guys questioning everyone they would come over and talk to you
[09:16.040 --> 09:21.400]  and others it wasn't just us i thought they knew why was it first that wasn't what it was and that
[09:21.400 --> 09:25.720]  they were singling me out turned out they were interrogating everybody but that's just normal
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.040]  now in america like when you go rent a car go to hotel room if they're part of patriot act
[09:30.040 --> 09:35.960]  compliance you get 20 questions so i'm going to be breaking some of that down later today
[09:35.960 --> 09:41.080]  gerald salente uh is going to be joining us coming up here in about 22 minutes from now
[09:41.880 --> 09:48.840]  top trans forecaster who had over six figures over a hundred thousand dollars taken out of
[09:48.840 --> 09:55.560]  of his private account roiders ap they've all admitted that it basically is a type of theft
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.480]  if it turns out it was done on purpose and if they don't return it at mf global
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.920]  and they're admitting that these were segregated accounts these were this was money he'd made
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.080]  in the market money he'd invested and then made in gold futures and that it was then his money
[10:11.080 --> 10:17.320]  and they've taken any other cash accounts from people as well 33 plus thousand mf global bought
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.680]  the trading firm that he'd been trading with and using since the early 70s and he's never seen
[10:22.680 --> 10:29.160]  anything like this and i was watching msnbc uh this morning just an hour and a half ago or so
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.800]  and uh they had the host they're anchoring it talking to the three reporters kramer and two
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.760]  other people on the ground at the new york stock exchange and he was saying well what's driving
[10:38.760 --> 10:44.280]  down the market right now uh you know the intel we're getting is there's no confidence now in the
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.440]  government there's no confidence now in these companies especially in futures that's why the
[10:50.440 --> 10:55.320]  markets are going down we thought that the bankruptcy of mf global hadn't signaled the new
[10:55.320 --> 11:01.800]  bear sterns or type situation 2008 but now that the money's missing they said that they had just
[11:01.800 --> 11:06.520]  misplaced it now they won't say where it went this is destroying confidence and this is well
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.320]  really theft that's what this is this is theft and then he throws it i meant to write down his name
[11:11.320 --> 11:17.560]  but couldn't find a pin here in the hotel room um he throws it to kramer and the uh the attractive
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.240]  woman and the other guy uh and they just all say no it's perfectly fine it's no big deal it's all
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.040]  just an accident perfectly reasonable and then about five minutes later i'm sitting there reading
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.480]  the newspaper surfing the web getting ready for the show doing research and he goes oh just just
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.160]  to be clear uh there's nothing to the rumors that the money was stolen no one knows where it is but
[11:37.160 --> 11:43.880]  it's no big deal quite normal uh no big deal i he didn't correct himself he just he just retracted
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.720]  everything by what he said five minutes later so somebody got in his ear after the break and said
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.760]  you listen here buddy and again i'm not watching many of these financial shows i've been on the road
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.800]  shooting video doing interviews with locals really learning a lot about what's happening out here
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.640]  out west what spurred me to want to do this trip um about six months ago my parents went out to
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.640]  montana and wyoming and visited family friends fellow patriots uh and they've just talked about
[12:11.640 --> 12:16.680]  how the government's trying to encroach there and the things that are happening so i figured i'd
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.680]  come back out west and i'm not going to say the other national parks and places i'm going in the
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.040]  next four days because i don't want to be waiting for me you know i wanted to go to carlsbad caverns
[12:26.040 --> 12:32.120]  be friendly be nice have my wife have my children richards with us helping with the technical stuff
[12:32.120 --> 12:38.520]  and i want to just come in all friendly and nice and see what it was like and i've been to carlsbad
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.760]  caverns four times before this and it's really a big police state now now now tying in to gerald
[12:44.760 --> 12:49.080]  salente coming up we're about to get some other news and some recaps some of the stuff we already
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.640]  mentioned and get erin dix's take who's riding shotgun with us throughout the three hours today
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.160]  and i've certainly appreciate the uh fantastic job he did the crew did yesterday with that in-depth
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.440]  breakdown of the censorship of the proof of fema camps in america and also the fact that they're
[13:04.440 --> 13:10.920]  hiding geoengineering terraforming uh kim trailing in plain view amazing job with erin dix but i wanted
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.160]  to go over some of the news here sprint launches soon to be mandatory emergency alert messages
[13:17.160 --> 13:21.240]  we told you years ago this was coming government said they're going to do it they're going to

[13:33.560 --> 13:38.040]  we'll listen to you inside your car how do i know all this is coming and of course much of it has
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.400]  now happened because i read the government documents homeland security three years ago
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.440]  was actually entertaining and recommending to congress and the and the federal government that
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.920]  they get funding to pilot taser bracelets on everyone getting on planes this is beyond or well
[13:54.920 --> 14:02.040]  well okay i know what's coming because i saw the federal purchase orders for austin alone in
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.200]  tooth in 1998 for eight hundred and forty four thousand dollars in microphones hidden in lamp
[14:08.200 --> 14:13.720]  post then i learned it went nationwide the last twelve years or so thirteen years now they're

[14:32.760 --> 14:41.080]  literature history uh astronomy not because i think it's trending and cool to be into that
[14:41.080 --> 14:49.080]  i'm really into giant gas giants exploding and and and and huge coronal mass ejections and gigantic
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.920]  star cluster formations that Hubble telescope has has photographed i want to know the secrets
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.120]  of the universe in my limited consciousness my tiny time to be alive i don't want to be
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.520]  filled full of madison avenue crud as they sell a slavery and because i've made a 20-year study
[15:06.520 --> 15:13.800]  almost 17 years it'll be 17 years in february on air on access tv and then am and fm and now
[15:13.800 --> 15:21.960]  today xm close to 100 am and fm stations global shortwave all of it i want to infect others with
[15:21.960 --> 15:28.280]  my love of life and and and that curiosity and that creative spirit that is the creative drive
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.640]  of humanity you're either creative or you're destructive you're either into love and and
[15:33.640 --> 15:38.280]  building and strength or you're into destruction and death and all of us have both sides of that
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.880]  in us but it's what side do we reach for i reach for the light i reach for the good i reach for
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.320]  the truth no matter what comes of all of this now huge developments are taking place and i'll get
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.040]  into this once salente is on with us and then more later with erin we're gonna open the phones up
[15:54.040 --> 15:59.320]  in the second third hour you may have kaiser and tarply tarply popping in uh from uh from syria
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.160]  he wanted to come on today he's there reporting uh but we're unable to get a hold of him and he's
[16:03.160 --> 16:08.360]  also been in zones where snipers are firing on people very very brave uh to be facing up to the
[16:09.160 --> 16:15.000]  the cia slash misad slash uh wahabi saudi arabian terror forces that are there on the ground
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.800]  but russian warships enter syrian waters to prevent nato attack so we're gonna be breaking
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.640]  that down we're not saying syria is good either the point is this is all part of a globalist plan
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.920]  but the big news is there's riots all over europe as they announced we're taking part of your pension
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.600]  fund we're raising your taxes well that'll bankrupt my my restaurant my hotel my business sorry too

[24:17.240 --> 24:23.960]  officers government agents and others at first who came out and warned that there was a global
[24:23.960 --> 24:30.520]  financial takeover happening by giant financial institutions they wanted to destroy free market
[24:30.520 --> 24:35.800]  capitalism and bring in a crony system where the general public lives in a communal kind of
[24:35.800 --> 24:42.120]  soviet model but the globalist are offshore and exempt from it all and siphon the money off to
[24:42.120 --> 24:48.120]  themselves and then again for 16 plus years i've told people bank of the world's coming
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.560]  they'll bankrupt the major regions the euro the north american union then the asian union
[24:53.560 --> 24:59.160]  and then say oh this is a terrible crisis the answer is a mega union and we're entering the
[25:01.240 --> 25:07.080]  next to final phase now in the establishment of this and once they have the global government in
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.680]  they can then in an orchestrated fashion shut down the country's even more cut off your resources
[25:12.680 --> 25:18.600]  as they've said in their plantopolis uh productions they even show british school children this is a
[25:18.600 --> 25:25.320]  post-industrial world by design to make you absolutely poor slaves that cannot resist
[25:25.320 --> 25:31.960]  then they'll say get sterilized give you welfare uh get government approval to have kids all of this
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.400]  is coming in this is all a public blueprint we cover it in endgame blueprint for global enslavement
[25:37.400 --> 25:43.320]  erin go back to the magnitude i mean they're even calling this in time magazine newsweek
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.880]  financial times of london a banking dictatorship a goldman sacks global coup they're now taking
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.880]  our exact terms we've been using for many many years because that's what it is we didn't just hit
[25:55.880 --> 26:01.480]  the center of the dartboard we're like robin hood splitting the arrow with another arrow
[26:01.480 --> 26:08.920]  and then splitting it again and again and again and again now how do we do this because we aren't
[26:08.920 --> 26:15.480]  smart because we care we learned history and we know the globalist handbook it's like if i go to
[26:15.480 --> 26:23.720]  a play and it's got a big thick uh breakdown uh or program that's why it's called a program oh here's
[26:23.720 --> 26:29.480]  your program you know who's coming up next you know who's gonna sing you know who's playing who
[26:29.480 --> 26:35.320]  you're like oh they're about to start the third act oh this this is a shakespearian event uh
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.600]  erin docks you've got the floor i mean i agree and you know groups like the builderberg have planned
[26:40.600 --> 26:47.320]  uh the european union for more than 50 years and they always hands on these embryonic plans they
[26:47.320 --> 26:53.240]  knew they couldn't open the gates with a full union so they started with the coal and other industrial
[26:53.240 --> 26:58.520]  you know common pool treaties getting the groups together and now they've progressed to this stage
[26:58.520 --> 27:03.640]  where it is openly a total banking takeover and i agree it's right here in the articles they totally
[27:03.640 --> 27:08.600]  admit that's what it is they're going to put these countries into receivership and completely run them
[27:08.600 --> 27:14.440]  and you can see where even if socialism isn't advisable it's become the trend in many of these
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.320]  small european countries the people are used to it and all those social benefits they've come to
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.760]  depend on will be just run by bankers so they'll say no whatever and again in europe they're taking
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.880]  around 70 percent of people's money even poor people and then they bring in the foreigners to
[27:29.880 --> 27:35.160]  basically be the political bloc who are on total welfare in many cases to out vote the domestic
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.480]  groups this is the balkanization plan that's why they always want to get the states here
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.280]  in more debt with unfunded mandates it's all about all about bringing us to this implosion point
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.600]  exactly and if you were going to have these socialist systems it makes sense in those
[27:48.600 --> 27:52.840]  smaller countries where you have some accountability now there's no accountability whatsoever
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.720]  and they're just they're openly using these austerity measures and going to loot the pension
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.280]  funds and and who knows what's going to happen to the people in these countries but obviously the
[28:02.280 --> 28:07.480]  countries themselves are going to be going into one form or another of bankruptcy and the banks
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.280]  are openly running the whole thing i mean mario monti is a very naked example of that alex
[28:13.320 --> 28:19.320]  well also don't forget they've militarized everything in the last 15 years as soon as europe
[28:19.320 --> 28:24.360]  got rid of rules on investment banks getting into general banking as soon as they got rid of it here
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.480]  this is the exact thing that's been done in argentina and other countries this is an exact plan
[28:29.480 --> 28:34.360]  it was done in japan they've been in a 15 year recession really a depression this is all about
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.560]  a consolidation that's why we were able to call it the globalist admit it was a premeditated
[28:39.560 --> 28:45.240]  consolidation and now they admit you know denver's got tv ads and manuals saying don't even trust
[28:45.240 --> 28:50.440]  your best friend they're probably a terrorist what's a terrorist they don't like the fellow reserve
[28:50.440 --> 28:57.240]  a terrorist is a real american or a real european or a real mexican or a real chinese anybody no
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.360]  matter where you are in the world who recognizes that globalism is a banker corporate takeover
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.240]  crime syndicate run by eugenicist it's not just corporations taking over the world and
[29:07.240 --> 29:12.600]  oh there'll be our rulers that's bad enough these are psycho control freaks who cared enough about
[29:12.600 --> 29:18.040]  killing the majority of us who spend decades getting control this is their religion the world
[29:18.040 --> 29:23.880]  government is only the means to the end the real party starts once they've got the real power and
[29:23.880 --> 29:28.440]  starts shutting off the resources then the extermination begins then the giant regional

[33:21.560 --> 33:26.280]  thank you for joining us Gerald Salente is going to be our guest the next 30 minutes
[33:26.280 --> 33:32.280]  we had him on two days ago on the radio show and now of course last night he joined us for
[33:32.280 --> 33:38.680]  info wars nightly news that rob do hosted did a great job along with the crew producing i was
[33:38.680 --> 33:47.800]  watching cnbc this morning and the host who was anchoring it went to kramer uh jim kramer and two
[33:47.800 --> 33:54.200]  other uh field reporters who were in the new york stock exchange and the anchor host i think
[33:54.200 --> 34:01.320]  they said his name was jamie uh i forget his last name he but this was on about two three hours ago
[34:02.120 --> 34:08.920]  he he said on their well the markets are going down because of mf global not because of the
[34:08.920 --> 34:15.400]  bankruptcy but because first we were told the money disappeared 600 to 900 million
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.120]  now we're told that they found it but now again they won't say where it is this looks like theft
[34:20.760 --> 34:26.280]  and that's what is really driving down the markets and driving down uh speculation and
[34:26.280 --> 34:32.040]  commodities and other things he said this is really a serious situation then he cuts to kramer
[34:32.040 --> 34:36.520]  and he cuts to the other people they all say well this type of thing happens sometimes and
[34:37.080 --> 34:40.200]  you know that's what happens when you're speculating or whatever now this was
[34:40.200 --> 34:48.440]  uh segregated accounts and ap reuters bloomberg forbs they've all reported this is unprecedented
[34:48.440 --> 34:52.440]  that's why investors are freaking out and getting out of the market that's why people don't trust
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.680]  banks we've already had all these semi runs on banks people trying to take their money out of
[34:56.680 --> 35:04.280]  bank of america uh jp morgan chase wells fargo and others because they understand that and some
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.840]  of the banks try to refuse to give you your money you've seen the attempts to ratchet up all these
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.720]  fees this is what the casual society is about they get to take your money and then not get in
[35:13.720 --> 35:19.080]  trouble so as this broke earlier in the week suddenly there was going to be judges involved
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.320]  and they were going to get the money back well now mf global and all the little companies
[35:23.320 --> 35:28.440]  that grabbed up like the one that salente's been uh doing trades through for more than 30 years
[35:29.160 --> 35:35.880]  suddenly uh they were going to give the money back now they're saying oh i we don't know where it is
[35:35.880 --> 35:41.160]  and it's just a news situation where you don't get your money back first it was you might get a
[35:41.160 --> 35:46.200]  little back and then know you'll get it all back and now sorry it's gone and the funny thing was
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.240]  that i'm going to gerald is that about five minutes later they go to break and they come back with
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.120]  the host who's there anchoring you know from the news desk and he goes actually uh just to clarify
[35:56.120 --> 36:00.360]  things i've researched all these rumors of the money being stolen and they're just that they're
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.960]  they're rumors uh we can't confirm uh so i just want to say that so well that we know the money's gone
[36:06.600 --> 36:10.200]  and he admitted it was a theft and that's what's hurting the market then he comes back five minutes
[36:10.200 --> 36:17.080]  later and was chastised i guess behind the scenes in his earpiece or whatever and it's like uh actually
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.880]  there's a nothing to these uh rumors he didn't say conspiracy theories but you know the money's

[36:39.480 --> 36:44.200]  had predicted that you'd see problems in december with delivery because a lot of these companies
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.400]  they believe don't have the physical gold gerald salenta thank you for joining us so give us the
[36:49.400 --> 36:54.120]  latest uh developments with your case and then i want to get your take and your expert analysis

[36:58.520 --> 37:04.040]  with germany secret plans to derail the british referendum on e u they admit it's a total banker
[37:04.040 --> 37:10.840]  dictatorship a goldman sacks coup that's time magazine over europe but they say how great
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.600]  goldman will now manage europe they'll fix the problems when they literally piloted the problem
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.080]  with all their minions and all the finance positions prime minister and presidents positions
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.720]  preparing for this takedown on the way up they made tens of trillions selling the derivatives
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.480]  garbage now they have the government agents they control sign on to those debts and then
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.480]  have the whore media or prostitutes you call them sell the public on it's your debt it's your fault
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.240]  and they're telling them we're taking part of your pension funds we're cutting your we're taking
[37:41.240 --> 37:46.600]  your money we're raising your taxes sorry if you go out of business it's our money give it to us so
[37:46.600 --> 37:53.720]  all hades is literally breaking loose gerald solante yes let me thank you alex let me first
[37:53.720 --> 38:01.320]  explain because a lot of people don't seem to understand this it is like having a layaway plan
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.160]  you go to a store and you're going to buy something but you don't have all the money yet
[38:05.160 --> 38:10.440]  so you just keep adding money into it until you have enough money and then you go pick it up now
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.240]  imagine that you go pick it up and you go to the place where the store was and the store is no longer
[38:15.240 --> 38:22.040]  there and you put all the money in that's what would that's exactly what happened to me i was
[38:22.040 --> 38:28.440]  building the account having planned it out that i would take delivery this month and kept putting
[38:28.440 --> 38:34.280]  money into my account building my account till i had enough money so all those morons out there
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.840]  that are saying what i'm doing you know oh you believe in paper this and that you don't know
[38:38.840 --> 38:45.240]  what you're talking about number two i just got off the phone with the broker here's the deal people
[38:45.240 --> 38:51.480]  like myself that had money in the account and the position to pick up the gold we're getting nothing
[38:52.200 --> 39:01.000]  zero some people are getting 60 cents on their dollar now here's the big lie and those guys i mean
[39:01.000 --> 39:09.960]  anybody that watches cnbc and believes those little those little guys out there that are always you
[39:09.960 --> 39:15.720]  know sucking up and bowing down to the money men you know they should have their head examined
[39:15.720 --> 39:23.000]  because here's the deal the cme group and this is a story that we broke with you last night
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.880]  the cme group is the exchange that handles all the delivery the derivatives and the commodities
[39:31.880 --> 39:38.520]  that's the exchange like the new york stock exchange handles stocks the cme group handles
[39:38.520 --> 39:46.520]  derivatives and commodities now commodities isn't just speculation farmers use it airlines use it
[39:46.520 --> 39:54.520]  millions millions and millions of people use exchanges and businesses buying futures for
[39:54.520 --> 40:07.080]  delivery now here is what the ceo of the cme group terrence terrence stuffy said last year
[40:07.640 --> 40:12.600]  we picked this up after doing research we pulled it up this was at a press conference
[40:12.600 --> 40:20.520]  with the former mayor daly who he called his great friend no customer has ever lost a penny
[40:21.080 --> 40:28.920]  as a result of the clearing member is defaulting through the cme group that's number one he said
[40:28.920 --> 40:37.400]  number two and this is the most important part since we are the guarantor of every transaction
[40:37.400 --> 40:44.600]  that happens in our markets we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of these
[40:44.600 --> 40:55.080]  contracts to do this we hold more than 100 billion of collateral to support the transactions
[40:55.640 --> 41:04.680]  that are being done on our markets okay terry boy over there in chicago with your good buddy
[41:04.680 --> 41:16.200]  daly from the machine where's the guarantee i know how to read i understand english the cme
[41:16.760 --> 41:25.320]  is either a fraud or this guy's a con or he's a liar you pick it it's one of those three
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.720]  because they're saying they guarantee it and we haven't gotten our money and they're saying
[41:31.720 --> 41:40.280]  it's only 700 million dollars short that's why the markets are falling apart there is no guarantor
[41:40.280 --> 41:50.360]  it's a lie a con or a fraud gerald this is news of which the magnitude i don't even have words
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.280]  to describe let me ask you this question and i think i know i'm gonna know the answer but
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.280]  you're on the inside of this now and i want to go back over exactly what this broker creature
[41:58.280 --> 42:05.000]  was telling you i want to break this down if they're admitting that the markets are falling apart
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.520]  and especially the futures markets because this is destroying confidence if if it's well known to
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.880]  even a layman like myself who just studies this is a novice that if you've got money in your account
[42:15.880 --> 42:21.880]  and then it's yours and it says on the account that it is segregated that is your money to take
[42:21.880 --> 42:28.440]  that as total fraud it's equivalent of wire fraud or basically bank robbery without a weapon that's
[42:28.440 --> 42:36.600]  a serious felony you can spend life in prison for this so why over 650 700 900 we see different
[42:36.600 --> 42:42.680]  numbers let's just say it's 700 million why over 700 million with a company that that has tens of
[42:42.680 --> 42:49.240]  millions of customers tied into trillions in in in different forms of assets why would they endanger
[42:49.240 --> 42:55.320]  the entire structure of this juncture over 700 900 million whatever it really is less than a billion
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.600]  dollars i think the answer is what you said three days ago here that's right they don't they don't
[43:00.600 --> 43:07.160]  have the product they don't have the goal to deliver and the same thing's going to happen with ets
[43:07.800 --> 43:15.160]  this is a big fraud this guy is shooting off his mouth saying that they're going to guarantee it
[43:15.160 --> 43:20.680]  and they have a hundred billion dollars in collateral a hundred billion dollars
[43:21.480 --> 43:29.880]  and terry boy you can't come up with 700 million so my belief is there's no money in there my belief
[43:29.880 --> 43:35.960]  this whole thing is one big scam pick up the papers look what's going on no no no gerald that's it
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.840]  this is bigger than made off this is the beginning there's no doubt and that's why they all love them
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.120]  on cmvc when this got brought up we're scared to death like they were in front of a firing squad
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.760]  gerald this is bigger than made off and they now admit the money isn't there that's why they said
[43:50.760 --> 43:55.720]  three days ago oh it's there it's an accident we'll give it back now they're saying okay the money
[43:55.720 --> 44:01.000]  in there just forget about it you've talked to them and they say listen gerald you want your
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.360]  500 000 or whatever it is i mean you won't say it's over 100 000 you're not getting it i mean these
[44:06.360 --> 44:12.040]  people are you're right you're not getting it and the whole thing how did they come up with this
[44:12.040 --> 44:18.520]  whole idea that they're going to take our money they took the money out of our accounts and they
[44:18.520 --> 44:27.080]  put it with a trustee oh yeah trust that trustee who made this one up as i said what are the
[44:27.080 --> 44:33.000]  landskis can get together with the coupons and we're giving it to this guy i mean they just make
[44:33.000 --> 44:41.560]  these rules up as they go along and here's the my big rub where's corezine where is he the guy that
[44:41.560 --> 44:48.600]  brought this company down oh by the way alex betting 40 to one that's right putting down one
[44:48.600 --> 44:55.400]  dollar and betting 40 on it who gets away with this the only people that get away with it are the
[44:55.400 --> 45:00.600]  criminals that have connections to the white house and wall street and let's talk right there
[45:00.600 --> 45:09.000]  corezine was up by the way he was up as it goes to be the next treasury secretary under obama's new
[45:09.000 --> 45:17.720]  term wow let me inject this anytime he's we still nobody's going after him why doesn't he go to jail
[45:17.720 --> 45:23.160]  until this thing is cleared up why don't they get his passport so he can't leave the country
[45:23.160 --> 45:28.840]  why isn't he doing a perp walk like you or i would do boy would they love to bring us down
[45:28.840 --> 45:36.360]  where are all those tough new york city finest that is that are spraying pepper spray at all ladies
[45:36.360 --> 45:43.560]  and beating up kids where are they you know where they are they're nothing more than enforcers for
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.800]  the financial crime bosses as they close off wall street you know am i losing it alex yes
[45:50.440 --> 45:58.040]  just like jesus christ did the only time the only time the man of peace lost his temper
[45:58.040 --> 46:04.040]  and pulled out the whip was to beat the money changers out of the temple and the temple in this
[46:04.040 --> 46:12.840]  country has become the banks we must bow to the bankers look at fox they run this peace today
[46:12.840 --> 46:22.040]  about oh poor corezine oh falling down from his heights this is what god christ angry and boy it
[46:22.040 --> 46:29.240]  has me angry and everybody out there i don't care what company you have your money with as i said
[46:29.240 --> 46:39.080]  raymond james infidelity charlie schwaab if they go bust you're gonna get the shaft you're not gonna
[46:39.080 --> 46:45.320]  get your money out of the bank read the headlines in the papers the banks in europe are coming up
[46:45.320 --> 46:53.960]  with all kinds of schemes trying to figure out how to keep this ponzi scheme going and you hit it
[46:53.960 --> 47:05.800]  you nailed it alex those little boys on cnbc they know it's a ponzi scheme it's collapsing
[47:05.800 --> 47:15.240]  they can't come up with 700 million dollars to quiet this thing down unbelievable and and but but
[47:15.240 --> 47:21.400]  gerald that was my question for you is that some people spend this about the 33 000 customers that
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.840]  have happened there uh their life savings stolen in many cases many of them widows you name it out of
[47:26.840 --> 47:34.120]  just plain old cash accounts where they take a delivery of cash in their accounts this will
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.480]  destroy confidence and it's not like he went and invested with corezine who's betting 40 to 1
[47:39.480 --> 47:45.800]  he came and gobbled up the established company you'd been using since the mid 70s but here's my
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.440]  question then why are they letting this happen now why have they just decided to hide this in plain
[47:52.440 --> 47:58.120]  view i mean even if they can't come up with 700 million you know the treasury could uh you know
[47:58.120 --> 48:03.160]  go somewhere and scrounge up 700 million in gold have they gone ahead and decided to set the
[48:03.160 --> 48:09.480]  precedent now with this and test it and see if they can get away with it a b i don't think they're
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.160]  getting away with it everybody i know including myself i've got to decide with the operating
[48:15.160 --> 48:21.720]  capital we've got in the business account to run my radio tv system my 35 employees i've got to
[48:21.720 --> 48:25.720]  decide what to do with that because it's true even though i've gotten some local banks and things
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.240]  it those can't be trusted because they're all tied into this i mean they are literally pulling out
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.800]  all confidence and i don't see how they're going to spend this and how they're going to get away
[48:35.800 --> 48:41.880]  with it i mean why did the one host jerald the actual anchor at the news desk say this is theft
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.240]  plain and simple it's destroying the markets he cuts to the guys they cover it up they cut back
[48:47.240 --> 48:53.720]  to him he goes to break and he comes back and says oh no nothing's going on here i mean and by the way
[48:53.720 --> 48:59.960]  again they all look scared jerald oh yeah they're scared as i say you you've you've covered the bases
[48:59.960 --> 49:06.120]  alex it's those possibilities it's number one they can't come up with the dough just like bernie
[49:06.120 --> 49:12.600]  made off couldn't come up with it it's a ponzi scheme number two yes they're setting us up
[49:12.600 --> 49:22.200]  they're seeing what public reaction is going to be and number three the whole system is collapsing
[49:22.200 --> 49:28.360]  look how they tried to promote they brought in the saviors over in europe into greece and into
[49:28.360 --> 49:35.400]  italy the goldman sacks gang to run the show and by the way the wrought trials would be jealous
[49:35.400 --> 49:41.400]  to see what the goldman boys have pulled off this is far greater than what they've ever done
[49:41.400 --> 49:47.320]  we got the goldman sacks boys that have been in the white house running the white house we got them
[49:47.320 --> 49:54.280]  from the tre- in the treasury you know they're all over the world you know this is huge it's
[49:54.280 --> 50:01.640]  collapsing it's collapsing and they're going to keep trying to prop it up they can't come up with
[50:01.640 --> 50:12.200]  the dough yes it is fraud yes it is a con who is behind it and there may be other people behind it
[50:12.200 --> 50:18.680]  and that's what we have to we will be maybe never find out to me that's one of the reasons why they
[50:18.680 --> 50:25.800]  are quieting this down this is a lot bigger than anybody knows to risk the whole commodities and
[50:25.800 --> 50:34.280]  derivatives exchange for seven hundred million dollars it's ridiculous stay there gerald well

[55:39.000 --> 55:44.280]  even worse than geithner a direct protege of robert rubin and larry summers the guys who
[55:44.280 --> 55:50.040]  busted glass deagle uh the former federal reserve head of the new york branch now they've got john
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.160]  corzine and this quote's here from obama talking about how he was a supporter back when no one
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.520]  knew how to pronounce his name and yet obama you know does the posturing as though he supports
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.800]  all the tax people and all these fake conservatives that demonize occupy wall street when it's a

[56:34.680 --> 56:43.240]  potential to potentially risky swaps to generate liquidity london european banks increasingly
[56:43.240 --> 56:51.960]  concerned about their ability to access funding are devising complex and potentially risky new
[56:51.960 --> 57:00.760]  deals that enable them to continue borrowing from the european central bank the banks moves
[57:00.760 --> 57:09.640]  which include behind the scenes swapping of assets among financial institutions could heighten risk
[57:09.640 --> 57:19.880]  across europe's already fragile financial system it says it right here this is white shoe boy language
[57:19.880 --> 57:26.600]  for they're going to come up with any scheme they can to make up another game to steal money from

[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.640]  and then i want to ask you the question after the break when the full audience is tuned in
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.440]  some stations don't carry this segment what are you going to do individually against these people
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:47.480]  that took your money charles lentek all right first of all finishing what i was saying is bigger than
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:54.120]  mf global it's a takeover in every way look alex those of us that are old enough to remember
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.240]  and i think about this whole generations two generations have no idea what this used to
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:05.240]  this country used to be like people could open up a hardware store you didn't have to go to work
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:11.560]  as a clerk for loads of home depot you could have your own store people used to open up their own
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:18.520]  pharmacies their drug stores with soda fountains in them i was a soda jerk during the end of that
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:26.360]  era you didn't have to work as a clerk for cvs a walmart a ride aid people used to be able to
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:33.640]  open up their own mom and shop stores clothing stores for men and women you didn't have to go
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.920]  to walmart which controls 10 percent of the action and be a clerk for them people in this country
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.440]  used to be able to start their own businesses and be their own entrepreneurs and now what they've
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.200]  done they've taken over every virtually every industry in this country under clinton with
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.600]  the broadcasting putting in the power of the hands of a few clear channel you know give me a
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:06.360]  break clear channel clear ripoff one after another they've deregulated this country laws that were
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:13.960]  put in place at the turn of the other century to stop the robber barons from robbing us so what
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:22.600]  i'm saying is the mf global is only part of a much bigger picture so you asked me what can we do
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.320]  there's only one thing i believe a couple of things we could do but one of them is
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:36.120]  break the chains all you cops out there to keep eating donuts and you have pension plans and
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:42.680]  you have these wonderful retirement plans you want to see your money when you retire guess what you're
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:50.680]  not going to get it because it's going to go under most likely like minded so instead of going to
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:59.400]  dunk in donuts go to your local coffee shop what people need to understand alex is that these huge
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:09.480]  companies and the mf global is the perfect example are so leveraged that you take away a little bit
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:20.600]  like 700 million to the entire cme group and you start seeing the whole thing collapse the whole
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:31.560]  thing begins to collapse all you need to do is everybody if you do your share and stop supporting
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:39.160]  the chains we could bring this country back to an entrepreneurial country another thing i keep
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:46.760]  hearing it all the time yeah they blame labor for everything you want every day low prices you have
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:54.600]  every day low quality with every day low quality jobs you gotta stay there gerald gotta go break

[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:58.200]  just said nah we're taking your money you know i'm doing what i can but you're fighting against
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:05.800]  you know i the system is so rigged that you can't get in there so what i'm doing is i'm exposing the
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:13.800]  crooks i'm exposing the cons and the frauds and please put up that video that you had uh i forget
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.200]  the fellow who did did the piece on it last night who uh who posted it he did an excellent job
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:28.120]  in revealing it about the cme group and the and they're either as i said it's either a lie a con or
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:35.320]  a fraud they said they were going to guarantee it up to a hundred billion dollars so what my work is
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:42.520]  as yours is is to keep exposing it and we can we could change the system are we talking about rob
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.480]  dude everyone else speaks up sure well and well let's get more into that and then get Aaron's take
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.400]  on this but Gerald are you talking about in the nightly news last night hosted by rob do
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.480]  yes but not that it robbed at a great job but whoever posted the piece on there that what we
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:06.040]  broke about the cme groups duffy uh terrence duffy saying that no one lost the penny with cme group
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.800]  and that the cme group which is the exchange like the new york sock exchange the commodities and
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:19.080]  derivative exchange they said they're backing this by a hundred billion dollars so whoever posted that
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:24.920]  piece on your site i forgot his name he did a great job in it get Paul Watson what was it
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:35.640]  patrick henningsson no another name uh erin dykes hurt nimo yes that was okay okay okay tell me
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.800]  tell me the headline and then after you leave us uh we'll uh we'll uh play that piece because i
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.840]  haven't seen it i've been on the road why is this so bombshell breakdown for folks what you're talking
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:52.360]  about specifically i sent this piece to you specifically because thank you it says i have a
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:15:00.760]  video tape of the head of the cme group terrence duffy saying that no one's ever lost the penny
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:08.280]  with the cme group in commodities exchange going back to the depression and that they are guaranteeing
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:16.120]  it to a tune of a hundred billion dollars he said this at a press conference with mayor daly
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:23.480]  last year they've gone as i said it's either a con a lie or okay so you're saying curtain nimo did
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.640]  an article with that video and we need to get that out to people we'll certainly cover that
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:35.800]  everyone should send it viral send it all to the media it's the biggest breaking story out there
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:41.880]  our system is a fraud and this proves it gerald do you remember the headline on that and we'll uh
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.960]  we'll repost it on the front page and make sure it gets emailed out or we'll call
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:50.600]  nimo up here to the front office and find out what the headline is and put nimo in studio because
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.080]  this is big the fact that they're telling you hey this is a hundred percent backed a hundred percent
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.600]  assured but but but listen they're already admitting the stock market's down hundreds of
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.600]  billions over this they're already admitting that this is endangering the entire commodity's future
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:12.520]  market derivatives even further why why would they not pay the 700 million this isn't this is incredible
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.280]  i don't believe they have it just like bernie didn't have it if they have it put it up because they
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:24.840]  said they'd put up a hundred billion here's the thing salenti cme discussed guarantee oversight
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:32.840]  on mf global and the show i did last night with rob it was it we hit the points over and over
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:39.480]  this needs to be brought out there it's a ponzi scheme why aren't they coming up with the money
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:47.160]  after taryn stuffy said they would guarantee it to the tune of a hundred billion not 700 million
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.560]  all right uh erin dykes i've raised a lot of points gerald's raised a lot of points the last
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.240]  four minutes we have or three minutes left for them any other questions or comments you've got
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:02.600]  from gerald and gerald any other points you think need to be made here today well first of all alex
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.160]  the article that gerald is talking about the headline is salenti cma did not guarantee oversight in
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:14.440]  mf global scandal that was curt's uh very nice article from yesterday afternoon we didn't get
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.640]  to cover it until the overdrive segment on the radio show but that's why we got rob dew covering
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.880]  it in depth on the nightly news last night and he's right it breaks down really what is a fraudulent
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.760]  promise to guarantee this money when clearly they're just running interference for the big boys
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.320]  and now the system's just trying to play stupid i mean listen i'm not just saying this folks i've
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.800]  studied this i've called a lot of stuff and i agree with gerald i think this is going to end up
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.680]  probably completely blowing up i've got to say a hundred times the size of made off because with
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.600]  made off that was 60 70 billion with the cme group and all these other groups at mf global and what
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.120]  it ties into this ties into tens of trillions uh does it not in the entire global derivatives
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:03.560]  futures market gerald yes it does they're they're talking a number in that videotape of 800 trillion
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.160]  or some number like that some ridiculous number that that that they that they work with uh i i
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.920]  don't have in front of me right now i had a second ago let me grab it hold on one second well i mean
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:19.640]  they argue the numbers they talk about 1.5 quadrillion and they say this area is eight hunt
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:27.000]  here i got it right here this is that terence uh uh uh duffy he said to do this we hold more than
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.840]  100 billion dollars of collateral here and and each and every one of these contracts which
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:45.000]  means facilitating the transfer of 800 trillion trillion 800 trillion dollars of risk he says
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.080]  it's on that video and they can't even give you 700 million they can't even give 33 000
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:57.560]  depositors their own personal accounts of 700 million this shows wild and empty giant fraud
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:03.400]  we're talking about thousands of quadrillions 800 billion excuse me trillions really just with
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.480]  just with this company and they can't even give salente his couple hundred thousand
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:15.000]  that's what we're saying it's a Ponzi scheme or else come up with the money i i don't want
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:23.080]  to hear anything else it's all hot air and again why isn't bernie made uh bernie made off
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:30.440]  why isn't corezine doing a perp walk how do they have this passport unbelievable

[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.680]  today so i didn't want to have him waiting in the wings would have been a good day to have him
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.280]  on the financial news we'll see bob next friday lord willing erin dykes is riding shotgun as he
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.680]  does when i'm out of town in case there's any technical difficulties but it's also great to
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:42.360]  always have erin's researched insight into things i want to open the phones up now with the news
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.240]  we've covered there's a lot of other news we haven't gotten to yet are any issue you want to raise
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.680]  i'd love to hear from everybody i want to take first-time callers in the first couple of rounds
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.680]  because the genesis phone system only takes six calls we probably should take it on our phone
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.080]  system we can take a hundred calls but hint hint genesis let's add some more phone lines but
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.120]  i tend to go call slowly so it doesn't really matter but when you hear a caller hang up
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:18.840]  that's your chance to join us on air the toll-free number is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 i am going
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:24.120]  to hand over the rest of this segment and a little bit of the next to erin to cover a lot of the piles
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.320]  of news he's got and to break down his take on what salente was just covering and the incredible
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:37.320]  draconian um police state admitted takeover of the private banks of europe and england without a
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:42.360]  vote i mean this is i knew this was coming but man it's something else to see it actually happening
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.640]  and to know what's coming next who the new world order is not nice all you people out there that
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.720]  made fun of us i feel sorry for you i told you the technocrats are getting ready to launch
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.360]  their global banking takeover three months ago with that ad you hear air the technocratic elite
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.080]  are taking over now what do they call themselves we are the technocrats you will be absorbed i'm
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.840]  going to throw it to erin dives to the rest of this segment a little bit of the next i'll then

[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.040]  in here and you know how bad i am with with systems i haven't studied all right we'll be uh
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:36.120]  taking your calls again coming up 800 25 at 9 9231 800 25 at 9 9231 erin dykes i'm handing the baton
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.240]  to you for the next 10 minutes or so thanks alexa and it's true the bankers are taking over and
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:47.080]  there's layers of layers of homeland security and other groups who prepare to deal with the
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.320]  backlash from the people uh you see it now with the massive protests going on and occupy in other
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.440]  areas and they're prepared to deal with it in order to allow the bankers to fully take over
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.160]  and implement their new plan of rulership through strictly economic means as they bring down the
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.600]  economies especially in the western world but i wanted to get into steve watson's amazing article
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:17.720]  here supreme court blocks government plan to claim ownership of dna and it's a ruling in the
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.640]  minnesota supreme court that the department of health is violating the law in storing using and
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:29.080]  disseminating no newborn screening test results and newborn dna that's something alex has covered
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.760]  uh for his entire span of being on air many people cast doubt on this didn't believe it was going on
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.400]  now it's being more and more fully exposed and steve watson writes that a long-running case in a
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.800]  long-running case the supreme court is ruled to limit the use of blood samples collected
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.800]  from newborns the case has exposed the fact that there is an ongoing semi-covert movement
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.360]  by state and federal governments to claim ownership of every newborn baby's dna for the
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.800]  purpose of genetic research without the consent of individuals and they've essentially ruled that
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.760]  the department of health would have to have explicit consent to use and store the blood
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.400]  samples right now it's kind of on an opt-out level within that state but we know this is going on
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.040]  across the country it's a big issue and uh in 2003 the citizens council for health freedom
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.680]  formerly known as the citizens council on health care discovered that the minnesota department of
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:28.120]  health had been indefinitely storing the blood of newborns since the mid-80s using the samples
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:34.680]  for purposes beyond the state's newborn screening since 1997 and since 2008 health department
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:40.520]  officials have been seeking exemption for the so-called dna warehouse so there they are trying
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:47.240]  to get out of laws preventing them from collecting and using and sending out this dna research
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:53.320]  to larger bodies we know there's the human genome project trying to map the entire uh
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:59.160]  background race development of the human species and the rest of it they also use this research
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:05.560]  for background on bioweapons for vaccines and all the rest of it and do you really want to trust
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:11.880]  these unknown shadowy entities with that level of information i think not we've had a guess like
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:18.440]  twyla brason before exposing this in fact she's part of that group cchf maybe it's time to get
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:24.440]  her back on we'll look into that uh we'll get more into other news on the other side alex is
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.560]  still with us of course and there's everything there's the use of these emergency alert messages
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:35.320]  you saw the takeover of television and radio communications earlier this month and the feds
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:40.680]  already announced they want to go to cell phones and internet platforms next now sprint is going to
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.800]  be part of that we'll get into that on the other side stay tuned info wars dot com and tonight on

[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.640]  show this is erin dykes i'm riding shotgun with alex as he pointed out he'll be back in just a few
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:39.160]  moments here we're kind of running the houston command center while alex's cape canaveral
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.720]  is out on the road obviously great that he could spend some time with the family while
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.000]  bringing you breaking news and we told you this was coming back when they were testing the emergency
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.560]  alert messages just a few weeks ago by taking over tv and radio which was in some ways a
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.200]  failed attempt it was bungled and garbled there's a lot of noise there were reports the different
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:07.400]  stations were layering it over with repeated audio or or pop songs and now sprint has announced
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:13.880]  that it's going to be participating in mandatory emergency alert messages on cell phones and it'll
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.960]  be an opt-in situation where you can download the program for existing phones but new phones will
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:26.200]  apparently be equipped with a chip which allows the federal government to break in with emergency
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:30.840]  emergency messages and you could bet their surveillance technology there as well it's
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.320]  something alex has warned you about for years and years and now it's going to happen and they say
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:40.520]  the internet takeover is next they warned a few weeks ago that they would be doing this and now
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:46.200]  one of the major communications companies has begun this process the others are in on it as well
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:50.840]  when you only have a few companies it's not really a free market situation where the companies can
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.160]  represent people and decide whether or not to participate in this kind of technology so it's
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:02.600]  kind of a soft mandatory situation and uh going into the details paul joseph watson writes and
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.840]  this is uh red linked on drudge right now so a lot of people are going to be reading this the
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.960]  telecommunication giant sprint has announced the launch of its wireless emergency alerts program
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:16.440]  that will deliver messages from the federal government directly to millions of americans
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:22.920]  it's part of a system set to become mandatory on all new cell phones and the wireless alerts allow
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:28.120]  the federal emergency management agency to accept and deliver warning messages to wireless networks
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:33.720]  uh from the president of the u.s the national weather service and other state and local emergency
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:41.000]  operation centers meanwhile i find it very uh telling what a puppet position the presidency
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.400]  has become uh this is kind of a small technicality here uh or maybe not maybe it's a bigger thing
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:54.600]  obama uses auto pen to keep government open and they get into how obama's overseas on his
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.040]  diplomatic trip to the pacific rim uh where they're trying to finagle what they are calling
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.560]  the american pacific century highlighting the importance of negotiating with china and trying
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.320]  to maintain military presence in that area meanwhile he's signing legislation to keep
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:17.560]  government open on a debt bill using a copy of his signature and a mechanical device
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.680]  that is certainly controversial and uh they get into how in the past they've had to fly
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:27.320]  legislation to far parts of the world for presidents like reagan and clinton to sign
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.680]  it and they're saying what a waste of money that is uh therefore under the george w bush
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.880]  administration some of his lawyers i don't know which ones perhaps the same ones that said torture
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:44.440]  was okay that using uh unnamed things on children's testicles was okay to get information uh some of
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.600]  those lawyers perhaps decided it was okay to use an auto pen to sign legislation now bush
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:57.240]  apparently never used it but obama has he did it earlier this year okaying an extension of the
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:02.520]  patriot act well isn't that nice uh so it's just a little technical thing in the constitution
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.120]  that the president shall sign any bills that he approves as the language stipulates but now
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.840]  somehow a copy is good enough and alex has broken down how vestigial our formal government has
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.480]  outlined under the under the constitution has become it's not enough to buy out all the members of
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:25.240]  congress and and lobby them heavily and corrupt them through and through it's not enough that the
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:31.880]  president uh really isn't the person at whom the buck stops it's really always been his advisors
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.280]  more and more elitist as the decades roll on whether they're from the council on foreign
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:41.960]  relations or someone else with nearly similar ideology whether it's stuffing the administration
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:49.080]  with uh open looters and bankers like geese jeff emilt who's shipping jobs overseas even as he's
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.280]  part of the supposed jobs plan whether it's plans to bring in people like eric schmidt of google to
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:01.240]  be commerce secretary or the latest uh apparent crook john corzine of the mf global scandal he
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:06.520]  was apparently tapped to be the next treasury secretary i mean it's just totally a puppet
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.960]  position you've known this for a long time i mean what is the president anyway uh given how much
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:17.160]  we've been hijacked by the national security state how much we've been taken over by elitist
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:22.840]  interest and what a fraud our whole electoral process has become but at the same time is this
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:29.000]  not another violation of the constitution signing bills with a mechanical signature uh perhaps that's
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.080]  something to debate and discuss but it is in the news meanwhile washington's blog is discussing how
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.360]  the occupy movement is protesting the same thing that the founding fathers protested in the boston
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.640]  tea party and what's more the more recent incarnation of the tea party also started out
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.480]  essentially protesting the same time the undue influence of big business in government at the
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:58.040]  time of the revolution in 1776 in the years preceding it when it built up the founding fathers
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:03.960]  were not happy in particular with the brit the british east india company which had you know
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:10.440]  easy access to the markets and a virtual monopoly and a very cozy relationship with the british
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.240]  government of course you know the east india tea company was involved in so much from the opium
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:22.840]  wars in china on down and all manner of looting and piracy but at the same time our founders did
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:30.840]  see the danger of this close and cozy relationship between authoritarian government and big business
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.600]  and so washington's blog gets all into that as to how the modern tea party and the modern occupied
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.400]  movement were really fighting against very similar things though they have been co-opted now and
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:46.920]  steered in diverse of directions really everyone sees what's going on but then when you get down
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:52.680]  to the individual level the details fray out and a lot of the meaning is lost it's definitely
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.200]  significant that egyptians are back in the streets protesting the military rule of their country
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:04.520]  they put off the new elections and the new constitution now 10 months after mubarak has
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:10.920]  been ousted people unhappy that the military has so far refused to give up power but they say they're
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:16.520]  just trying to keep civil order and that they always wanted a civilian government to take hold
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:21.640]  so we'll see how things develop there but massive protests going on a lot of people upset in the
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:28.360]  wake of that arab spring which was instantly hailed as a great move for democracy and a new wave of
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.280]  change in the middle east meanwhile the muslim brotherhood is being represented in libya and
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.360]  they are apparently going to be overseers in syria where there's quite a bit of tensions for war
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:46.920]  russia's blockading ships there now kind of warning against taking military action there and again
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.440]  we know there is a hit list of countries particularly in the middle east and central asian region
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.760]  countries in africa as well that are scheduled for military takeover sometime down the line
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.360]  people like wesley clark have named that list it does include iran it does include syria
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.000]  it included libya which they've taken over and it certainly included iraq which they have also
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.520]  taken over and other related countries as well i think lebanon on the list if i'm not mistaken
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:22.520]  don't have that right in front of me in political news you've got this uh real suspicious attempted
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:27.960]  what they're calling an attempted assassination plot the man who fired gunshots at the white house
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:35.240]  he's been questioned now he's been arrested and faces life in jail meanwhile was this some
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:41.000]  sort of staged event to buoy obama's reelection chances was it a real attempt and who was this
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.920]  guy anyway there are articles on info wars dot com today about that but frankly it pales in
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:54.040]  comparison to the total economic takeover going on in particular in europe not only in italy where
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:42:00.360]  bill berg steering member technocrats have seized the government and plan to implement these austerity
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:08.280]  measures but through this new ec excuse me through this new mechanism uh that merkel and sarcosi are
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.600]  hanchoing which would totally take over countries admittedly put them into receivership and run
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:20.600]  those countries into the ground if necessary meanwhile siphoning off from general european
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:26.840]  taxpayers what they consider to be an unlimited pool of money as a backstop for these defaulting
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.160]  countries they first said they wanted one trillion then that that wouldn't be enough
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:37.640]  and that they wanted a quote unlimited financial bazooka of money under this new totally new uh
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:44.920]  monetary vehicle that would sort of float above uh any remaining european sovereignty and threaten
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.000]  to jeopardize that directly in fact it's a total measure against sovereignty and that's one of the
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.560]  things that makes it so dangerous and you see britain uh kind of posturing and uh but you could
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:01.240]  see where they're not going to have a vote most likely they don't want to referendum they want to
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.520]  move this through very quickly of course they want to jam through these plans uh but why shouldn't the
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:11.800]  people of europe be able to have a vote whether it's in britain or any other country there uh
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:17.720]  ireland had a vote they voted no uh in terms of joining the european constitution and they just held
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.840]  another vote until the people were finally duped into saying yes that's the kind of thing going on
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:29.000]  in europe where they're really strong arming things you've also got stories like this one out of the
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.600]  guardian uh from two days ago november 16th and it regards the fake terror plots paid informants
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:44.040]  and the tactics of fbi entrapment questioned and they have repeatedly been caught really admittedly
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:51.160]  entrapping so-called suspects of uh al-qaeda or other terrorist networks into taking action really a
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.800]  lot of them are unrelated to any kind of fundamentalist networks they don't have a background even in
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:06.600]  islamic uh mentality it's just street people who've been set up and uh duped into agreeing to take
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:12.840]  action by the fbi in this particular case and there's dozens of cases we've gone through them as
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.960]  as they've come in over the years the underwear bomber probably just one of many uh where there
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:24.280]  was a clear setup the world trade center in 1993 was an extremely clear setup we have audio of one
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:29.880]  of the fbi informants explaining how they gave the bomb and showed them how to use it and uh
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:36.200]  substituted a dummy bomb for a real one in time for the bombing that killed four people injured
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.640]  many more and uh really sent a symbolic shock into new york that would later take hold with the

[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:37.320]  listening to you guys for just a little while and uh i know this is a bit off topic of what you guys
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:43.160]  have been talking about but i thought it might really interest you um if you take the game
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.960]  informer which is a magazine that is all about video games i'm not into the video games but he
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:54.840]  showed it and he said he wanted me to read it and the whole article was about a new game uh tom
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:02.200]  clancy based rainbow six uh patriots and i thought well that sounds kind of interesting and so i read
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:08.680]  the article and they they actually have in there the southern property law center and the whole
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:15.080]  article is about can you fire on americans and i mean it's just such propaganda it just made me
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.080]  sick and i thought well i was listening to your show and i said well these guys might like to hear
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.680]  this and i just let me stop you let me stop you i know about the magazine informer because i've
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:31.480]  seen it on newsstands i'm going to send the crew to get that right now and then they can cut in this
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:37.400]  evening the audio and video of you talking about it with myself then we can cut to the video of the
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.720]  actual game you are the police you're an anti-terrorism unit you even shoot and kill cops if they get
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.840]  your way here in the u.s it's all about training you tortures cool shooting cops is cool if it's
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.320]  for the greater good and yes you train to take on the patriots who are the bad people they don't
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:00.200]  like the fellow reserve they don't like golden sex they don't like the people taking old ladies
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:08.120]  pension funds they fight for the loving bankers who are taking on the evil ron paul type patriots
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:15.080]  and yes two weeks ago i was shown the trailer for it and from the rainbow six website we're on the
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.720]  brooklyn bridge and there's a there's a guy who's got a bomb strapped to him by the patriots the
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.520]  evil patriots who have to be dealt with of course and so all these young people are watching the
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.240]  simulating it and then the cops are trying to kill the guy but the bomb's going to go off so the
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:36.440]  special forces people are shooting the u.s cops to stop the greater damage of the bridge being
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:41.240]  blown up and this is the situational ethics they teach they teach this in law enforcement for
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.360]  at least 14 years i know of that you know torture is cool and a guy's going to release anthrax bombs
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.520]  do you torture his kids to make him answer questions do you save 10 000 by torturing his
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:57.000]  kid yes you do and they all fantasize about being jack bower and it's all total mind control and yes
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.720]  most the new point and shoot video games you know first person shooter games now i've always been
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.840]  about killing mutated humans it's all about simulated murder seeing fellow humans a scum the
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:13.160]  show cops is always about showing white trash and scum the cops are always the good guys the
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:19.480]  citizens of the bad guys the scum and yes it's all now in rainbow six about murdering the evil
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.960]  patriots but then in real world we have the training manuals gun owners conservatives
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.000]  returning veterans libertarians those are the enemies so tell me again the name of the magazine
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:35.160]  and and what issue it is i'll send folks over to local barns and noble because that's where the
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.960]  guys are going to find it or h.e.b. or wherever and then we can do a report on it tonight or we
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.560]  can do one next week but but this is the type of stuff that they teach in these and it's it's
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.520]  literally hundreds of games now so it's uh and i can confirm what you're saying i meant to get to
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:54.760]  this two weeks ago i didn't know that they were glorifying the southern property law center as
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.480]  our new commissar commander saying do you have what it takes to take on the american people
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.280]  they've been saying this was coming they were coops for it but now they're right and yes we're
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:08.760]  coming for them uh so so uh erin's gonna write down the name of this what's the name of the magazine
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:15.000]  again uh game and former and uh something else about that when you read the article uh when they
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.160]  closed the southern property law center they're talking about how many more uh militias have
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.680]  been formed since 2000 oh i can't remember what it was but the whole i mean it's just unbelievable
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.560]  the propaganda in there and these are for children supposed to be for children is what gets me and
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:36.520]  they uh are basically gonna have these children the next generation will be the ones that will
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:42.120]  be firing on america of course sir sir sir let me stop you i'm gonna break this down come back

[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:33.320]  before that they take screenshots of it of the video and put it online the main enemy is malicious
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:40.200]  the main enemy is gun owners the main enemy is anti-new world forces and you and of course
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:46.920]  the militias always engage in atrocities and are terrorists and evil and yes it's totally
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:51.880]  disgusting these video games for adults that don't know and of course a lot of adults don't even have
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:56.280]  lives they just play video games it's very sad i'm not saying playing some isn't okay but the
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:02.120]  point is it's a bunch of brainwashing be aware of it the main enemy is conservative libertarian
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.240]  returning veterans then in the real world and i want to do a piece about this in the real world you
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:13.320]  have the new york times and other publications we're in the first paragraph of the article it says
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.680]  the explorer scouts trained to take on the disgruntled iraq vet they take him out and kill him
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.480]  and then you learn explorer scouts across the country people laugh oh those are 14 year old
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:29.880]  kids really this program has been going on for five years they're now 19 have been simulating the
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:36.440]  killing of patriots i remember talking to the rotc out of the major university in san antonio
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.960]  and i was at the documents a decade ago and then and then when i covered it other people
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:47.400]  sent me info you know the rotc trains to take on at every major university in the us
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:54.120]  they do warfare simulation drills against conservative libertarian constitutional
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.240]  militias the southern prairie law center the adl comes in like literal russians that have taken
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.600]  over and read dawn and walk around to the local sympathizers going these are the enemies of our
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.800]  system they are the and sometimes they even say you are part of the new world order and they just
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:15.320]  sit there i mean this is so creepy and traitorous we're living like in a movie but it's really
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:21.000]  happening everything we've talked about is unfolding of course they're selling 10 15 20
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.240]  sometimes 50 million of these video games they're making billions off some video game franchises
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:33.800]  they're bigger than movies now you know they're $50 upwards of $100 for these and the people are
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:40.920]  buying them and they simulate all day torturing murdering killing militias killing american gun
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:46.040]  owners and these kids are fantasizing and then they go and fly real drones they go out and join
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.840]  the real military and that's why cops freak out now i i want to go back to know from oklahoma

[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.160]  that we can go out and buy it and actually show folks the magazine article this is big breaking

[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:31.240]  that but uh i read the thing i didn't even look at the issue but i know it's the latest issue
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:36.440]  because it comes out before it comes on the newsstand because he gets in the mail so i'm sure

[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.160]  because they come out a month beforehand or maybe sometimes two months but it's the latest we can
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.600]  do a search on it i'll guarantee you somebody's already written about it a lot of times they're
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:55.000]  top articles online um and again that's a game informer i see that magazine everywhere it's

[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:30.520]  video games were invented by the pentagon in the 1970s that's on record
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.720]  and they grew out of these automated shooting ranges where paper targets with different human
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:44.600]  images would pop up to create instinctive shooting or dehumanize targets because in warfare even
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:51.480]  very masculine tough people don't like to kill folks right up close a lot of people about half
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.120]  of them on average would hesitate bayonetting somebody at point blank range or shooting somebody
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:01.560]  in the head but they learn by paper targets it got it up to about 75 percent on average were
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:06.840]  willing to shoot and now it's about 98 percent will kill somebody right up close because of video
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:13.320]  games and doom itself was a first person shooter game developed for pentagon desensitization so
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:20.200]  it's a fact now in almost all of these first person shooter games the main enemy is the militia
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.280]  sometimes there's other factions as well you could pick factions you want to be part of in some of
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  the games but it's all part of the traitorous activity of tom clancy and rainbow six and all
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.400]  their globalist brainwashing they are training to wage war against the american people the entire
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.240]  homeland security greatest for that now i want to bring it to all your calls now the guy got me
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.440]  really upset bringing that up no you got the floor now for a couple minutes then we'll get
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.160]  air and stake we'll come back from break and go to more calls quickly but uh again breakdown
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.960]  what your son said to you what happened uh say it all in one piece now go ahead actually it was
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.000]  my nephew but um what what i was trying to say was i just have two more points and i'll let you go
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.200]  one of them is in the article i think the guy that came up with this game his last name was
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.520]  sears he was like the director i don't remember his first name the last name was sears and they
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.400]  were having quotes from him in there and one of the quotes i can't quote verbatim but he said
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:19.080]  we're tired of the you know typical uh arab or you know the typical uh russian uh bad guy so we
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.520]  wanted to do something different and i thought right i mean wow what is your deal man i mean
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:29.480]  you're gonna have these children getting this this christmas and they're gonna say hey man
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.920]  if uh you're not with uh the uh homeland security and you're not uh uh you know
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.280]  they're gonna they're gonna be having these children growing up to be the ones that fire on
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.080]  us just like the ones uh i told my wife i said these are the same people that came out to defend
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:49.960]  the penn state i said those kind of people are the same people that are going to be the ones
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:54.360]  if anybody ever out there questions who's going to be firing on americans it's the ones playing
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:00.200]  this video game and the ones coming out to defend uh pedophiles and the other point by the way sir
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:06.440]  that's only the cover oh we just got the idea to make rainbow six about fighting militias bull
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:12.760]  listen i cover this i've been tracking this for more than 14 years with video games they
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:19.400]  all of these first person shooter games have got a version at least where you fight american
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:24.920]  patriots and again you dovetail this with all the police manuals with the internal manuals the
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.880]  myack the homeland security this is a premeditated program do you have to remember the name of the
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:37.560]  article i mean i guess it's the new issue uh of uh game and former uh breaking down rainbow six
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:44.360]  you flip to it i mean this is like a six or seven or eight page long full page colored
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:49.800]  i'm going further it actually quotes southern poverty law center like see this is reality-based
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.920]  we've got to train to kill these people that said foreign banks and the un were going to take over
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:04:00.680]  because the un and the foreign banks are taking over you we uh oh this is so sick i mean again
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.400]  we are the real americans we are the resistance we are the people that did the research we were
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.280]  right and now they're training the the boy scouts to take us on they're training the military the
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:15.800]  police they've got citizen tattletale squads they've got psas on tv saying don't even trust
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:21.000]  your best friend this is the terrorist this is the foreign banks these are the criminals
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.560]  god bless you my friend erin dykes take us out to break what's your take on this well it's obviously
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:31.480]  a dehumanization tactic by the same general uh field that's trying to take us into this new
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:37.320]  world of cyborgs and high technology and and entering yeah what you called earlier the matrix
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:42.360]  it's just sad it's obviously going to brainwash a lot of people you spend many more hours playing
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:47.880]  these video games than you do watching a movie or a tv program no one exactly no one should buy
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.920]  this stuff for their kids your kids should be on the swim team playing football oil painting hiking

[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:40.520]  path and i was actually aware of this with horror two weeks ago but it shows how conditioned i am
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:47.720]  that i never even covered it because i'm so conditioned another of the myriad video games
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:52.680]  that brainwash tens of millions of americans and others have come out tom clancy's rainbow six
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:57.400]  and i'm just going off this from the caller i've already watched the video game i've already
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:03.640]  watched his trailers you take on american patriots american conservatives american libertarians and
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:09.800]  kill them and you're a special team that kills the evil militias that are fighting the loving banks
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.720]  the southern private law center is your advisor and they're going to help you take on the american
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:18.520]  people i mean this this is like a nightmare if they told somebody in the 60s there'll be things
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.720]  called video games where you simulate killing other americans who don't want the un to take over
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:28.600]  and who talk about a new world order and now a new world order is being announced a global government
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:33.960]  by the mega banks bankrupting the planet as we told you they would by design they're so arrogant
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.520]  they admit it's their plan they've got the explorer scouts training to take on quote disgruntled
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:42.840]  veterans and they admit it the new york times they've got all these training manuals the cops
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:48.680]  actually believe it the cops actually get scared if they pull you over and find a pocket constitution
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:53.400]  i've got a video of it from their own squad car and road to tyranny they start literally freaking
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:10:00.120]  out and it's like mind control are they like putting them on drugs or something somebody comes
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.200]  to insist we're going to deal with these people that are into liberty and freedom and they talk
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:09.080]  about a new world order and global government and then it all comes true and then we're still the
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.720]  terrorist we're still the bad guys and and you know some of the public are like i'm going to join
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:20.600]  with a new world order they're my friends i i'm so thankful for them erin what do you think of this
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:26.680]  i mean this is such anti-freedom anti-america brainwashing you watch movies like red dawn
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:34.360]  that cover a fictitious soviet takeover of the west coast in the northwest and they take over the
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:39.320]  town they brainwash people they put up movie screens you know brainwashing people against
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:45.160]  liberty and promoting the soviet system they get kids the title on their parents they do all the
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:50.200]  same stuff this criminal government's doing and they're putting up telescreens say report on your
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:56.280]  neighbors they're on tv saying can't trust your best friend meanwhile they are the terrorist on
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:01.080]  record working for foreign banks destroying everything i mean now they're taking people's
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:06.040]  private bank accounts and i guess if you don't like it you're a terrorist i mean does america
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.960]  realize authoritarianism has come and and the new world order is the enemy erin well i can only
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:17.880]  speculate exactly on what the motives are behind the propaganda and entertainment and video games
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.840]  and so forth but i think on one level it's kind of shifting the spectacles so that people who aren't
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:28.680]  paying attention sort of buy into the fantasy of it even as it's becoming a reality and meanwhile
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:34.200]  people who read up on it and are against the issues they just become numb to it because it's so in
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  their face even in the entertainment world but what you know the story behind the story is
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:46.040]  wireplaces like the southern poverty law center always quoted always look to as some authoritarian
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:51.240]  source when they know nothing they have no real information they're just trying to demonize broad
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.960]  sectors of the political well they were intimately involved in running hella heme city where oklahoma
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:02.600]  city was cooked up it came out in federal documents this is a very wicked globalist tool to demonize
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:06.920]  people that would stop the banker takeover remember they said new world order isn't real
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:14.040]  global banking takeover isn't real it's insane cop killers talk about it and now it's all out in the
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:19.480]  open and they're like okay the global government's real but it's nothing let's you know torture is
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:25.240]  good secret arrest is good this video game where the military hunts down the american gun owners
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:33.000]  and kills them this is very good the global system is here soon will purge america of those
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.920]  enemy john wane types the freedom we're so liberal there's nothing liberal about them but erin
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  expanding on this i don't think they're going to get away with this i mean people
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:48.600]  are really waking up to them i want to go to calls here but i keep forgetting to plug something

[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:58.440]  another game out there i tried to call about it a few months ago it's called champions online and
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  what it is that you start offering this american city that's getting attacked and then it moves forward
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:09.560]  for a few months and the united nations is there the group called until but it's an acronym that the
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:14.920]  un stands for united nations and they actually argue to do missions for them to kind of stabilize
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.480]  the area and one of those missions is called ending the terror and you actually go out and
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:27.640]  just your mission is just to kill 200 at hunter dash patriot is what they're called and that's
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:33.240]  your mission is to go do that all the old hunters though guys that were camo oh yeah i mean to have
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:38.440]  shattered union where you do that the un invades but the again the bankers implode us and they bring
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.400]  in foreign troops they've actually signed the agreements i've been there at drills covered
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:49.000]  my police state films where the troops openly train with foreign troops to not just take our guns
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  but execute us that's in police state 2000 uh what do you think of this i mean other gamers you talk
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.240]  to are they seeing through this this anti-american new world order garbage well i don't i don't play
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:07.000]  games that much anymore that was one that i was playing uh but that's not even why i called uh i
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.560]  was i was calling you it's funny that he said that it's not neary but i was wondering if you ever
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.760]  thought about like the track type of uh tampling that you can hand out with just some hard hitting
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:21.720]  information on it and maybe a radio station or something that would be yes yes we need to put
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.600]  out some simple pamphlets like pamphlet packets that are real cheap at cost they just have basic
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:31.640]  facts for people but but again how does that counter the glitz and sexiness of a murder
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:37.240]  simulation game where you kill the evil right winger hunters oh evil deer hunters must be
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:43.640]  murdered evil patriots but no that's a great idea sir all right well we love you man appreciate

[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.400]  drills where they try to take our guns with foreign trips and admits for america uh let's

[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.560]  him and see how he served the system but notice they didn't give him the memo on the vaccines
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:05.720]  that they know full well have been doing this for 50 years we've gone from one in 25 000 with
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:12.680]  autism to one in 58 cancers that they're doing it on purpose all you people that serve the system

[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:35.400]  poisons in the metals uh in fact i had an opportunity to talk to doctor tent any myself
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:41.880]  for a couple years back specifically about this issue and just how you know we as americans can
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:46.760]  get up to speed with what they're doing and how to stay healthy with simple things like homeopathy
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:53.480]  simple things like uh nutrition and herbs and as you say staying away from uh fluoride to heal
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:58.680]  the body and so the conference provided a really a wealth of information from people around the
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:03.320]  cutting edge in fact dr buttar put out a book called the nine steps to keep the doctor away
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:09.640]  and let's get dr buttar on the nine steps keep the doctor away good to hear from you got a jump
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:14.120]  erin what's your take on what he was just talking about well there's all kinds of stuff that they
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:19.880]  don't seem to want regular america people to use i mean just entering into the vitamin world has
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.440]  revealed to me that there's a lot of stuff we could be using to our advantage but instead
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:29.640]  they push these gmo's on us i mean i don't know very much in particular about by the way erin
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:35.720]  we've got you've got to let me use you as a poster boy for uh for uh what health does because and
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:40.280]  especially the the longevity you've been taking because folks look at erin look at we've got to
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:45.480]  do before and after how many pounds have you lost the last three four months uh exercising and
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:51.400]  doing longevity but also other health uh healthy things yeah who would have known diet and exercise
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:56.840]  but um yeah a significant amount i don't know exactly how much well it's a it's a lot i mean
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.160]  and you weren't like you were a little you know plubby like me and and i've lost a bit but you
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.720]  have really kicked kicked but i mean i just want to commend you erin for what you've done uh it's a great
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.880]  example your great example to all of us because i've been trying to get healthy and i challenged
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.560]  erin to get healthy and he just said okay and totally kicked my mind in so erin challenge me now call
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:22.600]  me call me a wimp yeah you're one of the biggest wimps i know alex but you know overall it really
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.560]  is about kind of extracting ourselves from that system that's been built up if you want to call it
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.600]  the beast system or the new world order system or whatever i mean whether everything from watching
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.720]  tv to getting healthy to getting off the couch i mean i i was brought up in that system watching
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:43.240]  tv i've tried to cut down i don't watch television anymore i've tried to pull myself into the
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:49.560]  healthy world tv watch what we watch now like 10 hour terrorism history documentaries oh yeah
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.720]  you learn a lot more from that type of programming especially if you're already partially aware and
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:59.560]  you can analyze things but yeah still just getting away from that system and building your own life
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:05.320]  apart from what what comes in a top down manner from the controlled media and well you know how
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:10.120]  it works we shouldn't be eating food that comes in processed boxes you shouldn't be watching more
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:15.960]  than an hour of television today uh you shouldn't be not exercising i mean they want us in a matrix
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:20.120]  they're trying to shut down farms and ranches for a reason they don't want us living like natural
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:24.680]  humans they want us in their modern cages matt in minnesota you're on the air and we'll talk to

[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:41.560]  and we have a caller on hold i want to have him finish the story that he was just telling
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:47.000]  but i was just looking during the break at one of the videos i just posted police nanny state
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:53.800]  report from entrance to carls bad cavern and there's a comment here he says i went to the airport
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:34:04.040]  to see my sister uh board a flight to california to be deployed to afghanistan again as they checked
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:10.680]  us in at the door a 55 year old man grabbed my sister's breast and i told him not to touch me
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:15.240]  so i was griped out and was thrown out yeah now they're going to start the checkpoints
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:19.960]  out at the entrance to the airport and then at the parking garage because the terrorists could
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:24.840]  attack anywhere and then out on the highway and then at the mall and then at your house because
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:28.920]  they could hide anywhere i mean there could be a terrorist there could be a terrorist through
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:33.480]  that green door behind me there could be a terrorist over there i mean they could be anywhere only
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:39.800]  government could keep me safe from this omnipresent invisible enemy oh but it's not the
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:45.960]  Arab terrorist it's the right winger they mean the real right winger or the patriot who understands
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:52.440]  things and who's done their research finishing up with matt minnesota so yes i've seen them say
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:59.080]  they're going to be in all the malls first saw this five years ago and the fbi's called for it
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:03.160]  and yes first they're just going to be there and search your bags just like the airport
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:07.240]  but then they admit it's going to move on to breast grabbing genital grabbing you're like
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.000]  what just won't go to the malls they're going to do it on the side of the highway and they know
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.440]  in actuaries you're going to resist a certain number you will then be called the terrorist
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:22.600]  you see and they don't care there's going to be a big shooting war with 150 million gun owners
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:28.360]  if one million fight back less than one percent fight back that that's an unstoppable army they
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.880]  want to wreck the whole country they want the gun owners to have shootouts with potbelly dsa and
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:39.640]  cops and military and all these steroid people it's all part of just wrecking everything just
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.600]  wrecking it they're taking salentes bank account now just to just to freak everybody out and they're
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:49.960]  going to take millions more it's just all part of breaking the will it's all part of the flaunting
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.800]  go ahead and finish your point up so so your buddy's involved in the in the overall maintenance and
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:59.400]  things and specifically in mall of america tell us what he told you and then uh i'd like to know
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:03.160]  if he'd like to be able to get in contact with us clandestinely and come on the show or give us
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:09.000]  more info but oh i guess that's terrorism letting a radio host know about tsa groping please continue
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:14.600]  all right yeah basically that's just what he has said his supervisor had told him is that they were
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:20.120]  getting ready to continue you're about to roll that out but um the other point i wanted to bring
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:24.920]  up when you got to mentioning the guns in the second amendment is um i stay in minneapolis so
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:30.680]  it's hennepin county here and they uh they did something you know really weird i was registered
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:38.520]  to own weapons i had bought an assault rifle and i had gotten a dui and the rifle was in the trunk
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:45.320]  of my vehicle and upon the dui search you know they found the rifle you know safe secure location
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:53.160]  unloaded no problem but several weeks later i received papers in the mail for a charge for
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:59.880]  a felon in possession of a firearm so long story short they used a juvenile felony that i had
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:06.760]  gotten when i was about 15 to call me a felon yeah let me stop you the law and the court
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:11.640]  rulings say you they can't do that but they don't care now they're taking people's second
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:17.160]  amendment for dwis they're taking the second amendment when your wife files for divorce they
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:22.520]  come and confiscate your guns for no reason uh the supreme court rule they can't do that they
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:28.040]  don't care this is a lawless crook government doesn't mean the average person and it's a
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:35.560]  crook but they go along with it and folks america has a cancer like the nazis had it in germany
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.600]  you know the germans did with the nazis or the soviets with the uh you know whole system
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:46.040]  we've got this and and and folks if we don't have a come to jesus moment and admit how bad it is
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.960]  there's no getting out of here i got to go to this video here in a few minutes but god bless you
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:55.160]  you should most local lawyers will sell you out but that was a false false deal they did to you
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.080]  and you need to fight that that's a fraud i am an expert in that area and i've had constitutional
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:04.600]  lawyers on to break it down as well uh chris in uh montana and then we're out of time here we got to
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:10.360]  go to this report on the un takeover and police state takeover of america where you can't even
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:16.600]  film the wildlife at national parks because it violates the animals rights that's not in this
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:23.160]  report that's something i forgot to point out that they told us but uh go ahead chris uh yeah
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:28.920]  uh what a previous college said about pamphlets um that's one of one of the things that i would
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.120]  love to have uh get my hands on would be uh something that outlines all the presidential
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:40.600]  candidates uh to give to people i think that would be a great tool uh to show people you know
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:46.440]  why to vote for ron paul well ron paul's starting to get in first or second place depending on the
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:51.000]  poll in new hampshire in places in iowa the system's scared all of their attempt to shut
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.480]  him down it's not worked he's got a good chance to win the nomination there's going to be election
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:00.360]  fraud but if we absolutely turbo charge it's going to be hard for him to do it anything else
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:06.360]  i know that was it well thank you for holding sir to bring us that information i want to thank
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:11.320]  erin dykes for hosting the show we're going to play this video and then an audio of myself at

[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:21.560]  play clips of tonight interspersed with this on the nightly news as it was happening but
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.760]  i mean carlsbad caverns i was here six years ago one of the biggest caverns in the world
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:32.360]  it's a true wonder blows anything i've ever seen away so i keep coming back here and uh
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:37.720]  they just treat you like trash it's about letting you know your garbage and more and more they're
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:42.520]  trying to restrict people's access to most areas at national parks and that's now happened here as
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.400]  well and they and they lectured us basically about that so here's this report and we'll go to break
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.920]  come back and erin will give you examples of how the un's taking land around the world
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:58.120]  that was put into these un biospheres as collateral to the banksters the banksters
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.160]  are loan shark criminals the big six megabanks they are involved in a scorched earth total
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:09.480]  world government takeover plan and the name of this video is there is no escape from the police
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:13.800]  state please get it out to everybody you don't know how long we'll have the internet as we do now

[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.560]  want to go after amish people selling their neighbors milk why are they harassing organic
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:51.320]  farmers why are they trying to arrest women with gardens in their yard you've seen all that craziness
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:57.080]  worse than the old soviet union because the global technocrats the fortune 100 owned by the big six
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:05.160]  megabanks want to shut down normal human self-sufficient society and do it to shut down true independent
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:11.560]  sustainability they bring in the counterfeit un agenda 21 sustainability now here's an example
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:17.240]  of this on the wide scale look at greece you've seen the news articles about all these hundreds of
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:21.560]  greek islands they have hundreds of them some of which have now been transferred for six billion
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:27.720]  dollars in debt one island alone that were owned by the state and the people have been given to the
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:34.520]  big megabanks and brokerage firms that actually induced greece into debt to understand that that
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:39.400]  they're taking their national and state parks and public lands and giving it to the same big
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:45.320]  brokerage firms that entice their government to get involved in all this fraud and to sign on to
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:53.800]  the derivatives that they created so to bail out the bankers you then also give them your property
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:59.000]  so back in 97 i learned about the executive order bill clinton had put into place transferring our
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  national parks and other key monuments and public lands and buffer zones were trillions of dollars
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:12.840]  overall the minerals everything over to the un as collateral to the imf and world bank just as you
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.760]  see happen in third world countries where the imf world bank come in and take the land we had the
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.760]  executive order we had the kentucky legislature talking about it i traveled around the country
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.760]  and i would pull into the grand canyon you name it and politely walk in and say i'd like to talk
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.160]  about the un plaque i'd like to talk about what's happening and they would blow up and threaten to
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:34.600]  arrest me and that's on tape at the grand canyon other places in america so about design so i've
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:39.080]  decided to travel back across the southwest and visit some of the same national parks and some
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:44.120]  others that i hadn't visited in that film like carlsbad caverns here in southern new mexico
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:49.240]  and that's why info wars dot com info wars nightly news is here that's why we're covering
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:54.120]  this information now i came here several times as a child i came here in college i came here six
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:59.160]  years ago with my wife and two children now i have a third child i wanted her to see it
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:05.240]  before she gets too big we're here again as part of this research project i brought my family along
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:11.080]  on the rv from the minute we get here it's changed in six years ago i'm going to run over just some
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.360]  of it because one thing alone is not a big deal but as it added and built up richard kept saying
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:23.560]  well wonder what's going to happen next we walk in and i see some of the park rangers with tasers
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:29.320]  and guns walking around the old tough guy like they're in an airport or something and terrorists
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:34.920]  must be everywhere okay so i think well whatever you know maybe they're forest service or something
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:39.800]  i don't know why they need guns and tasers but okay everything's okay in america same visitor
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:44.840]  center i've been too many times the elevator ride down 800 feet and all of it so then i go up to the
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:49.320]  counter and i go up and i was wondering why there was one group ahead of us and why it took so long
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:53.960]  to get them through i thought many people are slow so i get up there there's hardly any tourists here
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:44:00.600]  today there's literally more park rangers than there are a tourist i probably saw 40 or 50 total
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:07.400]  about 20 at one time so i get up there and i find out why i'm being interrogated i'm being told rules
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.640]  and i'm being asked if i've ever been in mine shafts or caves recently and where and i said no
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.680]  six years ago here i thought it was small talk but she was asking at real stern like i was you know
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:24.840]  tsa or something uh she was tsa and i was at the airport and i said no i told you i here six years
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:31.560]  ago she was really not anywhere on the east coast or anywhere there and i said no i said i said i've
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:37.400]  been here the last cave well where one of the caves you've been to one in mexico one time decade ago
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:45.320]  or more a couple around texas what caves in texas i don't remember the names and i was like what's
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.320]  it's all about she goes you don't worry about that here's your tickets and then i went and asked another
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:54.600]  ranger and i said is it that white nose fungus stuff and he said yeah and my mom's so educated she goes
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:02.200]  so informed she goes but the mexican uh brown bad isn't susceptible to that and he goes wow how do
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:07.320]  you know that but the point is then we walk past that and a ranger waves the kids over like oh thank
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:12.360]  god a nice ranger he wants to talk to the kids and he goes hi do you know what animal this is he has
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:16.920]  a table out we're trying to go to the elevators couldn't get past these people you know he wanted
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:24.920]  his pound of flesh and so he he holds up a white-tailed deer in a puma and shows us a puma skull
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.880]  and he goes one last thing and he holds up a map of the park underground and he says 90% of this is
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:36.600]  off limits to humans that's for the animals animals need a place to i'm like oh god does it never end
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.800]  this anti-human brainwashing you know 90 plus percent of the plants totally untouched the globalist
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.720]  the ones destroying the environment they got a fake environmentalism to grab property and control but
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:50.040]  i didn't say that i'm like thank you because we need to get through the park and get on the next
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:55.640]  leg of our investigative journey as my children are basically apprenticing with me i'm like thank
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.320]  you so then we walk out and go down to the natural entrance because you can't just take the elevators
[02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:05.480]  down you're lazy and there's another one comes slinking over and he says no gum no food no this
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:10.120]  and that don't talk it disturbs the animals and the people the lecturing continued and continued i
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:14.600]  said thank you and he was all kind of creeping around acting weird i'm like god this is horrible
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:18.440]  now remember i've been here at least four times before this hadn't happened this hadn't happened
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:24.280]  so then we walk down to the cave and a hundred yards in there's a camera and a sign that says
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:30.360]  cave watch if you see anything illegal call this number 30 30 and you know had the code before
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:34.680]  those were there if you've slipped and fell or needed help or whatever now it's tattle on people
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:40.120]  and cameras everywhere hidden up in cave crevices and this goes on and on and we finally we don't
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:46.920]  see any of the uh of the park rangers we get down to the bottom 800 feet down and they're all there
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:53.080]  bossing people around and stuff i talked to some they were a little bit nice then i went and got back
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.000]  on the elevator where they have a little gift shop down at the bottom went back up to the top i got
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:03.800]  back off saw more park rangers with guns and tasers i was my family walked in the bathroom
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:08.600]  i turned around and the guy goes sir did you just come in because you need to buy a ticket right now
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:14.040]  or or you know this is the last five minutes to buy a ticket but he kind of said it like
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:19.080]  and i was like okay uh thank you no i've i've already been down thank you and it's just this this
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:25.080]  this oppressive culture of the american people are bad the american people can't be trusted only
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:30.120]  government is good they've got new homeland security ads in denver that are airing and
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:34.440]  training manuals that paul watson wrote about yesterday where they say even your best friend
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:37.720]  can't be trusted they could be a terrorist really what about the government caught
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:41.080]  shipping drugs in the country what about the government caught beating people to death what
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:45.000]  about the government letting big mega banks rob people and putting their people in as federal
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:52.280]  regulators what about uh all these other companies taking people's bank accounts like mf global
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:57.080]  i mean what about that see this is about us learning to be perps us learning to be criminals
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:01.960]  us learning that we're bad we have guilt we're evil and it just went on and on there was a
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:08.520]  bunch of other nanny state stuff so many i had to write it down um but again this park 90 percent
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:15.160]  is off limits to you in the final equation if they discovered this cave like they did a hundred
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:21.240]  and something years ago today they would guaranteed not let it be open to the public there are already
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:25.800]  caves they found in the u.s canada france and other areas that are huge that they just say are
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:32.280]  off limits vital biosphere area it's all about treating us we have no rights we're scum we're
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:36.600]  trash we have no value and the government is there with the big mega banks to basically
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:41.320]  pick up the garbage and throw it away that's what's going on and more and more i mean i've
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:47.400]  gone to state parks where they're super rude um erin dyke's tried to go to a state park mckinney
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.960]  roughs with his girlfriend a few weeks ago and he said they interrogated a nice clean cut guy
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:56.200]  nice clean cut girlfriend they interrogated him like he'd done something wrong he said is anybody
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:01.160]  else hiding in the car it's like when you go rent a car they interrogate you where are you going
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:05.640]  what are you doing oh really who are you visiting it all goes in a patriot act database and this is
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:12.920]  all fact i mean this is like stasi east germany or something so i i wanted to follow this boil
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:18.680]  down before i also post the videos we shot in there today inside the cave and uh that covers
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:22.760]  some of what we just broke down here but it's just all off the chart so here's kind of a final
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:28.520]  boil down before i post all the pieces uh that were you know shot live inside the cave again i'm
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:33.560]  alex jones signing off from the southwest i'll be reporting throughout the weekend and next week

[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:09.240]  is an agenda 21 takeover in part but it's also allowing the various global interests like
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:15.400]  the united nations to have these parklands as collateral and uh there's a great documentary
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:20.680]  the ken burns one on the national park system very beautiful parks not knocking the park system
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:26.040]  but you can see the worship of the robber barons and the particular role they had in developing
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:32.600]  these parks and ultimately in having a say in who controls them at the end of the day i've seen
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:36.680]  well we'll get into it on the other side i'll tell my story of visiting a state park and being

[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:11.080]  and again i visited a state park in texas that was mckinney falls state park and they immediately
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:16.840]  demanded my zip code started asking questions uh me and my girlfriend asked if we're hiding anyone
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:21.240]  else in the car and if we were trying to duck out of uh extra payments and stuff we didn't do
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:25.960]  anything but try to come see the park and that's just the kind of treatment tsa style treatment
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:31.880]  you can now expect uh when you come to these places at the same time i've been very interested in
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:36.680]  alex's documentary america destroyed by design that was the first one he did about the united
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:42.680]  nation's takeover of national parks and i had a suspicion that there were many state parks that
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:47.320]  also fell under that jurisdiction it's true i found the list i know people like mon teeth have
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:52.200]  covered it before and i looked and many of the state parks i'm familiar with and love
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:56:00.120]  happen to be united nations uh held and operated as are a large portion of the wildlife refugees
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:05.640]  and uh other things in texas i check texas there's listings for the whole country i'm
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:09.400]  going to try to get a hold of that list and we'll cover some of that also on the info wars nightly

[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:20.680]  coverage from the road throughout the week info wars is doing so much now just remember
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:27.640]  greece started putting up island land for sale to private rich individuals to help save the economy
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:33.400]  including many of the most uh well-known tourist areas and other government held islands this was
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:40.760]  reported in the london guardian and other papers back in june of 2010 uh but there's a parallel there
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:48.040]  with the united nations takeover of united of us parks and wildlife as there is here with islands
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:54.520]  that are very important to greece its whole history and its tourism economy now being uh really just
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:57:01.080]  doled out to private billionaires and others who can own the island use it for profit or keep it
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:07.000]  for themselves keeping people away there is that rewilding plan going on just some of the stuff
