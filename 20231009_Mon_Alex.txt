[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.520]  It's Monday, October 9, 2023, this is the Alex Jones Show, and I am on a very, very important
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.200]  information mission, and I will be filing reports from the road over the next three
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200]  days.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.060]  I will be back Thursday, we're going to have Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser both
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.060]  co-hosting today.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.540]  I also taped an interview with a very informative journalist and researcher on Saturday that
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.940]  we'll be hearing in part of the third and the full fourth hour today, and thank you
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.700]  so much for joining us.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.940]  The big takeaway, if you happen to tune into the Sunday night show, you heard it
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.940]  all.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.980]  The big takeaway is this, no way Israel didn't know that attack was coming, so it
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.640]  is like 9-11, they knew full well it was coming, it was a clear stand down, and that
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.140]  is now hitting the news.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.660]  Also what I told you on Saturday is now admitted that Hezbollah took much of the six billion
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.340]  dollars that oh Biden gave them last month and gave that to the tens of thousands of suicide
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.140]  operators that were sent in to southern Israel out of the Gaza Strip, many of them
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.700]  of course were North Africans and others, and were clearly paid, jihadists, they get
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.380]  up to a hundred thousand dollars in some cases more for going out and fighting and
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.240]  especially if they die, their family is sent even more money, if you divide out
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.220]  say six hundred thousand dollars between ten thousand of these suicide troops, that comes
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960]  up to the six billion, but large portions of the six billion were obviously spent for
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.640]  the suicide payments, but the rest was spent on weapons, then you have the tens
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.600]  of billions of dollars of weapons coming out of Afghanistan that's now confirmed to be
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920]  their US hardware as well as a lot of hardware sent to Ukraine that's there.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.300]  So this has been brought to you by the globalist deep state that will now use this
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.360]  as crackdowns on freedoms in Israel, crackdowns here, crackdowns in Europe, it's
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.600]  also a good smokescreen for what has unfolded, with the Russians clearly
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.620]  decisively now winning the war in Ukraine against NATO.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.480]  So if you pull back from this, what's the other big issue?
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.920]  It's the tens of thousands of other than Mexican or other than Latin American
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.600]  pouring across even just the Texas sector every month, sometimes it's
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.600]  thousands a week, they're almost all military age men and many of them are
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.160]  Hezbollah and Hamas, but again Hezbollah out of
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.040]  Iran, he's the main group that did the training preparation and made the
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.160]  payments as I told you on Saturday, people are like, oh Jones, you know the
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160]  history of Hezbollah and Hamas, now I've actually done the research know what
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.640]  I'm talking about, and so there are tens of thousands conservatively of
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.800]  Hezbollah sleeper cells inside the United States right now, and if you
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.680]  think what you saw in Israel was a big deal, imagine what is going to
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.240]  happen inside the United States even when we go to war with Iran, so we've
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.000]  been pre-positioned for this and the globalist will love it, it will make 9-11
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.400]  look tame in comparison with the 3,000 dead, when and if they strike the
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.440]  United States, the many members of Congress are now pointing this out,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.160]  there's big articles up on info.wars.com, so it's something we have to
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.360]  get ahead of here and let the CIA and Mossad and MI6 and NATO
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.960]  intelligence and all the rest of them know that even when there's
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.040]  massive attacks in the West, you with the UN set up these centers,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.720]  broaden these people, you know exactly what you're doing and many
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.840]  of them admit that they're jihadist, and so I would expect the probability
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.200]  of the next year, maybe even sooner, of a massive 9-11 style attack
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.920]  but all over the country, they're going to hijack planes, they're
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.480]  going to use the same thing you saw with hand gliders, a lot of
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480]  them know how to fly an aircraft, they're going to steal aircrafts
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.120]  all over the United States, fly them into buildings, fly them into
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.600]  government buildings, attack sports stadiums full of people, attack
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.240]  colleges, you name it, big gatherings, and then the government will
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.920]  get more funding than those that do the stand down and brought the
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.160]  illegal aliens in and the jihadis in will actually get more money
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.120]  and more funding and more power because logic has been murdered,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.720]  just like Netanyahu clearly going to stand down is not going to
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.840]  get more power and more control, he's about to be ousted from
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.680]  power, so war is the health of the state, that's what's going
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.440]  on, and that's the reality, I would direct everybody to band
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.280]  on video and the first hour of my show last night where I laid
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360]  this all out in basically complete detail, also a lot of the
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.080]  Israelis that have moved into Israel are not conservative and
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.480]  don't like guns, so many of those are right up on the border
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.440]  with the Gaza Strip and two and a half million people that want
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.760]  to kill them were unarmed and don't like weapons, also you
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.320]  saw the hand gliders come in and attack the big party rave
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.800]  that was going on at a quote peace rally, reportedly killed
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.160]  200 there, so they're seeing a couple of hundred are dead
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.520]  across Israel, thousands injured, it's actually much, much
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.080]  higher and I would expect thousands and thousands dead, perhaps
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.680]  tens of thousands wounded, but that will be unfolding in the
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.120]  days to come, this is a big deal and part of the global
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.760]  escalation so the big banks can bring in their new global
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.120]  central system and new currency, again we have several big
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.920]  guest hosts coming up, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.720]  I'm Alex Jones, please stay with us and please spread the
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:03.120]  word, that's how we bypass big tech and the sensor, stay with us.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080]  Last year we put this book out, the great reset in the war
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.840]  for the world, it became a number one national bestseller,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.080]  now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.160]  important, the great awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.800]  and launch the second great renaissance, this is such a
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.720]  powerful book, it covers all the globalist plans, the latest
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.680]  developments, how to stop them and then gives an alternate
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.280]  plan of the society we could build together, that's why
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.000]  it's the great awakening, the great awakening is happening
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.480]  right now, you can get signed or unsigned copies of the
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.680]  book at infowarstore.com, this is a historic book, I want

[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.280]  Good morning ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday the 9th of
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.680]  October 2023, you're watching the Alex Jones show and
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.120]  folks we are on the cusp of World War III, I do not
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.480]  think that's an exaggeration, I'm Harrison Smith sitting
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.760]  in for Alex Jones with Chase Geyser, we'll be co-hosting
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.840]  the show today, we'll also be going to an interview for
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.360]  about the second half of the show, we'll be joined by
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.960]  Michael Yon who's a celebrated combat journalist, getting
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.480]  his take on of course the biggest story, probably the
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.400]  only story we'll cover today Chase, the unprecedented
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.160]  attack on Israel by Hamas and the Palestinians out of
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.400]  Gaza, unprecedented is the word they keep using and it
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.080]  really is an attack, really bigger than anything that
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.200]  has happened between Gaza and Israel for their entire
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.720]  existence, but Chase Geyser, welcome to the show, we're
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.520]  going to be tackling this, what a day to be hosting
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]  the Alex Jones show.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.800]  Absolutely, when we were scheduled for this I had no
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.480]  idea that Israel was going to be attacked and there's
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.480]  conflicting reports as to whether or not Mossad may have
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.120]  known that they were going to be attacked, but I've
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.320]  been learning up as much as I can about this subject
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.040]  over the weekend and you've enlightened me quite a bit,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.000]  you're informed and this is something you've had
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.680]  substantial opinions on for some time and this is a
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.920]  fascinating and terrifying development indeed.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.920]  Yeah, and neither one of us clearly, obviously neither
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.800]  one of us are experts specifically on the Middle East,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.120]  but that's okay, we really dedicated our, for the
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.960]  last 48 hours, I mean I've just been studying this from
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.200]  every different angle, trying to just get a full grasp
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.000]  of what's going on and hopefully that's what we can
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.240]  deliver to the viewers and the listeners today is just
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.440]  an understanding of sort of how we got here and where
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.440]  this goes from here because when I look at the current
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.400]  situation what I see is a line of carefully set up
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.400]  dominoes ready to fall and lead us to World War III
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.400]  and I think that's where I approach this, I know that's
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.160]  where you approach this as well, we were sort of
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.720]  joking at one point about you take Israel, I'll take
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.560]  Palestine and we'll just, we'll go head to head,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.200]  we'll solve this thing by the end of the show,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.880]  we'll argue it out, we'll figure out the conclusion.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.800]  There is no easy answer to this obviously, neither side
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.160]  is right or wrong, totally good or totally evil
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.120]  and you have to actually be able to sympathize with
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.920]  and understand the stances of both of these people,
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.200]  both of these groups, both of these, you know,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.000]  the bodies engaged in this conflict to understand
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.760]  where it goes from here and why they're fighting
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.320]  and what it's going to take to end it because I think
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.600]  that's where we both come in is how do we get
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.720]  peace out of this absolute quagmire
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.080]  of generational conflict?
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.160]  Maybe it's a good thing that we're not Middle Eastern
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.880]  experts because oftentimes I've found that with issues
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.480]  like this, the experts are sort of entrenched
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.200]  in their school of thought, they've written books
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.280]  and they want to sort of find reasons to back up
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.280]  what they've always thought or said
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.060]  and really here at Infowars, we're all just committed
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.400]  to applying logic to information as it comes in,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.520]  using critical thinking, thinking independently
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.320]  and not just taking whatever the narrative says for granted
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.360]  and so I think it's actually a breath of fresh air
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.920]  that we're in a position to tackle such a complicated
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.640]  and long-standing issue with fresh eyes.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.240]  Yeah, because this isn't something that we've,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.960]  you know, this conflict in particular isn't something
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.860]  that we've dedicated our time to but understanding
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.920]  the overall geopolitical landscape is something
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.640]  that we've both dedicated a lot of time on
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.320]  and so neither one of us have sort of an interest
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.240]  on either side but an interest in peace and an interest
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.360]  in, for me, keeping America out of this war.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.840]  After all, we've seen this before.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.400]  I mean, we have seen the war drums,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.600]  we've seen the horrifying images, which are horrifying.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.960]  I mean, you can't deny what the attacks,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.560]  you know, the videos that came out of these attacks
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.520]  are shockingly modern.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.560]  I mean, in certain ways.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.120]  There's video of this music festival
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.000]  and paratroopers gliding into the music festival.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.800]  People are like dancing to techno.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.640]  I mean, we're in such a bizarre situation.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.120]  Yeah, like a true red dawn moment
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.420]  but red dawn on acid.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.600]  Like it's so bizarre what we're dealing with here.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.280]  So let's just get you some of the latest.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.920]  From Al Jazeera, death toll soars to 1,300
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.600]  as fighting between Hamas and Israel rages.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.440]  More than 800 Israelis and some 500 Palestinians
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.640]  have been killed amid heavy fighting and bombardment
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.640]  following the largest attacks
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.160]  by Palestinian armed group Hamas
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.840]  against Israel in decades.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.200]  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galantz said on Monday
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.320]  authorities would impose a total blockade
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.320]  on the Gaza Strip, cutting electricity
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.000]  and blocking food and fuel supplies
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.240]  as part of a complete siege on the Hamas-run enclave.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.400]  It came as Gaza's Ministry of Health
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.920]  said at least 510 Palestinians had been killed
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.240]  and 2,751 more had been wounded in Israeli air raids
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.820]  on the enclave since Saturday
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.120]  when Hamas launched its multi-prong offensive on Israel.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.840]  And the big question here is,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.000]  is Israel going to invade Gaza?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.520]  And I mean, there's so many different ways
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.840]  to get into this topic.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.080]  Obviously, we can talk about what contributing factors
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.160]  may have come from the Biden administration,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.640]  the 6 billion to Iran, did that have an effect on this?
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.160]  Did his response yesterday do anything
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160]  to calm the situation or inflame the situation?
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.840]  It's my interpretation that basically what Biden did
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.960]  was almost the worst thing he could have done.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.900]  He essentially said that we'll give Israel
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.680]  all the equipment that they need
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.720]  signaling that Israel or America
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.340]  is not going to get involved personally in this,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.420]  like we're not going to be sending personnel in.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.000]  And Israel doesn't really need weapons right now.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.640]  What they need is people and they just don't have it.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.280]  Actually, one of the latest headlines
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.860]  is that Israel has called up 300,000 reservists
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.400]  amid counter-offensive push in Israel-Hamas war.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.640]  They've called up 300,000 military reservists
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.320]  to respond to a Hamas-led terror attack and invasion
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.180]  on the Gaza Strip,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.120]  which resulted in at least 800 dead Israelis.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.880]  The draft is the largest ever for Israel.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.240]  Israel, of course, actually declaring that it's at war
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.620]  with Gaza for the first time since 1973,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.740]  I believe it was the last time they were officially
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.840]  in a state of war.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.380]  And the question is, are they going to invade Gaza?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.620]  This is from Mario Nahfal, a Hezbollah operative
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.000]  was killed by IDF strikes in Southern Lebanon.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.780]  So the domino effect, essentially, as I understand it,
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.140]  what's happening now is that Israel has said
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.660]  we're going to go into Gaza.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.420]  We're going to push in.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.420]  In fact, this just broke a few minutes ago from Axios.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.100]  Bibi Netanyahu has said, quote, we have to go in.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.980]  Bibi tells Biden as Israel prepares
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.100]  for possible ground invasion of Gaza.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.640]  So they're set on doing a ground invasion.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.160]  Hezbollah has said if Israel invades Gaza
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.980]  with ground forces, then that brings
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.780]  Hezbollah into the situation.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.660]  America has essentially said,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.220]  and whether this is official from the Biden administration,
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.180]  whether this is just Lindsey Graham spouting off
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.140]  from Gateway Pundit, war monger.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.700]  Senator Lindsey Graham warns if Hezbollah intervenes
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.020]  in an Israel Palestine conflict,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.500]  US must respond against Iran.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.840]  So I mean, this is a literal domino effect.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.100]  If they go into Gaza, Hezbollah attacks Israel,
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.380]  America gets into the conflict,
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.380]  then you have Iran, Syria, and even Russia,
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.980]  to a certain extent, going gloves off.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.620]  And we have hundreds, if not thousands,
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.920]  of American servicemen in the Middle East
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.700]  as sitting ducks if Iran or Syria
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.020]  were to start bombarding them.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.860]  It would be hundreds of American servicemen,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.220]  lives lost, and you can just see
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.300]  how it spirals out from there.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.740]  So I mean, this is a inflection point
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.740]  in more ways than one geopolitically.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.480]  And if this isn't handled correctly,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.040]  it is World War III, no doubt.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.860]  If this isn't very carefully dealt with
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.900]  in a way that is hyper-focused
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.340]  on just stopping this from spiraling out into World War III,
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.140]  then that is what comes next, no doubt about it.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.400]  Yeah, I think the craziest thing about this,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.020]  I'm a big fan of Sun Tzu's Art of War
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.840]  and 48 Laws of Power, things like that.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.660]  You never attack a stronger enemy head on.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.900]  That's just like a basic rule of war.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.940]  Stupid to do that, you have to use guerrilla warfare,
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.120]  other methods in order to attack an enemy
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.740]  that's stronger than you.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.700]  And the fact that they were so audacious
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.520]  with this attack is interesting to me
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.440]  because obviously they were trying to solicit
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.460]  or provoke some sort of a response.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.180]  And so I'm curious as to whether the intention
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.220]  is to get Israel to respond aggressively
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.780]  so as to set off this domino effect.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.740]  Well, definitely I think the Palestinians
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.340]  and Gaza and Hamas and really even the wider,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.180]  they call themselves the Axis of Resistance,
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.900]  but from Hezbollah to Hamas,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.220]  you know, a lot of these militia groups,
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.220]  most of them funded by Iran,
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.820]  they don't want to go back to the status quo.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.320]  They want this to be an inflection point.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.440]  They don't want this to be just another sort of situation
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.300]  where there's an attack, there's an exchange of hostages,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.500]  and they go back to being in an open air prison in Gaza.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.340]  They don't want that.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.120]  They want a change in situation
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.300]  and that's what they're going for.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.180]  And they're going to get it one way or another.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.140]  And I mean, Israel is really in a very,
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.840]  very tough spot right now because again,
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.480]  they cannot afford not to go into Gaza,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.200]  but if they do go into Gaza,
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.040]  then it's gloves off for all the enemies
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.980]  that surround them.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.420]  So again, where this goes is still totally up in the air.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.620]  Of course, the Israeli president said
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.780]  the state of Israel will win.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.980]  We have no other choice saying basically
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.800]  they have to go into Gaza because what happens is
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.420]  if they don't go into Gaza,
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.820]  that means they're not really the top dogs
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.140]  in the Middle East anymore.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.780]  Their action is being limited by an outside force,
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.660]  which is an entirely new situation for Israel.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.600]  Extremely interesting.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.480]  We'll get more into it on the other side.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.940]  Why do you think the globalists
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.500]  are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.020]  Why are they attacking myself
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.100]  and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.340]  Because they can't get through
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.620]  this giant megalomaniacal power grab
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.200]  if we're here exposing them.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.580]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.340]  In my new book, we give you the solutions
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.500]  to build a new, better world,
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.220]  an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.060]  This is The Great Awakening,
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.800]  the plan to defeat the globalist
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.420]  and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.240]  It's a companion to my last book.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.220]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.100]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.660]  And the answer is different herbal formulas,

[00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:18.630]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.870]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:27.790]  I am Chase Geyser filling in with the great Harrison Smith for the great Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.970]  So much going on today, Harrison.
[00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.590]  What's been crazy to me about it is I've been going off for a year about how I hate that
[00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.670]  we're supporting Ukraine and I tease it as because they're Nazis and that is a primary
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.870]  reason that I'm against funding Ukraine.
[00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:49.350]  But the ultimate reason that I'm against it is just because I'm America first, right?
[00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:56.110]  And this is the challenge that I see when this is the problem that I have with the
[00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.590]  Republican party because we've seen this brutal attack and it is an evil, brutal attack on
[00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.090]  Israel.
[00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:09.430]  And immediately I see Republican after Republican, conservative after conservative throwing up
[00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:14.390]  the Israeli flag in their bios, just like the leftists threw up the Ukraine flag.
[00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:20.350]  And I'm thinking, hey, even though I may personally like Israel a lot more than I like Nazi sentiments
[00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:25.710]  in Ukraine, I still am an American and believe in America first.
[00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:32.310]  So isn't the consistent position that we not throw billions upon billions of dollars at
[00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.950]  Israel like we have for Ukraine?
[00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.190]  Well, isn't it amazing that we already have sent billions, I mean, didn't we just,
[00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.450]  I mean, immediately $6 billion to Israel.
[00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.590]  So I mean, clearly they have sort of these agreements already in place to facilitate sending
[00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.850]  money like that.
[00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.990]  But have we not been through this before with wars in the Middle East?
[00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.990]  They're a bad idea.
[00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.870]  I don't know how many times we have to learn the lesson, like it's a bad idea for
[00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.830]  America to get involved in any way, but certainly not with boots on the ground.
[00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:05.150]  And the fact is that, you know, remember after Trump killed Soleimani, the Iranians
[00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.750]  responded, they sent a missile, it didn't have a warhead on it, didn't have explosives,
[00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:15.950]  but landed a missile inside a American military base that gave traumatic brain injury
[00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.670]  to like 80 or 90 soldiers.
[00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.110]  And that was almost a symbol.
[00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.830]  It's like these bases in the Middle East are vulnerable to attack if the gloves come
[00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.610]  off with Iran.
[00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.230]  The crew just pulled up a statement saying the White House has called a lid already
[00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.230]  for today.
[00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.590]  So there will be no more statements from the White House today, I guess, which is
[00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.950]  a little bit bizarre.
[00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.550]  And clearly the Biden administration, I mean, obviously one of the main sentiments out
[00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.150]  today is like if Trump was in charge, this wouldn't have happened.
[00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.650]  And there's no doubt in my mind that that's true.
[00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.090]  This is purely, and I don't think it has, I personally don't think it has anything
[00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.370]  to do with the $6 billion released last, you know, two weeks ago to Iran.
[00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.970]  I mean, that money hasn't actually been doled out yet.
[00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.730]  I don't think that has much of an effect, especially when you look at the situation
[00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.970]  of the Gazans and the Hamas, how it's existed for a while.
[00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:14.130]  I don't think you need $6 billion to get a bunch of young guys with rifles to storm,
[00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.610]  you know, through a wall.
[00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.050]  This wasn't a big money operation.
[00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:23.850]  This was a personnel operation and the personnel already exists there in Gaza.
[00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.610]  So I don't know how much that has to do with it, but definitely Biden's, the Biden
[00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.850]  administration's overall weakness and ineptitude and just bungling everything.
[00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.010]  I mean, one of the headlines from Infowars, I'm sure it's somewhere in this pile is
[00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:42.610]  about the fact that there are weapons from Afghanistan in Gaza right now being used
[00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.610]  by Hamas.
[00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.610]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.170]  Israel, U.S. arms left in Afghanistan reach Gaza.
[00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:54.770]  So in more ways than one, the Biden administration's total failure of geopolitical gravitas has
[00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.170]  led us to this point.
[00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.890]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:03.450]  And one of the things that just baffles me is how this could have possibly been
[00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.450]  a surprise.
[00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.690]  I know that we maybe disagree.
[00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.730]  I don't have a solid position on this, but it's hard for me to believe that our
[00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:16.370]  intelligence communities, both of which including Mossad and CIA, United States intelligence
[00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:23.850]  agencies, have known about so many major events prior to their happening and then allowed
[00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.889]  them to happen all the way back to Pearl Harbor, maybe even earlier, obviously Vietnam
[00:24:27.889 --> 00:24:30.690]  and what happened with 9-11.
[00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.610]  I think they knew ahead of time and allowed it to happen.
[00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:38.490]  It's hard for me to believe that as sophisticated as these intelligence agencies supposedly
[00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.130]  are, they didn't know that this was coming.
[00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.370]  And to your point about the $6 billion, I think based off of the coordination that
[00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.350]  we saw, based off of the fact that this was a 50-year anniversary of a prior major
[00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:56.170]  event, I think that this was being planned long before just the last six weeks.
[00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.290]  I think that they were planning to do something like this.
[00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.410]  There was training going on.
[00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.889]  There was different doling out of who's going to fly and where.
[00:25:02.889 --> 00:25:06.250]  They knew the festival was going to be heavily populated, and they knew that the festival
[00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.770]  was going to be populated with multinational people, so they knew that it would trigger
[00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.050]  the world in a way if they would attack it, and there was going to be a lot of people
[00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.130]  in a consolidated area outside just totally exposed to gunfire.
[00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.490]  So I think that they had planned this for a long time, and the longer that they'd
[00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:24.530]  been planning it for, the more likely it is that Mossad or the CIA would have
[00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.530]  been aware of it.
[00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:30.450]  And I'm not surprised that Joe Biden's surprised about anything necessarily, but I do find it
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.290]  hard to believe that Mossad didn't know this was coming.
[00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.850]  Well, you know, the latest information about that is that Iran was helping to coordinate
[00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.130]  this about two weeks ago.
[00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.130]  They met in Beirut.
[00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.010]  I mean, that's the latest report is that there was a meeting in Beirut with some
[00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:50.970]  of the leadership of the Iranian Republican Guard to give the green light, essentially,
[00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.970]  to this attack.
[00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.810]  And it's, I mean, it's not speculation.
[00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.810]  It's very clear.
[00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.810]  You've got Hezbollah.
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:56.810]  You've got Hamas.
[00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.850]  And actually, the part of Hamas that carried this out, Hamas is the overall term for
[00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.210]  like the military people in Gaza or in Palestine.
[00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:11.210]  But within that, you have the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, I think is the name of the
[00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:19.250]  group, and that is the Iranian funded, Iranian trained, almost like Hezbollah franchise
[00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.170]  in Gaza that carried this out.
[00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.770]  I don't, you know, I don't know.
[00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:29.930]  I really don't know, because it's either that Mossad is super capable and sort of
[00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.750]  allowed this to be carried out as honestly, I sort of have expected something like this
[00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.889]  for a while because there's been so much strife in Israel, there's been so much division
[00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:42.210]  in Israel, there's so much political turmoil in Israel, I've sort of been waiting
[00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.730]  for like, OK, when's the big attack going to come so they can unify their people
[00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.950]  and cast to the side all of the internal conflicts?
[00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.850]  So there is there is a reason why they would want to let this be carried out.
[00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.130]  But the other side of it is maybe they did just underestimate their enemies here.
[00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:04.090]  I mean, they've said a former Mossad leader said, you know, we this was unimaginable.
[00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.970]  We we could not have imagined.
[00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.050]  I was talking to my friend yesterday and kept just saying that's a failure of imagination.
[00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.090]  I mean, they just didn't think this was possible, so they weren't prepared for it.
[00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.130]  They didn't think the Palestinians could pull something like this off.
[00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:20.490]  So they weren't, you know, defending against this this possibility.
[00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:27.610]  And so it may very well be that just Mossad underestimated what what these people were capable of.
[00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:32.889]  And I mean, you have you know, there's no way to train paratroopers in a cave, right?
[00:27:32.889 --> 00:27:35.450]  There's no way to train paratroopers in a tunnel.
[00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.050]  So clearly these attacks and the people who carried them out had to be trained outside of Gaza.
[00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.930]  It would have been impossible for them to avoid Mossad that way.
[00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.810]  But at the same time, they somehow got into Gaza and they were able to launch this attack
[00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.410]  without alerting the IDF or Mossad.
[00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.410]  So so so I mean, what do you think? Do you think they did less?
[00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.090]  I mean, they have reasons to let this happen, obviously.
[00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.490]  My inclination is to say that they knew it was going to happen and allowed it to happen.
[00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:05.370]  Maybe they were thinking, hey, we have a major vulnerability because we don't have enough of a standing army.
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:11.010]  We're very well equipped. We have a lot of technology, but we don't have a lot of boots on the ground to do some of the activities that we want to do.
[00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:19.570]  I know you mentioned we were speaking earlier that they have struggled with the region prior in terms of trying to occupy it and just being a nightmare, sort of a slaughter for infantry.
[00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.930]  So if you want three hundred thousand troops overnight, the best way to do it is to have some sort of a domestic event.
[00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.810]  Yeah, I can justify sort of conscripting everyone all at once in a way that you couldn't in times of peace.
[00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.650]  You know, it almost doesn't matter whether it was on purpose or not.
[00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.570]  Like at a certain point, doesn't matter what the arguments are or whether it was on purpose or not.
[00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.370]  We're dealing with the real world warfare taking place here.
[00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.010]  And at the end of the day, it's whoever's stronger is going to win.
[00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.690]  And I mean, this this conflict is just getting started.
[00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.490]  Where it goes from here is anybody's guess, but it's nowhere good.
[00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.490]  We'll be back on the other side, talk about how the international players all come into this.
[00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.210]  Stay with us, folks. It's the Alex Jones Show and FullWars.com.
[00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.170]  Last year, we put this book out, The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.409]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:11.210]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:16.490]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.450]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.090]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them,
[00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.409]  and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:29.010]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.370]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.130]  It's a powerful book.
[00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.370]  Get yours now.
[00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.330]  I'm going to say something obvious right now,
[00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.330]  but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.530]  Everybody seems very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.490]  But remember, he is a total and complete puppet.
[00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.290]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him,
[00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.090]  the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations.
[00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.250]  You want to blame Obama?
[00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.930]  Yeah, he's above Biden, but he's still a puppet too.
[00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.610]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war
[00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.370]  against this country that's deindustrializing us
[00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.889]  and attacking our culture and creating race war.
[00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:33.850]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders
[00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.970]  and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN
[00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.250]  taking control of our medical system.
[00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.530]  That's what we need to do.
[00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.330]  That's what we've got to stand for.
[00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.610]  That's what is going to bring down the system.
[00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.610]  But if we just make it about Biden, just about how horrible he is,
[00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.690]  the isopedophile and how his son's a crackhead and gun charges,
[00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.530]  it becomes a distraction from the larger issues.
[00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.090]  We'll cover it all live at info.wars.com forward slash show.
[00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.090]  We have not had this many of our best selling products
[00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.770]  back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns
[00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.370]  and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.970]  And these are game changing products.
[00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.770]  It's like our information's game changing.
[00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.889]  These products are incredible.
[00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:16.610]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.730]  All three of the info wars platinum
[00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.570]  flagship products that have been sold out for months
[00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.610]  are now back in stock, but a very limited run
[00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.770]  because we only had a budget to get three or 4000 bottles
[00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.090]  of each one of these.
[00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:36.370]  We've got 4000 bottles of the HGH Max boost that people love so much.
[00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.810]  We've got about 4000 bottles of 1776 testosterone boost that just came in.
[00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.490]  And we've got about 3000 bottles of pain in the incredible natural
[00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.730]  pain reliever situation.
[00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.970]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible.
[00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.570]  And they fund our operation at info war store dot com.
[00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.409]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength,
[00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.370]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.090]  They can be found in grass fed beef,
[00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.210]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.570]  And they can be found in fish,
[00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.050]  which are arguably the best source of Omega threes.
[00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:24.010]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.570]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil
[00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.090]  and ultimate krill oil at info war store dot com.
[00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.490]  Omega three fatty acids are essential for both our neurological
[00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.450]  and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:45.170]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.

[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:07.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:39.260]  Welcome back. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show. Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser sitting in for Alex today. Of course you can support everything we do here by going to Infowarsstore.com. And I don't know, is there any other media outlet that is as dedicated as Infowars
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:34:09.260]  is and has been for the last several decades in avoiding war and avoiding falling into the psychological traps that are laid for us to encourage populations to call for war. I mean, it actually feels nice being at Infowars and being able to look back at the last several decades of endless warfare and conflict overseas. And to say we've been on the right side of all of these events, because we've always called for peace. We've always called for non-intervention. We've always called for people to calm down, not fight.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:38.260]  We fall for the emotionally provocative images that they show or claims that they make to try to rile people up in order to override the logical faculties and get us into just this death match from which there is no winner. Nobody comes out on top. And at the end of the day, this isn't a conflict between Palestine and Israel. I mean, obviously it is. But the implications for this and the way that the rest of the world is being pulled into this are extremely dangerous and could very well lead to World War Three.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:35:07.260]  And you really have to ask yourself, what are we fighting over here? What is this worth it? Is this just an eye for an eye, you know, on and on forever? Are we fighting for, you know, to free the people of Gaza or to, you know, insist that they stay in Gaza forever? It's like, really, that's what we're going to go to World War Three to ensure that the people of Gaza don't have rights at all ever? I mean, that's the way I see it.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:36.260]  But, you know, regardless of where you land on the divide between and the way they're trying to to frame this whole conflict is Israel or Jews versus Muslims is Jews versus Muslims. Whose side are you on? Who should be eradicated completely? And who, you know, who do you support? And it's like, what a sick and demented way to even look at this conflict. The only possible outcome to benefit really anybody would be some sort of peace at this point.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:51.260]  I mean, maybe, maybe that's what this could as horrible as this attack against Israel was. Can this not be a wake up call to everybody that this cannot continue like this anymore? Something has to change. The status quo is just enough already.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:36:07.260]  Where we should do something has to change one way or another. And in my opinion, that doesn't mean one side has to be genocided completely, which we're seeing a lot of people on the right wing making that that argument. I have a post here from Joel Polack, who I believe is the editor of Breitbart News.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:18.260]  He posted this on Saturday. He said, I have broken the Sabbath and Jewish holiday to deliver this message. Israel should wipe out Gaza, allow 48 hours to evacuate women, children and the elderly, destroy everything that remains.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:34.260]  So I guess the implication there is kill all of the men, plow it under and annex it to Israel. This is the end for Hamas and Palestinian terror. I mean, if that's not a call for genocide, I don't know what is. And I don't know, maybe this is a controversial platform to take.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:50.260]  But I'm against genocide, Chase. It's so funny because Alex Jones isn't on Twitter because of hate speech or misinformation. And I know he's been classified as hate speech by certain financial institutions, and we struggle with that.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:37:10.260]  But you're right on the money because I can't think of a single instance in any of the broadcasts that I've listened to over the last 20 years where Alex or even this network has advocated in favor of an existing war or an impending war. He's a pacifist. He has advocated for war about as often as the Dalai Lama.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:32.260]  Right. Like zero times. Right. Right. And so you've got this hate speech that is real hate speech where people on Twitter are allowed to call for actual genocide. Yeah, literal. But we're the ones that are censored because we're constantly calling for peace. And it just goes to show how much the establishment, how much the narrative wants there to be violence, as long as it's on their terms.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:58.260]  100%. They absolutely rely on war to progress their entire agenda. And again, you know, you're right. It is good that we're not on either side of this or, you know, so called experts because experts tend to land on either one side or the other. But I mean, is it is it impossible to feel sympathy or empathy for both these sides? I have Palestinian friends. I have Jewish friends.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:14.260]  I have Jewish friends whose families right now are in bunkers, you know, because they're being attacked. I don't want them to be attacked. I don't want them to lose their family members, obviously. But at the same time, I don't think that Israel can continue to treat the Palestinians as they have and not expect anything.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:34.260]  And again, it doesn't matter whether you think it's right or not. It's a matter of reality. When you put people in a situation that, like the one that exists in Gaza, you're going to almost require, you know, it requires, it demands, there's going to be violence as an outcome of that because you're putting people in a impossible position.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:53.260]  And talking about the art of war in Sun Tzu, I mean, the people in Gaza have no escape. They have no, you know, ability to get out of where they are. So you've got to, in Sun Tzu, you know, they say really avoid that because a cornered animal will fight with everything it's got.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:05.260]  Right. They're just, they're just stuck on the beach there. And the difference is in Dunkirk, for some reason, the Germans didn't attack the vulnerable troops of the enemy. But here they are facing this annihilation.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:22.260]  But I'm with you. I empathize with the innocent people on both sides, but I just want to be very careful and explicit in that. And maybe this is a character failing of me, of mine. I have no empathy for the actual perpetrators of that type of violence.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:41.260]  Right. You know, if an institution or government had attacked my family and done terrible things to me, as Israel may have been doing over the last decades to the Palestinians, I wouldn't respond by attacking innocent people that are constituents of that.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:53.260]  Maybe I would respond by getting involved against the actual enemy, but it's like the mafia, right? The mafia, they even have rules when there's violence. Hey, no kids, no family. Don't whack the kids. Don't whack the wife if there's an issue.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:40:06.260]  You go after the person that committed the crime or didn't hold up to the deal, but you don't go after the innocence around them. And the fact that it's gotten to the point where there's that level of lack of honor just goes to show, I think, how irreparable the relationship is.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:15.260]  And I don't advocate for the genocide of any people, but I do think that the only way this is resolved is if there's a total complete victory on one side or the other.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:27.260]  Well, I don't know how that's going to come. Again, the latest is that, I mean, okay, so they're in this situation where, I mean, they're complaining. I mean, Israeli media right now is saying not only is Hezbollah limiting us in the north, right?
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:34.260]  So Hezbollah is in Lebanon, it's to the north of Israel, and they're launching missiles and there's sort of some back and forth fighting happening right now.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:46.260]  Hezbollah is being very careful to only do that in places that are contested, places like Sheba Farms, which is Israeli occupied, but technically Lebanese territory, or the Golan Heights, which is technically Syrian territory, but Israeli occupied.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:55.260]  So they so far have not attacked the Israeli sovereign land other than Sheba Farms and Golan Heights, so they're being very careful on that.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:04.260]  But Israeli media is saying, you know, not only is Hezbollah limiting us in the north now where they exist, but they're now limiting us in the south by saying, if you invade Gaza, then we'll get involved.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:10.260]  And so Israel is sort of hamstrung and they're not about to go into Gaza and then open up a second front to their north.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.260]  And they tried to go into Gaza in 2008 and it was a total disaster.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:23.260]  They really can't invade Gaza with ground troops without carrying out an intense bombing campaign every block and then taking that block over and then bombing the next and then taking the next.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.260]  And what happens to the two million people that live there now?
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.260]  It's a mass murder.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.260]  So, like, how can you be calling for that and claim you're on the good side?
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:40.260]  And then, you know, you look at the, you know, the images that came out of the, you know, women being dragged away and stuff, and it's like, I can't be on these people's side anyway, so I'm not on anybody's side.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:58.260]  But there is a reality and a sort of equation of mathematics to what's going on in the warfare spectrum that is undeniable and that you can't understand without at least trying to put yourself in the mindset of both of the combatants.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:06.260]  Putting yourself in the mindset of Israelis that are terrified of being pulled out of their, you know, beds and killed by Muslim extremists.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:13.260]  But you also have to be able to sympathize with the Palestinian people who go, we've been under, you know, attacks for the last several decades.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.260]  We can't take this anymore.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.260]  This is intolerable.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:23.260]  And at this point, I mean, the latest is that Israel has ordered an immediate cut off to Gaza's water supply.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.260]  They've halted the electricity supply to Gaza.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.260]  They, Bibi Netanyahu has told Biden, we have no choice.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:38.260]  We have to go into Gaza because, again, they really don't because if they don't go into Gaza, that means that they're not the ones that are the top dog in the Middle East anymore.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:44.260]  It means their action is being determined by Hezbollah, essentially, because Hezbollah is saying, if you go in there, we'll attack.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.260]  They don't go in.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.260]  It's sort of seeding.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.260]  It's almost seeding sovereignty of themselves.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.260]  I mean, they are in an impossible situation.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:57.260]  But again, how this relates to Russia and Ukraine, I mean, that's where it gets really interesting and terrifying.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.260]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.260]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.260]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.260]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.260]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:23.260]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:29.260]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.260]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.260]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:18.770]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:23.250]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I am Chase Geyser.
[00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.009]  With the distinguished Harrison Smith on the Alex Jones Show for Alex today, exciting things
[00:47:28.009 --> 00:47:33.790]  happening in Alex's world today, which I'm sure you will hear about when he gets back.
[00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.790]  So much going on.
[00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:40.649]  We were talking about covering the news during the break and all of the articles, 98% of
[00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:42.770]  them are all about this issue.
[00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:47.450]  And Harrison and I spent a couple hours chatting this morning about this dynamic.
[00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:51.730]  And I was trying to figure out how this all ties in together, all these issues.
[00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:57.770]  Obviously the entire world knows that we have an incredibly weak president.
[00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.770]  And it's sort of a slow roll, it was like one bad thing would happen.
[00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:04.810]  And then when the repercussions for that didn't seem to be enough, you'd see another bad
[00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.410]  thing over here, another bad thing over there.
[00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:15.589]  And all these pieces I actually do think are connected in that we have Iran funding
[00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:18.529]  the Palestinian attack, supporting the Palestinians.
[00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:22.910]  We know that China supports Iran.
[00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:29.029]  We know that Russia has basically completed a victory in Ukraine.
[00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:34.509]  And I'm wondering how is Ukraine tied into what's going on with Israel and Palestine?
[00:48:34.509 --> 00:48:41.790]  They seem totally unrelated, but when we think about how Putin and President Xi have
[00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:47.069]  sort of been in cahoots the last couple of years and all these alliances, these uncommon
[00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:49.990]  or unexpected alliances, I think there is one narrative.
[00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:56.109]  I think that what we have is a situation in which we have bullied all of these nations,
[00:48:56.109 --> 00:49:03.509]  basically every nation in the world for decades, using sanctions because the dollars,
[00:49:03.509 --> 00:49:06.270]  the petrodollar, because it's the global reserve currency.
[00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.109]  We can come in and freeze assets.
[00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:14.669]  We can come in and leverage that power to really harm and damage anyone we want, whether
[00:49:14.669 --> 00:49:19.470]  it's friends or allies, we can blackmail or coerce them into doing the things that we want
[00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:20.509]  them to do.
[00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:26.990]  And that is something that has been incredibly taxing on the world in terms of their happiness
[00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:30.149]  or satisfaction, I think, with the United States' place in it.
[00:49:30.149 --> 00:49:36.390]  And it's similar to like King George for a long period of time, he sends this in the
[00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:41.250]  Declaration of Independence, a people will bear abuse for a long period of time before
[00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:45.549]  a threshold is crossed in which they actually decide to stand up and do something about
[00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:46.549]  it.
[00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:50.270]  All of these years of billions upon billions, trillions upon trillions of dollars in sanctions
[00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:56.069]  and abuse and manipulation and coercion, I think that the international community has
[00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:59.270]  come together and decided we've got to do something about this bully that is the United
[00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.270]  States.
[00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:05.230]  So we know that China is dependent on the United States for agriculture, for a lot
[00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.270]  of its food imports.
[00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:13.109]  We know that traditionally China has been dependent on imports for oil, natural gas, especially
[00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:16.870]  from Saudi Arabia, which of course is sort of at the center of OPEC.
[00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:25.549]  And with Russia having control, whether it's outwardly or under the cover of Ukraine,
[00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:27.390]  that's the breadbasket of Europe.
[00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:32.230]  So what if those resources, instead of being exported to Europe, were exported exclusively
[00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:37.750]  to China to minimize China's dependence on the United States for agriculture, simultaneously
[00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:44.509]  Russia would then have control over the energy exports and that pathway, that trade route
[00:50:44.509 --> 00:50:49.109]  through Ukraine in a way that would make it independent of NATO, that energy could
[00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:54.029]  be sent both to China and the Middle Eastern communities, and then with the elimination
[00:50:54.029 --> 00:50:57.589]  of Israel in the Middle East, there's no military strength of the United States.
[00:50:57.589 --> 00:51:01.629]  So we have a collapse of our agriculture experts to China.
[00:51:01.629 --> 00:51:04.029]  We have the establishment of the independence of China.
[00:51:04.029 --> 00:51:08.790]  We have the establishment of the independence of Russia and increased exports for them.
[00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:13.589]  And we've unified all of the Middle East against Israel, which could be eradicated
[00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:17.589]  except for Saudi Arabia, which is a competitor to Iran.
[00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:22.490]  That introduces a climate in which China could say, hey, look, the dollar is no longer
[00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.430]  going to be tied to oil.
[00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:26.710]  There's no more petrodollar.
[00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.470]  It's now going to be the yen.
[00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.350]  And that could be a total collapse, I think, of our economy.
[00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.350]  They could take Taiwan.
[00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:36.350]  And we've got all these refugees all over Europe from these terrible trade deals that
[00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:37.350]  we've made.
[00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.430]  We've got all these immigrants storming into our border.
[00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.470]  Many of them, I think, are of this persuasion.
[00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:46.390]  They could just activate the sleeper cells in our country and all across Europe if
[00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:47.390]  we tried to fight against it.
[00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:48.390]  What do you think?
[00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:49.830]  No, I think all of that's accurate.
[00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:55.270]  I think a lot of this does have to do with the death or the reorganization of the world
[00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.870]  economy post-petrodollar.
[00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:59.910]  I mean, I think that's fairly obvious.
[00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:04.509]  In fact, you know, a lot of these things are being done sort of out in the open from Reuters.
[00:52:04.509 --> 00:52:08.710]  Arab League chief heads to Moscow for talks after Hamas attack on Israel.
[00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:14.950]  So you've got the Arab League chief, Ahmed Aboul Git, heading to Moscow on Sunday for
[00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.430]  talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.
[00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:22.109]  And, you know, from the war in Syria, I mean, the fact is that, like, we're both
[00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:25.830]  on the cusp of World War Three and have kind of been in World War Three for the last
[00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:26.830]  like 10 years.
[00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:32.069]  With Syria and the help they've gotten from Russia and the continuing attacks against
[00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:37.790]  them from either America or Israel, this is all a snowball rolling downhill.
[00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.870]  Now might be a good time to go to this video that I'm sure a lot of our audience
[00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:48.509]  has seen before, but in case you haven't, this is a stark warning against falling
[00:52:48.509 --> 00:52:51.149]  for what some of the crew is bringing up there.
[00:52:51.149 --> 00:52:54.830]  People like Nikki Haley saying, now's the time we have to get into war with Iran.
[00:52:54.830 --> 00:53:00.670]  The military industrial complex has been salivating over the idea of war with Iran for the last
[00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:03.710]  20 years, no less.
[00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:09.950]  And General Wesley Clark back in 2003 made this statement saying that the US military
[00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:15.350]  was planning on actually invading seven countries in five years.
[00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.189]  A very famous clip, but it's good to keep this in mind as you hear people beating
[00:53:19.189 --> 00:53:23.069]  the war drums in really disturbingly flippant ways.
[00:53:23.229 --> 00:53:25.629]  I mean, they're just like, we just got to go to war with Iran as if that's just like,
[00:53:25.629 --> 00:53:27.629]  we'll just do it and everything will be fine.
[00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:28.950]  It's absurd.
[00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:36.390]  And I mean, what Biden has done by essentially you have like a playground scuffle.
[00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.270]  America is the teacher. We run everything right.
[00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.549]  I mean, America runs everything.
[00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.670]  We are the top dog in the world still to this day.
[00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.069]  China's making moves, but it's America still.
[00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:47.069]  And instead of being like the teacher coming in and separating the kids going,
[00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:48.870]  all right, we're going to settle this peacefully.
[00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:50.069]  I'm not going to let you two fight.
[00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:51.790]  First want to throw a punch. I'm going to take out.
[00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:56.509]  Instead of doing that, what Biden has said is you can imagine the teacher going,
[00:53:56.509 --> 00:53:59.990]  I'm going to give all I'm going to give a stick and a rock to this kid and let
[00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:01.470]  him do whatever the heck he wants.
[00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.029]  And I'm not going to get involved unless somebody else comes.
[00:54:05.029 --> 00:54:07.870]  And then you've got these other countries like Iran and Syria.
[00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.750]  They're like seeing their younger cousins essentially getting beaten up on the
[00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.629]  playground and going, all right, we're going to go beat up the teacher if he
[00:54:13.629 --> 00:54:18.310]  doesn't stop. I mean, it's all it's it's insane that Biden and again, I'm not
[00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:23.910]  I'm not saying it's it's not not the same decision I would make.
[00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:27.629]  But the fact is that by saying that we're not going to get involved in
[00:54:27.629 --> 00:54:31.270]  saying but saying Israel can take the gloves off and do whatever they want.
[00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:35.790]  He's just setting up massive conflict in the very near future.
[00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.149]  So let's go to this video of Wesley Clark.
[00:54:39.149 --> 00:54:43.670]  This is clip number 15 from back in 2003, talking about the fact that even back
[00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.750]  then the American military had this long distance plan to invade Iran.
[00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.509]  Let's watch right after 9-11.
[00:54:50.509 --> 00:54:54.430]  About 10 days after 9-11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary
[00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.750]  Rumsfeld and and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz.
[00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.549]  I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the joint
[00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:02.390]  staff who used to work for me.
[00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:05.430]  And one of the generals called me and he said, sir, you got to come in.
[00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.950]  You got to come in and talk to me a second.
[00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.069]  I said, well, you're too busy. He said, no, no.
[00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:11.870]  He says we've made the decision.
[00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.029]  We're going to war with Iraq.
[00:55:14.029 --> 00:55:16.830]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:20.750]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq. Why?
[00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:24.069]  He said, I don't know.
[00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:27.549]  He said, I guess they don't know what else to do.
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:32.470]  So I said, well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to Al Qaeda?
[00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.910]  He said, no, no.
[00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:35.950]  He says there's nothing new that way.
[00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:39.109]  They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.
[00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:42.589]  He said, I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists,
[00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:46.470]  but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.
[00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:50.149]  And he said, I guess if the only two you have is a hammer,
[00:55:50.149 --> 00:55:53.270]  every problem has to look like a nail.
[00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.750]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later,
[00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.990]  and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.629]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:56:00.629 --> 00:56:02.589]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:04.310]  He said, he reached over on his desk.
[00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:06.830]  He picked up a piece of paper and he said, I just, he said,
[00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.350]  I just got this down from upstairs, meaning the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.069]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take
[00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:18.750]  out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria,
[00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:23.870]  Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.350]  So that's been the plan for at least the last 20 years.
[00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.189]  We're going to continue covering this into the next hour.
[00:56:29.189 --> 00:56:31.109]  Again, talking about what the latest developments are,
[00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:37.029]  a new aircraft carrier force, a large aircraft carrier in our military,
[00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:40.629]  moving to the eastern Mediterranean in support of Israel.
[00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:43.670]  Israel essentially saying they are going to invade Gaza,
[00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.790]  which is going to bring in Hezbollah.
[00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:46.910]  I mean, again, the dominoes are lined up.
[00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.229]  They're ready to be knocked down.
[00:56:48.229 --> 00:56:51.830]  If this isn't handled with extreme tact and skillfulness,
[00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:53.029]  this is World War III.
[00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:55.390]  This is the shot heard around the world.
[00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:56.229]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:56:56.229 --> 00:56:58.549]  I do want to remind you, go to infowarsstore.com
[00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:00.950]  to support everything that we do here.
[00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:04.509]  I know people are probably upset that Alex isn't in today on this,
[00:57:04.509 --> 00:57:06.629]  you know, monumentally, historically important thing.
[00:57:06.629 --> 00:57:07.589]  There's a good reason.
[00:57:07.629 --> 00:57:10.750]  And like Jay said, you'll find out that reason very shortly.
[00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.509]  We are continuing to expand.
[00:57:12.509 --> 00:57:16.310]  We're continuing to provide coverage in only a way that Infowars can,
[00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:19.509]  that is demanding peace and non-intervention
[00:57:19.509 --> 00:57:23.149]  and not taking sides in this strive for genocide.
[00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:26.149]  So I hope you can support us by going to infowarsstore.com,

[00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.270]  and all the beautiful things that our founders
[00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.950]  and forefathers left to us,
[00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:41.350]  but also moving into the future

[00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:53.509]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:57:54.509 --> 00:57:56.509]  Where were you when the globalists were caught
[00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:59.670]  trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.029]  Where were you when the new world order
[00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:03.149]  was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:58:03.149 --> 00:58:04.229]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:58:04.229 --> 00:58:07.069]  You're watching and listening to infowars.com right now.
[00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:08.670]  And I salute you and thank you.
[00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.270]  And I want to encourage all of you
[00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.790]  who've been in this fight so long
[00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:13.830]  to realize we've reached the critical juncture
[00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.310]  in the battle now.
[00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:18.750]  And a key tool in that fight is the great awakening,
[00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.790]  defeating the globalists
[00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.310]  and launching the next great Renaissance.
[00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:23.910]  This is my second book,
[00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:25.870]  part two of the great reset in the world for the world.
[00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.549]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, more powerful book.
[00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:31.830]  And just like the last book went to number one,
[00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:33.950]  it is up to you to sense the number one right now.
[00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.589]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists
[00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:37.910]  and it funds the info war.

[00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:54.390]  has finally returned.
[00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.430]  To celebrate this powerful product's

[00:59:13.629 --> 00:59:15.029]  and regular use.

[00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.870]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:57.710]  you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:02.710]  All right folks, still a lot to come in today's episode
[01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:09.310]  of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.950]  I'm Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.750]  with Chase Geyser.
[01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:16.910]  We are of course talking about Israel and Palestine
[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.029]  and the inevitable massive conflict
[01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:23.069]  that is boiling right now.
[01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.310]  And I want to go to a couple of videos here
[01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.689]  just to lay down what we're talking about.
[01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:29.350]  When we're talking about Gaza
[01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:31.330]  or when we're talking about Palestine
[01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:33.370]  and going back again to the art of war,
[01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:35.729]  the number one rule is understand your enemy.
[01:00:35.729 --> 01:00:37.850]  And I think there's a total misunderstanding
[01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.810]  of the Palestinian people
[01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.509]  from a lot of commentators I've seen,
[01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:44.490]  probably from a lot of people in Israel as well.
[01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:46.089]  And in a way, I mean,
[01:00:46.089 --> 01:00:47.390]  whether you like what they do or not,
[01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:49.770]  you have to, I don't know if admire's the right word,
[01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.529]  but you have to respect the fact
[01:00:51.529 --> 01:00:55.210]  that these people have carried out a 75 year resistance
[01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:58.609]  against a massively overpowering enemy
[01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:00.629]  in a way that I can't imagine Americans
[01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:03.170]  holding on for that long.
[01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.770]  And I said this on Twitter and somebody responded to me,
[01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.009]  well, that's great for them,
[01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:09.970]  but they'll be dead by tonight.
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.910]  And I think what people don't understand
[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.450]  is that they don't die, they become martyrs.
[01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:17.770]  They are happy to die if it's in the cause of battle.
[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:20.290]  And it's only going to create more people
[01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:21.770]  willing to go out and fight.
[01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.649]  So unless you understand the mindset
[01:01:23.649 --> 01:01:24.990]  of the people that you're fighting,
[01:01:25.629 --> 01:01:26.470]  the things you're gonna do,
[01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:27.710]  even if it defeats them militarily
[01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.029]  is only going to empower them socially or geopolitically.
[01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:34.029]  If you don't really at least try
[01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:36.990]  to see the world from your enemy's eyes,
[01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.950]  you're gonna make mistakes in fighting them.
[01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.189]  And so I wanna go to a video
[01:01:40.189 --> 01:01:42.029]  that just explains what Gaza is
[01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:44.149]  and why the people of Gaza
[01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:47.750]  really don't have a lot of options
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:51.710]  in terms of just, and we'll show another video later
[01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:53.430]  where somebody asks a person from Gaza,
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.270]  like, why don't you leave?
[01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.149]  And he's like, because I can't,
[01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:58.430]  like you don't understand this is in all,
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:01.589]  for all intents and purposes, an open air prison.
[01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:02.710]  And so you got a bunch of people
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:04.509]  that are just, they're just gonna become radical,
[01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:06.109]  whether you like it or not,
[01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:08.270]  that's the situation you're putting them in.
[01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.990]  So maybe that's a situation we need to undo.
[01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:12.810]  So let's go now to clip number 12, I believe.
[01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.109]  This is Gaza Explained, let's watch.
[01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:17.470]  The strip is only 25 miles long
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:19.109]  and about five miles wide.
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:24.250]  Two million Palestinians live packed into this tiny space.
[01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:27.009]  One of the most densely populated places in the world.
[01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:29.089]  Half are children.
[01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.930]  Many live in refugee camps
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.689]  speckled throughout the besieged territory.
[01:02:34.689 --> 01:02:38.170]  A stunning 80% of the population relies on foreign aid.
[01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:41.870]  Aptly called an open air prison,
[01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:45.330]  there are only two ways to leave the imposed area.
[01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:48.529]  The rez crossing into Israeli territory
[01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:51.770]  and the Rafah crossing, which goes to Egypt.
[01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.710]  Both are completely controlled by hostile militaries.
[01:02:56.129 --> 01:02:57.930]  What Israel calls a border
[01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.729]  is actually a heavily militarized perimeter fence
[01:03:00.729 --> 01:03:03.870]  comprised of barbed wire, surveillance networks
[01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.569]  and lethal no-go zones.
[01:03:06.609 --> 01:03:09.930]  If you roam too close to the so-called no-go zone,
[01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:12.850]  which extends 300 meters out from the fence,
[01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:16.649]  Israeli forces have authorized themselves to shoot to kill.
[01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:18.850]  Thousands of unarmed Palestinians have been shot
[01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.450]  for violating this rule in 2018 alone.
[01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.250]  Mm.
[01:03:24.569 --> 01:03:26.569]  The same goes for Gaza's coastline.
[01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:28.970]  It is the only place in the world
[01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:31.089]  where you can't even flee by boat,
[01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:33.069]  as refugees elsewhere often do.
[01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:35.569]  Fishermen are restricted
[01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:38.029]  to only a few nautical miles from their shore.
[01:03:39.009 --> 01:03:42.170]  Strain past that, even by accident,
[01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:43.490]  you can be blown out of the water
[01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.029]  by Israeli warships.
[01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:50.810]  A massive seawall in the north and south
[01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.569]  currently being extended
[01:03:52.569 --> 01:03:54.990]  boxes them into their small sliver of sea.
[01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:59.689]  This violence is compounded by an economic blockade
[01:03:59.689 --> 01:04:02.330]  that imposes a chokehold of poverty on Gaza,
[01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.590]  resulting in one of the highest unemployment rates
[01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:06.830]  in the world, according to the World Bank.
[01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:12.210]  70% of the youth are unemployed,
[01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.769]  with 52% for the general population.
[01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.609]  So as there's a little rundown of what exactly Gaza is,
[01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:20.809]  and then, of course, on top of that,
[01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:22.850]  you have gates within Gaza
[01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:25.549]  that prevent people from moving from one end to the other.
[01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:27.069]  And if you look at this little chart,
[01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:30.410]  this is the human cost of the Israeli-Palestine conflict,
[01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.569]  and you see the death toll on this.
[01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.490]  And on the Palestinian side, from 2008,
[01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:38.769]  you have 3,000 on the Palestinian side, 800 Israeli.
[01:04:38.769 --> 01:04:41.210]  I mean, the brunt of this conflict
[01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:44.850]  has been borne primarily by the Palestinians
[01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:46.769]  to a very, very heavy degree,
[01:04:46.809 --> 01:04:48.210]  as in, you know, tens of thousands
[01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.090]  versus just a few hundreds.
[01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.529]  And when you treat people like this,
[01:04:52.529 --> 01:04:53.930]  I mean, you have to expect
[01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:56.189]  that they're going to want to fight you in brutal ways.
[01:04:56.189 --> 01:04:57.290]  It's just inevitable.
[01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:03.790]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:06.769]  Where were you when the globalists were caught
[01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.970]  trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:11.290]  Where were you when the New World Order
[01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:13.450]  was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:14.490]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:17.330]  You're watching and listening to infowars.com right now,
[01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.930]  and I salute you and thank you.
[01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:20.529]  And I want to encourage all of you
[01:05:20.529 --> 01:05:22.049]  who've been in this fight so long
[01:05:22.049 --> 01:05:24.049]  to realize we've reached the critical juncture
[01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:25.549]  in the battle now.
[01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:29.009]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening,
[01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:30.049]  defeating the globalists
[01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:32.549]  and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:34.170]  This is my second book,
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:36.130]  part two of the great reset in the world for the world.
[01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:39.809]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[01:05:39.809 --> 01:05:42.090]  And just like the last book went to number one,
[01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.210]  it is up to you to sense the number one right now.
[01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:46.850]  This is a cultural fighting against the globalists
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.170]  and it funds the info war.
[01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:50.330]  Get signed or unsigned copies

[01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:04.009]  ["The Great Awakening"]
[01:06:12.509 --> 01:06:13.769]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.250]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.769]  Second hour has begun.
[01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:18.490]  I am your host, Harrison Smith,
[01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.210]  sitting with my cohost, Kase Geyser,
[01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:24.049]  talking, of course, about Israel and Palestine.
[01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:28.290]  Checking some late-breaking stories here.
[01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:29.450]  I haven't confirmed this,
[01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:31.609]  but a unconfirmed report is that
[01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:34.769]  the St. Porphyios Orthodox Church in Gaza,
[01:06:34.769 --> 01:06:39.229]  oldest church in the world, 1,616 years old,
[01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.290]  may have been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike.
[01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:45.809]  So that would be incredibly troubling if confirmed.
[01:06:45.809 --> 01:06:47.890]  But we're going to continue to show you some videos
[01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.970]  to help explain this situation.
[01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.710]  Again, trying to treat this
[01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.569]  with all of the gravity it deserves.
[01:06:55.569 --> 01:06:58.769]  Jason, I got a call from my wife.
[01:06:58.769 --> 01:07:03.769]  She keeps me, you know, from going too far.
[01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:06.049]  You know, she just called me right before we went
[01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:06.890]  on the show and just like,
[01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.130]  hey, look, I know you're going to say
[01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:08.970]  everything you want to say.
[01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.609]  I just want to say, you know,
[01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:12.689]  tread carefully, this is a really big deal.
[01:07:12.689 --> 01:07:13.529]  Like, how is it?
[01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.729]  And it's like, trust me, I know, I know.
[01:07:15.729 --> 01:07:18.490]  Believe me, I know, you know, people are watching this.
[01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.569]  They're probably already furious
[01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.149]  at what we've had to say just by the fact that
[01:07:22.149 --> 01:07:25.370]  I just want to lay out the strategic overview
[01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:27.769]  so we can hopefully try to contribute
[01:07:27.769 --> 01:07:30.569]  to a diminishing of the conflict,
[01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:32.729]  a cooling down of the war,
[01:07:32.729 --> 01:07:37.490]  a not getting America into another world war
[01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:40.529]  which can only serve us badly.
[01:07:40.529 --> 01:07:41.410]  Let me ask you this.
[01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:42.769]  Yeah.
[01:07:42.769 --> 01:07:45.569]  In your mind, what is the just solution?
[01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:48.809]  Yeah, that's like almost an impossible question.
[01:07:48.809 --> 01:07:49.970]  Like, I think at this point,
[01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.130]  at this point, what I would love would be
[01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:53.990]  somebody like Trump, I don't know who it would be,
[01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:56.890]  but it would have to be if an American president
[01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.370]  could just come in like the teacher on the school yard
[01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.049]  and just put his hands on both the foreheads of the kids
[01:08:02.049 --> 01:08:04.210]  push them apart and go,
[01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.769]  what do we need to do to solve this?
[01:08:05.769 --> 01:08:08.930]  Nobody's throwing one more punch until, you know,
[01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.609]  and I'm going to, you know,
[01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:12.689]  help you to resolve this conflict
[01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.370]  and set a path towards peace.
[01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.010]  And if either one of you tries to break this peace,
[01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.650]  you're going to be, you know, talking to me.
[01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:21.809]  I would love for America to use its power and its force
[01:08:21.809 --> 01:08:25.610]  not to just help exact revenge on the Palestinians
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:28.170]  or help to fund the terror from the Palestinian.
[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.610]  Like, what if we could just step in and go,
[01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:33.769]  I don't care about the argument you're having.
[01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:34.809]  Cause I really don't.
[01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:37.090]  I'm not a Muslim or a Jewish person.
[01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:38.889]  I'm not an Israeli or a Palestinian.
[01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.610]  So I don't want to see America get involved on either side.
[01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:45.530]  I want to see a cessation of this conflict.
[01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:47.490]  However, you know, whatever that takes,
[01:08:48.610 --> 01:08:50.370]  I mean, you know,
[01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:52.570]  you're asking me literally an impossible question.
[01:08:52.570 --> 01:08:54.850]  Mine's better than mine have failed to solve
[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:56.049]  the last 50 years.
[01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:59.090]  It seems to me, and I could be mistaken.
[01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.990]  We established, well, at the beginning of the show
[01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:03.250]  that we're just too mind speculating,
[01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.730]  but it seems to me that the Palestinians
[01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.850]  have a legitimate grief with the Israelis.
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:13.650]  But what's really going on is the entire
[01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:18.650]  middle Eastern region is using the Palestinians
[01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:20.850]  as a way to attack Israel.
[01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:23.750]  And what I mean is we're using Ukraine
[01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.330]  as a way to attack Russia,
[01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:28.690]  who is officially anatomy of the United States.
[01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:31.130]  And I think even if we were able to establish
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.570]  some sort of agreement between the Palestinians
[01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:34.630]  and the Israelis,
[01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:38.150]  that we would still have an incredible amount of hostility
[01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:39.990]  in the middle Eastern region against Israel
[01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:42.309]  because Israel is perceived as
[01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:47.430]  the United States military presence in the region.
[01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.389]  And all of those nations hate us
[01:09:49.389 --> 01:09:51.870]  because we bond them so many times,
[01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.510]  we've totally toppled the governments
[01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:56.590]  and we issue sanctions on them constantly
[01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.350]  because of the petro dollar.
[01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:01.130]  And so I wonder if the problem actually is
[01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.549]  between Palestine and Israel
[01:10:02.549 --> 01:10:04.930]  so much as it is between the United States
[01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:06.030]  and the middle East.
[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:09.590]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's why it gets all complicated
[01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:13.630]  because everybody's a proxy of somebody else.
[01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:14.990]  I just kept thinking about this article,
[01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.750]  this from all the way back in December of 2021,
[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.870]  but Trump says Netanyahu quote,
[01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:21.630]  never wanted peace with the Palestinians.
[01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:23.230]  So Trump tried to sort of do this
[01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:24.690]  and come in and create a quote,
[01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:27.350]  ultimate deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.
[01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.510]  And he claimed that the Palestinians
[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:31.549]  were willing to make that peace,
[01:10:31.549 --> 01:10:33.549]  but the Israelis weren't.
[01:10:33.549 --> 01:10:35.990]  And Netanyahu never wanted to make peace
[01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:37.630]  with the Palestinians,
[01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.309]  which this would have been avoided
[01:10:40.309 --> 01:10:42.389]  if they could have come to some agreement.
[01:10:42.389 --> 01:10:45.030]  This attack against the Palestinians
[01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:47.430]  or against the Israelis by the Hamas
[01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.150]  or the Palestinians would have been
[01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.510]  much, much less likely to have occurred.
[01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:55.030]  So I can't think that this was a good idea
[01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.850]  from Netanyahu.
[01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.190]  And again, this is where it seems to me
[01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.190]  less of like orchestrated, less of like,
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.510]  oh, we're going to do this as a,
[01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.710]  we're going to allow this to happen.
[01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:07.350]  So we have the justification to do what we want to do.
[01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.750]  It seems like arrogance.
[01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.950]  It seems like they just did not think
[01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:15.330]  that they had to come to the table with the Palestinians.
[01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:17.049]  They just thought, you know, why should we?
[01:11:17.049 --> 01:11:19.389]  We're the power, they're the,
[01:11:19.389 --> 01:11:20.389]  you know, they're the small people.
[01:11:20.389 --> 01:11:21.690]  We'll do whatever we want to them.
[01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.070]  We don't need to negotiate with them.
[01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.269]  And then you have something like this.
[01:11:24.269 --> 01:11:28.530]  And it just, to me, it just reeks of unwarranted arrogance
[01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.769]  based on a misunderstanding of their enemy.
[01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:34.030]  Yeah, well, and with all blood feuds,
[01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:35.889]  you almost lose track of where it all started.
[01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:38.049]  Fortunately, this is fairly well documented,
[01:11:38.049 --> 01:11:40.510]  but there's probably just so much bitterness,
[01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.750]  I imagine, between both sides
[01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.389]  that they just want the other one dead.
[01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:47.070]  This is like almost like a Cain and Abel thing
[01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.309]  where somebody's just going to have to go.
[01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:51.710]  Yeah, we were joking yesterday about,
[01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:53.190]  or I was saying, yeah, it's one of those things
[01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:55.230]  where I often get the question, they're like,
[01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.070]  people will just be like, so Israel, Palestine,
[01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.910]  like, what's up with that?
[01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:59.950]  And it's like, okay, where do you want to start?
[01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:00.870]  And I made the joke like,
[01:12:01.389 --> 01:12:03.150]  well, there was this man named Moses one time, right?
[01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:04.590]  Like, is that how far back you go?
[01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:05.469]  And then you pointed out,
[01:12:05.469 --> 01:12:06.889]  actually, I think it goes back to Abraham.
[01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.590]  I don't think you're going far back enough
[01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.950]  when you get to Moses.
[01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:11.430]  So, I mean, it goes back and back and back.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.549]  And obviously, a major aspect of this
[01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:14.950]  is the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:17.790]  So the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock,
[01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.350]  is, you know, operated by Muslims,
[01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:22.710]  or, you know, Muslims are allowed to pray there.
[01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:25.469]  And this is a sort of agreement
[01:12:25.469 --> 01:12:28.389]  that Israel has had since time immemorial.
[01:12:28.389 --> 01:12:29.870]  They are going to be the protectors
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.110]  of these sacred sites.
[01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.710]  And recently, they've allowed, you know,
[01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:36.150]  Israeli activists to go in.
[01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.870]  They've stopped Muslims from going in.
[01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.790]  I mean, they're sort of violating
[01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:42.230]  very long-held sacred traditions
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:46.090]  of allowing a multiplicity of religions to coexist.
[01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.630]  And this operation that the Palestinians carried out,
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:51.110]  they called Al-Aqsa Flood Operation.
[01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:53.110]  And part of it was that they
[01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:54.309]  were sort of looking ahead and going,
[01:12:54.309 --> 01:12:57.590]  they're about to stop us from going to Al-Aqsa.
[01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:59.710]  And of course, you know, a lot of Jewish traditions
[01:13:00.469 --> 01:13:02.269]  think that where Al-Aqsa is
[01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:04.389]  was the site of Solomon's temple,
[01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:06.190]  and they want to build a third temple
[01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:07.910]  because that's a prerequisite for,
[01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.590]  you know, bringing on the Messiah.
[01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:13.070]  So really, a lot of this is centered around Al-Aqsa Mosque
[01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:15.630]  and some, you know, provocations there.
[01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.030]  And again, I'm not saying that like,
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:18.549]  oh, well, they stormed the mosque,
[01:13:18.549 --> 01:13:20.590]  so therefore their children should be killed
[01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:22.309]  and their women should be kidnapped and raped.
[01:13:22.309 --> 01:13:25.350]  Like, and that's what's frustrating
[01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.070]  about this conversation is because even in America,
[01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.710]  even places far removed,
[01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:31.110]  it's like even suggesting that,
[01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:32.790]  hey, let's all calm down,
[01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:35.389]  is treated from both sides like a call to genocide them
[01:13:35.389 --> 01:13:36.549]  while they are simultaneously
[01:13:36.549 --> 01:13:37.870]  calling to genocide the other side.
[01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:40.510]  And it's like, I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:42.670]  This is all horrible.
[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:45.430]  Well, that's the nice thing about being a populist.
[01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:49.269]  I'm an America first populist, and it's not my call.
[01:13:49.269 --> 01:13:50.950]  I don't have to pick a side.
[01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:52.469]  I shouldn't be involved at all, actually.
[01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:53.290]  It's none of my business.
[01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:55.150]  And frankly, most of the things that we've done
[01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:56.870]  in terms of foreign policy since World War II
[01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.549]  have only catalyzed hatred.
[01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:00.790]  There's a famous Bill Burr bit about it where he says,
[01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.030]  a butt kicking doesn't just fall out of the sky.
[01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.870]  Right.
[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.910]  People just so easily accepted
[01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.090]  that we were hated in the Middle East
[01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.710]  because of our freedom,
[01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:11.469]  but it's because of our terrible foreign policy
[01:14:11.469 --> 01:14:12.309]  over the last 50 years.
[01:14:12.309 --> 01:14:15.210]  We have catalyzed and antagonized these people,
[01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.769]  economically, socially, geographically,
[01:14:17.769 --> 01:14:18.910]  in terms of their energy,
[01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.570]  every weakness we've exploited.
[01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:25.549]  And I think the world would be a better place
[01:14:25.549 --> 01:14:27.809]  if we just stopped screwing with other people's business.
[01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:29.990]  Yeah, and again, this is the good example
[01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:32.269]  where we are both vociferous.
[01:14:32.269 --> 01:14:35.190]  We are both very outspoken critics
[01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.290]  of American foreign policy.
[01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:38.530]  We aren't anti-American.
[01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.590]  We don't hate America or Americans.
[01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:41.809]  That's our interest.
[01:14:41.809 --> 01:14:42.650]  That's what we love.
[01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:45.490]  So when we are criticizing the Israeli government,
[01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:47.190]  the Israeli military doing things,
[01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.549]  has nothing to do with how we feel
[01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:50.090]  about the Israelis on the ground.
[01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.210]  Same thing with the Palestinians and Hamas.
[01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:55.769]  You have to be able to determine,
[01:14:55.769 --> 01:14:59.150]  you have to be able to distinguish the power structures,
[01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.730]  making moves that are horrific,
[01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.230]  and the people on the ground.
[01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:08.170]  But it's shocking seeing all of these anti-war,
[01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.730]  apparently anti-war conservatives,
[01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.290]  I mean, literally calling for genocide
[01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.410]  in places like Gaza.
[01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:18.090]  It's just, there's a disconnect here that is,
[01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:21.850]  I can only ascribe it to just like emotional response
[01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.570]  to the images that we're seeing that are horrible.
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:25.410]  Like obviously they're horrible.
[01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.290]  Yeah, those images are terrible.
[01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:30.450]  The images that I see every couple of weeks
[01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:32.930]  or couple of months of Palestinian kids
[01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.809]  dying in bombings when Israel bombs them,
[01:15:35.809 --> 01:15:37.049]  those are all so horrible.
[01:15:37.049 --> 01:15:39.809]  You don't make decisions based on your immediate
[01:15:39.809 --> 01:15:41.969]  emotional reaction to these things.
[01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:43.510]  You do take them into account
[01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:47.049]  as you try to chart a path towards peace,
[01:15:47.049 --> 01:15:49.549]  which is what we should all be in favor of.
[01:15:49.549 --> 01:15:51.510]  And we have a clip from Ron Paul that we'll go to.
[01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.170]  We have a couple more clips that we want to go to.
[01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.570]  And then we'll welcome Michael Yon.
[01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.490]  We have a big interview with Alex Jones
[01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:58.889]  reported yesterday that we want to go to later.
[01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:00.370]  Why do you think the globalists
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:02.930]  are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.130]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump
[01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:06.490]  and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:07.730]  Because they can't get through
[01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.030]  this giant megalomaniacal power grab
[01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:11.610]  if we're here exposing them.
[01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.969]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.769]  In my new book, we give you the solutions
[01:16:16.769 --> 01:16:18.889]  to build a new, better world,
[01:16:18.889 --> 01:16:20.969]  an alternative to Klaus Schwab's,
[01:16:20.969 --> 01:16:22.610]  you will eat the bugs.
[01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:24.450]  This is the great awakening.
[01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:26.210]  The plan to defeat the globalist
[01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:28.809]  and launch the second great Renaissance.
[01:16:28.809 --> 01:16:30.650]  It's a companion to my last book
[01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.610]  that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:35.450]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:01.269]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.150]  that our amazing high quality coffee
[01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:04.290]  has not been available.
[01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:06.530]  And that's because the prices went up too high
[01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:09.090]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.809]  I turned down so many companies
[01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:12.170]  that wanted to work with us.
[01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:15.370]  But now we have brought back the coffee

[01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:02.809]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:20:02.809 --> 01:20:04.570]  of the new world order.
[01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:06.370]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:18.450]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:25.570]  I am Chase Geyser filling in with Harrison Smith with the great Alex Jones covering everything
[01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.370]  Israel and Palestine.
[01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:33.250]  Trump posted this morning, shortly before we got in the air, the same people that raided
[01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:39.570]  Israel are pouring into our once beautiful USA through our totally open Southern border
[01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:41.210]  at record numbers.
[01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:43.690]  Are they planning an attack within our country?
[01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:50.410]  Crooked Joe Biden and his boss, Barack Hussein Obama did this to us.
[01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:53.750]  Typical Donald Trump charm right there, but I think he's right.
[01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:59.250]  And I think this actually ties in a little bit to diversity, equity and inclusion, right?
[01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:04.210]  Because we have this situation in which we are constantly worshipping diversity as like
[01:21:04.210 --> 01:21:05.210]  this idol.
[01:21:05.210 --> 01:21:07.549]  It's what makes us strong.
[01:21:07.549 --> 01:21:12.629]  And really what's made America strong in the past has not been what's different about
[01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:17.290]  us so much as where we're the same, whether you're from Germany or Ireland or Africa
[01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:20.210]  or wherever you come from all over the world to immigrate to the United States.
[01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:23.610]  It worked when there was assimilation, they call it a melting pot because it blends
[01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:26.370]  into one thing and it's all the same.
[01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:30.610]  But this diversity thing is like this separation, this apartheid of cultures where everyone
[01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:34.610]  has to respect everyone else's, you have to integrate them, but you can't mix them
[01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:37.009]  at all because that's cultural appropriation.
[01:21:37.009 --> 01:21:40.370]  And so we have this situation which we're taking all these people into our country
[01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:44.690]  and we're forcing through diversity, equity and inclusion that they work together, that
[01:21:44.690 --> 01:21:49.950]  they're in close proximity, but we're simultaneously setting up an environment that seems intentionally
[01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.889]  designed to catalyze as much hate as possible.
[01:21:52.889 --> 01:21:56.549]  So make them enemies and then put them as close to each other as possible.
[01:21:56.549 --> 01:22:05.730]  So if there ever was an awakening of a sleeper cell base, then there would be just terror
[01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:09.490]  on the streets, just like some of the George Floyd protests that we saw in the looting.
[01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:10.490]  So I don't know.
[01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.490]  What do you think about that?
[01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:15.330]  No, there have already been clashes in New York, I think in Washington DC, I mean,
[01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.849]  there are these massive protests where you've got Israelis on one side and Palestinians
[01:22:18.849 --> 01:22:23.129]  on the other on American soil fighting each other over something that's happening 3,000
[01:22:23.129 --> 01:22:24.129]  miles away.
[01:22:24.129 --> 01:22:25.129]  No, we don't.
[01:22:25.129 --> 01:22:30.210]  Yeah, this is a lesson in the reality of so-called diversity.
[01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:37.370]  And again, what I am really concerned about is the domino effect that this could have
[01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:44.009]  if this isn't treated with the deftness that is required to avoid this spiraling
[01:22:44.009 --> 01:22:46.410]  into a wider conflict.
[01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:53.490]  And the piece that the people in power recognize, but you don't see it reflected a lot in media,
[01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:59.809]  is Hezbollah, which is the Lebanese resistance movement, essentially is what they call themselves.
[01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:06.429]  And you see sort of mention after mention from people in power, Anthony Blinken came
[01:23:06.429 --> 01:23:11.030]  out with a statement saying, oh, you better not open a second front, as well, don't
[01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:15.330]  you get involved now, you know, you're not allowed to get involved, which they could
[01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:19.070]  and they're the ones sort of limiting Israel going into Gaza right now.
[01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:22.929]  But again, and this is sort of the takeaway I get from this, this is an inflection point
[01:23:22.929 --> 01:23:28.370]  of the Middle East, where if Israel does not go into Gaza, that represents a power
[01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.889]  dynamic shift away from Israel towards the Arab states around them.
[01:23:32.889 --> 01:23:36.969]  In other words, Israel can no longer act with total impunity, being the big dog, sort
[01:23:36.969 --> 01:23:39.170]  of allowed to do whatever they want.
[01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:40.410]  They are now being limited.
[01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:43.210]  If they allow this to happen, if they allow themselves to be limited, then that's
[01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:44.210]  it.
[01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:45.210]  I mean, they're limited from then on.
[01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:48.769]  They're being dictated to what they can do, what they can get away with by their
[01:23:48.769 --> 01:23:50.370]  enemies outside their borders.
[01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:52.250]  They cannot stomach that.
[01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:57.610]  But if they enter Gaza and defy those limitations, then they're opening themselves
[01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:00.210]  up to massive attack from Hezbollah.
[01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:07.009]  And you saw what Hamas was able to achieve with a much smaller, much less capable force
[01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:09.389]  than exists in Hezbollah.
[01:24:09.389 --> 01:24:12.089]  And it's not going to be good.
[01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:13.089]  Then Iran gets involved.
[01:24:13.089 --> 01:24:17.889]  And again, I want to remind people that we have American bases in the Middle East right
[01:24:17.889 --> 01:24:19.730]  now that are sitting ducks.
[01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:25.129]  And if we get involved and we, you know, and Russia has said that if we get involved
[01:24:25.129 --> 01:24:28.530]  against, you know, if America gets involved against Hezbollah, they're giving the green
[01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:32.530]  light to Syria and Iran to attack American bases in the Middle East.
[01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:37.969]  So the question Americans have to ask ourselves is, is it worth spending the lives of American
[01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:42.330]  servicemen to basically maintain the status quo?
[01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:44.570]  And how long can that go on?
[01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:47.849]  And is the status quo even something worth defending?
[01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:53.210]  I mean, I personally don't want to spend a single life to guarantee that Gaza remain
[01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:57.009]  a two million person open air prison.
[01:24:57.009 --> 01:25:02.570]  I really think you've got to you got to give the Palestinians rights.
[01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:04.009]  I mean, they have no rights at this point.
[01:25:04.009 --> 01:25:05.570]  They have no human rights at this point.
[01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:07.170]  They don't even have food and water.
[01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:09.889]  In fact, maybe we should go to that clip here.
[01:25:09.929 --> 01:25:19.490]  The headline is that the defense secretary, the defense minister of Israel, has ordered
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:24.490]  a total blockade of Gaza and they are limiting.
[01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.570]  And we'll just go to the video.
[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:26.210]  You'll you'll hear it here.
[01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:26.730]  Clip number nine.
[01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:29.330]  This is the Israeli defense minister this morning.
[01:25:32.769 --> 01:25:36.210]  He says we are imposing a complete siege on Gaza.
[01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:39.570]  There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel.
[01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:41.290]  Everything will be closed.
[01:25:41.969 --> 01:25:45.809]  We are fighting against human animals and we are acting accordingly.
[01:25:46.769 --> 01:25:50.610]  I mean, I just you know, God bless the Israeli people, but I'm not on that dude's side.
[01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:51.530]  I'm not on that.
[01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:56.250]  I'm not in favor of what that guy is just not just suggesting, but implementing
[01:25:56.250 --> 01:26:00.610]  now a total blockade, cutting off food, water and electricity from two million people.
[01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:01.929]  And they expect it to go well.
[01:26:01.929 --> 01:26:04.129]  They expect people just to die like what?
[01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:04.969]  Right.
[01:26:04.969 --> 01:26:06.170]  And I appreciate your perspective.
[01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:08.170]  You see a people provoked.
[01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:12.570]  Yeah, but then I look at how they responded and it was like such an overcompensation.
[01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.009]  Of course.
[01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:17.129]  And I think that it's something that we just tend to do as people psychologically,
[01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:19.570]  whether it's individuals or as societies.
[01:26:21.089 --> 01:26:25.290]  Altogether is whenever there's a problem, we tend to overcompensate for it.
[01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:28.009]  It's like getting in the shower when the water is too cold.
[01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:30.929]  Oh, I'm freezing and you swish it, you know, and all of a sudden you're
[01:26:30.929 --> 01:26:34.769]  burning and you have to kind of go back and forth until you find that perfect temperature.
[01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:44.290]  And as much as I understand the appreciation and appreciate the hell that the
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:50.769]  Palestinians have been through it, what is a German dancer have to do with it?
[01:26:51.089 --> 01:26:54.129]  That makes me sick and it makes me sick to see children bombed.
[01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:54.809]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:59.170]  But when you're going over intentionally grabbing civilians and then pulling them
[01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:03.530]  back and then celebrating and showing your kids that you're raping and murdering
[01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.849]  these people in front of your little kids.
[01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:06.570]  I mean, you want to have kids similar age.
[01:27:06.929 --> 01:27:09.450]  I can't imagine doing something like that in front of my kids, man.
[01:27:09.769 --> 01:27:13.009]  There's a certain level of just lost conscience at this point.
[01:27:13.009 --> 01:27:15.089]  The hatred is just totally covered.
[01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.210]  Yeah, no, it is.
[01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.650]  It is one of those things where it's like, it's like, I want to be on the
[01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:21.410]  Palestinian side, but then you see him do that.
[01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:26.650]  And it's just like, you know, the reason I'm, I typically am, you know,
[01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:29.009]  am, I like to support the underdog basically.
[01:27:29.009 --> 01:27:33.290]  And you see all these, all these images of, you know, Israelis, you know,
[01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.530]  whether it's the colonies, the, the settler camps or the settler, you
[01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:40.410]  know, buildings that they clear people out of, it's like, all right, I
[01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:43.009]  don't like that because I don't like the innocent people getting taken
[01:27:43.009 --> 01:27:43.330]  advantage of.
[01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.889]  I like the innocent people getting hurt.
[01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:48.049]  So then when the Palestinians go and hurt innocent people, it's like, well,
[01:27:48.049 --> 01:27:49.089]  this is what I'm against.
[01:27:49.089 --> 01:27:50.290]  So why are you doing it now?
[01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:51.210]  I'm against you doing that.
[01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.570]  I mean, it's, it is, it's an impossible situation.
[01:27:53.809 --> 01:27:59.769]  And again, maybe, maybe the, the silver lining of this is like, I can go,
[01:27:59.809 --> 01:28:01.530]  Hey, let's never let this happen again.
[01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:02.610]  And what does that take?
[01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.809]  Maybe it means lessening some of the restrictions on Gaza.
[01:28:05.809 --> 01:28:10.009]  Maybe doubling down on this is not the right response because maybe
[01:28:10.009 --> 01:28:14.210]  that's just going to radicalize and create more extremists in Gaza.
[01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.969]  Like what it's, it's inevitable.
[01:28:15.969 --> 01:28:19.530]  Basically you've got these 2 million people, people out there, you know, I
[01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:21.530]  mean, they're cutting off their electricity or cutting off their food.
[01:28:21.769 --> 01:28:23.210]  What do they think is going to happen?
[01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.210]  They can't, they, they don't have anywhere to go.
[01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:26.250]  They can't just flee.
[01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:28.009]  They're supposed to die.
[01:28:28.089 --> 01:28:29.009]  They're going to fight back.
[01:28:29.009 --> 01:28:30.809]  They're obviously going to fight back.
[01:28:30.809 --> 01:28:32.129]  That's the human reaction.
[01:28:32.129 --> 01:28:34.250]  You can't treat these people like animals.
[01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.049]  They're not animals.
[01:28:35.089 --> 01:28:36.610]  They're, they're going to act like humans.
[01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:37.650]  They're going to be humans.
[01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:41.330]  They're going to have the human response, which is to fight back and do the
[01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:45.410]  things to your enemies that they've done to you, even if it's brutal and
[01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:48.650]  horrific and to children and women, that's what they're going to do.
[01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:51.650]  So how, no matter how you feel about it, that's the reality.
[01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:56.490]  You have to treat this as it is and not in some fantasy world where you can do
[01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:57.809]  whatever you want and they have to die.
[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:04.490]  Last year, we put this book out the great reset in the war for the world.
[01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:06.290]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:10.090]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:13.250]  The great awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and
[01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:15.530]  launched the second great Renaissance.

[01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:26.530]  them, and then gives an alternate plan of the society we could build together.
[01:29:26.769 --> 01:29:28.090]  That's why it's the great awakening.

[01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:13.410]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq exactly one
[01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:17.290]  year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:20.690]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:22.530]  That's just cause they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:26.690]  What a beautiful setup while other networks lie to you about what's

[01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:49.490]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:53.570]  I am chase geyser filling in with Harrison Smith for the great Alex
[01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:59.410]  Jones, who seems to always be right before we get started diving into the
[01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:03.490]  news and with our special guest, this segment, let's talk a little bit about
[01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:08.049]  vitamin mineral fusion, which is back at 25% off.
[01:34:08.769 --> 01:34:10.570]  I highly recommend any of the products in our store.
[01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:14.530]  I was not a supplement person at all before I started working here, but.
[01:34:15.849 --> 01:34:18.570]  Asked around and was surprised to find out that it actually is true
[01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:21.610]  that many, if not all of the crew takes at least one or two of the
[01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:25.570]  products and I started using brain force plus started using turbo force
[01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:27.849]  plus, and they really do work.
[01:34:27.849 --> 01:34:32.730]  I know that vitamin mineral fusion is designed to sort of lay a foundation
[01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:37.530]  for our vitamin mineral health, which can actually help the other products in
[01:34:37.530 --> 01:34:39.250]  the store perform even better for you.
[01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.570]  So it is 25% off.
[01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:43.849]  I think the trifecta pack is also still on sale at 40% off.
[01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:49.209]  So it'd be great time to get those products and pair them with this
[01:34:49.209 --> 01:34:53.530]  vitamin mineral fusion at info wars store.com.
[01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:55.209]  What's on your mind, Harrison?
[01:34:55.650 --> 01:34:59.650]  Well, we're gonna, we're gonna welcome Michael Yon to the program.
[01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:01.690]  And now he is a journalist.
[01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:05.090]  I don't know if we, I don't know if calling you a war correspondent
[01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:07.049]  is the right answer, but you've been to a lot of conflict zones.
[01:35:07.049 --> 01:35:09.530]  You've been doing incredible work at the Southern border, but you have
[01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:11.849]  a lot of insight into the situation in the middle East.
[01:35:12.009 --> 01:35:14.170]  So I'm very happy to welcome to the show now, Mr.
[01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:15.570]  Michael Yon, welcome to the show, Michael.
[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:20.530]  I'm in Panama right now, back in the Darien Gap.
[01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:22.370]  I just left the Darien Gap this morning.
[01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:24.170]  This is highway one, Pan American highway.
[01:35:24.730 --> 01:35:27.929]  It's been, it's going to be completed to Columbia at some point.
[01:35:27.929 --> 01:35:29.090]  They're building a bridge now.
[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:31.370]  Down near you'll meet some Panama.
[01:35:31.889 --> 01:35:34.610]  I've been down in Darien Gap where I've spent, I don't know, maybe
[01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:36.490]  six months since Biden was installed.
[01:35:36.809 --> 01:35:41.049]  Because this lane, this one lane you see right here is the two lane highway.
[01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:46.490]  This one lane right beside me is the lane that goes to the United States.
[01:35:47.009 --> 01:35:51.129]  And this is the lane where three to 5,000 aliens per day head up in buses
[01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:53.170]  that probably pass us on with you.
[01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:58.570]  And now the presence of Costa Rica and Panama were just together on the
[01:35:58.610 --> 01:36:00.769]  stick for about a few days ago.
[01:36:00.969 --> 01:36:04.009]  They were down in Las Blancas camp where I was just at actually.
[01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:08.490]  And they announced that they're going to go from about 60 buses per day.
[01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:10.889]  So from about five dozen buses per day.
[01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:15.129]  And those buses fit about roughly 50 people per bus, depending on how
[01:36:15.129 --> 01:36:16.330]  many children and that sort of thing.
[01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:21.009]  They're going to go from 60 to five dozen to about 200 per
[01:36:21.009 --> 01:36:23.530]  day on the average day, right?
[01:36:23.809 --> 01:36:26.650]  They're building two camps out in the Darien Gap right now.
[01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:28.049]  Again, I've been out here a lot.
[01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:31.570]  I'm very familiar with the Darien Gap, the crossing between Colombia and Panama.
[01:36:32.009 --> 01:36:35.450]  This is the pathway for the world to get to the United States.
[01:36:35.809 --> 01:36:37.209]  That's why I spend so much time here.
[01:36:37.209 --> 01:36:38.370]  This is the final train.
[01:36:39.009 --> 01:36:42.370]  This is the train from which if you can get your feet anywhere in South America,
[01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:45.570]  then you just work yourself off to Colombia and then go through the
[01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:47.730]  Darien Gap and then you get in a bus.
[01:36:47.929 --> 01:36:53.370]  Now the presidents of Panama and Costa Rica made a decision very recently,
[01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:57.129]  but they announced it on the 6th of October, that they're going to start
[01:36:57.129 --> 01:36:59.530]  allowing these buses to come up from the Darien Gap.
[01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:05.009]  It'll be going right by me probably while we're talking to Costa Rica.
[01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:07.650]  They used to stop there even two days ago.
[01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:09.490]  They would stop at the Costa Rican border.
[01:37:09.929 --> 01:37:11.849]  The aliens would be stuck there for a while.
[01:37:11.849 --> 01:37:13.250]  Michael, I'm sorry.
[01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:14.370]  I got to jump in here.
[01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.410]  We're having a lot of trouble hearing you.
[01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.049]  It's the audio is not great.
[01:37:18.049 --> 01:37:20.090]  So we can reconnect with you.
[01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:23.969]  Our producers are working behind the scenes to get a better connection because I just
[01:37:23.969 --> 01:37:25.929]  want people to be able to hear what you're saying.
[01:37:25.929 --> 01:37:26.929]  It's important information.
[01:37:26.929 --> 01:37:31.250]  And if we can't get it clearly, then we need to fix that.
[01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:34.490]  So we're going to reconnect with Michael on here in just a second.
[01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:37.889]  We do have some other videos to go to in the meantime.
[01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:42.450]  Well, and some other stories to cover.
[01:37:42.450 --> 01:37:48.170]  The latest that we're hearing is that it may very well be tonight that the
[01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:50.969]  ground operation in Gaza kicks off.
[01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:56.209]  Again, this would be the start of the domino effect.
[01:37:56.450 --> 01:38:02.610]  If they enter Gaza, Hezbollah has said that they will enter into a war stance with Israel
[01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:07.450]  from the north, opening up two fronts in an already overstretched Israel.
[01:38:07.889 --> 01:38:09.969]  Israel is in a very, very bad situation right now.
[01:38:09.969 --> 01:38:13.929]  The US has sent a carrier strike group there for Israeli support.
[01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:19.490]  We've promised basically unconditional support for Israel in terms of military supplies,
[01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:23.530]  but have essentially said that we're not going to get actively involved.
[01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:27.690]  However, you've got people like Lindsey Graham saying that if Hezbollah attacks,
[01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:32.209]  then we'll have to get into this, which then brings Iran and Syria in.
[01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:33.849]  Then it's World War Three.
[01:38:33.849 --> 01:38:38.090]  As we've been explaining on InfoWars for the last several years,
[01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.889]  these are the fault lines being drawn.
[01:38:40.889 --> 01:38:47.730]  It's Russia, China, Iran, Syria, that whole block versus Israel, America,
[01:38:48.209 --> 01:38:51.250]  the puppet regime in Ukraine and NATO.
[01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:55.129]  And it's scary how there is no, like when you really play it out in your mind,
[01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.330]  there's no downside to war for the globalists.
[01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:59.490]  There's no downside to war for the New World Order.
[01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:04.450]  It gives them everything they want faster and more conveniently than they would get it otherwise.
[01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:13.450]  This is breaking Mario Naful on Twitter, who's keeping pretty rapid up to date on this conflict.
[01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:19.250]  He says, Israeli home front command asks Israelis to prepare for a three-day stay in safe rooms.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:22.049]  In light of the development of the fighting in various sectors, you must prepare equipment
[01:39:22.049 --> 01:39:26.849]  that will allow you and your family to stay safe in rooms for up to 72 hours.
[01:39:26.849 --> 01:39:32.290]  Pretty horrifying message to get from your government.
[01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:33.290]  And of course, Israel-
[01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:36.129]  We're going to bomb you, so stay inside.
[01:39:36.129 --> 01:39:39.730]  I get, I mean, they're telling the Israelis to stay inside, right?
[01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:44.929]  So, man, it is rapidly spiraling out of control.
[01:39:44.929 --> 01:39:47.969]  It is rapidly spiraling out of control.
[01:39:47.969 --> 01:39:51.370]  You have interesting international aspects to this.
[01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:57.690]  The Arab League chief has gone to Moscow to talk with the Russian foreign minister
[01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:00.170]  about what's going on in Israel.
[01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:06.450]  You have some countries suggesting that, you know, we de-escalate here.
[01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:09.650]  Egypt warns of consequences of escalation in Israel.
[01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:13.009]  Turkey's Erdogan calls for restraint as well.
[01:40:13.009 --> 01:40:18.410]  So it seems like a lot of countries around the world are going, hey, this is a, you know,
[01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:21.290]  tinderbox you're playing with here.
[01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:29.250]  Let's not burn the earth down in this, in a response to a horrific, but at this point
[01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:33.490]  overt terrorist attack against the people of Israel.
[01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:34.490]  Absolutely.
[01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:39.370]  I did find it very interesting that Israel expected a stronger condemnation of Hamas from
[01:40:39.370 --> 01:40:40.370]  China.
[01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:46.769]  A Beijing embassy official says here in this Reuters article, sort of crickets from China
[01:40:46.769 --> 01:40:51.490]  on this is pretty interesting and sort of supports the theory that China's pushing
[01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:58.370]  Iran, which is pushing Palestine to sort of do this in the hopes of reducing any sort
[01:40:58.370 --> 01:41:04.769]  of military capabilities in Israel or in the region as a whole through Israel.
[01:41:04.769 --> 01:41:09.209]  But again, man, I don't want to take either side.
[01:41:09.209 --> 01:41:13.330]  I'm an American and I know that we have this petrodollar and we have this currency
[01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:18.809]  and there's all sorts of complicated dynamics happening in the region.
[01:41:18.809 --> 01:41:22.889]  But it just goes to show if we would have had honest money from the beginning, if we
[01:41:22.889 --> 01:41:28.469]  would have stayed on a gold standard, not put in fractional reserve banking, not gotten
[01:41:28.469 --> 01:41:35.209]  so involved in all of these conflicts and regions, then we wouldn't be in this position.
[01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:39.590]  If the theory is true that this is about protecting the sanctity of the petrodollar, which it
[01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:45.090]  may very well not be, but if that is true, then this is just another example of unintentional
[01:41:45.090 --> 01:41:50.750]  blowback or consequences of doing shady stuff that doesn't really add up and kicking
[01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:54.009]  the can down the road and expanding debt continuously.
[01:41:54.009 --> 01:41:55.009]  Yeah.
[01:41:55.009 --> 01:41:59.730]  And it's one of those things that it's like obviously the people on the ground,
[01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:03.929]  like the people in Israel who are hiding in safe rooms right now, they don't really
[01:42:03.929 --> 01:42:05.870]  care about the petrodollar, right?
[01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:06.870]  That's not there.
[01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:08.990]  That's not why they're calling for certain things.
[01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:12.170]  But the people who are running the world and really making the decisions, that is
[01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:13.929]  likely on the forefront of their mind.
[01:42:13.929 --> 01:42:17.809]  So it looks like we've reconnected with Michael Yon.
[01:42:17.809 --> 01:42:20.929]  Michael, we had some trouble hearing you there.
[01:42:20.929 --> 01:42:23.090]  You're there in the Darien Gap.
[01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:27.450]  Trump put out a tweet saying that he was worried that essentially there are going to
[01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:33.809]  be sleeper cells of Hamas or really anybody inside America ready to launch similar attacks
[01:42:33.809 --> 01:42:34.809]  we saw in Israel.
[01:42:34.809 --> 01:42:40.330]  I mean, a very similar thing could be orchestrated here in America with the influx of foreigners
[01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:41.330]  totally unvetted.
[01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:42.330]  We don't know where they're from.
[01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:44.889]  We don't know who they are, but we are giving them plane tickets farther into the
[01:42:44.889 --> 01:42:45.889]  country.
[01:42:45.889 --> 01:42:50.330]  How does the immigration crisis play into what we're seeing unfold in the Middle East
[01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.330]  right now?
[01:42:51.330 --> 01:42:52.330]  Right.
[01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:57.209]  Actually, I've just left Darien Gap a few hours ago, and now I'm up on Highway 1.
[01:42:57.209 --> 01:43:01.290]  This is the highway to the Darien Gap and goes up through Costa Rica and Nicaragua
[01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:03.610]  and eventually to the United States.
[01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:04.610]  Now, how does this play in?
[01:43:04.610 --> 01:43:07.049]  I see people from Gaza coming through all the time.
[01:43:07.049 --> 01:43:08.250]  I talk with them out in the jungle.
[01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:11.990]  I mean, I'll ask people where they're from, I meet Afghans all the time every
[01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:17.009]  single day, meet tons of Chinese every single day, mostly Venezuelans coming in.
[01:43:17.009 --> 01:43:21.250]  But now we've got three to five thousand people coming in per day, tons of Arabs.
[01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:22.250]  I don't even know how many.
[01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:23.250]  You can't keep track.
[01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:26.969]  It's just the human waves coming in, and it's increasing.
[01:43:26.969 --> 01:43:30.330]  Right now, as we speak, they're making two new camps out in the jungle.
[01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:32.530]  We were just out there yesterday, got more drone footage.
[01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:35.889]  One of the camps is about 60 to 80 acres now.
[01:43:35.889 --> 01:43:36.889]  They're still cutting it down.
[01:43:36.889 --> 01:43:42.929]  This is deep in the jungle, and this will be big enough for at least 15,000 new aliens
[01:43:42.929 --> 01:43:47.730]  per day to top the current capacity that they already have, which is three to five
[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:48.730]  thousand.
[01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:50.849]  So that's another 15,000 per day.
[01:43:50.849 --> 01:43:53.330]  And then there's another camp that they're building right now as well.
[01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:54.889]  So don't be surprised.
[01:43:54.889 --> 01:44:01.490]  I'm being very conservative to say that by January or so, expect 10,000 per day coming
[01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:02.929]  just out of the Darien Gap.
[01:44:02.929 --> 01:44:07.009]  That doesn't include other feeders coming through, like many people fly to El Salvador
[01:44:07.009 --> 01:44:14.009]  first or Honduras or Mexico City or Cancun, or they come through the Canadian border.
[01:44:14.009 --> 01:44:18.049]  Others are coming up on Jupiter Beach in Florida, you know, another place in Florida.
[01:44:18.049 --> 01:44:20.650]  And many are coming in with the CBP-1 app.
[01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:24.490]  In other words, they're flying in directly from places like Guatemala.
[01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:25.809]  They're flying in from Colombia.
[01:44:25.809 --> 01:44:27.570]  They're flying in all over the United States.
[01:44:27.570 --> 01:44:31.330]  So we're being flooded with millions of people.
[01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:34.290]  I'm talking, I don't even know how many.
[01:44:34.290 --> 01:44:35.290]  Nobody knows.
[01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:36.290]  Nobody actually knows at this point.
[01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:41.410]  But the border patrol, I thought when they came here, they were saying that nobody
[01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:42.410]  knows.
[01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:44.410]  And most of the border patrol are not even on the border right now.
[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:46.410]  They're in the in-processing facilities.
[01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:50.209]  They're in the in-processing facilities, basically rubber-stamping everybody to come in.
[01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:52.410]  So how many Hamas are coming in?
[01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:53.410]  I don't know.
[01:44:53.410 --> 01:44:57.049]  But we see protests around the United States now by Hamas, Australia, as well.
[01:44:57.049 --> 01:44:58.049]  This is horrible.
[01:44:58.049 --> 01:45:00.769]  There's going to be massive terrorism in the United States.
[01:45:00.769 --> 01:45:01.769]  There already has been.
[01:45:01.769 --> 01:45:02.769]  Look, Sweden's gone, right?
[01:45:02.769 --> 01:45:03.769]  I was just in Luxembourg last year.
[01:45:03.769 --> 01:45:04.769]  It's about 50 percent migrants now.
[01:45:04.769 --> 01:45:05.769]  I didn't say 1-5.
[01:45:05.769 --> 01:45:06.769]  I said 5-0, right?
[01:45:06.769 --> 01:45:07.769]  It's gone.
[01:45:07.769 --> 01:45:08.769]  Luxembourg's gone.
[01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:09.769]  When I was in Luxembourg the first time, when I was in the army, it was the jewel
[01:45:09.769 --> 01:45:10.769]  of Europe.
[01:45:10.769 --> 01:45:11.769]  It was beautiful.
[01:45:11.769 --> 01:45:20.769]  It was a place where the children can play outside at midnight.
[01:45:20.769 --> 01:45:24.290]  Now you don't want to take your family there in broad daylight.
[01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:26.889]  In downtown Luxembourg, it's quite dangerous now.
[01:45:26.889 --> 01:45:29.690]  It's completely compromised, as is most of Europe.
[01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:30.690]  It's going that direction.
[01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:32.610]  Not Hungary.
[01:45:32.610 --> 01:45:33.610]  Not Czech Republic.
[01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:34.610]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:35.610]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:41.090]  And of course, we know that the migrant crisis, at least as it exists in Europe,
[01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:43.929]  is a consequence of our involvement in the Middle East in the first place.
[01:45:43.929 --> 01:45:45.650]  Again, we're going to have to reconnect with Michael.
[01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:46.650]  I'm so sorry.
[01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:48.610]  We're having a lot of trouble reconnecting.
[01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:52.690]  We'll do it over the phone line, and that will make it easier and we'll be able to hear
[01:45:52.690 --> 01:45:54.250]  you more clearly.
[01:45:54.809 --> 01:46:02.490]  And again, you have to wonder how this spirals out of control, because that is another aspect
[01:46:02.490 --> 01:46:07.809]  of this, that you have massive populations in America, in Western Europe, that you can
[01:46:07.809 --> 01:46:11.969]  see all the videos from yesterday and even today.
[01:46:11.969 --> 01:46:18.809]  People waving the Palestinian flag, driving around, honking, and celebrating over this.
[01:46:18.809 --> 01:46:23.450]  These are potential hostile forces that we've imported in here, and then you get into
[01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:27.730]  the number of Chinese people that have entered into America, and it's like, while we are
[01:46:27.730 --> 01:46:34.650]  completely lax in allowing our own country to be literally invaded by millions of people,
[01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:40.209]  we are hyper, hyper concerned about what goes on in Ukraine and Israel.
[01:46:40.209 --> 01:46:44.209]  And when Donald Trump wants $3 billion to build the wall, we have to shut down the
[01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:48.049]  government and have debates and make arguments, and it doesn't happen.
[01:46:48.049 --> 01:46:51.849]  We have to invoke obscure military funding rules to try to get it done.
[01:46:51.849 --> 01:46:54.090]  And then, you know, Israel gets attacked on Saturday.
[01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:57.330]  By Sunday, they've got a $6 billion check coming their way.
[01:46:57.330 --> 01:46:59.330]  Just not even a discussion, not even.
[01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:02.370]  And that's what is almost most frustrating to me about the American government as a
[01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:03.370]  whole.
[01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:04.570]  We are choosing these problems.
[01:47:04.570 --> 01:47:08.049]  We are deciding to have these problems exist.
[01:47:08.049 --> 01:47:09.969]  They are all imminently solvable.
[01:47:09.969 --> 01:47:10.969]  We are so powerful.
[01:47:10.969 --> 01:47:13.009]  We are so capable as a country.
[01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:19.490]  It is our leadership and our government that is willfully subjecting us to invasion, restriction,
[01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:21.629]  collapse as a whole.
[01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:22.629]  It's infuriating.
[01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:27.750]  And it's sort of it just sort of emphasizes how infuriating that is when you see how capable
[01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:32.969]  we are at intervening for the sake of another country like Israel or Ukraine.
[01:47:32.969 --> 01:47:37.070]  How many mistakes can Joe Biden make before we realize that it's not just because he's
[01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:41.730]  a blithering idiot, but it's actually straight up treason?
[01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:45.290]  Like look at all the things that have happened since the Biden administration, not even
[01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:47.830]  counting the things that happened while he was the vice president with Hunter Biden
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:48.990]  in the laptop.
[01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:51.110]  We've had Ukraine invaded.
[01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:58.309]  We've had billions upon billions of our own dollars go straight to that war for no obvious
[01:47:58.309 --> 01:48:00.509]  or apparent reason.
[01:48:00.509 --> 01:48:05.389]  We have Israel, which is supposed to be our ally as a nation, being attacked and we're
[01:48:05.389 --> 01:48:06.389]  surprised about it.
[01:48:06.389 --> 01:48:08.150]  Our intelligence community didn't catch it.
[01:48:08.150 --> 01:48:12.070]  Their intelligence community allegedly didn't catch it.
[01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:13.070]  We've got China moving.
[01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:14.910]  We've got Iran pushing.
[01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:19.190]  We've got the collapse of Afghanistan, which was atrocious.
[01:48:19.190 --> 01:48:23.070]  And then we've got Taiwan being surrounded by China.
[01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:25.429]  Literally everything that could go wrong is going wrong.
[01:48:25.429 --> 01:48:29.690]  Inflation is through the roof and our border is wide open for no apparent reason either.
[01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:34.950]  The only people that they're deporting are the Venezuelans who are the right wing
[01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:41.809]  or right leaning ones and probably the only ones that are actually eligible for asylum.
[01:48:41.809 --> 01:48:46.790]  Them and German families that homeschool their children, they're also getting deported.
[01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:48.629]  I honestly think this is all on purpose.
[01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:53.150]  I wonder if he just took a bribe from China to sell us out to let the whole country fall
[01:48:53.150 --> 01:48:54.389]  apart at this point.
[01:48:54.389 --> 01:49:00.070]  You know, at a certain point, it does not matter whether it is malice or stupidity
[01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:03.150]  because we're paying the price for it regardless.
[01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:06.870]  Again, very, very dangerous situation we find ourselves in.
[01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:09.610]  We are monitoring some of the latest breaking news.
[01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:14.429]  They have called in 300,000 reservists to Israel.
[01:49:14.429 --> 01:49:18.509]  We've got the Israeli government telling their own people get underground for three
[01:49:18.509 --> 01:49:20.870]  days while we take care of this.
[01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:26.990]  You've got a bizarre sort of occurrence where you have some Israeli citizens in places
[01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:31.709]  like America going back to Israel to fight, while meanwhile you have video after video
[01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:36.030]  of mass numbers of people fleeing to the airport in Israel trying to get out of the
[01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:38.910]  country before this conflict happens.
[01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:45.450]  Nine Americans have been killed in this event and, you know, it only promises to accelerate
[01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:46.450]  moving forward.
[01:49:46.450 --> 01:49:50.309]  Again, we can get into some of the, you know, international aspects of this as we
[01:49:50.309 --> 01:49:51.309]  move forward.
[01:49:51.309 --> 01:49:55.150]  I do understand we are back with Michael Young, third time's a charm.
[01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:57.790]  We'll have the connection be decent this time.
[01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:59.269]  Michael, thank you for calling in.
[01:49:59.269 --> 01:50:01.190]  I'm sorry you keep getting cut off.
[01:50:01.190 --> 01:50:05.809]  I guess that's the price you have to pay for being on the ground and in some of these
[01:50:05.809 --> 01:50:07.230]  conflict zones.
[01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:12.129]  Not the best internet connection, but hopefully we can establish a better connection now.
[01:50:12.129 --> 01:50:14.709]  Thank you again for working with us, Michael.
[01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:15.709]  Thank you.
[01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:20.429]  Yeah, I've got a star link here, but it's not working, so we're almost done.
[01:50:20.429 --> 01:50:26.030]  And so, in any case, yeah, you know, the so-called border crisis that Europe is having
[01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:28.910]  is similar to the border crisis in Israel and Ukraine.
[01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:31.110]  That's what kind of border crisis this is.
[01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:32.709]  This is straight up war, right?
[01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:34.030]  This is not a border crisis.
[01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:35.030]  That's a mischaracterization.
[01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:37.830]  This is a war.
[01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:38.830]  We're being invaded.
[01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:43.030]  We're being invaded by millions per year into the United States.
[01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:49.030]  And right now, again, I see people from Gaza coming through the Darian Gap constantly,
[01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:50.030]  right?
[01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:52.030]  They're all over the United States now, right?
[01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:53.030]  And they have been for years.
[01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:56.030]  And, you know, we see the reports, by the way, coming from Israel.
[01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:59.030]  And by the way, as I was just leaving the Darian Gap this morning, a friend told
[01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:02.030]  me that a couple of weeks ago, I haven't been able to check this out because I've
[01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:08.030]  been in the Darian Gap today, that, you know, we issued a visa free travel for Israelis
[01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:09.030]  a couple of weeks ago.
[01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:11.030]  So they need to fact check that if that's true.
[01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:14.030]  It's a good and reliable source, but it needs to be checked.
[01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:16.030]  Again, I just left the gap.
[01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:18.030]  That would be quite interesting timing.
[01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:24.030]  In any case, the visa free travel to the United States, because I said, you know,
[01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:29.030]  with this war in Israel, we're going to start seeing Israelis come through the
[01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:30.030]  Darian Gap.
[01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:35.030]  And he said, no, they just, you know, offered visa free travel a couple of weeks ago.
[01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:40.030]  So in any case, yeah, so right now, yeah, so please check that out.
[01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:41.030]  It's a reliable source.
[01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:43.030]  But again, I just left the jungle.
[01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:47.030]  But at the same time, the people who are coming in are from all over the world,
[01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:51.030]  Afghanistan, tons of Chinese, of course, three to five thousand a day.
[01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:54.030]  That number is clearly going to go up to at least 10,000.
[01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:55.030]  Right now it's rainy season, by the way.
[01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:57.030]  So the jungle is very muddy right now.
[01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:59.030]  It's very difficult to get through.
[01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:01.030]  But by January, it should be dry.
[01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:05.030]  And that's when, even though this is rainy season, and normally in rainy season,
[01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:09.030]  the numbers decrease, the numbers have been increasing month after month.
[01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:13.030]  In August, the Panamanian government told me 82,000 came through the Darian Gap
[01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:14.030]  in August, right?
[01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:16.030]  That was August of 2023.
[01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:18.030]  In September, I don't have the numbers yet.
[01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:21.030]  But I think those numbers are going to be close to 100,000,
[01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:23.030]  based on what I'm seeing down here.
[01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:28.030]  And I think the numbers now in October will be some number far greater than 100,000.
[01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:35.030]  And by January, I would be surprised if it's less than 300,000 per month.
[01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:41.030]  So I've sort of prognosticated for years that when we see World War III,
[01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:44.030]  it's going to be less of states versus states
[01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:46.030]  and more of what looks like a worldwide civil war,
[01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:48.030]  where you're going to have populations within countries
[01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:50.030]  fighting the leadership of that country.
[01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:53.030]  You're going to have migrants fighting the natives of those countries.
[01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:57.030]  I mean, it really seems like when World War III breaks out,
[01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:59.030]  which almost seems like an inevitability at this point,
[01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.030]  it's not going to be, like I just said,
[01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:03.030]  big blocks of states fighting against one another.
[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:05.030]  That'll be an aspect of it.
[01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:08.030]  But you'll also have this very scary reality
[01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:12.030]  of having massive foreign populations within Western countries
[01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:17.030]  suddenly acting as enemy reserves behind enemy lines.
[01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:21.030]  That is a very distinct possibility, is it not?
[01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:23.030]  Well, it's exactly what's happening.
[01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:24.030]  It's not even a possibility.
[01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:26.030]  That's what they say they're doing, right?
[01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:27.030]  Right.
[01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:29.030]  I mean, this is straight up right in everybody's face.
[01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:31.030]  They're not hiding it at all.
[01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:33.030]  And, you know, Alex has been talking about this for years.
[01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:35.030]  Well, here it comes, and it's here.
[01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:39.030]  And you see right now, you know, old-school war is usually
[01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:41.030]  population against population, right?
[01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:42.030]  It's this tribe against that.
[01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:44.030]  It's Huthus versus Huthis.
[01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:49.030]  You know, it's Han Chinese against Uyghur.
[01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:50.030]  You know, it's that sort of thing.
[01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:53.030]  And that's, of course, what's happening in Israel right now.
[01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:57.030]  You see these reports, by the way, of American citizens being killed in Israel.
[01:53:57.030 --> 01:54:01.030]  Well, they might be being killed by other American citizens
[01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:03.030]  because many American citizens are Hamas.
[01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:08.030]  Many American citizens are Israeli Jews or Israeli Arabs, Israeli Muslims.
[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.030]  You know what I mean?
[01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:12.030]  It's not like, for those who have been to Israel,
[01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:14.030]  you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:17.030]  There are a lot of Hamas who are American citizens.
[01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:19.030]  It literally could be Americans killing Americans over there.
[01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:20.030]  I have no idea.
[01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:23.030]  But the bottom line is, that's a people versus people war.
[01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:28.030]  And there are obviously nation-states involved, such as Iran, of course,
[01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:32.030]  and many others in the United States as well.
[01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:35.030]  And so, you know, Israel, obviously, serious times ahead,
[01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:39.030]  and I expect more diasporas to come through the United States.
[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:42.030]  You know, it's just a matter of getting on the airplanes
[01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:44.030]  and getting through the United States.
[01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:45.030]  Let me ask you this, Michael.
[01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:47.030]  Since you are sort of a war correspondent,
[01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:50.030]  at least you have experience in these conflict areas,
[01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:54.030]  what are we potentially missing from the reporting that we're seeing?
[01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:56.030]  Like, if you're on the ground reporting on something,
[01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:58.030]  and then that night you go and check the headlines,
[01:54:58.030 --> 01:55:00.030]  you go, how is nobody mentioning this?
[01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:05.030]  Like, what do we miss as people who are relying on the mainstream media
[01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:08.030]  for a lot of cases, or at least big media companies,
[01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:10.030]  we're relying on them to see what's happening.
[01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.030]  For the people on the ground,
[01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:14.030]  what do you think they're seeing that we're not seeing,
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:16.030]  even if it's speculative or just vague?
[01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:18.030]  Like, what do the American people miss
[01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:23.030]  by not actually having eyes on the ground there in Gaza reporting in real time?
[01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:27.030]  What is just an example of something that we may be blind to
[01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:29.030]  and not even know that we're blind to?
[01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:32.030]  Well, I'm not in Israel at the moment.
[01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:35.030]  I'm down in Panama, and I left the Bering Gap just hours ago, right?
[01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:39.030]  So this is part of that war.
[01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:41.030]  This is not, you know, there's all these separate wars
[01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:43.030]  that are all connected, though.
[01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:46.030]  And this is the invasion that's going on through here.
[01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:49.030]  There's a specific reason why I'm here, obviously,
[01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:52.030]  because that traffic you hear behind me is Highway 1,
[01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:54.030]  going straight to the United States.
[01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:55.030]  This is the invasion force.
[01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:59.030]  And so, look what's happened to Israel, right?
[01:55:59.030 --> 01:56:04.030]  And by the way, everybody acting surprised about what's happening in Israel,
[01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:05.030]  how can you be surprised?
[01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:07.030]  It's almost embarrassing to say you're surprised.
[01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:10.030]  Hamas has been saying they're going to do this for years.
[01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:12.030]  They've been building tunnels for years.
[01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:13.030]  They've been buying rockets.
[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.030]  The United States is giving them billions of dollars,
[01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:17.030]  and they've clearly stated their intent.
[01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:20.030]  And now, you know, they're suddenly doing it.
[01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:23.030]  Surprised? How can anybody be surprised by this?
[01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:27.030]  And it was just, the enemy will generally, an enemy like that anyway,
[01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:30.030]  like TCP or Hamas or all these various groups,
[01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:33.030]  they will tend to tell you what they're going to do.
[01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:35.030]  Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.
[01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:37.030]  Mao said exactly what he was going to do.
[01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:39.030]  Pol Pot said what he was going to do.
[01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:41.030]  You know, they say what they're going to do,
[01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:42.030]  and then they execute.
[01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:45.030]  And you see the World Economic Forum now is saying
[01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:49.030]  that they're going to cause the migration of 1.2 billion people.
[01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:51.030]  It is unfolding.
[01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:54.030]  That's why I'm here beside Highway 1 and Panama,
[01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:57.030]  because this is a major invasion route to the United States.
[01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:59.030]  And the United States has gone, Israel's just dead, period.
[01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:01.030]  That's why I'm focused on this.
[01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:04.030]  If we die, Israel's dead anyway.
[01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:06.030]  But this is the main battlefield.
[01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:10.030]  I am on the main front of this right here.
[01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:13.030]  The Darien Gap is the main invasion front.
[01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:15.030]  Talk about a multi-front war.
[01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:17.030]  I mean, it's like every street in every city
[01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:21.030]  is going to be a front of World War III once it really kicks off.
[01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:22.030]  And I think you're exactly right.
[01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:24.030]  Thank you so much for Michael Yon reporting live
[01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:26.030]  from the Darien Gap there down in Panama.
[01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:28.030]  If the crew could bring up that last statement,
[01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:30.030]  this is sort of a horrifying development.
[01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:33.030]  A spokesperson for Hamas says he regrets to announce
[01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:37.030]  that from now on they will start executing civilian hostages
[01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:40.030]  they took from Israel on live TV for every IDF airstrike
[01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:42.030]  that hit civilians in Gaza.
[01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:45.030]  A horrifying and brutal development.
[01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:46.030]  More on the other side.
[01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:47.030]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:51.030]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:54.030]  Where were you when the globalists were caught
[01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:57.030]  trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:59.030]  Where were you when the New World Order
[01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:01.030]  was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:02.030]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:05.030]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now,
[01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:06.030]  and I salute you and thank you.
[01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:09.030]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long
[01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:13.030]  to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now,
[01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:16.030]  and a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening,
[01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:20.030]  defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:22.030]  This is my second book,
[01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:24.030]  part two of the great reset in the War for the World.
[01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:27.030]  It's a longer book, a quite frankly more powerful book,
[01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.030]  and just like the last book went to number one,
[01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:32.030]  it is up to you to sense the number one right now.
[01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:34.030]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists,
[01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:36.030]  and it funds the Infowars.
[01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:40.030]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now
[01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:42.030]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.030]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:45.030]  This is a book everybody needs.
[01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:47.030]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening right now.
[01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:49.030]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:50.030]  Thought it was next week.
[01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:51.030]  I come in this morning.
[01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:54.030]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:56.030]  Body's ultimate memory formula.
[01:58:56.030 --> 01:59:00.030]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:02.030]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:06.030]  Look how full this model is.
[01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:09.030]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:15.030]  Right to the top with these 95% humanoids.
[01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:18.030]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:19.030]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:22.030]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:26.030]  This is 95%.
[01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:28.030]  Super constant, so like taking one pill
[01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:31.030]  is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:34.030]  It's that powerful or more.
[01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:37.030]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:40.030]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:42.030]  Pulled out for almost 8 months back in stock
[01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:48.030]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:47.800 --> 02:00:05.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.000]  What's happening right now is truly biblical.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.740]  I mean it feels like the culmination of so many various events.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:20.180]  Russia is accelerating its counter-offensive in Donbas as it continues to establish control
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:25.120]  of the eastern part of Ukraine, and in many cases you could argue that this is almost
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.620]  like Russia's opening up a second front.
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:32.940]  Not that Russia coordinated this or, I mean, they may have had some foreknowledge, but
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:38.340]  I think the war in Ukraine might be taking a backseat to what's happening in the Middle
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:42.900]  East, which may mean that, you know, if we only have a certain amount of money and
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.940]  weapons to send, it's going to Israel, not to Ukraine.
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.000]  We may see a peace settlement in Ukraine before too long.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.700]  That's just my guess, looking at the geopolitical chessboard here.
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:59.260]  By the way, this is the third hour of the American Journal, it's not the American
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.840]  Journal, that's the show I host in the morning.
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.840]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:03.840]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.360]  I usually host the American Journal, the Infowars Morning Show.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.240]  Chase Geyser is sitting in with me, co-hosting the Alex Jones Show today as we deal with
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:15.360]  this truly biblical turn of events.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.040]  And I mean, we haven't even gotten in, we touched a little bit on the idea of the Third
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:23.720]  Temple, rebuilding it, Al-Aqsa Mosque, that most of this is actually sort of centered
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:31.560]  on with some of the Israeli, well, what the Palestinians call Israeli abuses, Israeli
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.360]  sort of breaking their agreement to allow use of the Al-Aqsa Mosque for the Muslims
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.960]  that live there and in Palestine.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:43.400]  The building of the Third Temple that would bring about what some people think is the
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.800]  Antichrist, other people think would be the Messiah.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:53.320]  On top of that, you have these prophecies from Revelations about the Euphrates going
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:54.320]  dry.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.640]  Well, Euphrates is dry for the first time in history.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:59.880]  I mean, it's like prophecies are being fulfilled here, Chase.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:05.960]  We are in a biblical time period, a period of biblical importance.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.400]  Do you think it, I mean, what do you think is going on?
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:13.080]  Do you think there's people just using the Bible and the world's religions to achieve,
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:19.240]  you know, very mundane or, you know, temporal victories here on earth?
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.440]  Or do you think there's something to the spiritual aspect of all this?
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.560]  I've got a couple opinions about that.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:28.680]  First thing is I really take to heart the passage that the end will come like a thief
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:29.680]  in the night.
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.580]  I don't think anybody knows when it's going to happen.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:34.800]  You can analyze the Bible all you want, try to study the numbers, try to line up
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.000]  the dates, read the verses.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:38.040]  But nobody's really going to know.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:42.080]  There's going to be major surprise, I think, when the rapture happens.
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:47.480]  The other thing, well, one thing, let me just, a lot of people are saying that this
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:51.120]  conflict may start to blow up, may start to get really big.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:54.740]  And I mean, the idea is that the Antichrist will come as a peacemaker.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:59.080]  So somebody, if you start seeing like a politician that you weren't really aware of before
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:05.520]  and both sides are really into him and he comes as a peacemaker to settle this conflict,
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.920]  a lot of people looking for the rapture are looking for somebody like that to emerge and
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:15.160]  create peace in this area in the setup to becoming the Antichrist.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:16.160]  Yeah.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.480]  I'm more concerned about what is more obviously going to happen than I struggle
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480]  with the Bible.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.540]  I think that the Revelations is designed to make sense in hindsight, not designed
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:28.840]  to really help you understand what's going to happen.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:34.180]  I think it's going to be like a, you were wrong the whole time situation to those
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.740]  who weren't believers, to those who condemned and they're going to look and it's going
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:38.620]  to be like an enlightenment.
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:43.880]  But I think what I'm concerned about in the next 90 days is like Taiwan being invaded
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:50.820]  because if we do get involved in a ground conflict to protect our interests in Israel
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.620]  and there is a major war between several different nations occurring in the region again,
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.340]  that'd be the perfect time for Taiwan to get seized because you can't fight a war
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:03:59.340]  on two fronts.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:00.340]  You can't fight the enemy on two fronts.
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.220]  It's another rule of war.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:10.480]  So I think we're seeing a total shift in the geopolitical landscape and I would not
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.700]  be surprised if it doesn't measure up to the likes of the end of World War I or the
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:16.700]  end of World War II.
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:19.820]  Regardless of whether it even culminates in a world war, I think we're going to
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:22.380]  see major shifts in how things are going.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:23.380]  Yeah.
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:28.980]  I mean, we already are and again, I got to be honest, I don't know how Israel gets
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:29.980]  out of this.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:30.980]  What's this?
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:43.460]  Folks, the warmongers are on the march.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:44.660]  They're salivating.
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:49.300]  They are desperate to get fully involved in places where up till now we have had just
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.700]  very, very subtle influence.
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:56.220]  I don't know, how many Americans are we willing to die so that Israel can keep their
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.260]  open air prison going?
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.400]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.100]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.980]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.980]  here exposing them.
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:14.460]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:20.100]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.180]  to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:27.860]  This is the great awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and launch the second
[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:28.860]  great Renaissance.
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:33.100]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:36.020]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:24.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:29.380]  I am chase geyser filling in with Harrison Smith for the great Alex Jones covering this
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.180]  historical moment.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:37.380]  We seem to be on the verge of world war three over the conflict occurring right now
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:42.920]  between the Palestinians and Israel, which isn't seemingly actually just between the
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:48.420]  Palestinians and Israel, but certainly rooted.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:53.220]  Iran leader uses X to hail Hamas terror attack that killed 1000 plus people.
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.780]  Alex Jones is still banned.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:56.780]  I had toil.
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:59.820]  I had Tola Ali common eye.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:04.100]  The Supreme leader of the, of Iran and puppeteer behind Hamas took to X to celebrate
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:08.420]  the terrorist groups assault on Israel that resulted in 1000 dead.
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:14.060]  Meanwhile, info wars founder Alex Jones is still banned from the platform quote.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.500]  The Zionist regime is dying.
[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:16.500]  Hashtag Palestine.
[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.820]  He even used a hashtag.
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:23.180]  And the leader on his official X account wrote last Wednesday, two days before the
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:26.420]  Hamas surprise invasion of Israel.
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:27.420]  So you can call for genocide.
[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:31.180]  You can call for the attack and the death of innocent people.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:38.180]  And that's no problem on X formerly Twitter, but Alex Jones is too much of a hate speaker
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:39.180]  for the platform.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:40.180]  Yeah.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:42.820]  Well, he bullied a CNN journalist, so he has to go.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:48.440]  Meanwhile, Israel launches the biggest ever deployment with 300 K called up tanks gathering
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:53.320]  and jets smashing bases for Gaza invasion.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:54.860]  It looks like this is going to be full scale.
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:59.640]  So do you think that Hezbollah is bluffing and they just said that as a deterrent or
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:00.960]  is going to, it's going to happen?
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:02.440]  I think, I think it's going to happen.
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:06.000]  I mean, the, the statement that we read there at the very end of the crew pulled
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.920]  up is like almost a worst case scenario for me.
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:15.240]  I mean, again, what it says, Israel warns the U S will join if Hezbollah joins says
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:19.000]  IDF will destroy Damascus target Syrian president Assad.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.480]  If Hezbollah joins war, U S warships will support Israel in war.
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.920]  So they're saying that it will be tonight or within the next 24 to 48 hours that they
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.480]  will be launching a ground invasion into Gaza Hezbollah has said, that's a red line.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.840]  Lindsey Graham has said that if Hezbollah gets, gets into it, then so will America.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:40.360]  But again, the, the, I mean, none of this makes any sense.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:46.480]  Our bases in the middle East will be targeted like they've never been before.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.720]  It will be hundreds of American servicemen dead.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:54.800]  And you have to ask why and for what is that going to prevent another Gaza incursion
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.800]  into Israel?
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.800]  I don't, I don't think so.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.960]  If even if it did, would that be worth it for America to sacrifice God knows how
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.500]  many soldiers and, and open up to a, to a wider war people behind, you know, here
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.980]  in our country that have crossed over illegally, that may be, you know,
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:14.820]  operatives waiting for a signal to, to launch their own attacks.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.300]  I mean, what are we fighting for here?
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:19.300]  What is the, is it, is it revenge?
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.300]  Is it vengeance?
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.300]  Is it to teach the Palestinians a lesson?
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:27.220]  Like, I, I don't get what we're, what, what we would be fighting for here.
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.460]  We are not at risk from this conflict.
[02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:30.780]  We are not yet right.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:33.500]  We will be if, if we get into this war.
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:36.060]  It's just, are we really about to start another one of these?
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:41.540]  And, you know, so the IDF says they'll destroy Damascus and target President Assad.
[02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:44.260]  I mean, they're already bombing Damascus on, on a weekly basis.
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:46.420]  So, I mean, that's not particularly new.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:51.100]  I guess they can up it even more, but this is just another, like, okay.
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:54.300]  So if they invade Gaza, Hezbollah attacks them.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:55.780]  So then they attack Damascus.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:58.300]  So then America is getting into, I mean, like world war one.
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:09:59.300]  That's how it started.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.740]  One thing led to another, and then everybody was at war, right?
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:13.860]  So if you could go back in time and talk to the leaders of, you know, before world war one and show them the millions of people dead, the totally pointless conflict, the horror upon horror that, that brought, brought that about.
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:15.940]  Would they think that was worth it?
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:21.620]  Would they think that this was a good thing, that they, they did that and it was right and good and they upheld the honor of their country?
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:23.460]  Or would they say nothing is worth this?
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:27.780]  Why don't we just come to a negotiated agreement?
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:37.300]  I mean, I see nothing but murder, chaos, madness, destruction, and a total reorganization of the world's economies in lines of the great reset.
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:41.340]  Hamas official says open to discussions over truth with Israel.
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:44.420]  Statement has come through back channels verified by many sources.
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:48.300]  They say they're open to discussions with Israel regarding the pacification.
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:50.740]  Again, we have the story from December of 2021.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:53.820]  Trump says Netanyahu never wanted peace with the Palestinians.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:11:00.020]  The Palestinians, apparently, I mean, according to the people involved, they're asking for, they're asking for peace talks.
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:00.460]  Yeah.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.580]  But two days ago, they were slaughtering a bunch of innocent people.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:06.540]  Well, that's, that's how it works, right?
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:08.140]  You, what do you think was going to happen?
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:13.980]  Well, they have a bunch of, they have a bunch of, you know, hostages right now that are a bargaining chip that they can use.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:16.620]  I mean, they, like I said, they don't want the status.
[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:17.940]  They don't want to go back to the status quo.
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:19.660]  They don't want this to be a flash in the pan.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:26.580]  And then they just returned to their previous arrangement because the previous arrangement is intolerable, intolerable to the people who are subjected to it.
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:34.500]  So, I mean, unless, unless we're willing to fight for the right of Israel to, you know, keep Gaza as an open air prison.
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:47.700]  Like, I don't, I don't know what else we'd be fighting for, unless you think that any form of peace whatsoever is therefore tantamount to like killing all the Jews in Israel, which is how I see a lot of the rhetoric going, which is why it's so frustrating.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:55.180]  It's literally, if you're just like, hey, you know, the Palestinians have sort of been, been hurting a lot over the last little while.
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:12:00.380]  The response you get is like, so all the Israelis should die, all the Jews in the world should die.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:12.140]  And it's like, is this, is this a healthy adult way to discuss a geopolitical situation or is this hysteria on both sides leading towards an inevitable genocide on one side or the other?
[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:18.420]  Are we really not capable of finding a way that avoids total death of one group or another?
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:21.100]  Is, is that really beyond our capabilities at this point?
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:30.340]  Well, we were talking the other day about how our culture is so consumed with the idea or psychologically installed with the idea that everything is good versus evil.
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:38.140]  It's like Hollywood, Christianity, it's very Western to think in terms of things as good versus evil or good versus bad.
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:42.100]  It even goes all the way back to Plato's Republic with the concept of eudaimonia, the good life.
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.620]  What is a good life? What is a bad life?
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:47.460]  But oftentimes it's just bad versus bad.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:51.500]  Yeah, there is no, there is no winner on this.
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:13:01.140]  And again, I, I see so many people online saying the most vicious, I mean, literally just being like, when I wake up in the morning, Gaza better be a pile of rubble.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:02.300]  And it's like, what is wrong?
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.860]  Like, why would you want that for me?
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.420]  I get like, yeah, they attacked your people.
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:10.660]  It's, that's bad, but how did you get in this situation in the first place?
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:16.140]  And is this not just a continuation of the policy that has led to this horrific outcome?
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:21.060]  Can we not intervene to stop this, this outbreak?
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.540]  I mean, that's the craziest part.
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:40.500]  We are currently right now, as we're talking in the few hours of all of you and of the thousands of years of human history, the next few hours will determine whether a monumental World War One level catastrophe that destroys the world as we know it will occur or whether we can find a way around it.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:43.500]  I mean, that really is the water filter and some life select.
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:46.820]  So now is the time to get that seriously.
[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:47.580]  Absolutely.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:50.420]  And I feel peace of mind that I have it.
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:56.380]  Infowars, store.com, life select, I have three months worth stored at my house in case of emergencies.
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:58.940]  Now would be a time better than ever, I think, to get stuff like that.
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:00.260]  Completely insane.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:06.100]  And every new update brings us seemingly closer to that inevitability.
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:09.860]  Again, we are, we killed armed militants from Lebanon earlier today.
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:13.180]  So I mean, and that's one of the things about the troop movements in Israel.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:17.260]  They're moving a lot of troops to the south in preparation for a ground invasion in Gaza.
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:24.700]  But even more troops are moving to the north because they expect the Hezbollah offensive to begin at some point.
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:31.580]  And look, Gaza compared to Hezbollah, Hezbollah, it has they have all the weapons talking about pacification.
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:36.060]  If Hezbollah is about ready to come in and mow down, it's that was very confusing to me.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.660]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:42.540]  I think they they I honestly, I don't see how Israel.
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:44.300]  Gets out of this.
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:45.020]  I don't know.
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:54.940]  I don't know how Israel succeeds in this without America being full force involved and like actually destroying Iran and Syria.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:59.380]  And I mean, it's I don't know what Israel's play is here.
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:01.340]  They really are between a rock and a hard place.
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:03.660]  And, you know, maybe just.
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:09.180]  Maybe just not pushing it further is the best way to go.
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:13.460]  I think I think Iran's already a nuclear power, too, which is a concern.
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:14.860]  I know that that's not the public.
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:20.260]  Well, but oh, man, and nukes, that's that's a whole nother issue.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:23.740]  My God, I mean, hopefully we've brought some clarity to this situation.
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:29.580]  We're actually going to oh, my God, it's now there's more for Hezbollah members killed is only a few minutes ago.
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:34.020]  A number of launches from Lebanon territory towards Israel territory were detected.
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:37.500]  Folks, that's going to be it for Chase and I.
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:40.300]  Chase will actually be hosting American Journal tomorrow.
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:43.220]  I'll be hosting War Room because we are having to do this musical chairs.
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:47.820]  Everybody hosting everybody else's show because they're sending some of us to prison.

[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:07.580]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:10.580]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:20.420]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.

[02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:25.370]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:31.690]  In this example, it's much darker because, you know, your parent wants the best for you.
[02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:36.470]  The parent is hoping when you're a teenager, you live to your 20s.
[02:20:36.470 --> 02:20:39.990]  You don't do something stupid that wrecks your life.
[02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:47.590]  Well, these globalists who are creating this financial instability for people, they don't
[02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:50.950]  have your best interests at heart.
[02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:57.550]  They want their power and, you know, the parent wants you to survive.
[02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:59.270]  These globalists just want their control.
[02:20:59.270 --> 02:21:00.270]  Well, that's right.
[02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:01.910]  People say all the time that globalists don't care about us.
[02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:03.110]  No, they do.
[02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:11.070]  They want to sabotage and hurt people to make us more controllable, to phase us out of their
[02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:12.070]  own words.
[02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:13.070]  All right.
[02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:19.830]  It's one twenty four central time, emergency Saturday, October 7th transmission.
[02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:24.430]  Kent Hackenlively is an amazing author and researcher and helped me do the book, The
[02:21:24.430 --> 02:21:29.590]  Great Reset, and now the new book, The Great Awakening, defeating the globalist and launching
[02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:31.950]  the next great renaissance.
[02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:32.950]  It's on preorder.
[02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:33.950]  It's in our warehouse.
[02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:34.950]  It starts shipping on the 20th.
[02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:39.470]  You can order it at Amazon.com to send us number one or get signed copies as a fundraiser
[02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:41.030]  to keep us on air at M4.com.
[02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:43.030]  And we need your support.
[02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:45.430]  We have unsigned copies there as well.
[02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:46.830]  All right, Kent.
[02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:47.830]  Wow.
[02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:48.830]  What a day to get you on.
[02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:53.070]  You were supposed to be on an hour ago, but I had to get more crew in here to do research
[02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:54.070]  and prepare for this.
[02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:59.230]  I was going to tape a show that we were going to air with you on Monday.
[02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:06.110]  But wow, this is all going on and unfolding the situation in Israel with Hamas, with
[02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:09.990]  obviously Hezbollah's Iranian backing going on.
[02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:13.510]  You were there earlier live listening to me the last 15 minutes when I was giving
[02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:14.510]  my perspective.
[02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:18.910]  Before we dive into the book and we cover some of this in the book, what is your historical
[02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:21.630]  view of the situation?
[02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:27.210]  You know, it's very much in tune with what you say, Alex, which is people in countries
[02:22:27.210 --> 02:22:32.250]  want to just go and live their lives in peace and prosperity.
[02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:40.330]  And these crazy rulers of ours keep provoking these conflicts in which the regular people
[02:22:40.330 --> 02:22:41.330]  suffer.
[02:22:41.330 --> 02:22:42.330]  Yeah.
[02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:45.090]  So the Palestinians are suffering, the Israelis are suffering.
[02:22:45.090 --> 02:22:49.090]  And it seems like soon the Iranian people are going to be suffering if I read the tea
[02:22:49.090 --> 02:22:51.210]  leaves correctly.
[02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:54.530]  And you know, this gets into a wider conflict with Iran.
[02:22:54.530 --> 02:23:02.010]  So I'm just so happy to be a part of your mission of getting this message out to the
[02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:05.330]  public, which is a true populist message.
[02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:07.970]  Let's take the power away from the elites.
[02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:13.770]  Let's put it back into the hands of the people, because we the people can live peaceably
[02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:18.230]  with each other and figure out how to create a better world.
[02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:23.210]  We just need to get rid of these people, these elitists, these globalists who believe
[02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:27.850]  that they can control us and force us to fight with each other.
[02:23:27.850 --> 02:23:34.050]  And you know, in these times, which I know people are scared.
[02:23:34.050 --> 02:23:39.970]  What I would say to the InfoWars audiences is ask yourself, what's the bravest thing
[02:23:39.970 --> 02:23:41.370]  you can do today?
[02:23:41.370 --> 02:23:44.090]  What is the most constructive thing you can do?
[02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:50.530]  I think it's to get your new book, The Great Awakening, our new book, The Great Awakening.
[02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:59.210]  Read it and understand it, because these globalists can only exist when we are unaware
[02:23:59.210 --> 02:24:00.770]  of what they do.
[02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:05.650]  If we are able to understand their plans, and that's why it was so great to work with
[02:24:05.650 --> 02:24:06.650]  you on this.
[02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:09.850]  Because, you know, even though I've read a number of books, as you can see behind
[02:24:09.850 --> 02:24:14.490]  me about various aspects of corruption, I didn't understand all of the things.
[02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:19.170]  I mean, it was such an education working with you getting your perspective on things.
[02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:22.650]  You know, we've got over 400 references in the book.
[02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:29.350]  So this book is really a deep dive for maybe people who like to, you know, read more than
[02:24:29.350 --> 02:24:33.270]  maybe watch the videos or they want to go deeper on it.
[02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:40.430]  So I just, I feel like in these times in which people are so scared, you know, connect
[02:24:40.430 --> 02:24:49.850]  to God, connect to the sacred source and say, all right, what can I do calmly with a
[02:24:49.850 --> 02:24:55.710]  rational mind in order to be helpful to the world rather than just to be panicked?
[02:24:55.710 --> 02:25:00.510]  And by the way, you wrote Ending Plague and some of Mika Vince's books with her.
[02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:05.370]  That was really the blueprint early on in the plandemic that Mickey Willis and others
[02:25:05.370 --> 02:25:07.830]  used to just totally break out.
[02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:12.670]  And that also Robert F. Kennedy Jr. used as a research blueprint to then write The Real
[02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:13.670]  Anthony Fauci.
[02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:20.510]  So when you help me write just one chapter on COVID, it's the most concise, boiled
[02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:25.390]  down, most knowledgeable info of its origin, what it really does, what the shot does
[02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:26.790]  you're going to find.
[02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:30.690]  And we probably had, let's not exaggerate.
[02:25:30.690 --> 02:25:31.690]  What do you think?
[02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:34.350]  Probably 60 interviews over the phone.
[02:25:34.350 --> 02:25:40.770]  We probably did seven, eight, nine, 10 sessions in person, sometimes for five, six hours at
[02:25:40.770 --> 02:25:44.830]  a time at my home or in my office when you came here to Austin.
[02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:49.210]  And so this wasn't just a bunch of recordings of me and me sending you links like The
[02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:50.410]  Great Reset and War of the World.
[02:25:50.410 --> 02:25:52.170]  It's an excellent primer.
[02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:57.090]  This book is a couple hundred pages thicker and a super fast read and covers the waterfront.
[02:25:57.090 --> 02:26:01.770]  I mean, sure, when I approved the manuscript and it was done three weeks ago and went
[02:26:01.770 --> 02:26:02.770]  to print immediately.
[02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:03.770]  Now it's in our warehouse.
[02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:08.670]  How about a quick turnaround with the great folks at Skyhorse, the First Amendment juggernaut.
[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:12.870]  I thought it was a great book, but once I got it in last week and started signing
[02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:17.150]  copies of it and getting it ready to ship out and I reread it over the last five days,
[02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:19.430]  I am really proud of this book.
[02:26:19.430 --> 02:26:22.890]  So great job, Kent, helping me vet all my research.
[02:26:22.890 --> 02:26:26.550]  And so I just saw the top of my head, said four times the work on this book than the
[02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:28.550]  last one.
[02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:31.750]  Contradict me if it's twice, five times what you really think.
[02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:36.670]  And then I made a lot of crazy claims to you and you said 99 percent of you could actually
[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:41.370]  find were actually accurate than the few times I had just kind of twisted something or flipped
[02:26:41.370 --> 02:26:42.370]  it and got it backwards.
[02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:45.050]  Then we were able to find out what I was actually saying.
[02:26:45.050 --> 02:26:46.450]  What was the process like of the book?
[02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:48.450]  Let's talk about what's in it.
[02:26:48.450 --> 02:26:54.390]  Yeah, so what was great, and I really want your audience to know this, I never found
[02:26:54.390 --> 02:27:00.090]  you telling me a single thing that I couldn't find a source that kind of went along with
[02:27:00.090 --> 02:27:01.090]  that.
[02:27:01.430 --> 02:27:06.950]  Yeah, the only three to four percent of the time there was something that I didn't trust
[02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:10.750]  about the source, but I was really clear that you had heard it.
[02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:17.250]  And when people ask me, what's it like writing for Alex Jones, I say, the man has
[02:27:17.250 --> 02:27:26.070]  an incredible memory, recall, I'll say something like, well, gee, really get me this David
[02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:32.330]  Rockefeller China relationship and you'll go, well, can you go to the New York Times
[02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:35.870]  1973, you know, January.
[02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:41.290]  And suddenly I type it in and I find, you know, David Rockefeller talking about what
[02:27:41.290 --> 02:27:45.890]  a wonderful place China is, even though they just went through the Cultural Revolution where
[02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.650]  they killed millions.
[02:27:47.650 --> 02:27:53.970]  And so it was really what was well, he endorsed me, endorsed Mao Zedong and said, we need
[02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.990]  to be like this.
[02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.990]  Yeah.
[02:27:55.990 --> 02:28:03.670]  Yeah, and so every time you would tell me something that I'd go, hey, I wonder if that's
[02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:05.430]  a little bit too far.
[02:28:05.430 --> 02:28:09.350]  Like the one on Nygaard and them having women have babies so they could drain their
[02:28:09.350 --> 02:28:12.270]  juices and inject them in themselves.
[02:28:12.270 --> 02:28:19.530]  Yeah, and so every time you would tell me something, you know, I would just think
[02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:22.730]  to myself a little bit, OK, maybe that's a little bit on the edge.
[02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:25.550]  Maybe that's a different interpretation than I would make.
[02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:31.630]  But I would go to the source and I'd go, no, I think Alan is Alex is 100 percent rock
[02:28:31.630 --> 02:28:32.630]  solid on it.
[02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:37.070]  And so, you know, when I was able to do because I'm trained as a lawyer, so I want
[02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:41.350]  to go back first and then then I'll go into analysis.
[02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:44.850]  And I know in media kind of you want to get people's attention.
[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:46.610]  So you may do it a little bit differently.
[02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:51.430]  So for those who are more sort of like, well, give me the facts first and then give
[02:28:51.430 --> 02:28:52.430]  me the analysis.
[02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:54.890]  They may enjoy this a little bit more.
[02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:58.210]  But, you know, I.
[02:28:58.210 --> 02:29:02.730]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:29:02.730 --> 02:29:05.970]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for
[02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:07.890]  sex slavery worldwide?
[02:29:07.890 --> 02:29:10.770]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War three with Russia?
[02:29:10.770 --> 02:29:12.370]  Well, I know where you are.

[02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:04.470]  five G or the GMO crops.
[02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:09.630]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies industry
[02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:10.870]  to use.
[02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:14.210]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:17.870]  The allowable level, the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply

[02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:20.520]  I'm never going to build a media empire like you are.
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:21.520]  Oh, nothing about me.
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:26.320]  The point is a great collaboration, one of many to come, because you just basically fact
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:27.840]  checked and organized the last book.
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:35.000]  This one, what would you say, did this book four times the work or that's just a guesstimation?
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.680]  I would say easily four times the work.
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:44.640]  Well, what do you think, five times?
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.280]  It's difficult to say because the first book was a thing.
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:49.280]  Well, we wrote a lot of chapters.
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:50.280]  We decided to scrap.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:55.080]  We did a lot of ... I'm really proud of this book.
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:01.800]  Yeah, and so I think the depth of the research and how much I went into things, I'd say four
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:07.400]  to five times the work, it's about two and a half times the length, but I think it's just
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:13.480]  so much more detailed and I really wanted to hit things so that people would understand
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:15.680]  the military industrial state.
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:22.120]  How has the deep state over 60 or 70 years gone from something that we may have said,
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:28.240]  gee, this sounds like a good idea at the beginning of the Cold War, but as Reagan warned,
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:32.560]  once you build something in government, it becomes eternal.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:40.160]  And so we have this government surveillance military industrial state and it's just gone
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:41.160]  crazy.
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:43.680]  Let me address that.
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:47.880]  Last week, Homeland Security officially said, we're looking at all Trump supporters as potential
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:50.000]  terrorists and we think that's dangerous.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.280]  We've been ordered to do it, literally targeting a giant political movement.
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.680]  We talk about how they set up the police state for Russia in the Cold War, then it
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.800]  was for radical Islam under 9-11 and now it's completely swung around against us.
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:03.520]  That's a major chapter of the book.
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:07.240]  Let's talk about what's in these chapters because, folks, when I tell you I'm proud
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:09.240]  of this book, this is an incredible book.
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:11.320]  Plus it keeps us on air with your support.
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:16.840]  So do you want to walk through the chapters with people maybe?
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:22.720]  You've got all the copies of the book and I don't have them yet, so pull out a
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.640]  chapter you like to talk about.
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.440]  Well first off, Bannon did an incredible intro.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:29.640]  His intro is powerful.
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:34.880]  Chapter one, the threat of artificial intelligence, this really in just one chapter gives you
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:40.120]  the boil down of what AI is and where it's going.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:45.580]  And you know, the AI chapter is really interesting for me because to get that perspective
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:52.920]  that Elon Musk and who was it who was saying like, you know, calling people species
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.920]  this?
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:55.220]  Was it Tim Cook?
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:36:03.860]  It was Larry Page to Elon.
[02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:09.660]  And just to find, you know, it's so crazy to have people like Larry Page getting into
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:17.620]  an argument with Elon Musk calling, you know, silicon-based life is equal to our
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:19.180]  life and you're a speciesist.
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:22.180]  And this is 12 years ago.
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:26.460]  Yeah, and it's abundantly documented.
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:29.460]  It's not just coming from the mind of Alex Jones, it's coming from books that are
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:34.460]  published articles that are out there and you say to yourself, who are these crazy
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:35.460]  people?
[02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:36.460]  And I interrupted you.
[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:38.500]  I interrupted you because we collaborated so much.
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.160]  It's firing all my synapses.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.780]  Start over with a species is his and what we say in the chapter and what it's mainly
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:44.780]  their own statements.
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.660]  I mean, this is big saying screw carbon based life form.
[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:50.860]  I mean, imagine if Hitler said, I want to get rid of all carbon based life form.
[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:51.860]  Screw it.
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:53.540]  That's where he says that's all over.
[02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:54.540]  That's beyond Hitler.
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:55.540]  But it's like, oh, they're liberals.
[02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:56.540]  It's OK.
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:00.300]  They're declaring the end of all like parrots and kitty cats and dogs and blue
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:01.300]  whales.
[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:03.300]  I mean, this is bigger than just anti-human.
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:09.180]  Yeah, you know, you talked about the word speciesist and you and you encouraged me to
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:14.700]  go into a deep dive onto the creation of this word speciesist and you know, I find it comes
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:20.880]  from PETA and, you know, then the academics who are doing it have questionable connections
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:27.080]  to the intelligence agencies and you just find yourself going like, why do I am I always
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:28.080]  getting this idea?
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:32.680]  Oh, you know, and you know, one of the things that was just so amazing and, you know,
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:38.480]  we had profiled Yuval Noah Harari in that previous book and we go into him again
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:43.520]  at the beginning and he talks about this creation of this global useless class.
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:50.360]  Well, when people like me and you who've read history read, you know, somebody using
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.040]  language like that, you know, all of the bells and whistles go off.
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:56.520]  This is early Nazi thought.
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:02.360]  And there's actually a German expression that the Nazis used, which was life, life
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:04.440]  unworthy of life.
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:09.200]  And that's how they said, you know, OK, we can kill these groups, you know, starting
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.060]  first with disabled children, then going after their political enemies and then going
[02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:18.760]  after the Jews and gypsies and homosexuals and, you know, all this other sort of stuff.
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:27.040]  And so when we hear language like a global useless class and other people take it as useless
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.040]  eaters.
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:32.880]  Well, what the heck do you do with global with useless eaters?
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:34.320]  You know, they're useless.
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:39.200]  So you're removing them from humanity that we care about.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:40.200]  You've already dehumanized them.
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:41.640]  You've already said they're garbage.
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:45.400]  Yeah, yeah, and you're setting them up in the ghetto.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.760]  And you know, one of the things that just has really bugged me over the past couple
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:52.820]  days is what Hillary Clinton said.
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:39:00.760]  And I think that this gets to the difference between us and them knowing I hate to use
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:03.580]  that expression, the difference between us and them.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:07.320]  But it's really accurate in this case.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:13.200]  What she said of MAGA extremists, OK, that's how she puts it.
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:19.040]  She said maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of cult members.
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:22.080]  I find that absolutely chilling.
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.640]  That separates the MAGA people from the rest of American society.
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:35.000]  And here's what I say to liberals for those liberals who are terrified of Alex Jones.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:45.800]  We will never submit you to formal deprogramming, but we will write books with hundreds of
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:48.960]  references for you to check.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:57.080]  And we kindly suggest that you read this book so that we could have an informed discussion
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:59.040]  on it.
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:02.800]  Remove the hysteria from the conversation.
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:04.360]  That's what this book is about.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.660]  This is about removing the hysteria.
[02:40:07.660 --> 02:40:09.120]  You can read it.
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:11.940]  We quoted extensively.
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:13.920]  And then let's have a conversation.
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:16.600]  That's what Americans are supposed to do.
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:19.320]  That is Western civilization.
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:30.560]  This move to cut down on debate and discussion between people of goodwill is anti-human, anti-Western.
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:34.720]  It's actually anti-life, for God's sakes.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.860]  They don't even like carbon-based life forms.
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:40.640]  They want us all to be silicon-based.
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:44.120]  And the beautiful part is, whether it's Elon Musk or Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan,
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:46.380]  they suddenly get this.
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:50.880]  And they just change their perspective to see that it's anti-life, anti-carbon.
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.960]  And once you do that, it really does feel alien.
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:57.820]  I'm not saying aliens run this, but what is Harari?
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:40:59.000]  What does Klaus Schwab?
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.200]  What does all these top globalists say?
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:12.680]  They say, I don't believe in God yet, but we're going to be God.
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:18.500]  And that's what was really interesting about working with you on The Great Reset was
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:24.760]  I got to read all these books, and with my background as a writer, I'm always aware
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:29.840]  that at some point, the writer has to show his hand.
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:34.840]  The writer has to tell you, here's what I believe, here's what I'm trying to convince
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:35.840]  you of.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:41.280]  And it took me two and a half books of reading novel Harari in order to find what
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:42.320]  he wanted.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:49.840]  And he talked about, isn't it going to be great when we can combine with humans and
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.160]  we can be sexless, non-breeding cyborgs who can live forever.
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:03.120]  And you know, I don't know about you, but sure, I'd love eternal life, but no sex
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:04.560]  for eternity?
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.040]  This is hell.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.760]  Don't let me have that.
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:13.560]  And so, you know, what I find is these people, you just have to listen to the bad
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:15.800]  guys because they'll give it away.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:24.240]  And I think that that's what I really come away appreciating about you is all your broadcasts
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:32.280]  are informed by an extensive amount of reading of these documents that these evil globalists
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:33.560]  have put out.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:40.960]  And so, you know, I really encourage people, take a look at what Alex is saying because
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:43.600]  it's based on his own deep research.
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.840]  And that's why really it was so great to work with you because I can always trust
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.440]  that I would find what you told me to go looking for.
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:55.560]  And that's just chapter one.
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:00.280]  It just goes on and on.
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:03.680]  Last year, we put this book out, The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:06.120]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:09.880]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:15.200]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:17.160]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:22.200]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them and then gives
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:26.240]  an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:27.400]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:29.680]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:35.200]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at info war store.com.
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.200]  This is a historic book.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:38.720]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:42.560]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast,
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.160]  but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.

[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:55.720]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:56.840]  It's a powerful book.
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:57.840]  Get yours now.
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.960]  I talk a lot about the great successes that Info Wars has had.
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:03.960]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.480]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.640]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:17.120]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:20.480]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.880]  in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:29.560]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:34.120]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:35.360]  support us.
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  I know you spread the word.
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:37.440]  I know you pray for us.
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:38.440]  That's wonderful.
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:39.440]  Keep doing it.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:43.480]  But most viewers and listeners never go to info war store.com and you never buy great
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.280]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time.
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:47.280]  Give me some air.
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:50.360]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products in info
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.360]  war store.com.
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:55.560]  If just one percent more of you took action and went to info war store.com, our funding
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:56.760]  problems will be over.

[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:20.460]  Because I could always trust that I would find what you told me to go looking for.
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:28.300]  And that's just chapter one. It just goes on and on and on. And you want a boil down
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:32.160]  folks that's cutting edge. Because unfortunately most people talking about AI aren't reading
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.820]  what the globalists say it is. They're just telling you it's a fun thing, oh it's going
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:38.660]  to get rid of you, but why do they want to get rid of us?
[02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:42.500]  Chapter two, Mao is in charge of the Democratic Party and political violence is bad except
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:47.780]  when it's directed at patriots, conservatives and Christians.
[02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:53.900]  That was great because you told me that I should look at one of Mao's speeches that
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:59.220]  he gave during the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. And if you read it, it's almost
[02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:03.700]  like a blueprint of what's happening in America today. The Cultural Revolution was
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:11.460]  not put forward by the older generation. What they did was they turned middle school students,
[02:48:11.460 --> 02:48:15.700]  high school students and college students against their parents and they let them be
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:24.560]  as vicious as possible. And so what Mao talked about is you need to break the relationships
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:29.460]  that people have with each other. So you need to break the family relationships. You
[02:48:29.460 --> 02:48:39.380]  also had the weird, you know, getting rid of gender in Mao's China. So, you know, men
[02:48:39.380 --> 02:48:44.700]  and women would dress exactly the same. Well, romantic love is one of the most powerful
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:51.900]  forces in the universe. Just like family love, love of God is a powerful force. So
[02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:59.400]  when you go to that 35,000 foot view and you go, wait a minute, why are all the forces
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:05.840]  in the modern Democratic Party interested in separating parents from their children?
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:11.680]  Because they're supposed to trust their teachers more than their parents. No, no,
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:16.680]  no, I'm sorry. That's not the way human society goes. They want to separate us from
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:24.680]  each other because they want people not to talk to their friends who may have slightly
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:29.280]  different opinions, who may be more conservative. That's really what's going on because you see
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:34.520]  nobody on the conservative side saying don't talk to a liberal. You know, it's like, oh,
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:39.560]  talk to liberals and, you know, show them how much we have in common, how we're the
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:46.160]  elite are, you know, gaming the system to make us hate each other and, you know, breaking
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:51.640]  the relationship with God. And, you know, which I would say and I think we're in agreement
[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:57.760]  on this that, you know, it's like God first family, you know, and, you know, each
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:07.760]  other. It's God, family, country. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, it's kind of
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.800]  funny because you're supposed to be so radical. But as I put this together, I say this is
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:19.640]  so frickin traditional. You know, this is like an Eisenhower Republican, you know,
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:24.000]  book on on what we should have and what we should, you know, or founding fathers
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:30.600]  document like let's put a good society together that has a better chance of being,
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:37.280]  you know, more just than any other society in human history. And, you know, we're looked at,
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:43.160]  you know, Hillary Clinton is saying we need to be deprogrammed in some formal system. Well,
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:49.800]  screw you. And now we've only gotten to the second chapter. We're taping this on Saturday
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:54.680]  with this giant war that's erupted in Israel. But but this is, like you said, the million
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:59.840]  foot view the thirty five thousand view to understand what's going on. So let's go to
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:05.400]  chapter three. You are being modified against your will. And then we talk about and to
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:11.920]  what end that the modification, the transhumanism is happening now. And we're only up to page
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:21.400]  50 at this point. One of the things that I enjoyed learning most about was the mouse
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:28.680]  utopia experiments from the 1960s in which they decided to create this utopia for mice,
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:33.680]  you know, free from predators, free from population density, population,
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:42.000]  private food pressures. And what happened is it led to the collapse of the mouse colony.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:47.040]  So so what would happen and it was really interesting because you see in the mouse
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:53.080]  utopia experiments, a model of what's happening in our cities today. So what
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:52:00.640]  they found is that if you give the mice unlimited food, and you crowd them together,
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:08.920]  a whole lot of different behaviors start to evolve. So the mouse societies will usually
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:15.600]  have an alpha male who's got a breeding harem. Okay, well, usually in the wild,
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:21.640]  what happens is the alpha male defends himself from challengers, challengers lose, they go off,
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:26.680]  they may create their own colonies, that's what happens. Okay, so the alpha male has dominance,
[02:52:27.680 --> 02:52:36.240]  the females can have their children, care for their children, the mouse colony survives. Well,
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:44.440]  what happens is, there's too much fighting because the males who lose can't leave. Okay,
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:51.400]  so they keep attacking the males, they keep bothering the females, the females can't raise
[02:52:51.440 --> 02:52:58.800]  their children, they often kill their children. Then what also happens is some mice decide to
[02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:03.280]  drop out of society, they just don't participate anymore, even though-
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:09.960]  And so that's the explosion of homeless. Yeah, it's the explosion of homeless. You've
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:15.480]  also got these mice that they call the beautiful ones who will spend all day
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:23.120]  preening themselves and have no interest in sex. And so, I think of like Instagram and
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:27.920]  how everybody wants to be beautiful on Instagram and all of these platforms. And you're
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:33.960]  saying like, okay, that's great that you have 100,000 followers. Do you have five people in
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:39.240]  your life that you talk to? Do you lay down in bed next to somebody you love? Do you have
[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:45.920]  children? Are you a contributing member of your society? And when I looked at those
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:52.120]  mouse utopia experiments and compared it, I lived in San Francisco for eight years and
[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:56.880]  loved it when I was in my 20s. I wanted to be a city guy, I wanted to be an urban guy,
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:00.480]  but no way in hell you can get me to live in a city right now.
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:06.400]  Well, let's talk about this. And I'm not saying we're like mice in our spirit,
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:11.780]  but we're the closely associated in test of drugs and psychologically and culturally,
[02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:16.320]  not the chimpanzees and not the great apes like we've always heard. We're the closest
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:23.760]  to mice and pigs, whether it's drugs that test on us or behaviorally or what we do.
[02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:29.320]  And so, they found that humans were already behaving like the mice, but the mice only
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:33.080]  have like a five-year life cycle. We've got a 75-year life cycle. And so,
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:35.360]  what they predicted in the 60s would happen to our culture,
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:38.160]  all of this is now happening exactly as it did with the mice.
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:48.520]  Yeah. And it's just remarkable to see how many of these things are happening in our society.
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:55.560]  And they're happening primarily in democratic run cities. And you find yourself saying like,
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:55:00.640]  okay, I can understand tolerance. No, but it's traditionalism and staying with what
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:04.240]  we're supposed to do is a shield. And when you get rid of traditionalism,
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:13.000]  you're wide open, you collapse. Yeah. And so, I live close to San Francisco
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.440]  and every day on the radio, I hear people talking about San Francisco and they'll say,
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:24.840]  how can anybody think that this is a good situation? I mean, they put together an app,
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:30.160]  which was called the crap map of San Francisco. Avoid human feces on the street.
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:36.520]  Well, what happened is the entire map turned brown and they canceled it. I mean,
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:42.520]  it's just failure after failure. And you know, Brandon, we can all do stupid things
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:47.880]  from time to time, but you have to wonder when you keep having these excessive failures,
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:54.480]  is this all part of a plan? And then people ask, why do you live close to that? Well,
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.480]  your family goes way back. I've talked to you generations there. You've got a winery,
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:06.480]  you've got family land out in the hills. You're from there. It's where your ancestors came.
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:11.600]  People ask, why are you in Austin? My ancestors literally started Waterloo,
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:16.160]  that is Austin. And I do have to leave it, basically. It's become San Francisco or any
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:20.120]  San Francisco, and just in a few years, because they want a post-industrial world.
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:23.440]  It's a formula. They're bringing out civilization, the great reset,
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:27.280]  so they can build back better. And that's also in the book as well. We got to move
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:30.760]  quick here, because this is so important. And I want people to know how great the book is,
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:37.680]  available at infowarsword.com or amazon.com. So we did chapter three. Let's go into chapter
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:43.240]  four. They want you to be a teenager on an allowance, and that's just the beginning.
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:49.920]  The social credit score, the AI take over. Yeah, so that was great, because I've been
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:57.240]  fascinated by the digital banking and digital bank currency. And I always look for
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:03.520]  the plan. Okay, you know, I think that they dangle shiny objects in front of us to get us
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:09.280]  mad. And, you know, the challenge is really to go deeper and say, what's the plan here? And,
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:15.800]  you know, and you got to break it down easy to people in a way that they can understand. And
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.480]  so I think we've all had the experience of being a teenager. And, you know, maybe our
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:24.280]  parents put us on an allowance. And then maybe we thought, hey, you know, I'll get a job.
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:31.080]  And then I'll, you know, have some extra money. And that makes you more mature. And then hopefully
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.880]  you go to college or you go to trade school or you go to work and, and you start earning
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:40.840]  your own money. And with that greater money comes the greater freedom. And you understand
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:46.160]  that actually the founding of our country was because there were wealthy people like George
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:52.440]  Washington. Why do you think the globalist are desperately trying to censor everybody? Why
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:56.280]  are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else? Because they
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:58:00.360]  can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.080]  But we're not just exposing their operation. In my new book,
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:09.840]  we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's,
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:15.720]  You Will Eat the Bugs. This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.560]  launch the second great Renaissance. It's a companion to my last book. It was a number
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.560]  one worldwide bestseller. And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[02:58:51.680 --> 02:58:56.080]  things that we all miss, including myself. Everybody seems very excited about the impeachment
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:59:00.320]  Joe Biden. But remember, he is a total and complete puppet. It needs to be about the
[02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:06.320]  criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations. And he wanted
[02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:10.720]  to blame Obama. Yeah, he's above Biden, but he's still a puppet too. We need to make it
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:15.840]  about the power structure that's waging war against this country and that's deindustrializing us.
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:21.600]  Attacking our culture and creating race war. We need to make the impeachment all about the
[02:59:21.600 --> 02:59:26.640]  open borders and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN taking control
[02:59:27.440 --> 02:59:32.160]  of our medical system. That's what we need to do. That's what we've got to stand for.
[02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:36.160]  That's what is going to bring down the system. But if we just make it about Biden,
[02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:40.240]  just about how horrible he is, how he's a pedophile and how his son's a crackhead
[02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:45.360]  and gun charges, it becomes a distraction from the larger issues. We'll cover it all live
[02:59:45.360 --> 02:59:53.920]  at Infowars.com forward slash show. If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:55.440]  you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:10.080]  Our country was because there were wealthy people like George Washington, who put his own
[03:00:10.080 --> 03:00:16.480]  money to funding the Continental Army. And so it's not just money is power, but money is
[03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:23.680]  freedom. And you understand it at a deeper level, why when that when the elites create
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:30.400]  financial insecurity, you know, when what is it like 50 to 60 percent of the people in the world
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:35.600]  can't in the United States can't put together a thousand dollars for an emergency? Well,
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:42.640]  that means you're hanging on by your your fingertips. And so what do people do who are
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:48.000]  hanging on by their fingertips? They don't make waves. And so this is, you know, an argument
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:54.400]  that's being made a lot, which is why does it seem the powerful are interested in creating
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:58.880]  a cycle of dependency on us? Because, you know, when you're a parent and you've got a kid
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:06.080]  on an allowance, well, you got control over them. You can say do what I want, or you don't
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:11.840]  get your allowance. And they're doing the same thing. And, you know, in this example, it's
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:17.600]  much darker. Because, you know, your parent wants the best for you that the parent is hoping
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:24.160]  when you're a teenager, you live to your 20s, you don't do something stupid that wrecks your
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:30.880]  life. Well, these globalists who are creating this financial instability for people,
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:38.800]  they don't have your best interests at heart. They, they want their power. And, you know,
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:44.480]  the parent wants you to survive. These globalists just want their control. Well,
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:47.280]  that's right. People say all the time that globalists don't care about us. No, they do.
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:51.200]  They want to sabotage and hurt people to make us more controllable
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  to phase us out of their own words. And so just like people didn't take Hitler serious,
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:03.040]  Hitler was a amateur compared to Klaus Schwab. And you all know Harari in what they're calling
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:08.000]  for a total end of carbon based life, claiming their gods. Ray Kurzweil said,
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.840]  I don't believe in God yet. Again, this is a declaration of war against humanity.
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:18.000]  And just telling us, hey, it's all over. You know, you're, you're falling, you're bad.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:23.040]  They're offering something a trillion times worse. And I say that from their perspective,
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:27.600]  they project their own hate of themselves. We talk about that in the book onto us. No,
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:31.520]  I think we're amazing. Our heights are incredible. Our lows are horrible, but
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:37.120]  I like the human process. See, we can decide humans are the only animal that builds its
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:39.840]  controls its own environment because we're not an animal. We're made in the image of God.
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:43.520]  We can look what we envisioned a thousand years ago or 200 years ago we've built.
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:47.600]  And so they know that they want us to decide that, oh, you're overpopulated. You're bad.
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:51.360]  Turn off your life forces, roll over to die. No, we're not going to do it, Kent.
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:54.480]  And so that's why the book is so important. I want to challenge viewers and listeners
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:03:00.160]  for the bare minimum. It keeps us on air and it funds the operation. It's historical book.
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:03.760]  It's something you're not supposed to have. It's something the sensors don't want you to have.
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:08.080]  And the other book was great and was the number one bestseller. This ladies and gentlemen
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:11.840]  is light years better than the great reset and the war of the world. It is the great
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:17.120]  awakening. It's not just telling the enemy operations, it's detailing how to defeat them.
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:22.480]  So I have a little four or five minute promo video that I shot last week that kind of breaks
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:28.240]  us down, Kent. And let's race through the other, I think there's 10 or 11 more chapters we haven't
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:33.840]  talked about. And you're only skimming the surface here. I mean, this is deep,
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:38.960]  hardcore research, but it's not giving you a headache like academics. We give our view.
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:43.120]  We show their statement. We show where they set it. We tie it together with the next chapter
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:46.560]  and back to the last chapter. And I thought the book was great.
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:51.760]  Well, when I got them in last week, they came in on Monday, the 18 wheeler of books,
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:58.480]  and I pulled a dozen out using the shipping center. And I took them home and I told my wife,
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:01.760]  you can't bail these out the family till the 20th. And I sat down and I was like,
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:05.680]  I'm just gonna read one chapter, read four that night, even though I was already tired.
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:09.360]  And it went back quick. I was like, I just read like four huge chapters in two hours.
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:12.880]  Then the next night, read another three, four, and then I finished it this morning.
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:16.800]  And I was just like, I'm really proud of this. And I'm proud of the other book.
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:21.920]  It's a great book, but it's kind of sad that I thought that book was great. Now. I don't
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:25.120]  think it's that good. I'm not putting it down, but, but I think be honest with us
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:28.160]  before we go to this club, how do you feel about this book compared to the last?
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:33.520]  You know, what was really funny is I've been working with the same editor
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:40.640]  at sky horse for probably 10 books. And she is the most reserved person I've ever met.
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:44.160]  You know, you, you, you put your blood, sweat, and tears into a book.
[03:04:44.240 --> 03:04:48.720]  You send it to your editor, you know, you get back all the notes and you say,
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:53.040]  you know, you want to know, okay, I see all the comments, but what did you think about it?
[03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:55.520]  And so finally I said, Caroline,
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:02.320]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:06.400]  coffee has not been available. And that's because the prices went up too high for the
[03:05:06.400 --> 03:05:10.640]  raw beans and the quality had gone down. Some, I turned down so many companies that wanted
[03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:17.280]  to work with us, but now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:22.960]  national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated it's powered by the company.
[03:05:22.960 --> 03:05:28.720]  Minute man coffee, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling,
[03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:36.240]  strongest coffee that I have ever drank. It is game changing. All you gotta do is buy a bag of
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:40.480]  it and try it. I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win.

[03:05:56.640 --> 03:06:11.360]  Now crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:19.600]  front lines of the info war. What do you think of this book? You know, you never tell me like
[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:24.640]  what you think. And she wrote me back and she goes, I think this book is going to set the
[03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:30.800]  world on fire. I was just like, Holy crap. You're the most reserved person I know.
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:35.520]  Well, this is live right now, but we're going to take a few clips of things you say and
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:40.000]  put them up front when this airs again on Monday to the full broadcast. So let's put a
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:45.920]  few, let's put that club up front right there because yeah, cause again, I wanted to have
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:50.080]  everything in this book and I, and we got really frustrated and we had to cut some chapters,
[03:06:50.080 --> 03:06:55.120]  add some chapters. We rewrote a lot of stuff. I said to you, I said, Kent months ago, I said,
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:58.960]  too much of this is just recordings of me. And then you just prove what I say and put a,
[03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:03.600]  put a citation on it. I said, I want you cause I'm impressed with the stuff you've had
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:07.040]  a bigger influence on this. This is not like the last book where you were just organizing.
[03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:11.120]  When I said, I said, I want to bring your brain into organize this. So this book,
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:14.560]  that's why I said, I want to put you as a co-author, not a ghost writer because you
[03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:18.000]  are a co-author on this. You, and I think you made the book much more powerful because
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:24.080]  you organized all this chaos I'm looking at and help really distill it down. So congratulations.
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:27.760]  Thank you very much. It was a pleasure to work with you.
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:31.600]  I know it was frustrating to make you throw a hat. I think at one point the book was up
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:37.280]  at like 700 pages long and ensure reading a transcript of what I've said is important
[03:07:37.280 --> 03:07:41.040]  and it has links and it proves it. But what we did together, I mean,
[03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:45.600]  we worked intensely on this. I mean, I think some chapters we probably did like
[03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:51.200]  we probably had like five, six meetings per chapter sometimes.
[03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:57.520]  Yeah. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is the great awakening. Here's a little
[03:07:57.520 --> 03:08:01.440]  breakdown of it. We're going to come back, finish up talking about the book and hit
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:05.680]  some of the other news that's unfolding. And there's some big surprises coming up next week.
[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:09.680]  And you're watching this live on Saturday. We're going to air this for big parts of
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:14.240]  it for an hour on Monday. I won't be in studio and it's not cause I'm on vacation.
[03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:19.520]  When people think I'm on vacation, I'm not on vacation. And my wife and daughter might
[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:24.240]  be when I go on the road and they're off at the museum or the planetarium or the
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:29.600]  aquarium or at the beach or by the beach. I'm not doing that, folks, other maybe an
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:35.040]  hour a day with them. I go behind the scenes doing a lot. It's kind of like Fight Club.
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:38.480]  And I don't want to it's cooler than Fight Club because we're not communist blowing up
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:43.760]  Wall Street, but it's the real Fight Club. And let's just say this. My work off air is
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:47.440]  just as important as the on air work. I've really reached by the grace of God,
[03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:52.480]  more works for serious ways. A point now where and the enemy knows this,
[03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:55.440]  they'll be on our phones, tap and stuff, but the public hasn't quite figured out yet.
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:01.840]  And I don't deserve this, but I now recognize is kind of the Tyler Durgin
[03:09:02.800 --> 03:09:06.480]  behind the scenes with some of the biggest names out there. And a lot of that's going
[03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:11.520]  to start coming out because we're not launching Operation Chaos. We're launching Operation
[03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:15.760]  Renaissance, Operation Great Awakening. And because of all this, I've convinced a lot of
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:20.160]  people that now know I'm right to listen to me about how to challenge this and how to fight
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:24.880]  this. So all glory goes to God spiritually, temporarily to the audience, the crew and
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:31.520]  everybody else. But. If they kill me, I didn't commit suicide, like Matt Gates just said,
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:35.280]  and they blow my airplane up, I didn't do it either because I'm not dumb. We're
[03:09:35.280 --> 03:09:39.280]  hurting them bad right now. All glory goes to God. Here's a quick breakdown. We'll come
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:40.640]  right back with Ken Heckman, why we stay with us.
[03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:16.640]  agenda to what they're doing. So in this book that came out in 2022, there came a number one
[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:22.080]  worldwide bestseller, The Great Reset in the War for the World. We lay out the enemy's
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:26.720]  own statements, their own plans. It is the blueprints to the Death Star.
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:30.880]  And that book is available, signed or unsigned at mfullwarstore.com.
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:38.320]  But now we're talking about the new book, The Great Awakening. The Great Awakening,
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:42.800]  defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:50.240]  And that's what this book does. It is 400 pages long. I would say that 60% of it is
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:55.360]  the latest enemy operations and how they're operating and what makes them tick and how
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:04.480]  to stop them. But then 40% or so is what we can build different ideas, different systems to
[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:10.480]  counter the dystopia that they are setting up. Now we're going to send this to number one.
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:14.160]  You're going to send this to number one. They are so pissed about this book. They're
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:19.280]  already attacking it. But I want to encourage all of you to go to mfullwarstore.com and get
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:25.040]  a signed copy that's a fundraiser to keep us on air and historical memento and also get
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:32.240]  unsigned copies. Give your friends, your family and your neighbors because this book is a major
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:38.320]  piece of history. So let me go over some of what's in the book. We'll go ahead and
[03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:42.960]  go to a overhead shot and I'll show you the back of the book. A Tucker Carlson quote,
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:46.960]  a Bill Maher quote, a Joe Rogan quote, a Stephen K. Manning quote, a Mickey Willis quote.
[03:11:46.960 --> 03:11:51.760]  And these quotes are absolutely dead on. Tucker Carlson says Alex Jones is often mocked for
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:56.880]  his flamboyance. But the truth is he's been far better guy to reality in recent years.
[03:11:57.440 --> 03:12:04.400]  In other words, a far better journalist to say NBC News. Bill Maher, Alex Jones gets to speak.
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:09.600]  Everybody gets to speak. Here's Joe Rogan. Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:16.400]  in the world and he's been right about a lot of SH-T. Stephen K. Bannon, for more than 20 years,
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:21.360]  no populist figure has been more of a bayonet in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:24.400]  Stephen K. Bannon, who also wrote the foreword to the book.
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:29.200]  Mickey Willis, award-winning documentary filmmaker, reaches hundreds of millions.
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:33.600]  Mainstream media is wrong the vast majority of the time, yet they are never held accountable.
[03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:38.400]  Alex Jones is right the vast majority of the time, and yet he is silenced and persecuted.
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:45.600]  The book, ladies and gentlemen, is unbelievable. And it was researched by the great researcher
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:50.080]  Kent Heckin' Lively who double-checked everything I said, who fact-checked it all.
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:58.880]  It has a big document section in the back where we show you everywhere the sources come from.
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:04.880]  You need the great awakening, defeating the globalist and launching the next great renaissance
[03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:09.760]  today with the foreword by Stephen K. Bannon. Let's go to a document cam shot
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:16.720]  and give people a first look at this book. There's the great awakening and it goes into
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:20.320]  the chapters. Foreword by Stephen Bannon, a bayonet to the back of the deep state.
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:23.840]  Chapter one, the threat of artificial intelligence. Chapter two,
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:28.160]  Mao is in charge of the Democratic Party and political violence is bad except when it's
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:32.240]  directed at Alex Jones. Chapter three, you're being modified against your will.
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:39.040]  That's the GMO, genetic engineering. Chapter four, they want you to be a teenager on an allowance
[03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:42.800]  and that's just the beginning, the social credit score, the ESGs.
[03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:47.440]  Chapter five, the eternal war of tyrants. Chapter six, the war machine. Chapter seven,
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:51.360]  the deep state makes its move. Chapter eight, the education of Tucker Carlson,
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:55.280]  Joe Rogan and others. That's the big inside baseball section, very powerful.
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:13:59.200]  Chapter nine, Jeffrey Epstein. We're in the field of the globalist, Dracula,
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:02.960]  but even worse because they prey on their own children. They murder their own children
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:07.040]  and drink their blood. Totally proven, I name names, you cannot make this up.
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:12.480]  Chapter 10, the COVID lies in deception. Chapter 11, selling your soul to Hollywood
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:17.440]  and the CIA. Chapter 12, combat tactics for victory. Chapter 13, the final battle,
[03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:23.840]  conclusion, how you know you're winning and more. The Great Awakening, exclusively available
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:28.960]  at infoawarstore.com. A piece of history, funding the resistance and getting a great
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:33.680]  tool to further empower yourself, inform yourself and wake up friends, family, neighbors.

[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:41.200]  And I thank you for all your support. We are all part of The Great Awakening.
[03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:46.800]  All right, Kent, you've done a great job. I've been jumping in a lot because we're all
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:50.080]  in the same mind here. We wrote this book together, but I want to hit some of the
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:54.720]  other chapters here in conclusion because we're going to shove this into one of the
[03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:59.440]  hours Monday, so it needs a fit. Or maybe we'll go at 1.30 on Monday, get to the
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:04.320]  fourth hour, whatever much time it takes. Air this on Monday, guys, because I'm going
[03:15:04.320 --> 03:15:07.840]  to be on an airplane going somewhere for a big interview on Monday. I'll leave it at that.
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:11.120]  We got a lot of other big developments after that, the week after.
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:15.120]  The planets are politically aligning, so pray for us. The enemy definitely knows we're over
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:19.920]  the target. So Kent, other comments about this book, I mean, we really can't hype this
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:24.480]  book enough. And again, I was proud of it till I read it in the hardcover as the
[03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:30.160]  actual book. Altogether, it's I mean, some of the stuff is like Shakespearean
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:36.000]  that you wrote off of what I said. The way we riff off each other is like jazz.
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:41.120]  I'm very proud of this. Yeah, well, it's kind of funny you mentioned jazz because
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:45.680]  I think of that same thing because you'll say something and you know, you have your
[03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:51.600]  personality and I have a little different personality. But what we both share is a love
[03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:58.640]  for truth. And so I'm figuring out how do I talk with all the craziness in the world,
[03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:04.560]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[03:16:04.560 --> 03:16:08.960]  the economy going crazy. You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality,
[03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:13.760]  durable food and water filtration and self defense. Now we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:16.720]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:20.320]  And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[03:16:20.320 --> 03:16:24.800]  but they don't have enough durable food or water filtration. This is something you need

[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:05.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:21.320]  The way that in a book, that is, you know, engaging to the reader, because books are
[03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:27.359]  something different than just, you know, a broadcast. It's really a mind to mind sort
[03:20:27.359 --> 03:20:33.420]  of thing. So, you know, you have to be working at a very high level, you have to use imagery,
[03:20:33.420 --> 03:20:38.500]  you have to say to yourself, okay, where is the reader getting tired? Where do I need to,
[03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:43.900]  you know, maybe throw a little bit of levity here. Where do I need to back it up and, you
[03:20:43.900 --> 03:20:47.820]  know, make a comparison to something else? Exactly. Because most of my research is reading
[03:20:47.820 --> 03:20:52.859]  raw bills or documents or, and it gives, it makes me upset. This, that was it.
[03:20:52.859 --> 03:20:59.300]  I had fun reading the book. Yeah. And, you know, it's kind of strange to say, okay,
[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:03.699]  we're talking about people who want to destroy the world. And yet, it's also a fun read,
[03:21:03.699 --> 03:21:12.820]  because what you realize is these evil people are really terrible planners for society. It's
[03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:19.220]  not just that their plans are bad, it's that they don't work with human beings. The reason
[03:21:19.220 --> 03:21:26.340]  they need the secrecy is because their plans suck. It's not good for human beings. And when
[03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:33.539]  you tell human beings about this plan, like, you know, you all know Harari, he thinks that
[03:21:33.539 --> 03:21:40.340]  the global useless class is going to be plugged into computer games and be on drugs. And then,
[03:21:40.340 --> 03:21:46.900]  you know, Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook creates meta, which he's like, oh, everybody's gonna
[03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:52.060]  want to live in the virtual world. Well, you know, I got one of those things, I put it on,
[03:21:52.099 --> 03:21:57.460]  I tried to play the games. And, you know, half an hour, I got a splitting headache. And,
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:02.740]  you know, that thing has been sitting in my closet ever since. And that's why Facebook lost.
[03:22:02.740 --> 03:22:08.779]  But making dinner for your family, or being at a campfire, or praying to God never gets old.
[03:22:08.779 --> 03:22:13.900]  It just gets better. Yeah, you know, every day that my wife and I are both home,
[03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:18.140]  we sit outside and have a little bit of coffee. And, you know, we're just talking about broken
[03:22:18.179 --> 03:22:22.660]  sprinklers, you know, whether our fountains work in, you know, what our kids are doing,
[03:22:22.660 --> 03:22:29.939]  you know, people we know, I mean, to me, that is, you know, better than anything else in the
[03:22:29.939 --> 03:22:34.380]  world. That is the high point of my day. We're designed to do it. It's what we are. We
[03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:40.500]  got to go with what we are. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, we human beings are designed
[03:22:40.500 --> 03:22:46.779]  to interact with about 40 to 60 people from like the small tribes that we lived in for
[03:22:46.779 --> 03:22:52.699]  hundreds of thousands of years. So that's why this internet age is such an age of isolation
[03:22:52.699 --> 03:22:59.460]  for people because we're forgetting that what's important is that contact and connection with
[03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:04.259]  physical people in our lives. And that's what we got to get back to. We got to get
[03:23:04.259 --> 03:23:08.179]  back to our connection with God. And the book, the book breaks all that down. The book
[03:23:08.179 --> 03:23:15.179]  breaks that down. Yeah, we need to reconnect to the source. The source of our joy is our
[03:23:15.179 --> 03:23:19.779]  connection to God and our connection to each other. And that's what the globalists hate.
[03:23:19.779 --> 03:23:24.619]  They want to plug us into machines. We want to plug you into God and we want to plug
[03:23:24.619 --> 03:23:28.340]  you into each other. Listen, I've never been a big drug guy, like alcohol and nicotine,
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:32.939]  that's it. And some caffeine. But with my children, it was always as particularly as I've
[03:23:32.939 --> 03:23:37.820]  gotten older, I'm 50 here in a few months. My six and a half year daughter, she gets up
[03:23:37.820 --> 03:23:42.220]  way earlier than my wife, like 6 a.m. like I do. And I make these fabulous breakfasts.
[03:23:42.220 --> 03:23:47.300]  I mean by fabulous, it's like what you get at a restaurant. And I just love doing it
[03:23:47.300 --> 03:23:53.140]  and like slicing the fruit perfectly and cooking the eggs and bacon or turkey perfectly
[03:23:53.140 --> 03:23:57.580]  and making her hash browns perfectly and putting a heart and ketchup on the hash browns.
[03:23:57.580 --> 03:24:01.580]  And then I just sit there with her and talk to her and read her books. Now she
[03:24:01.580 --> 03:24:07.619]  reads books. She reads books to me and tells me jokes. And it's like I took cocaine
[03:24:07.619 --> 03:24:10.460]  and meth a few times, made me feel horrible and I hated it. So people say it makes
[03:24:10.460 --> 03:24:15.259]  them high. I get high doing that for like an hour every morning. It's the best time of my
[03:24:15.259 --> 03:24:20.500]  life. And I literally get high doing it. Just like I get high at a campout or hunting
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:26.340]  or quite frankly back in the old days, fighting or swimming a couple of miles or doing woodwork
[03:24:26.340 --> 03:24:31.340]  or just we're mint or planting a garden and tending a garden. And it's just we're
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:35.060]  supposed to do this. We're designed to do this. And people need to get back to work.
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:42.660]  And think about this, Alex. For a lot of people, you're the big bad wolf, okay? That's just the
[03:24:42.660 --> 03:24:48.580]  way you're the most persecuted man on the planet. And your greatest joy every day is
[03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:53.420]  when you can be of service to others. When you're of service to your daughter,
[03:24:53.420 --> 03:24:57.019]  when you're of service to your wife, when you're of service to the people that you work with.
[03:24:57.019 --> 03:25:04.380]  I mean, that's the source of joy. And all this other crap out there is just not
[03:25:04.420 --> 03:25:09.019]  important. And so I think that's one of the things that as I get more into this space,
[03:25:09.019 --> 03:25:12.939]  I'm sure I'm going to come up under increasing attack. But hopefully,
[03:25:12.939 --> 03:25:18.220]  I'd like secured my fortress of joy. And they never get to my fortress of joy.
[03:25:18.220 --> 03:25:23.460]  Oh my God, we should write a book together called Fortress of Joy. Just a book about
[03:25:23.460 --> 03:25:28.660]  what empowers humans. Because you're right, none of the attacks mean anything because all
[03:25:28.660 --> 03:25:32.500]  that matters is my family. I love one of my parents once a week for dinner. And it's just,
[03:25:32.500 --> 03:25:36.179]  I realized they won't be here forever, these beautiful people. And just my older children
[03:25:36.179 --> 03:25:40.060]  come over, they're moved out. And we just have like a two hour dinner. We laugh, we make jokes.
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:46.939]  And the French Bulldog jumps around and does tricks. And it's just, it's beautiful. And they
[03:25:46.939 --> 03:25:53.539]  want to take that from people. Yeah, and so, you know, and one of the things, it's kind of
[03:25:53.539 --> 03:25:58.320]  been funny, because as I've gotten higher visibility, I'll go to events. And I'll have young
[03:25:58.359 --> 03:26:02.759]  people come up to me, and they'll find out who I am. And they've read some of my books.
[03:26:02.759 --> 03:26:09.599]  And they'll say things like, I got red-billed three years ago. And you know, now, every day,
[03:26:09.599 --> 03:26:14.480]  when I wake up, I'm reading about the plans of the globalists and this and that and the
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:20.240]  other thing. And you know, I think they want me to be, like, you know, impressed that they
[03:26:20.240 --> 03:26:29.199]  are spending 14 hours a day, the day, you know, on all the crap in the world. And and
[03:26:29.199 --> 03:26:35.720]  you know, I say to them, do that less, okay, you know, three or four hours, okay, that's
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:41.560]  about all I can take of the terrible stuff in the world. And then the rest of my day,
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:48.039]  I'm doing all the things that bring me joy and contentment. And so, so I feel like
[03:26:48.039 --> 03:26:56.519]  those three or four hours that I'm, I'm attacking the dragon, attacking the devil. I am a I am a
[03:26:56.519 --> 03:27:07.000]  fearless warrior during that time. But I have to secure my fortress of joy constantly to make
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:14.160]  sure that I'm a good warrior. Hey, I'm gonna ask listeners don't do this. Hey, Kent. Wes,
[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:17.920]  will you go get in your own name or whatever? Will you get fortress of joy? I'll pay it back
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:24.439]  right now. Dot news or.com. I don't know that's been written yet that we should Google. It's
[03:27:24.439 --> 03:27:31.880]  probably some horrible sex site. Trying to like type in Janice. Yes, I had this sponsor
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:35.720]  on and the crew didn't have it like pulled up something a bully never but the who knows
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:39.960]  what fortress of joy is. But that is a great I've never heard that term. That's what we
[03:27:39.960 --> 03:27:44.400]  need to form as a fortress of joy against their evil. Because it's a saying many have said
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:50.039]  it's known as you said it first. But you don't fight because you hate the people in front of
[03:27:50.039 --> 03:27:54.840]  you. You fight because you love the people behind you. And that's it. Yeah, I am a fortress
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:28:03.279]  of joy. Yeah, and if they can steal our joy, if when we appear in front of the public,
[03:28:03.279 --> 03:28:10.000]  we're scowling we're angry. We're not convincing them to join us. And and that's why
[03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:17.679]  you mentioned that the book was fun to read. Well, I love mocking stupid people. And I love
[03:28:17.679 --> 03:28:26.439]  mocking stupid plans. And it's it's fun. And, and our movement is fun. Connecting to God is
[03:28:26.439 --> 03:28:33.880]  joyful. Connecting to others is joyful. I say to those people who are living the liberal
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:43.880]  nightmare. I understand how miserable you are. What I'm asking you is to come over to the joyful
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:58.560]  side of life. Okay, so I'm not attacking them. I want to rescue them. We have not had this many

[03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:10.039]  through this giant mega maniacal power grab if we're here exposing them. But we're

[03:33:05.900 --> 03:33:14.900]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.900 --> 03:33:20.900]  From their unhappiness.
[03:33:20.900 --> 03:33:26.900]  Beautiful. I'm just search engine Fortress of Joy. Make sure it's not a porn site.
[03:33:27.900 --> 03:33:34.900]  Fortress of Joy Church. That's something in California. We got to get it right now.
[03:33:34.900 --> 03:33:41.900]  Because I know I know me. Well, whatever. It doesn't matter. I said the title. It's fine. We don't get it.
[03:33:41.900 --> 03:33:46.900]  Absolutely. So you just came up with that term. That's a great term.
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:54.759]  Hey, that's why you pay me the big bucks. All right, look, look, look, you got to come
[03:33:54.759 --> 03:34:00.080]  back because I got to jam this an hour and a half on Monday. But let's race through the
[03:34:00.080 --> 03:34:05.960]  other chapters, like chapter five now. Sure. Let's do a sentence or two about each one.
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:12.199]  Chapter five, the eternal war of tyrants. Yeah. Basically, if you're a tyrant, you're
[03:34:12.199 --> 03:34:16.560]  not a good partner. You will betray each other constantly. Good guys don't get it
[03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:21.400]  together until five minutes before midnight. You know, the bad guys always plan and then
[03:34:21.400 --> 03:34:26.640]  they betray each other and then they lose, which is a powerful thing. If the left bans
[03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:30.640]  the Republican Party trying to do, they'll just have sectarian war with themselves.
[03:34:30.640 --> 03:34:35.439]  Absolutely. Let's go ahead and go to the next one here. Chapter six, the war machine.
[03:34:35.439 --> 03:34:40.800]  That's a that's an important one. Yeah. You know, how did we get into this state
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:47.439]  where where the military controls so much? And when you realize that the United States
[03:34:47.439 --> 03:34:52.800]  spends over eight hundred billion dollars a year, has over seven hundred and fifty overseas
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:35:01.439]  bases and our closest 10 competitors don't spend as much as we spend. And, you know,
[03:35:01.439 --> 03:35:06.000]  with us having seven hundred and fifty bases overseas, well, that's that's a recipe for
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:10.720]  continued conflict. You know, our nearest competitor is Great Britain, which I think has
[03:35:10.720 --> 03:35:18.080]  like 12 or 15. Incredible. And we get a lot more into it. I mean, we're just glazing over
[03:35:18.080 --> 03:35:22.320]  this town. We got a few minutes. We can spend more than 20 seconds apiece on these chapter
[03:35:22.320 --> 03:35:26.480]  seven. The deep state makes its move. The point is they're taking over right now.
[03:35:27.759 --> 03:35:33.199]  Yeah, that looks to you know, where I think was the real start of all of this was with
[03:35:33.439 --> 03:35:39.119]  the Eisenhower's military industrial speech is farewell address. And then you had the
[03:35:39.119 --> 03:35:45.759]  Kennedy administration and that was cut short. And shortly after John Kennedy's assassination,
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:52.800]  we went full bore into Vietnam, you know, our longest war until the war on terror.
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:36:02.480]  And and we have become a militarized war state, which is is not it's not leading us to world
[03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:08.560]  destruction, I don't think, but I think it's leading us to continued conflict, making sure
[03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:14.480]  that the military industrial complex sells all its weapons in one war. And then we got to replace
[03:36:14.480 --> 03:36:19.679]  all the ammunition. And then to make sure that happens, they've got to take over here
[03:36:19.679 --> 03:36:24.080]  domestically, which Homeland Security and the Pentagon are now directly the American people.
[03:36:24.080 --> 03:36:29.599]  That's the key of the chapter. Yeah. And many people have said you cannot be a
[03:36:29.599 --> 03:36:36.640]  republic and an empire at the same time. And the United States over the past 50 years
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:41.599]  has become an empire. We need to turn it back to the republic. We need to get rid of these
[03:36:41.599 --> 03:36:46.800]  overseas bases. We need to cut our military spending, spend it on the people at home or
[03:36:47.599 --> 03:36:53.439]  bring down the debt. You know, we need to to to not be the big bully on the block.
[03:36:53.439 --> 03:36:58.240]  Absolutely. Let's go to the next chapter here. After we talk about the war machine,
[03:36:58.240 --> 03:37:02.880]  Chapter seven, the deep state makes its move. Chapter eight, the education of Tucker Carlson
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:07.599]  and Joe Rogan, as well as others. That's an important chapter. That's a big one.
[03:37:09.279 --> 03:37:13.920]  Yeah, that was great because you, you know, told me, you know, about your relationship
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:18.480]  behind the scenes with all these people. And, you know, you were also very clear that you
[03:37:18.480 --> 03:37:23.199]  didn't want to feel like you violated any confidences. So we really stuck with, you know,
[03:37:23.199 --> 03:37:26.640]  what is in the public record and, you know, a couple of things that are outside of the
[03:37:26.640 --> 03:37:31.359]  public record. But I really think that we tried to be respectful. But, you know,
[03:37:31.359 --> 03:37:36.960]  so many people have credited you with changing their thinking on things, you know, from people
[03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:42.560]  like Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and Russell Brand. And they've said so publicly. And I think
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:48.800]  it's just important that people understand that really kind of behind the scenes, you know,
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:56.960]  you guys talk like, you know, regular people talk and, you know, there can be little arguments
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:38:03.519]  and fights. And, you know, you know, you are a very passionate person, Alex, but I've noticed
[03:38:03.519 --> 03:38:08.240]  a consistent pattern that, you know, if you get a little bit too passionate, you know,
[03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:12.160]  you are then, you know, five minutes later saying, I'm sorry, I got a little bit too
[03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:17.679]  passionate. And I think standing on that, I don't get any pushback. I don't get any pushback.
[03:38:17.679 --> 03:38:23.840]  Now, that's what I'm sorry. They now see it. I know. It's what we've definitely are
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:27.039]  having some big victories behind the scenes. And what does it say that not just them,
[03:38:27.039 --> 03:38:31.599]  but all the most popular people in the Western world, but around the world are anti globalist.
[03:38:31.599 --> 03:38:35.119]  That's the globalists know that. I mean, the most popular thing is anti globalism.
[03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:44.080]  Yeah. So so when people get, you know, disheartened by what they see in the world,
[03:38:44.080 --> 03:38:48.880]  I mean, your your effect and the message because, you know, a lot of other people will take
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:55.679]  different pieces of it. But this pro human message is, is winning incredibly. I mean,
[03:38:55.679 --> 03:39:01.519]  I think the greatest testament to that is, you know, when Tucker Carlson was on Fox News,
[03:39:01.519 --> 03:39:05.759]  you know, he'd have a big night, three or 4 million people. And people are like,
[03:39:05.759 --> 03:39:10.000]  oh, you know, he, he is the guy we trust the most in the mainstream news. Well,
[03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:17.759]  once he leaves the mainstream news and he's on his own, he's getting 100, 150, 200 million.
[03:39:17.759 --> 03:39:21.679]  I think that interview we had with the guy who's going to be president in Argentina,
[03:39:21.679 --> 03:39:27.199]  I think of like 250 million. You know, the trouble is like 400 million ever work. Yeah.
[03:39:27.199 --> 03:39:31.759]  The average is 100 million. Chapter 10. No. Chapter nine. Jeffrey Epstein,
[03:39:31.759 --> 03:39:36.080]  Renfield of the globalist Dracula's. But even worse, they prey on their own children.
[03:39:36.160 --> 03:39:42.320]  That's a huge chapter. Yeah. And all credit to you, because I said to you,
[03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:47.039]  when I was starting to work on that, I said, hey, Alex, I don't understand the Jeffrey
[03:39:47.039 --> 03:39:52.080]  Epstein story. You know, I understand pieces of it, but the pieces don't make any sense.
[03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:57.840]  You know, I understand he's a rich guy and OK, he's got some really weird sexual things.
[03:39:57.840 --> 03:40:02.160]  But, you know, after a while, that kind of gets boring. What's the plan? And you
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:05.039]  went through the plan and you gave me all the sources and,
[03:40:05.039 --> 03:40:10.720]  you know, I'm amazed my hair is still, you know, is not white and it's still there
[03:40:11.840 --> 03:40:15.359]  because it was terrifying what you told me. And we put that on the book
[03:40:15.359 --> 03:40:18.480]  and it's all abundantly documented. That's probably the biggest chapter.
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:22.960]  Yeah, I think so. And I think that's like 50 pages long.
[03:40:23.679 --> 03:40:29.359]  Wow. Let's talk about the next chapter here, ladies and gentlemen. Again, this is a book
[03:40:29.359 --> 03:40:35.759]  everybody needs to get info war store dot com Amazon. Let's go to Chapter 10,
[03:40:35.759 --> 03:40:41.679]  The COVID-19 Lies and Deception. You know, that was really kind of in my
[03:40:41.679 --> 03:40:46.320]  wheelhouse because I've written four books with Dr. Judy Mikovitsian. As you can see,
[03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:52.160]  I've got another book here, a presidential takedown that was written with Dr. Paul Alexander,
[03:40:52.160 --> 03:40:59.279]  who is a senior pandemic adviser from about May of 2020 to September of 2020.
[03:40:59.279 --> 03:41:04.880]  And so, you know, he told me all of the things that happen inside the castle walls. You know,
[03:41:05.439 --> 03:41:10.480]  I've been a writer of the rebels who are outside the castle walls. Well, with Paul Alexander is
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:15.439]  inside the castle walls. So I was able to condense all of that until I think about 40 pages.
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:21.119]  But hey, you want a quick read to know how messed up COVID was? It's all in there.
[03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:26.640]  And continuing with more of the chapters from The Great Awakening and info war store.com
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:34.080]  and of course, at Amazon.com. Let's push to number one. We have Chapter 11,
[03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:41.599]  Selling Your Soul to Hollywood and the CIA. Yeah, you know what you had told me about your
[03:41:42.640 --> 03:41:47.119]  adventures in Hollywood and what other people had done. And I think what people
[03:41:47.119 --> 03:41:53.439]  don't understand is, is there's really, you know, many centers of power in our country.
[03:41:53.439 --> 03:41:58.640]  And, you know, a lot of people will say like, Oh, I understand that, you know, our military
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:05.759]  industrial complex probably controls our national security correspondence and everything.
[03:42:05.759 --> 03:42:10.640]  And, you know, you can look at other forms of control. But what we we don't understand is
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:16.960]  that, you know, there's abundant documentation that our intelligence agencies have connections in
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:22.240]  Hollywood, and our programming what we see. And, you know, this whole idea of predictive
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:25.920]  programming is something that, you know, I was not really that familiar with. But,
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:30.720]  you know, as I did a deep dive into it, and I could see like, hey, you know, who's doing this
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:35.759]  and, you know, to have people like Ben Affleck, who, you know, most people would think of as,
[03:42:35.759 --> 03:42:39.920]  you know, an extreme liberal, you know, say at one point after making this movie Argo.
[03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:44.000]  Yeah, I think there are probably a lot of people in Hollywood who are intelligence agents,
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:48.160]  and you don't you see the message is it tells you what the CIA wants to destroy America
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:53.759]  and destroy our families. Chapter 12 combat tactics for victory. That's really important.
[03:42:59.039 --> 03:43:02.720]  Last year, we put this book out, the great reset in the war for the world,
[03:43:02.720 --> 03:43:07.039]  it became a number one national bestseller. Now we've put part two out and it's even
[03:43:07.039 --> 03:43:11.920]  thicker and more powerful. The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and launch
[03:43:11.920 --> 03:43:18.400]  the second great Renaissance. This is such a powerful book. It covers all the globalist plans,
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:22.480]  the latest developments, how to stop them and then gives an alternate plan
[03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:26.560]  of a society we could build together. That's why it's the Great Awakening.
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:32.160]  The Great Awakening is happening right now. You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book
[03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:37.599]  at info war store.com. This is a historic book. I want to thank you all for your support.

[03:45:01.519 --> 03:45:05.279]  Where were you when the globalists were caught traveling millions of children for sex
[03:45:05.279 --> 03:45:09.359]  slavery worldwide? Where were you when the new world order was starting world war three with

[03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:31.840]  launching the next great Renaissance. This is my second book part two of the great recent
[03:45:31.920 --> 03:45:35.840]  war for the world. It's a longer book, quite frankly, more powerful book.

[03:46:02.480 --> 03:46:07.759]  and they can only be obtained through diet. They can be found in grass fed beef,
[03:46:07.759 --> 03:46:13.039]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it. And they can be found in fish,

[03:46:58.160 --> 03:47:05.679]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:24.220]  Yeah, you know, just how do you connect with that divine source? And, you know, one of
[03:47:24.220 --> 03:47:28.380]  the things that we talked about is like, you know, and you always ask us and Steve Bannon
[03:47:28.380 --> 03:47:33.500]  is kind of funny to watch the two of you because both of you at some point in your
[03:47:33.500 --> 03:47:38.300]  interviews will with people say like, where are we? Where do you think we are? And, you know,
[03:47:39.260 --> 03:47:45.660]  for me, the answer was the story of Exodus that, you know, Moses, you know,
[03:47:46.699 --> 03:47:53.900]  had the people of Israel rise out of slavery. They they were the plagues. They left Egypt.
[03:47:53.900 --> 03:47:59.820]  They're at the Red Sea. They they see Pharaoh's army approaching. And, you know,
[03:47:59.820 --> 03:48:10.140]  the Israelites, after seeing all the wonders that God provided them to escape from Europe,
[03:48:10.699 --> 03:48:16.940]  when they see the Egyptian army, start complaining to Moses. Why did you take us out of Egypt? And,
[03:48:16.940 --> 03:48:24.940]  and, you know, God gets Moses gets the message from God. Be still and know God. And so what I
[03:48:24.940 --> 03:48:33.500]  say is, you know, and that's not a trust the plan idea. The idea behind that is that
[03:48:33.500 --> 03:48:42.539]  we human beings need to do everything we know how to do to show our devotion to God and to
[03:48:42.539 --> 03:48:47.580]  what's right. And then God shows up and then, and then we have to let go of the result.
[03:48:48.140 --> 03:48:52.220]  And so, you know, I'm getting to a certain age, you're getting to a certain age,
[03:48:52.220 --> 03:48:57.420]  I know I'm not going to be here forever. And I'm just saying, I want my legacy to be
[03:48:58.060 --> 03:49:05.500]  that I have all I have done what I considered to be right, to the best of my knowledge
[03:49:05.500 --> 03:49:11.580]  at this time. That's what everybody needs to be. Then we have the final battle.
[03:49:14.380 --> 03:49:20.460]  Yeah, it just kind of revisiting that, that that positive human message, because
[03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:28.300]  as you always talk about the the Renaissance, it's this flowering of human creativity.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:36.539]  It's not a top down, you know, way of doing it's a bottom up. You know,
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:44.779]  if the globalists are saying that there are some among us who will be part of a useless class
[03:49:44.859 --> 03:49:49.740]  and dependent upon, you know, which, you know, pointy headed intellectual,
[03:49:49.740 --> 03:49:55.260]  you quote, they think that 80 to 90% of us should be gone.
[03:49:57.500 --> 03:50:04.220]  We're saying every human being has value. And the Renaissance was this great flowering
[03:50:04.859 --> 03:50:13.020]  of the public of the populace. Where do we find our joy? How do we bring that into the
[03:50:13.020 --> 03:50:20.619]  political sphere? And how do we create a world which is more beautiful than anything we can
[03:50:20.619 --> 03:50:22.859]  imagine? And then we have the
[03:50:24.460 --> 03:50:32.940]  final chapter here. Before the co-authors note writing for Alex Jones, how you know you're
[03:50:32.940 --> 03:50:38.220]  winning more positive examples of the fact that we're turning the tide together. And then in
[03:50:38.220 --> 03:50:43.660]  closing, get into writing with me. He wanted to write that final chapter. Why did you do that?
[03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:50.539]  Well, you know, one of the things that I talked about is I thought originally thought when I was
[03:50:50.539 --> 03:50:55.660]  a young man, I was going to be a prosecutor that that was my goal. And then I worked in
[03:50:55.660 --> 03:51:04.220]  criminal law. And you know, so I, I, I admired people like Rudy Giuliani going after the mob. I
[03:51:04.220 --> 03:51:11.820]  admired people like Elliot Ness going after Al Capone. And then I worked in it and, and I started
[03:51:11.820 --> 03:51:16.060]  to also at the same time become aware of the great criminal defense attorneys, you know,
[03:51:16.060 --> 03:51:22.220]  people like Alan Dershowitz, Jerry Spence, William Kunstler. In law school, I was fortunate
[03:51:22.220 --> 03:51:27.420]  enough to be taught by a guy named Bernie Siegel, who actually defended the Green Beret killer
[03:51:27.420 --> 03:51:34.940]  Jeffrey McDonald. And, you know, as much as at the time as I didn't, you know, understand,
[03:51:34.940 --> 03:51:43.100]  I didn't agree with them. I, I admired their ability to stand up against the system to be one
[03:51:43.100 --> 03:51:49.420]  man against something and just use their intellect, not their fists, not bombs, not guns,
[03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:55.420]  but their intellect. And so, you know, I had the experience of, you know, interacting some with
[03:51:55.420 --> 03:52:01.660]  a guy named Tony Sarah, who was like so big against the war on drugs. And, you know,
[03:52:01.660 --> 03:52:07.420]  as I started, started to learn more and more, I understood like, gee, the criminal defense
[03:52:07.420 --> 03:52:12.859]  attorney has a real part in our society. And, you know, when it came to you,
[03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:17.660]  I kind of looked at you as you are being tried in the court of public opinion.
[03:52:17.660 --> 03:52:20.380]  And if you are being tried in the court of public opinion,
[03:52:21.340 --> 03:52:28.460]  I want to be your defense attorney. So I, I consider myself Alex Jones's defense attorney
[03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:34.539]  in the court of public opinion. And, and the verdict is going to be in our favor. And so I
[03:52:34.539 --> 03:52:43.900]  just felt like you had been railroaded, you had been maligned. And with every piece of skill
[03:52:43.900 --> 03:52:49.580]  and intelligence that I had, I was going to write the defense brief for Alex Jones.
[03:52:49.580 --> 03:52:54.300]  And that's what I consider this book to be, which is the defense of populism in a pro-human future.
[03:52:54.300 --> 03:52:58.940]  Yeah. And the defense of the ideas that you've talked about based on your extensive research,
[03:52:59.740 --> 03:53:03.660]  the great awakening, defeating the globalist and launching the next great Renaissance.
[03:53:03.660 --> 03:53:07.420]  Alex Jones with Ken Egan lively Ford by Stephen K. Bannon available now on
[03:53:07.420 --> 03:53:11.500]  info or store.com as a fundraiser. Give us on air. Signed also unsigned available.
[03:53:11.500 --> 03:53:15.740]  Then for a store, get an Amazon drive to number one, important to do that. A great Christmas
[03:53:15.740 --> 03:53:20.140]  gift. You know, don't really a bunch of shopping. Don't spend gas. Don't get mugged at the mall,
[03:53:20.140 --> 03:53:24.699]  just buy 10 copies of the unsigned book and buy one copy of the sign. If you want
[03:53:24.699 --> 03:53:27.580]  and just give people the great awakening. It's what it's all about. Well, this book
[03:53:27.580 --> 03:53:32.619]  saved the world. No, but all of our resistance together with God behind us will, will we will
[03:53:32.619 --> 03:53:39.260]  win Ken Egan lively. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. All right. That was a powerful
[03:53:39.260 --> 03:53:44.539]  two hours. Appreciate the crew coming in for this live Saturday show. We're obviously
[03:53:44.619 --> 03:53:50.460]  tomorrow night on the Sunday show going to be tracking this extremely dangerous war.
[03:53:52.300 --> 03:53:57.020]  That is going to suck in Iran and suck in everything else. Cause Iran is trying to act
[03:53:57.020 --> 03:54:02.779]  like that. It's a mass. This is Iran working with a mass and we just pray that peace comes
[03:54:02.779 --> 03:54:09.020]  at the stop, but we'll obviously have a lot for you at info wars.com as developments unfold.
[03:54:09.020 --> 03:54:13.500]  Israel's got to repel this invasion first, but I would expect them to level Gaza,
[03:54:13.500 --> 03:54:18.140]  which is so savvy people there as well. And then I would predict major actions,
[03:54:18.140 --> 03:54:23.740]  bare minimum killing of Iranian generals and others, perhaps an attack after they've taken out
[03:54:23.740 --> 03:54:30.539]  Gaza in the North there in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, but as well as also here
[03:54:30.539 --> 03:54:34.779]  in our country. And I'll go back to how did Israel not know this attack was coming.
[03:54:34.779 --> 03:54:39.580]  That's a big issue in this as well, separately. We have great products at
[03:54:39.580 --> 03:54:44.619]  info war store.com that fund. This broadcast will also enrich your life, do amazing things
[03:54:44.619 --> 03:54:48.779]  for your stamina, your energy, your immune system, your bones, your joints, your brain.
[03:54:48.779 --> 03:54:52.140]  We have the trifecta sale extended till Monday, but we got to end it.
[03:54:52.140 --> 03:54:57.020]  Cause one of these is about to sell out DNA force plus bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[03:54:57.020 --> 03:55:02.859]  and real red pill. Plus 40% off together, 25% off individually, vitamin and fusion
[03:55:03.580 --> 03:55:08.619]  back in stocks. Let's end the broadcast with a three minute trifecta ad because like I said,
[03:55:08.619 --> 03:55:13.660]  we're barely in the black and we just stay here. And it's so frustrating because I want to hire
[03:55:13.660 --> 03:55:17.820]  Savannah Hernandez back. I want to hire Drew Hernandez, no relation. They're ready to take
[03:55:17.820 --> 03:55:22.380]  the job for low pay, but there's not pay for them. I want to cover Bilderberg. I want
[03:55:22.380 --> 03:55:27.980]  to cover Bohemian Grove. I want to cover skull and bones. I want to cover RNC, DNC. I want
[03:55:27.980 --> 03:55:33.340]  to be at the border every month or more because we, it has a huge effect. We reach tens of
[03:55:33.420 --> 03:55:38.779]  millions when we do, but we don't even have the funds, uh, to do that with putting the crew up
[03:55:38.779 --> 03:55:44.779]  in like motel sixes and myself. Uh, so there's just not money for any of it and limited security.
[03:55:44.779 --> 03:55:48.300]  We got to have at least three, four security guys. When we go to the most dangerous areas,
[03:55:48.300 --> 03:55:51.580]  the border, and they're working 50 bucks an hour, they deserve it. They're great people.
[03:55:51.580 --> 03:55:56.140]  I mean, it takes money to prosecute a war. Go to info war store.com. Take advantage of the
[03:55:56.140 --> 03:55:59.820]  trifecta sale. Uh, three of our great products have been sold out for a very long time

[03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:22.140]  share the link, very powerful, not just what's happening in Israel and the coverage of that
[03:56:22.140 --> 03:56:26.860]  potential world war three scenarios that are very probable, but also the great awakening,
[03:56:26.860 --> 03:56:32.619]  how to counter all this together, a great two hour transmission, want to thank the crew.
[03:56:32.619 --> 03:56:37.340]  And as I said, I'll see you back tomorrow for the Sunday show and back on the Monday
