[00:00.000 --> 00:26.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show here on this Wednesday,
[00:26.560 --> 00:40.000]  29th 2019. Filling in for Alex, I am Owen Shroyer. Big shoes to fill today on the heels of the
[00:40.000 --> 00:50.680]  Mueller statement that was just given on the hill. Now we're going to air the entire thing in
[00:50.680 --> 00:58.680]  the next segment or maybe we'll do it in the second segment or the third segment. But we're
[00:58.680 --> 01:05.400]  going to air the whole thing, probably in the next segment. In fact, I'm just wargaming it all
[01:05.400 --> 01:09.520]  on air right now. We're going to do it in the next segment because I do believe we have more
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.240]  time in that segment than the third segment. And if I'm right, crew, just give me a note on that.
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.880]  I think it fits in better in the next segment. So that's what we're going to do. And we may air
[01:19.880 --> 01:25.560]  it a couple times. And I'll maybe do some live commentary over it the first time. Maybe we'll
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.800]  just air it fully through and then I can come back and do some commentary. And then we can take
[01:29.800 --> 01:42.080]  your calls later on as we are guest free today. But I have stacks of news to get to. Much of
[01:42.080 --> 01:50.160]  it is very important culture news and political news. But they are about to re drum up Russian
[01:50.160 --> 01:58.360]  collusion. What I mean, what else do you need to say? They they they're really about to drum
[01:58.360 --> 02:06.880]  this backup. That's what this is. And it's really stunning. It's really stunning that we've come
[02:06.880 --> 02:15.240]  full circle now and we're right back to where we began with Russian collusion. Something that has
[02:15.240 --> 02:25.960]  been totally disproven. And at this point, if you really believe that Donald Trump colluded with
[02:25.960 --> 02:37.520]  Russia for, I mean, whatever that means in the mythical world, these people live in, you really
[02:37.520 --> 02:46.600]  have lost all ability to think for yourself. That's what it really comes down to. If you if
[02:46.600 --> 02:56.520]  you really think that Donald Trump was part of a big conspiracy with Putin or Russia or any one
[02:56.520 --> 03:04.840]  from Russia or some other big conspiracy involving Russia in order to steal the 2016 election from
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.560]  Hillary Clinton, if you really believe that you have lost the ability to think for yourself.
[03:11.560 --> 03:21.320]  You are under MK ultra mind control with the television flicker rate, putting you in a trance
[03:21.320 --> 03:33.640]  and then CIA agents, part of some modern day operation mockingbird on TV, telling you what to
[03:33.640 --> 03:48.120]  think. This is not a game. This is the real world. And when I realize that that's what's going on,
[03:48.120 --> 03:59.440]  and it just hits you like a rush. And I'm looking to get this phone call on air today. But as soon
[03:59.440 --> 04:06.920]  as Bob Mueller finished giving his statement, a Democrat called into C span. And if it's not the
[04:06.920 --> 04:15.680]  epitome of where the Democrat voter is right now intellectually, well, I'd hope it's not. But sadly,
[04:15.680 --> 04:31.680]  I think it is. And it can be so easily reverse engineered to show them how they reached that point
[04:31.680 --> 04:39.040]  in the thought process, even though none of it's real. But yeah, folks, they were testing with the
[04:39.040 --> 04:45.200]  flicker rates of the TVs. They have CIA agents acting like newsmen on television. This all came
[04:45.200 --> 04:50.640]  out in the Frank church hearings. It's clearly still going on. I can't believe it. But I'm actually
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.440]  witnessing it. We're going to air the full mother's Mueller statement on the other side of this break.
[04:55.440 --> 05:25.400]  This is the Alex Jones show and we're defeating the leftist. I got mob on the streets by fans that almost all of us said, we used to love you on air was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube. Are you coming back? We're at info wars.com. We're at news wars.com. All watches launches on summit dot news. We have our own videos. We have our own articles. They're trying to destroy us. But thanks to you.
[05:25.440 --> 05:47.280]  And others having us on info wars. We're still checking along. So we're there folks. Tomorrow's news today info wars dot com. I'm at info wars dot com and news wars dot com. We knew this censorship is coming forever. We have our own video
[05:47.280 --> 05:58.520]  streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it. Reupload and do whatever you want. People go to info wars dot com and news wars dot com. That's where they find it. You know, there's what things go websites. Go there.
[05:58.520 --> 06:22.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Mueller has just given a statement on his report. We air it right now on the Alex Jones show, everyone. And thank you for being here.
[06:22.520 --> 06:51.520]  Two years ago, the acting Attorney General asked me to serve as special counsel, and he created the special counsel's office. The appointment order directed the office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.
[06:51.520 --> 07:06.520]  I remember this would have happened while Obama was president during our investigation. I'm speaking out today because our investigation is complete. The Attorney General has made the report on our investigation largely public.
[07:06.520 --> 07:29.520]  We are formally closing the special counsel's office. And as well, I'm resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life. I'll make a few remarks about the results of our work. But beyond these few remarks, it is important that the offices written work speak for itself.
[07:29.520 --> 07:50.520]  Let me begin where the appointment order begins, and that is interference in the 2016 presidential election. As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system.
[07:50.520 --> 08:10.520]  The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks.
[08:10.520 --> 08:17.520]  The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.
[08:17.520 --> 08:34.520]  And at the same time as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election.
[08:34.520 --> 08:49.520]  These indictments contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or the innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
[08:49.520 --> 09:07.520]  The indictments allege and the other activities in our report describe efforts to interfere in our political system. They needed to be investigated and understood. That is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office.
[09:07.520 --> 09:16.520]  That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation. The matters we investigated were of paramount importance.
[09:16.520 --> 09:23.520]  It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned.
[09:23.520 --> 09:38.520]  A subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators. It strikes at the core of their government's effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.
[09:38.520 --> 09:48.520]  Let me say a word about the report. The report has two parts addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate.
[09:48.520 --> 10:07.520]  The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.
[10:07.520 --> 10:19.520]  In the second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation.
[10:19.520 --> 10:36.520]  In order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation and we kept the office of the acting Attorney General apprised of the progress of our work.
[10:36.520 --> 10:52.520]  And as that forth in the report after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the President did commit a crime.
[10:52.520 --> 11:11.520]  The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long standing department policy, a President cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional.
[11:11.520 --> 11:18.520]  Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited.
[11:18.520 --> 11:27.520]  The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy.
[11:27.520 --> 11:29.520]  So here he is giving the media their narrative.
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.520]  Therefore not an option we could consider.
[11:33.520 --> 11:35.520]  He would have charged Trump if it was legal.
[11:35.520 --> 11:45.520]  The President's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation.
[11:45.520 --> 11:51.520]  Those points are summarized in our report and I will describe two of them for you.
[11:51.520 --> 12:04.520]  First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting President because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available.
[12:04.520 --> 12:11.520]  Among other things that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.
[12:11.520 --> 12:24.520]  And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.
[12:24.520 --> 12:33.520]  And beyond department policy, we would have charged Trump if it was legal.
[12:33.520 --> 12:45.520]  It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution at all for him to be going through this other than to stab Donald Trump in the back.
[12:45.520 --> 12:57.520]  Those were the principles under which we operated and from then we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the President committed a crime.
[12:57.520 --> 13:07.520]  That is the office's final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the President.
[13:07.520 --> 13:17.520]  We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the Attorney General as required by department regulations.
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.520]  So now it was a criminal investigation even though they said it wasn't.
[13:21.520 --> 13:27.520]  They said they would provide our report to Congress and to the American people.
[13:27.520 --> 13:31.520]  At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released.
[13:31.520 --> 13:38.520]  The Attorney General preferred to make the entire report public all at once.
[13:38.520 --> 13:49.520]  We appreciate that the Attorney General made the report largely public and I certainly do not question the Attorney General's good faith in that decision.
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.520]  I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this matter.
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.520]  I am making that decision myself.
[13:57.520 --> 14:04.520]  No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.520]  There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress.
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.520]  Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report.
[14:13.520 --> 14:19.520]  It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made.
[14:19.520 --> 14:24.520]  We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.
[14:24.520 --> 14:26.520]  And the report is my testimony.
[14:26.520 --> 14:27.520]  This is a clown.
[14:27.520 --> 14:34.520]  We will not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.
[14:34.520 --> 14:44.520]  In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.
[14:44.520 --> 14:49.520]  So beyond what I have said here today and what is contained in our written work,
[14:49.520 --> 14:58.520]  I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.520]  And as for that reason, I will not be taking questions today as well.
[15:02.520 --> 15:03.520]  Forever.
[15:03.520 --> 15:18.520]  Before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the FBI agents, the analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner.
[15:18.520 --> 15:26.520]  These individuals who spent nearly two years with the special counsel's office were of the highest integrity.
[15:26.520 --> 15:37.520]  And I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments that there were multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election.
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.520]  And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.520]  Thank you.
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.520]  Thank you for being here today.
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.520]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:48.520 --> 15:58.520]  $50 million, two years of investigations, and that's what you get right there.
[15:58.520 --> 16:00.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.520 --> 16:04.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.520 --> 16:05.520]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:05.520 --> 16:08.520]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:08.520 --> 16:14.520]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[16:28.520 --> 16:34.520]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[16:34.520 --> 16:37.520]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:37.520 --> 16:43.520]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[16:43.520 --> 16:47.520]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.520]  Was there ever a vote?
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.520]  Who do we fight for?
[16:50.520 --> 17:16.520]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:29.520 --> 20:38.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard the full Mueller statement.
[20:38.520 --> 20:49.520]  I'm going to do my best to try to just break down everything we just witnessed and what is going to follow because of it.
[20:49.520 --> 20:58.520]  But at the same time, I have to at least remember it's all a big distraction.
[20:58.520 --> 21:06.520]  Now, having said that, we have to cover the open treason that happened against this country that,
[21:06.520 --> 21:13.520]  whether you want to say Bob Mueller was involved in or not, I guess you could still debate.
[21:13.520 --> 21:21.520]  But is he covering up for it? Absolutely.
[21:21.520 --> 21:31.520]  But how do you even respond to something so fake, so obviously contrived,
[21:31.520 --> 21:45.520]  and then with even the most basic logic and reasoning can be totally dissembled?
[21:45.520 --> 21:51.520]  Let's just review some of the things Mueller is saying.
[21:51.520 --> 22:09.520]  Russia is interfering in our elections with cyber attacks and different forms of electric attacks or whatever they're alleging.
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.520]  Maybe that's happening. Maybe that's not happening. That's not what they were investigating.
[22:13.520 --> 22:24.520]  You have Obama on a hot mic talking about meeting with Putin once he gets reelected.
[22:24.520 --> 22:36.520]  So, I mean, it's just a joke to act like you can't talk to Russians, to act like you're not allowed to meet with Russian ambassadors.
[22:36.520 --> 22:41.520]  But that's what they're doing.
[22:41.520 --> 22:54.520]  And so, why does an entire body of people believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia even though there's no evidence?
[22:54.520 --> 23:02.520]  Because the media has been telling them that.
[23:02.520 --> 23:07.520]  And Bob Mueller could have come out here and made a statement saying, we found nothing.
[23:07.520 --> 23:13.520]  He investigated for two years. The media hyped something up that we never had.
[23:13.520 --> 23:21.520]  The origins of this investigation are being investigated and could have been fraudulent, but he didn't do any of that, did he?
[23:21.520 --> 23:31.520]  He went on with the giant myth that Trump colluded with Russia and that what else, WikiLeaks, was a part of it.
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.520]  So, let's think about that.
[23:36.520 --> 23:42.520]  Julian Assange is currently under arrest and has been charged with what?
[23:42.520 --> 23:49.520]  18 different espionage act violations or some such thing by the US government?
[23:49.520 --> 23:54.520]  And that's Trump's bag man in the Russian collusion?
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.520]  Delusion?
[23:58.520 --> 24:06.520]  If Donald Trump is colluding with Russia, why would he have to go through WikiLeaks as a conduit?
[24:06.520 --> 24:11.520]  It doesn't make sense.
[24:11.520 --> 24:24.520]  And if WikiLeaks was indeed the conduit as Bob Mueller claims it to be, how come Julian Assange has never been questioned to this day?
[24:24.520 --> 24:41.520]  He said no evidence presented that WikiLeaks had any involvement with Russia in regards to the Clinton email hack, which is just one of the email dumps done by WikiLeaks.
[24:41.520 --> 24:46.520]  Now, there's a couple other ripples in this that are going to be interesting.
[24:46.520 --> 24:50.520]  Obviously, Mueller's done speaking. He's not going to speak in front of Congress.
[24:50.520 --> 24:54.520]  He's not going to anger the left.
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.520]  This is going to really anger the left. They're expecting Mueller to testify before Congress.
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.520]  They need that testimony. They're not going to get it.
[25:04.520 --> 25:12.520]  And that's because they don't realize how devastating that would be to the Russian collusion narrative.
[25:12.520 --> 25:20.520]  As far as sat before Congress, Republicans are going to get to question him, too, and it's not going to be pretty.
[25:20.520 --> 25:26.520]  But Mueller realizes that, so he's not going to testify before Congress.
[25:26.520 --> 25:38.520]  But then there's the media, which has been the real issue here as far as the deception is concerned with the public.
[25:38.520 --> 25:46.520]  Well, you heard Mueller. He said that they couldn't prove there was no obstruction, but they also couldn't prove there was obstruction.
[25:46.520 --> 25:58.520]  So that's Mueller basically signaling to Democrats in Intel communities and intelligence, House committees, and signaling to the media to say,
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.520]  Trump may have committed a crime. We just couldn't find it.
[26:02.520 --> 26:12.520]  Or Trump did commit a crime, but we couldn't get the evidence and we couldn't charge him anyway if we did.
[26:12.520 --> 26:23.520]  So that means that all the Democrats in the House committees and the Senate committees are about to launch all a bunch of separate investigations into Trump-Russia collusion.
[26:23.520 --> 26:39.520]  And the media is going to start spouting the narrative that Trump would have been found guilty if the laws weren't constructed to protect the president from such charges.
[26:39.520 --> 26:46.520]  But let's recall all the lies. They said President Trump was not under criminal investigation.
[26:46.520 --> 26:53.520]  It turns out he was. It turns out they were even investigating him for obstruction of justice.
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.520]  How could they do such a thing when they have not even found a crime?
[26:58.520 --> 27:06.520]  How can you obstruct justice when no crime exists?
[27:06.520 --> 27:21.520]  Can you say Trump didn't cooperate when there was more cooperation from the Trump administration and Trump associates in this investigation than the Mueller team even expected?
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.520]  But what does it really all come down to?
[27:24.520 --> 27:52.520]  And this is where the paradox exists. It all comes down to the fact that Obama illegally spied on the Trump campaign and they needed an excuse so that they could not be charged criminally for treason.
[27:52.520 --> 28:03.520]  And the claim that Trump colluded with Russia was the cover for the illegal spying by the Obama administration.
[28:03.520 --> 28:17.520]  Now that's very surface level above the fold, above the horizon, above the water that we can see.
[28:17.520 --> 28:28.520]  But there's so much else going on behind the scenes beyond that, that it's really impossible to break down in one segment.
[28:28.520 --> 28:36.520]  But that's Mueller's statement and that's what I expect to come from this.
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.520]  So Democrats are going to launch a bunch of investigations, drum them up.
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.520]  The media is going to drum it up saying that Trump would have been charged if the laws weren't constructed the way they were.
[28:46.520 --> 28:58.520]  Mueller will be deemed a hero that is until he refuses to testify in front of Congress and then the average leftist will be angry at him and who knows, maybe even CNN will be too.

[33:24.520 --> 33:33.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.520 --> 33:37.520]  Alright, we have the clip.
[33:37.520 --> 33:46.520]  We have the clip I was looking for. The crew found it of the caller right after the Mueller statement was given on C-Span.
[33:46.520 --> 33:55.520]  And I just want to play it because, again, I don't even know really how to properly break this down,
[33:55.520 --> 34:03.520]  other than to just apply what I know, what we all know, and what we're seeing.
[34:03.520 --> 34:18.520]  We know that the CIA and other government programs and other governments have tested with flicker rates on televisions and lights on monkeys and probably even humans.
[34:18.520 --> 34:26.520]  I don't know if that's declassified, but let's not act like we're not still in Kansas here.
[34:26.520 --> 34:33.520]  And you know that the CIA embeds operatives in the media. This came out in the Frank Church hearings.
[34:33.520 --> 34:36.520]  This came out in the declassified JFK file.
[34:36.520 --> 34:39.520]  So when you combine those two things, what can you do?
[34:39.520 --> 34:56.520]  You can run a massive false flag, a massive false narrative, a massive fake news story, and create mass hysteria.
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.520]  And that's what they've done with the Russian investigation in the Mueller report.
[35:00.520 --> 35:07.520]  But I'm going to play the clip that really encapsulates that here in just a minute.
[35:07.520 --> 35:13.520]  But first, I haven't even paid the bills yet here today.
[35:13.520 --> 35:22.520]  And we've got a great special going right now at infowarstore.com for the Memorial Day sale, which is not going to last forever.

[37:38.520 --> 37:49.520]  All right. I want to go to this clip now that just encapsulates how brainwashed and deceived the average Democrat voter is.
[37:49.520 --> 37:56.520]  Listen to this C-SPAN caller in immediate response to the Mueller statement today.
[37:56.520 --> 38:03.520]  Justice, and we'll get to those. We'd love to hear from you, and we'll go first to our Democrats line to hear from Diana Livingston, New Jersey.
[38:03.520 --> 38:05.520]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[38:05.520 --> 38:16.520]  Hi. Good morning. I hope that now that Mueller has formally resigned from the Department of Justice that he will be allowed to testify publicly.
[38:16.520 --> 38:23.520]  Pause it right there. Deception number one. She says that he will be allowed to testify.
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.520]  No one's stopping him from testifying but him, but you watch. This is the Democrat delusion.
[38:29.520 --> 38:39.520]  They're going to be under the auspices that Trump or the Attorney General or somebody somehow is stopping Mueller from testifying even though he's the one stopping it.
[38:39.520 --> 38:41.520]  He's the one that doesn't want to testify.
[38:41.520 --> 38:48.520]  So the Democrats are going to be ticked off that Mueller's not going to testify in front of Congress even though that's his choice.
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.520]  So there's deception number one. Roll the tape.
[38:52.520 --> 39:00.520]  Our election security, which this Trump administration and GLP Congress has failed to pass any bill.
[39:00.520 --> 39:01.520]  Pause it right there.
[39:01.520 --> 39:08.520]  Election security. Lady, there are people pouring over the southern border like you won't believe.
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.520]  And guess what? They're getting on the voter rolls. Dead people are voting. People are voting twice.
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.520]  People are voting in counties they haven't lived in in decades. What do you think's going on?
[39:19.520 --> 39:26.520]  And you're going to complain about election security that heck they even come out and say non-citizens should vote now.
[39:26.520 --> 39:33.520]  And you're going to act like election security is the problem. Oh, but what's the big twist to this?
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.520]  The Trump administration is doing nothing about the Russians interfering in our election.
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.520]  This happened during the Obama administration.
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.520]  This didn't happen during the Trump administration. In fact, you can go back and look.
[39:48.520 --> 39:54.520]  Obama discounted the threats of Russia.
[39:54.520 --> 39:57.520]  It was a national news story.
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.520]  Obama doesn't take the threat of Russian interference seriously.
[40:02.520 --> 40:05.520]  Obama says nobody can hack the elections.
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.520]  So it was the Obama administration that allowed all this to happen.
[40:08.520 --> 40:11.520]  It was the Obama administration that stood down, lady.
[40:11.520 --> 40:13.520]  And what do they do? They blame Trump.
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.520]  Just like it's going to be Mueller that won't testify, they'll blame Trump.
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.520]  Just like it was Obama's administration that allowed the Russian interferes to happen, they'll blame Trump.
[40:23.520 --> 40:29.520]  Okay? I mean, again, I can reverse engineer and show how delusional these people are all day.
[40:29.520 --> 40:32.520]  But let's go back to her.
[40:32.520 --> 40:36.520]  Directives to our intelligence agencies to protect our elections.
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.520]  That's a main concern of our, of me. I'm a Democrat. That's a main concern.
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.520]  It seems like they're trying to dismiss this whole thing as a big hoax.
[40:45.520 --> 40:47.520]  And they mean not the hoax of Russia.
[40:47.520 --> 40:54.520]  Like they're trying to admit that, yes, Russia, it was they interfered, but that the Trump administration had.
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.520]  All right, just listen to the delusion in this lady's voice.
[40:59.520 --> 41:02.520]  She has no idea what she's talking about.
[41:02.520 --> 41:06.520]  Again, everything she's complaining about happened during the Obama years.
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.520]  Donald Trump, as his administration, cooperated to the fullest extent.
[41:11.520 --> 41:14.520]  Millions of dollars were spent. And they lied to him about the whole thing.
[41:14.520 --> 41:16.520]  All right, go back to the call.
[41:16.520 --> 41:24.520]  Council, Robert Mueller interfered, but that the Trump administration had nothing to do with it or were in eager to accept help.
[41:24.520 --> 41:31.520]  And even though it wasn't, you know, and this needs to be explained to the people, the difference between a criminal prosecution and
[41:31.520 --> 41:37.520]  immoral acts that don't meet the level of proving the crime.
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.520]  We see a lot of innocent people get because of the state can't prove a crime, get let go.
[41:43.520 --> 41:50.520]  It doesn't mean that the Congress and the American people shouldn't review what Mueller had in the report.
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.520]  That dealt with campaigns receiving help from foreign.
[41:55.520 --> 41:58.520]  That's all Hillary. All right, let's go to Hillary.
[41:58.520 --> 42:01.520]  So there it is, folks.
[42:01.520 --> 42:08.520]  Fumbling and stammering and bumbling around, totally clueless, blaming Trump for the things that Obama allowed.
[42:08.520 --> 42:11.520]  Blaming Trump for Mueller's decisions.
[42:11.520 --> 42:16.520]  When Mueller even said, stated clearly, it's my decision not to testify before Congress.
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.520]  It's my decision not to speak publicly after this.
[42:18.520 --> 42:29.520]  He said he said it himself and these delusional people call in and say, Mueller better testify or Trump stopping him from doing it.
[42:29.520 --> 42:39.520]  You know, look, I mean, how do you even how do you even live in this clown world anymore?
[42:39.520 --> 42:46.520]  I just don't even believe it. And Democrat voters honestly think we're stupid.
[42:46.520 --> 42:55.520]  They really think we're stupid as they are getting drug around like a bull by its horns, like by the ring of its nose right now.
[42:55.520 --> 42:58.520]  It's unbelievable.
[42:58.520 --> 43:06.520]  They've not shut down our speech. We're at infowars.com and newswars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.520]  We've got mob on the streets by fans, but almost all of us said we used to love you on air.
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.520]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.520]  Are you coming back? We're at infowars.com. We're at newswars.com. Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[43:20.520 --> 43:22.520]  We have our own videos. We have our own articles.

[43:27.520 --> 43:29.520]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news today.
[43:29.520 --> 43:45.520]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com. We knew this censorship was coming forever.

[43:48.520 --> 43:51.520]  Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[43:51.520 --> 43:54.520]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com. That's where they find it.
[43:54.520 --> 43:59.520]  You know, there's things called websites. You just go there.
[44:24.520 --> 44:29.520]  Then you add, not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[44:29.520 --> 44:30.520]  Literally.
[44:30.520 --> 44:35.520]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen,
[44:35.520 --> 44:42.520]  then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.

[44:52.520 --> 44:58.520]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[45:00.520 --> 45:03.520]  Stacey in the great state of Texas.
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.520]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.520]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.520]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[45:14.520 --> 45:19.520]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.520]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that they say that they have in them.
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.520]  And they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[45:26.520 --> 45:28.520]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.520]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good.
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.520]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.520]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like it.
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.520]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo charge women.
[45:43.520 --> 45:45.520]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[45:45.520 --> 45:51.520]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy. These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.520]  InfoWarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[46:00.520 --> 46:05.520]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.520]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more. Thanks for calling, Tom.
[46:10.520 --> 46:12.520]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call.
[46:12.520 --> 46:18.520]  Just want to thank you for your products. I have the InfoWars decals on outside of my cell phone case.
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.520]  My truck, sport the shirts, all the equipment. I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[46:22.520 --> 46:23.520]  God bless you, brother.
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.520]  And I have three or four InfoWars bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[46:27.520 --> 46:30.520]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[46:30.520 --> 46:33.520]  You're our only hope, brother. I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[46:33.520 --> 46:58.520]  It's people like you on the ground as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[46:58.520 --> 47:05.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.520 --> 47:19.520]  Here we go.
[47:19.520 --> 47:27.520]  These people are so predictable, man.
[47:27.520 --> 47:31.520]  Every Democrat is already tweeting,
[47:31.520 --> 47:37.520]  Bob Mueller has just referred us to impeach the president.
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.520]  Wow. New people are so damn predictable.
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.520]  For what?
[47:45.520 --> 47:52.520]  For what?
[47:52.520 --> 48:00.520]  I have hours of videotape of me going to impeach Trump rallies and asking every single individual there why Trump should be impeached.
[48:00.520 --> 48:03.520]  And I can't get one answer.
[48:03.520 --> 48:10.520]  I couldn't even get an answer from the Democrats tweeting this out today.
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.520]  Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both just tweeted out a time to impeach the president.
[48:15.520 --> 48:18.520]  So I'm sure they're all tweeting it now.
[48:18.520 --> 48:20.520]  The media is probably all over it too.
[48:20.520 --> 48:22.520]  For what?
[48:22.520 --> 48:25.520]  Mueller said nothing, nothing.
[48:25.520 --> 48:28.520]  He found nothing.
[48:28.520 --> 48:36.520]  Again, you know, I'm going to open up the phone lines here to get your response, you know,
[48:36.520 --> 48:43.520]  because I don't know, I feel like I'm fumbling and bumbling around here because this is just insane.
[48:43.520 --> 48:53.520]  I just can't believe that we're dealing with this level of delusion and this level of deception.
[48:53.520 --> 49:01.520]  And you know, the president better go after these people.
[49:01.520 --> 49:04.520]  This is just out of control.
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.520]  This is just out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:09.520 --> 49:14.520]  A total made up hoax.
[49:14.520 --> 49:17.520]  Hoax.
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.520]  And every angle.
[49:20.520 --> 49:30.520]  And then you could even sit back and hold a mirror to the whole thing and realize that everything they're claiming Trump did, Hillary Clinton actually did and tenfold.
[49:30.520 --> 49:40.520]  How did they get that information on Trump, Hillary Clinton paid for it?
[49:40.520 --> 49:50.520]  The only person that's been caught colluding with any Russians is Hillary Clinton.
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.520]  I just, I'm just stunned.
[49:55.520 --> 50:11.520]  I'm just stunned that anybody can be following this and not see the clear levels of deception that the Democrats are engaged in right now.
[50:11.520 --> 50:18.520]  I mean, wow.
[50:18.520 --> 50:20.520]  I'm stunned.
[50:20.520 --> 50:24.520]  And they buy all of it.
[50:24.520 --> 50:28.520]  They're never going to give it up.
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.520]  I just don't know what you do.
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.520]  What do you do for someone that's that brainwashed?
[50:36.520 --> 50:45.520]  What do you do with someone that's that deceived?
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.520]  I'm taking it back right now.
[50:49.520 --> 50:57.520]  I'm honestly taking it back at the level of deception we're dealing with here, and this is honestly low level crap, but that's why it's so frustrating.
[50:57.520 --> 51:10.520]  Because this is like the most low IQ level of deception, like, you know, slapstick comedy or something like a poop joke, and people are falling for it.
[51:10.520 --> 51:18.520]  Like, I can understand, like, high level deception, 9-11, Golf of Tonkin, JFK assassination, go down the list.
[51:18.520 --> 51:24.520]  This is like poop joke level IQ deception.
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.520]  And it's all right in front of us, all of it.
[51:28.520 --> 51:32.520]  But you know what, go back to that clip because you wouldn't know why.
[51:32.520 --> 51:43.520]  Because look at the people in the background of that image. You can just tell the brainwaves are flatlining.
[51:43.520 --> 51:54.520]  And they're just dragging us down into the depths of society with them.
[51:54.520 --> 52:03.520]  It's just unbelievable that people can be so deceived by the most low level deception I've ever seen in my life.
[52:03.520 --> 52:09.520]  All right, you know what? I bet they can't even believe it at this point.
[52:09.520 --> 52:17.520]  I bet they can't even believe people still can't see their blatant deception. It's not even difficult to see.
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.520]  All right, I'm just going to open up the phone lines.
[52:21.520 --> 52:28.520]  Let's get your take on this. 1-877-789-ALIX, 1-877-789-ALIX.
[52:28.520 --> 52:38.520]  By the way, I'm Owen Troyer, filling in for Alex Jones today on this important broadcast, and I'm just stunned right now.
[52:38.520 --> 52:50.520]  And I've got all kinds of other news that's very important that I need to get to, but I'm just, like, knocked off my feet at the level of delusion.
[52:50.520 --> 53:00.520]  In fact, I want to go back. Can we go back to that phone call one more time before we go to callers, guys? Do we have that queued up?
[53:00.520 --> 53:05.520]  Yeah, I want the audience to hear this one more time.
[53:05.520 --> 53:09.520]  This is the level of deception that we're dealing with in this country.
[53:09.520 --> 53:15.520]  And again, I can only apply what we know is going on.
[53:15.520 --> 53:24.520]  The CIA embeds people in the media. That came out during the church hearings. That came out of the declassified JFK files.
[53:24.520 --> 53:34.520]  Governments test with light patterns and flicker rates and everything on monkeys to see what flicker rates make humans the most susceptible.
[53:34.520 --> 53:37.520]  You combine those two, what do you get?
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.520]  An entire group of people that believe in Russian collusion.
[53:41.520 --> 53:45.520]  Even after two years of an investigation and no collusion found.
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.520]  Millions of dollars spent basically a public proctology exam of the president.
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.520]  Just unbelievable. And they get nothing and they tell you they still have something while they give you nothing.
[53:57.520 --> 54:03.520]  And then look and listen to the average Democrat voter. This is a call into C-span.
[54:03.520 --> 54:08.520]  Again, I play this because I want to take callers here and let's notice the difference.
[54:08.520 --> 54:20.520]  But just again, I am stunned that people can be so deceived by such low IQ deception like a poop joke from a comedian.
[54:20.520 --> 54:31.520]  But listen to this Democrat call or into C-span right after the Mueller statement and see how lost and gone and brainwashed these people are.
[54:31.520 --> 54:38.520]  Get to those. We'd love to hear from you and we'll go first to our Democrats line to hear from Diana Livingston, New Jersey.
[54:38.520 --> 54:43.520]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[54:43.520 --> 54:54.520]  Hi, good morning. I hope that now that Mueller has formally resigned from the Department of Justice that he will be allowed to testify publicly.
[54:54.520 --> 55:01.520]  Now pause it again. I just got to break it down again. It's like they don't even listen to their own people. She didn't even listen to what Mueller said.
[55:01.520 --> 55:07.520]  Mueller literally said, he already said, lady, you didn't even listen. You didn't even listen. Maybe that's what it is.
[55:07.520 --> 55:11.520]  They don't want to listen. They already have their minds decided. You didn't even listen.
[55:11.520 --> 55:20.520]  Mueller said in his statement, he's not testifying. He said he's not commenting further. You didn't even listen.
[55:20.520 --> 55:25.520]  You didn't even listen. Go back.
[55:25.520 --> 55:34.520]  The issue involves our election security, which this Trump administration and GLP Congress has failed to pass any bills.
[55:34.520 --> 55:41.520]  Again, pause it. All of this happened during the Obama administration. It was brought to Obama's desk. It was brought to his attention.
[55:41.520 --> 55:46.520]  He chose to do nothing. That was national news. New York Times. Washington Post.
[55:46.520 --> 55:58.520]  Again, you're projecting everything Obama did onto Trump. You have been deceived, lady. You are a victim of CIA MK ultra mind control.
[55:58.520 --> 56:07.520]  We want to free you from the MK ultra mind control. Do you understand? We are throwing you a life vest. We are throwing you a tube.
[56:07.520 --> 56:14.520]  Come back to reality. Shake the shackles of the MK ultra mind control. Go back.
[56:14.520 --> 56:23.520]  Directives to our intelligence agencies to protect our elections. That's a main concern of our, of me. I'm a Democrat. That's a main concern.
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.520]  Yes, with all the illegal votes coming in. I'm sure.
[56:25.520 --> 56:33.520]  They're trying to dismiss this whole thing as a big hoax. And they mean not the hoax of Russia. They're trying to admit that Russia doesn't exist.
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.520]  But that the Trump administration had nothing to do with it or were in eager to accept help.
[56:38.520 --> 56:44.520]  And even though it wasn't, you know, and this needs to be explained to the people, the difference between a criminal.
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.520]  Here, pause it right here. Pause it right here and rewind at 15 seconds. Now look, we broke down the insanity of this lady.
[56:49.520 --> 56:55.520]  But just listen to the final six seconds. This is the state of a Democrat mind right now. This is the state of a Democrat voter's mind.
[56:55.520 --> 57:01.520]  Listen to the just nothings, the ramblings, just like a drunken fool.
[57:01.520 --> 57:08.520]  It was they interfered, but that the Trump administration had nothing to do with it or were in eager to accept help.
[57:08.520 --> 57:16.520]  And even though it wasn't, you know, and this needs to be explained to the people, the difference between a criminal prosecution and
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.520]  immoral acts that don't meet the, the level of, of proving the crime.
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.520]  We see a lot of innocent people get because of the state can't prove a crime, get let go.
[57:27.520 --> 57:40.520]  That doesn't mean that the Congress and the American people shouldn't review what Mueller had in the report that dealt with campaigns receiving help from foreign.
[57:40.520 --> 58:08.520]  You want to know what an MK ultra mind control victim sounds like folks? You just heard it right there.
[58:08.520 --> 58:33.520]  You want to know what an MK ultra mind control victim sounds like folks? You just heard it right there.
[58:33.520 --> 58:48.520]  You want to know what an MK ultra mind control victim sounds like folks?
[58:48.520 --> 59:04.520]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[59:04.520 --> 59:07.520]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[59:07.520 --> 59:19.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:19.520 --> 59:27.520]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:27.520 --> 59:37.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[59:37.520 --> 59:44.520]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:44.520 --> 1:00:05.520]  Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:14.520]  All right, the phone lines are lighting up right now. We're going to take your calls coming up shortly.
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:31.520]  There is other news to get to. I'm just saddened that my fellow Americans can't see a clear deception campaign going on right in front of their face.
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:46.520]  And they just eat it like a fish bites a fake worm on the lure. Just to get sucked up onto the deck, flop around. An intellectual suffocation.
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  This is the Alex Jones show. I want Troy filling in for Alex today. Democrats are already calling for the impeachment of president after Mueller's statement.
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:09.520]  So the Democrats for 2020 are campaigning on two issues now. One issue, Orange Man Bad. Second issue, abort the babies.
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:25.520]  So real strong, real strong campaign agenda for the Democrats in 2020. Orange Man Bad abort the babies.
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:35.520]  I guess maybe throw in higher taxes. I guess they like higher taxes too.
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:41.520]  So just to highlight what we've been over before we take your phone calls here.
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:55.520]  Mueller comes out in a short statement, insinuates WikiLeaks, Trump and Russia are working together to hack Hillary Clinton and interfere in US elections.
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:03.520]  They offer zero proof. They never interviewed or questioned Assange. They offer no evidence.
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:16.520]  Then goes on to insinuate that if the law wasn't constructed in such a way they would have charged Donald Trump, President Trump with a crime, but they couldn't.
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:35.520]  And Democrats are now across the board once again calling for impeachment in what has clearly been a contrived deception of the American people.
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:47.520]  So they're going to try to impeach the president for what? They don't know. None of them know.
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:55.520]  But the CIA Mockingbird Press and the Democrat Party said it's a good thing.
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:18.520]  So therefore it is. Total mind control is what it is. But they're about to have a rude awakening.
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  You know, if things go the way that they have for my entire life in this Congress and this government, there'll never be any justice.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  We'll never see the light of day about the origins of the illegal spying or anything else.
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:44.520]  But if Trump is the real deal and he actually wants to be the president of the United States and he actually wants to do something for this country and he actually wants to drain the swamp, it'll all come out.
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:51.520]  And hopefully maybe then the deception, the lines of deception can begin to reveal themselves.
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  But until that day, it's clear that's not going to be the case.
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:06.520]  But they're going to be in for a rude awakening even of their own accord because they still think Mueller is going to testify before Congress.
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:14.520]  He's already said he's not. So how's that going to go?
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:20.520]  So we're going to take your calls on the other side of this break to discuss all of it.
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:28.520]  I do have other news to get to. I'm just stunned at the level of deception I'm seeing.
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:37.520]  And it's just amazing because the Democrat, the average Democrat voter, it's like nothing goes in.
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:41.520]  I don't understand how they can be this deceived at this point. I really don't.
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:49.520]  Whether you like Trump or not, you could still hate Trump with all your guts. There's no damn Russian collusion.
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:59.520]  But you just have to cling on to that. You just have to cling on to it because that's the programming.
[1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:02.520]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike.
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:07.520]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:12.520]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:17.520]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  It tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:28.520]  It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. Like, good.
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:34.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride three toothpaste.
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:40.520]  I've used the, uh, super male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:43.520]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to keep me on air. I'm thanking you.
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:49.520]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the two bone broth.
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:51.520]  It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.
[1:05:51.520 --> 1:06:17.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:33.520]  Nothing like info wars. Nothing like info wars.
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:36.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Oh, and Troy, you're filling in for Alex Jones.
[1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:43.520]  We're about to take your calls here in response to Mueller statement and everything that's followed in the short time afterwards.
[1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:52.520]  It's been quite explosive. Before we do that, though, you know, I actually need.
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:58.520]  I actually need to go to info wars store.com because I'm running out of some of my favorite supplements right now.
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  So I may have to place an order here live on air, but I got to get myself some extend the wise.
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:11.520]  I've run out of extend the wise and I've run out of bio PCA, both from four store.com both on sale.
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:16.520]  The extend the wise is 60% off. Here's the amazing thing about extend the wise.
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:21.520]  There's all different kinds of oil, you know, supplements out there.
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  We've got great ones. We've got the krill oil. We've got the fish oil.
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:35.520]  I've both in my pantry. I even actually have the kids on a roll with just the DHA because there are different health benefits to just DHA and not the.
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:45.520]  So the EPA, I think is the other one, the two oils that come in that. But the extend the wise has the fish oil, the coq 10 and the garlic.
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:52.520]  And there have been a lot of studies done on garlic with the positive effects on the immune system and other such things.
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:08:01.520]  So the extend the wise is just an incredible fish oil supplement with coq 10 and garlic that has so many different benefits.
[1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:07.520]  60% off. We barely even talk about this. I love this product. I take it every morning.
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  In fact, I used to fish oil in the morning. Now I just do the extend the wise and then I do the fish oils at night.
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:19.520]  But we don't even really promote some of our best products like extend the wise.
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:25.520]  But I do extend the wise every morning. It's 60% off right now. Just read all the five star reviews for yourself.
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:32.520]  I mean, this is the type of product. I mean, yeah, we have the best krill oil at info store.com. We have the best fish oil at info store.com.
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:38.520]  We just put out the best because that's, you know, the market is fish oil, krill oil.
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:44.520]  But we made extend the wise like that's a totally unique supplement in and of itself.
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  And we never even talk about it. And it's awesome for so many different reasons.

[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:09.520]  50% off bodies. Incredible supplement. 50% off super male vitality. I love how Tom Papert said it from big league politics who host the fourth hour here sometimes.
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:17.520]  He didn't realize how much time was in the day until he started taking super male vitality and he could actually seize the day.
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:24.520]  Carpe diem with super male vitality. The protein bars. People love our protein bars.
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:33.520]  I like the peanut butter chocolate ones personally. It tastes like a double fudge brownie with peanuts inside of it and a peanut butter coating.
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:39.520]  Try it for yourself if you don't believe me. That's what it tastes like. The survival shield x2.
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:46.520]  The nascent iodine in survival shield x2 is a life changing product. That's not a joke.
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:51.520]  Read the reviews for yourself. Give it a try. It's on sale at infowarstore.com.

[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:40.520]  So thank you for your support. Okay. The lines are lit up and people are responding to the Mueller statement.
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:46.520]  So let's start with Jose in North Carolina. Go ahead, Jose.
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  Good afternoon. First time caller. I just wanted to honestly, I'm just commenting on things that yourself and others have said concerning just at least the same behavior of people lately.
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:21.520]  The mind control that's going on, I mean, it's so unfortunate concerning, you know, they're snorting the water, there's flicker rate going on with their favorite device, you know, TV, their cell phone and whatnot.
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:30.520]  And then there's the constant repetition from the devices that, you know, whatever their so-called use sources are.
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:40.520]  It's rather sad, at least from my perception that it seems like they don't have a chance because they're stuck in a bad habit.
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:47.520]  So it's like, oh, I see what you're saying. So you're like, you're stuck in a loop and you can't get off the track.
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:12:08.520]  Exactly. Exactly. And they're stuck in it. It's unfortunate. Like my neighbors, for example, it'll take them a while for them to even try, you know, filtering their own water and, you know, super blue, you know, fluoride free toothpaste, for example.
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:30.520]  You know, just at least that. But where I'm coming from has to do with the science of this and also the spiritual side of this, because it seems like my personal friends who know better and have better, I'll say, life habits.
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:45.520]  We seem to have a certain immunity to, you know, the GMO and the poisons in the general environment. Now that's a blanket statement, but it seems to be true here.
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  No, that's like the old, there's like an episode of Futurama where these brainwaves are brainwashing the whole earth except fry because he's from a different century.
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  So he has different frequencies of the brain and he's able to save the earth, even though he's like the dumbest person.
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:14.520]  Yeah, yeah. But, you know, but that right there, it's been a pop culture reference. That's honestly what got me curious and what led me to checking out in force years ago.
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:30.520]  Just being curious about, you know, all this sci fi stuff and turns out to be real. My my big wake up moment and the personal story, I haven't been back it up. No, but I'll just go ahead and say it.
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:44.520]  I was basically recruited into the military with GI Joe cartoons back in the day. And I ended up working for the US Air Force 70 first rescue squadron. I was the supply manager.
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:14:03.520]  So I had access to what back then was called the standard base supply system. And I had a moment I was working the graveyard ship. And I looked up the this particular action figure that was one of my favorite ones to hit.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:19.520]  The code name of the figure was like out and he was the deceptive warfare specialist. I thought that figure was cool because with this particular equipment, according to the fake dossier in the back of the action figure,
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:37.520]  I convinced the enemy to basically give up, which appealed to me back then, you know, one of the good guys and that's what good guys do. But then years later, I'm I just happened deceptive warfare equipment on the supply system and boom, it's an actual thing.
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:50.520]  Now, anyone would access to the Internet that can, you know, go to a dot mill or dot does by or, you know, look up whatever DARPA is working on and they can find these these kinds of.
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:59.520]  Well, and let's not even forget there was a there was a leaked document that showed governments were testing with cell phone frequencies on how to control people's minds.
[1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  There have been other things that have been leaked. So there was the document silent weapons for quiet wars. So it's out there.
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  It is. It totally is. It's right there at everyone's fingertips. All they have to do is tap on it kind of like, but that's it.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:24.520]  But it comes back to what you said at the outset, Jose, these people are stuck in a loop. And so they can't get outside of that loop.
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:31.520]  And that's why it's so frustrating. Great call, Jose, North Carolina. Great first time caller. Amazing.
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:38.520]  That's what's so amazing about this is that it should be an event like this that shakes you out of that loop.
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  Because I mean, I have friends that are liberals. I have friends that vote Democrat. They don't. They never believed any of this Russian inclusion stuff.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.520]  How can somebody believe this garbage? Hey, Trump, all you want. Think he's the worst thing in the world.
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:54.520]  Don't buy into the CIA propaganda.
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:24.520]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:30.520]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:38.520]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:24.520]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:51.520]  800-506-6740.
[1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:56.520]  That's 800-506-6740.
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:09.520]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:18.520]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:22.520]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:29.520]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:31.520]  And you may be experiencing back up too.
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:37.520]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowarstore.com and get oxy-powdered.
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:40.520]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:50.520]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some back up of your own, oxy-powder from infowarstore.com will clear it out guaranteed.
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:19:08.520]  So go to infowarstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with oxy-powder.
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:36.520]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:50.520]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:54.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:20:08.520]  X3, now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  I guess what upsets me is how even the average consumer of news, but you know what, it really is happening.
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:48.520]  But the average consumer of news just watching everything going on and just kind of scratching their heads like, huh?
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:52.520]  What? They're doing what? They said what?
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:58.520]  Calling for impeachment and what? Russian inclusion still?
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:05.520]  So, I mean, this helps Trump in 2020, but I guess they think they can impeach him before that, maybe?
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:11.520]  It's all out of control. We're taking your calls on the situation. Remember, please support us at infowarstore.com.
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:26.520]  We have massive MAGA Memorial Day specials happening right now, including 60% off some supplements at infowarstore.com, so please support us at infowarstore.com today to keep us on air tomorrow.
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:33.520]  And we're taking your calls right now on the Mueller statement and what has followed in the short period of time since.
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:41.520]  And Jeremy in California disagrees with me. I'm not sure on what it just says disagree on the board, so we'll find out. Jeremy in California, go ahead.
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:46.520]  Hey, dude. Well, before I trigger you, let me explain to you why I disagree with you.
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:52.520]  First of all, I don't believe there was any collusion. I think I don't believe that narrative at all.
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:22:00.520]  I definitely think that WikiLeaks was fed their sourcing from probably somebody from the inside. So that's the track I'm on.
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:11.520]  However, with regard to obstruction, unfortunately, President Trump may have ensnared himself because he couldn't control himself.
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:23.520]  And I think before you just say, hey, this is some big CIA hoax, you realize that obstruction of justice, there doesn't have to be a crime that's proven that just protecting yourself.
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:36.520]  If you interfere with an investigation, you could put yourself into jeopardy. So if we step back for a second and say, well, if this was President Obama in the same situation, okay, he didn't collude.
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:40.520]  But he certainly tried to block things. We'd be freaking out.
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:44.520]  But what did Trump do to try to block anything?
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:50.520]  He got involved, the admittance to firing Comey, the admittance or not the admittance.
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:58.520]  That was a recommendation of Rosenstein. Right. But documented, but he was vocal about it and he said why he did it, man. That's the problem.
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:02.520]  But the Democrats were calling for the firing of Comey before that even happened.
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:14.520]  Right. But still, the point is, is Trump gave his justification as to why it happened. The conduct involving Cohen, you know, and getting involved there.
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:18.520]  What conduct with Cohen? What conduct with Cohen?
[1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:22.520]  Dude, inferring pardons, all these various different types of things.
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:24.520]  Inferring pardons. What are you talking about?
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:34.520]  If you start to look into, you know, poke around in volume two of the Mueller report, you're going to find some stuff there that doesn't, isn't favorable to president.
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:36.520]  And yes, even if you don't, if you don't.
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:42.520]  Okay, so, so Jeremy, so let's say that Trump made a misstep or whatever. Okay, so, so, so, but hold on now.
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:46.520]  But you agree the Russian collusion narrative is fake news, right?
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:54.520]  Totally. So, so you're okay then. So, so you're okay then with them starting something entirely phony, investing a ridiculous investigation that goes on.
[1:23:54.520 --> 1:24:00.520]  Trump has a crooked toenail somewhere, it stubs his toe, and so he should be impeached and removed and he's bad because of that.
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:09.520]  Right. Here's what I, here's my opinion on that is that Trump, unfortunately, he had every right to be angry and to throw a tantrum.
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.520]  The problem is, Owen, he threw what may be an illegal tantrum.
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:19.520]  And that's his problem. What? What did he do that's illegal?
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:24.520]  If he, listen, he, there doesn't have to be a crime to obstruct justice.
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:28.520]  That's what you need. You need to look into that. There doesn't need to be a crime.
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:36.520]  You can just be protecting yourself, but you're still obstructing information from flowing. This is the problem.
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:39.520]  And that's the problem. No, I'm sorry, but that's where you're wrong.
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.520]  You cannot obstruct justice when there is no crime present. That's literally impossible.
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  What you're talking about is process crimes here, Jeremy. That's a totally different thing.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:58.520]  I would ask you to reach out to Paul Craig Roberts or somebody like that who maybe has a little more insight than me who's just reading and really no legal expert.
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:00.520]  Dude, this is just my opinion.
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:05.520]  But you're not even giving a specific example. You're just saying Trump threw a temper tantrum.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:10.520]  I wish he would throw a temper tantrum. I'm sick of this. I'd throw them all in jail. We know what happened here.
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:15.520]  I'll give you. Okay. The termination of Comey, the appointment of a special counselor, a counsel.
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:21.520]  Again, you keep going to the termination of Comey. The Democrats called for it and it was a suggestion by Rosenstein.
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:25.520]  Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.520]  That never happened. That literally never happened. The exact opposite happened.
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:33.520]  He's about to declassify everything. He's already declassified the whole Mueller reports out there.
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:35.520]  So what information are they withholding?
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  And I agree, investigate the investigators.
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.520]  But in the meantime, if Trump may have thrown an illegal tantrum.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:47.520]  And that's the thing, man. He may have done this to himself.
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:52.520]  And that's the problem. If he did 50%-
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:59.520]  No, no, no, no. The problem is we have a corrupt deep state that set the president up, engage in a coup,
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  try to stop a duly elected man from getting an office. That's the problem.
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:08.520]  If Donald Trump stubs his toe in the midst of this ridiculous investigation, that's not the problem.
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:15.520]  So that's where we disagree, Jeremy. Great call, though. Let's go to Lydia in Indiana. Go ahead, Lydia.
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:23.520]  Hi. I first want to say that I'm a first-time caller and I also started taking your iodine drops.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:29.520]  And because I have problems with my thyroid and my nails and some other areas that deal with thyroid, we're already getting better.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  So thank you for that product.
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  But as to my comment, hearing what Mueller has said, now I kind of understand why Pelosi started saying that the president is in a cover-up.
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:47.520]  I think those two go hand in hand.
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:55.520]  And it just irritates me that people keep going back to President Obama,
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:02.520]  but certain actions, like certain actions occur that had nothing to do with it, that still need to be looked into,
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:11.520]  like the false Pfizer warrants, the Steele dossier, Hillary's private server, none of that had anything to do with...
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:17.520]  Oh, yeah. And by the way, Lydia, with the Christopher Steele not cooperating, there's about to be more coming out with that.
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:24.520]  This wasn't just a domestic spy operation. This wasn't just a domestic coup. This was an international coup against Donald Trump.
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:32.520]  Yeah, looking at everything that's going on in Europe, I can understand what you're saying there. Yeah.
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:36.520]  I mean, it's all going to come out. I mean, you had multiple...
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:41.520]  I mean, they already admit Russian intelligence was involved. Who knows what their role was, really?
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:47.520]  You had MI6 involved, Australian spy. I mean, it's out of control.
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  And the Joe Biden stuff and his son now with the Ukraine, again, nothing to do with Trump.
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:01.520]  But hey, if Trump's having a cover-up, then they can put everything else under the rug underneath that to hear what Mueller said today.
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:04.520]  It just makes me mad.
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:11.520]  Well, I think that a lot of people are going to be mad on both sides of the aisle, because Mueller, he's not going to deliver what the Democrats want.
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:18.520]  He can't. There's nothing there. He's not going to give a testimony before Congress because he knows that'll just blow up in his face and embarrass him.
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:22.520]  So both sides are going to be upset by this.
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  Again, though, I'm just stunned. I'm just stunned that people can't see this. Anything else, Lydia?
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:31.520]  No.
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:38.520]  Well, thank you so much for shopping at infowarestore.com. I'm so glad to hear that the Survival Shield X2 worked for you, but that's why we put it out there.
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:49.520]  Yeah, there's actually a lot of thyroid problems in this country, and because of a lack of iodine, if you have a problem like that, go to infowarestore.com and get the Survival Shield X2 today.
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:29:16.520]  And you will notice the difference, as Lydia just said. We'll be right back with more of your calls.

[1:29:49.520 --> 1:30:05.520]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words.
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:12.520]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:23.520]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:28.520]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:38.520]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high-quality, metal-competitive, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:44.520]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[1:30:44.520 --> 1:31:08.520]  It is amazing. Experience pure, Methicabolum and B12 for yourself, and fund the Second American Evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:18.520]  That stood against the threats that have now changed the world.

[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:27.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:42.520]  Well, the hot topic is obviously Mueller's statements and the response to them.
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  People are already guessing Mueller's going to end up at MSNBC or CNN. Boy, wouldn't that be right in your face?
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:34:00.520]  And the left still wouldn't see it. And we're taking your calls, but I want to read the press statement from Sarah Sanders just released.
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:13.520]  The special counsel has completed the investigation, closed his office, and has closed the case. Mr. Miller explicitly said that he has nothing to add beyond the report and therefore does not plan to testify before Congress.
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:19.520]  The report was clear. There was no collusion, no conspiracy, and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction.
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  Special counsel Mueller also stated that Attorney General Barr acted in good faith in his handling of the report. After two years, the special counsel is moving on with his life and everyone else should do the same.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:38.520]  No, the Democrats are now getting ready for impeachment and the left is getting ready to protest for another year straight, claiming Russian collusion with no evidence.
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:45.520]  So, we go back to your phone calls. Let's go to Jesse calling in from Idaho. Go ahead, Jesse.
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:56.520]  Hey, Ellen, I just wanted to kind of touch on that C-SPAN caller that you played earlier on, you know, Mueller's report this morning.
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:05.520]  She's kind of like a poster child for the silencing that's been going on, the suppression of info wars and everybody else.
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:17.520]  She's exactly what they're trying to create by silencing everybody around us because if you had five minutes with someone like her, you could have her that passionate against her own party if she actually knew the truth.
[1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:25.520]  You know, it's an interesting thought, Jesse, because I've gone out to these events and I've tried to have the discussions with these people.
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:28.520]  I know the timing is obviously different now, but who knows?
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:34.520]  My guess is that lady's probably heard of info wars and things were the worst thing on earth because that's the propaganda that she...
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:41.520]  I don't doubt that. I mean, I've seen everyone in YouTube videos and they see how they, you know, they can take exactly what you say and don't even care.
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:47.520]  But I feel like she's definitely a poster child for, you know, they want to create more of her.
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  No, that's right. They want the sobering, just fumbling, bumbling, stumbling people out there to have no clue what's going on and somehow just believe whatever they are told to from whatever sources they're told to believe.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  And they'll see what they want, kind of like how she mentioned that, oh, Mueller, they'll stop Mueller from testifying.
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:15.520]  And when he specifically said that he doesn't want you, there's no point in it.
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:21.520]  Mueller could hold up a blue marker and say, this is a blue marker and every single one of them would be like, oh, no, that's black.
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:23.520]  He's trying to tell us something, you know?
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  Yeah, that's Trump confusing Mueller's color. Trump made Mueller colorblind, yeah.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:34.520]  Yeah, exactly. And then also one of your callers that called earlier, that was kind of disagreeing with you.
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  He kind of mentioned the firing of Comey.
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  The firing of Comey would only be obstruction of justice if Trump had committed a crime and he knew Comey was going to expose his crimes.
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:50.520]  So therefore Trump fired him to keep that from being exposed.
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:55.520]  But there's no crime to begin with for him to try and, you know, hide it.
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:01.520]  Yeah, plus it was a recommendation for Trump to fire Comey that he took.
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:05.520]  The Democrats wanted him fired before that even anyway.
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:11.520]  So it's just these, it's just like a three card money shell game that the Democrats are trying to play right now.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:14.520]  Thanks for the call, Jesse. Let's go to Philip calling in from Arizona.
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:16.520]  Go ahead, Philip.
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:25.520]  Oh, hey, I just wanted to talk about something I had seen watching C-Span right before the Mueller came out.
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:31.520]  And they had just turned the cameras on, turned the mics on, and there were two women sitting in the front row.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:37.520]  And they started laughing and they had to be warned that they were on a hot mic.
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:48.520]  And when they found that out, man, they were just, they were pretty shocked to say the least both physically and verbally.
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:57.520]  So it just kind of goes to say, you know, why do reporters need to be warned of a hot mic before they can act with a little integrity?
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:00.520]  And then, you know, I wonder what they said.
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  Are they, you know, colluding with each other? Is it conspiracy through the media?
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:09.520]  You know, I actually didn't see what you're talking about.
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:14.520]  My guess is it's probably just a couple of journos just gossiping.
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:19.520]  Well, they seem pretty, they seem pretty shocked when they found out they were on a hot mic.
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:25.520]  Well, you'd be pretty shocked what journos in DC gossip about.
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:33.520]  Well, I just thought if you guys could find that and see what they said, you know, I went back to look at it and it was live video.
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:34.520]  I couldn't rewind it.
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:35.520]  Was it on C-Span?
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:38.520]  You said just where they earned the Mueller statement.
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:41.520]  Yeah, but going back to C-Span, they started right at Mueller.
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:44.520]  They don't start it 10 minutes before.
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:45.520]  All right.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.520]  Well, we'll have the crew investigate, see if they can find that.
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:49.520]  Thanks for the call, Phillip.
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:56.520]  Let's squeeze in Jeff here from Canada on the caller to go ahead, Jeff.
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:58.520]  Hey, Owen.
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:38:59.520]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.520]  You know, the Bible says, let the word of God be confirmed in the mouth of two or three witnesses.
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:09.520]  And this lady from Livingston, New Jersey, I think is total BS.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:20.520]  I think she's just put in there to trumpet the exact narrative that we're going to hear about for the next six months to a year to a year and a half.
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:23.520]  There's no doubt C-Span stages callers.
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:33.520]  And in fact, I kind of thought that the Republican callers after that were staged, but there's no doubt C-Span stages callers or maybe not even C-Span, but the Democrat Party getting into C-Span.
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  I don't know.
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:38.520]  I mean, because I can usually tell, I think you can usually tell when that's the case.
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:39.520]  I think that woman was genuine.
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:44.520]  She didn't really have a strong narrative or talking points.
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:47.520]  And by the end of the call, she was just a bumbling idiot.
[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  Usually when they stage a call like that, they have their bullet points ready to go and they sound not so dumb.
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:57.520]  But there's no doubt C-Span.
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:02.520]  Again, I don't know if it's C-Span, but the Democrat stages calls into C-Span.
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt if it was staged with everything else that happens.
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:10.520]  I mean, Mueller's deep state, the media's deep state.
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:16.520]  And now to get a third person just out there at the beginning to get the talking points out, I could see it.
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:23.520]  If it wasn't, you know, it's still sending the message to the brain dead people.
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  And it's just a giant fog machine.
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:26.520]  That's all it is.
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.520]  Well, if that's the best stage caller they can get.
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:33.520]  Wow, I guess that's where they're at these days.
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:34.520]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:36.520]  Let's go to Sebastian in Georgia.
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  Go ahead, Sebastian.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:40.520]  Hey, what's up?
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:42.520]  Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:44.520]  Thank you for calling.
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  I just, I like, I like bar AG bar more and more the more they attack them kind of the same way, Trump.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:58.520]  And I wonder if he's going to give a good juicy response to this Mueller statement.
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:01.520]  Nothing, nothing too juicy so far.
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:16.520]  And if the president is actually intending on draining the swamp and exposing the treason, then I could see why at this point he would be sitting on his hands waiting patiently.
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:17.520]  Well, I can't wait man.
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:22.520]  Couple weeks all here and all this stuff's going to be great.
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:27.520]  Well, if they get away with it, it won't be totally that.
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  People need to go to jail for this.
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:31.520]  Hell yeah, man.
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  Build the wall, the wall going up.
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:35.520]  I need a wall.
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:37.520]  No doubt about that with the invasion at the southern border.
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:38.520]  Thanks for the call, Sebastian.
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:47.520]  But let's just, let's just be clear before we go to break here.
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:57.520]  You had an active coup attempt to stop Donald Trump from getting elected.
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:13.520]  And then once the signs were he was going to get elected, the same people engaging in an active coup then decided to illegally spy on Trump and his campaign.
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  And again, it's like if you believe, if you go with the history repeat itself, then nothing will ever happen.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  But if you go with Trump is the real deal and not the typical politician, then maybe something will happen.
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:37.520]  But all we can do now is just read and react and wait.
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.520]  But get ready.
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:43.520]  The Democrats are about to go, they're about to go full board on impeachment.
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.520]  They're about to launch an investigation or a hundred into Trump after this.
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:53.520]  And the media is going to be right there parroting impeachment obstruction of justice the whole time.
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:43:21.520]  That's what's coming next.
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:26.520]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now.
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:31.520]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:35.520]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:41.520]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:51.520]  Call and talk radio, c span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:57.520]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:05.520]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:19.520]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com.
[1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:25.520]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President, we need your help.
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:29.520]  We need it now. You can take on big tech.
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:38.520]  We saw info wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:46.520]  So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:52.520]  The way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:58.520]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.

[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:15.520]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things it's associated with.
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:17.520]  And then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:22.520]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup that was sick.
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:29.520]  But then you add not just the fact this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.

[1:46:50.520 --> 1:47:08.520]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:25.520]  It's amazing we've reached this point.
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:32.520]  State-run propaganda controlling the modern-day Nazi brown shirts.
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:46.520]  We're literally battling the equivalent of Joseph Gerberl's Nazi propaganda arm and the Nazi brown shirts that are about to get activated.
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:50.520]  That's what we're dealing with here. It's stunning.
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:53.520]  Wow, and you know what?
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:56.520]  This is why they censor infowars.
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:47:58.520]  This is why we're not allowed on YouTube today.
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:00.520]  This is why we're not allowed on Facebook today.
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:02.520]  This is why we're not allowed on Twitter today.
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  This is why we're not allowed to livestream on the biggest internet highways in the world because this narrative, this broadcast, this intelligence is not allowed to be out there.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  The average person is going on to YouTube right now searching Mueller report, Mueller statement.
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:30.520]  Normally, before the censorship, we would be number one up there, the biggest audience at this broadcast, and we'd be breaking the paradigm, shattering the false narratives.
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:34.520]  We were so successful they had to kick us off their platforms.
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:39.520]  So the bad news is the American people can't get the truth.
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:41.520]  People around the world can't get the truth.
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:43.520]  They cannot get this broadcast.
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:58.520]  The good news is we're still able to broadcast and put this information out there that hopefully you re-amplify and re-upload so that the people can get it because if you're supported at infowarsstore.com.

[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:11.520]  This is why we got kicked off of YouTube folks.
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:19.520]  They don't want us on there today when everyone's going on to YouTube to see the response to the Mueller statement to see what happened really with the Mueller statement.
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:20.520]  We used to dominate.
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.520]  That's how we got Trump over the hump.
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:25.520]  That's why they cut our knees out from under us.
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:31.520]  But your support at infowarsstore.com allows us to exist still.
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  All right.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:36.520]  Let's go back out to the phone lines again the hot topic obviously the Mueller statement everything that's following.
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.520]  Let's go to Brandon in Texas.
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:40.520]  Go ahead Brandon.
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:43.520]  Go and thanks a bunch for taking my call man.
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  I was out at the Planned Parenthood rally with you guys on Sunday was awesome.
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:48.520]  Very cool.
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:51.520]  Just a really quick plug X3.
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:52.520]  Okay.
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:57.520]  I know we don't hear a lot about X3 the tri iodine for my daughter who's in third grade.
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:13.520]  I started giving that and the honor roll fish oil to her about six months ago and for the first time ever third grade she had a 1.5 improvement in reading and she got on the A B honor roll as a third grader first time ever.
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:18.520]  So I you know the study to the research has been done over here that stuff obviously does something.
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.520]  So thank you guys for that.
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:22.520]  Thanks Brandon.
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  Oh I love it.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:35.520]  So what I have what I want to talk to you about Owen is just really two part the first part is with Mueller's appearance public appearance here is just fodder right for for the machine.
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:48.520]  It's just more breadcrumbs so they can drag this narrative on and if you're exactly right and that's why I made the statement at the outset saying you know I realize that this is all smoke and mirrors and a distraction.
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:54.520]  But at the same time it's important to expose the false narrative and what they're trying to do right now.
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:55.520]  Right.
[1:52:55.520 --> 1:53:08.520]  And what more importantly let's expose that if Mueller thinks he's just going to slither off into the private sector without having to answer for his his his Epstein and Lord knows who else he's been covering up for and the content of the WikiLeaks.
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:09.520]  Let's face it.
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:13.520]  What it's cryptographically verified that it's still online.
[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:19.520]  Let's talk about what's in there is still more breadcrumbs leading us lemmings off the cliff.
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:29.520]  And how is it that Mueller again this guy's Oh what a great investigation all the documents millions of documents millions of dollars not once did he contact Julian Assange.
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:41.520]  How are you going to claim that you know for a fact WikiLeaks is coordinating with Russia and Trump when you've never even talked to WikiLeaks at least they never published it if they did they never said it.
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:43.520]  Assange said he was never contacted.
[1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:48.520]  So how can they make these statements about WikiLeaks with no evidence and no questioning of Assange.
[1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:52.520]  Well they don't want to open up that can of worms because WikiLeaks is bulletproof.
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:54:00.520]  Those are cryptically cryptographically verified sources and it would be a good time for Trump to get on the side of Julian Assange.
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:05.520]  He wants to mention WikiLeaks early in his campaign but now he wants to just be like oh I don't you know.
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:13.520]  Oh my gosh oh my gosh and oh I just realized it too. That's another level of the deception here.
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:15.520]  It's kind of like what they did with Trump and Putin.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:25.520]  They want to create that wedge in between Trump and Assange so that Trump is afraid to do the right thing with Assange because the media will say oh see this is proof of collusion.
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  Wow.
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:29.520]  Wow I hope Trump doesn't fall for that.
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:35.520]  Real quick the second part of what I wanted to say was how this is able to continue.
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:42.520]  You see when we were at the Planned Parenthood on Sunday I started talking about Hillary and how these things come from the top down and the collective consciousness right.
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:51.520]  Well these leftists can you know they get their I don't know if you were friends with any lefties but they're on their phone even more than conservatives like 24 seven and why.
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:58.520]  Because that little dopamine injection that comes from their little validation of their feelings about the orange man right.
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:04.520]  They're like and so this news is just it's sick and it's all happening.
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:10.520]  The conduit is the devices and the social media and the platform.
[1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:17.520]  Well and look nobody holds CNN accountable for all the fake news that they put out there.
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:18.520]  Nobody bans them.
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  Nobody calls for them to be censored.
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:21.520]  They win awards for it.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  So that's just the clown world that we live in Brandon thanks for the call and thanks for coming out Sunday and supporting us at info store dot com.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:29.520]  Let's go to Burke in Kansas.
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  Go ahead Burke.
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:37.520]  Yeah I think so and I think Miller's just going to disappear.
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:38.520]  I really do.
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:41.520]  I think we're not going to hear anymore out of him.
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:44.520]  He's got his own head on the chopping block.
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:49.520]  That man's not going to say anymore about anything he's done.
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:53.520]  And as far as this lady that called in to C-span being loopy.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:55.520]  You know I get it.
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:56:08.520]  I can see you know she gets she's fixated on something and she gets you know you do that's loopy use the great word there because you do you get fixated on something and you get loopy about it.
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.520]  I'm loopy about the wall.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:11.520]  I really am.
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:13.520]  It's it's crazy.
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:17.520]  His term is running out and we're getting nowhere.
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:23.520]  It's getting real bad and I'm loopy about that.
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:25.520]  Well let's talk about that.
[1:56:25.520 --> 1:56:28.520]  We've got 60 seconds left here.
[1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:33.520]  Do you think that if Trump doesn't build a wall he can't win 2020.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:35.520]  Oh man.
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:37.520]  Does he still have your vote.
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  I think he's going to win but I don't think I'm going to vote for him if he doesn't get something going.
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:44.520]  I'm not going to vote period.
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:56.520]  He's going to lose my vote because I really thought he was going to be the man to do it because there's three kinds of people out there and in Trump is one of them.
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:56:58.520]  You make things happen.
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:03.520]  You wait for things to happen or you say what happened.
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:13.520]  Well I almost think that Trump should like troll them hardcore and somehow set up some deal for wall construction and contract through Trump International.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:15.520]  I mean that would be the funniest thing ever.
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  I wouldn't even be mad.
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:17.520]  I wouldn't even care.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:20.520]  I'd watch the media go into hysteria just build the damn wall.
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:26.520]  We have an invasion at the southern border so now people have to build the wall privately to protect their communities.
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:33.520]  But you know again that's why we're free market capitalists here because the private sector always works better than the public sector anyway.
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:38.520]  And so there's just more proof of that with a wall going up in New Mexico but we can't get a wall from our government.
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.520]  And look it's not even all Trump's fault.
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:43.520]  I mean he's got judges blocking him. Congress is blocking him.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:46.520]  The Democrats apparently want wide open borders.
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:49.520]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:52.520]  That what God gave us from other nature is incredible.
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:57.520]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are so upset.
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.520]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.

[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:24.520]  All right, well, I've just received bad news here.
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:30.520]  I mean, man, look.
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:42.520]  We've had a corrupt government here that's gotten away with a lot of crimes, folks.
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.520]  A lot of crimes.
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  A lot of them have been exposed, but you've never had anybody willing to prosecute.
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.520]  And we thought things would be different under Trump.
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  We still have our fingers crossed that they would.
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:01:02.520]  But this is a sign that they're not.
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:07.520]  This was just released from the Justice Department.
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:19.520]  Findings of misconduct by an FBI deputy assistant director for unauthorized contact with the media disclosing law enforcement and other sensitive information to the media and accepting a gift from the media.
[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:32.520]  The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation alleging that then FBI Deputy Assistant Director had numerous contacts with members of the media in violation of FBI policy.
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:34.520]  That's McCabe.
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:41.520]  Additionally, it was alleged that the DAD may have disclosed law enforcement or other sensitive information to the media without authorization.
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:56.520]  This matter is among the OIG investigations referenced on page 430 of the OIG's review of the allegations regarding various actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in advance of the 2016 election began in June 2018 before Trump was elected.
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:15.520]  The OIG investigation concluded that the DAD engaged in misconduct when the DAD disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal and federal court in violation of 18 U.S. Code subsection 401, contempt of court, provided without authorization, FBI law enforcement, sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions,
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:22.520]  and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization in violation of FBI policy.
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:36.520]  The OIG also found that the DAD engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225 to attend a media-sponsored dinner as a gift from a member of the media in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  Prosecution of the DAD was declined.
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:49.520]  The OIG has completed this investigation as providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action, which will be nothing.
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:52.520]  That's a kick in the nuts.
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:59.520]  So you have either McCabe or his assistants or whoever else was involved in this caught breaking the law.
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:02.520]  Meet right here.
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:14.520]  Three different violations and prosecution was declined, and now it's in the FBI's hands where nothing will happen.
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.520]  That's a bad sign.
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:22.520]  That is a bad sign.
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:31.520]  You know, I'm not wall-loopy like that last caller was talking about, but I'm just as loopy.
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:36.520]  If Assange is going to rot in a cell while Hillary Clinton walks free, Trump's a total failure.
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:38.520]  Sorry.
[2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:41.520]  He'll do great things for the economy. Obviously, the numbers are undeniable.
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.520]  He's done the great things for America's morale, great things for the military morale.
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:48.520]  There's no doubt Trump is one of the best presidents in modern history. That's already in the books.
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:55.520]  But if you have a situation when he leaves office, the Assange rots in a prison cell while Hillary Clinton walks free, he's a total failure.
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:04.520]  Because they'll reverse all of his economic stuff. They'll reverse all the trade deals. They'll reverse all the reverse regulation.
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:06.520]  They can reverse all that.
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:15.520]  If you don't put people in jail for the open treason that you know they committed President Trump, you will be derelict of your duty.
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:22.520]  And I understand you're one man against an entire system of corruption, but we elected you to be that man and we need you to be that man now.
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:32.520]  And if you have cowards that are not willing to put these people to justice, you need to get them out.
[2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:41.520]  These are the death throes before the 2020 election. They're coming for your head, President. They're coming to impeach you.
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:49.520]  They're coming to impeach you. You have all of them caught in open treason. Bring them in! Bring them in!
[2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:55.520]  Shut up the Democrats calling for impeachment by arresting the Democrat criminals!
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:05:02.520]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[2:05:02.520 --> 2:05:09.520]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:14.520]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:28.520]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.

[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:30.520]  You know, it's probably a pipe dream. But boy, oh boy, right now is the perfect time for the president to bring these people in.
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:43.520]  We steal all the wind from out the sales of the Mueller statement today by declassifying everything, exposing the illegal spying, naming the names, charging them with treason.
[2:06:43.520 --> 2:06:50.520]  Now it's literally the perfect time. You've got all the left drummed up, fired up right now over this total Russian collusion hoax.
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:57.520]  We all know it's fake. Steal all their energy, steal all their momentum, and hit them while they're as high as they could ever be.
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:03.520]  Bring them back down to earth. Now is the perfect time to bring these people in for treason.
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:18.520]  You have the evidence, President Trump. Do your job. Strike while the iron's hot. Destroy the morale of the deep state and their minions and the enemies of this country.
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:29.520]  Unfortunately, I doubt that's going to happen today. I hope it happens in the next year, but how could you help but doubt that too?
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:36.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most censored broadcast in the world.
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:52.520]  They can't have Info Wars injecting into YouTube and Twitter and Facebook live coverage of breaking news like this because we defeat the mainstream media propaganda.
[2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:54.520]  That's why they censor us.
[2:07:54.520 --> 2:07:59.520]  So all we have is infowars.com slash show.
[2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:01.520]  All we have is you.
[2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:05.520]  We don't have corporate sponsors. We don't have big ad buys. We're not allowed on Google ads.

[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:54.520]  Well, we've been taking your calls and I want to go back to your calls.
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:59.520]  There are some other news I could get to here, but this is the hot topic. People want to weigh in.
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:05.520]  And so we'll go back out to the phone lines. Let's go to Al calling in from Illinois. Go ahead, Al.
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:10.520]  Hey, what's going on there?
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:17.520]  I'm in Chicago, right outside Chicago in Cook County, and people don't really talk about it too much.
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:27.520]  They mainly focus on California and New York, but Chicago has probably one of the higher illegal immigrant populations out here.
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:33.520]  To the point where, I mean, the hospital wait lines are like five hours, five, eight hours.
[2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:38.520]  You got to drive out into middle of nowhere if you have like a kidney stone or a emergency or anything.
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:47.520]  By the way, there was also 42 people shot in Chicago over the Memorial Day weekend, a city with very strict gun laws.
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:53.520]  I love the city of Chicago. What a great place, but man, are the politics up there screwy.
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:11:01.520]  Oh, downtown is beautiful, but everything outside of it, though, you're pretty much in danger, especially at night.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:10.520]  But anyway, I did want to comment on the Mueller press conference or whatever that was.
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:16.520]  I really don't think Mueller knew what he was getting into when he signed up for this.
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:25.520]  And when he found out probably right away that it was all BS, he was basically stalling for time
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:33.520]  and trying to figure out how he was going to cover his ass at the end of it just to make sure that his legacy is okay.
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:37.520]  That's why he's saying he doesn't want to testify anymore. This is my final statement.
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  He just probably doesn't want to have his legacy be muddled up with.
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:56.520]  Well, I'd like to believe that, but he could have made references to that or insinuated that and he did nothing of the sort.
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  He did the exact opposite.
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.520]  Oh, I'm absolutely sure that he was in with the Democrats, too.
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:09.520]  But I'm not defending him at all. I'm just saying that I think that's what actually happened.
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:17.520]  And also, what I wanted to get into is where's Obama? He's been silent. He hasn't been saying anything.
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:23.520]  I believe it's just my opinion that he's behind the scene controlling all this.
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:27.520]  And Comey doesn't care that he's coming out and saying all this stuff. He knows it's false.
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:32.520]  Well, this is actually very complex. This is actually extremely complex.
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  There's no doubt previously Obama had been pulling a lot of strings and maybe even after he was out of office
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:46.520]  and continuing to do such things because he was pulling the strings from the beginning, making the calls.
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:54.520]  It reached a threshold. I couldn't even tell you a time, but it reached a threshold at some point where Obama could no longer do that.
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:58.520]  None of them could do that anymore because they knew they were being investigated.
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:03.520]  So they could no longer engage with those type of communications to get their stories straight.
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:08.520]  And that's why over time the stories have kind of, the web of lies has kind of been exposed.
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:14.520]  The silence from Obama is deafening. It really makes you wonder what he knew when he knew it.
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:22.520]  But I think right now their communications have been cut off and they really are not able to get a clear message out right now.
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:26.520]  And so that's why Obama is totally silent.
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:35.520]  Yeah, exactly. And I think also he's probably just maybe even promising like Comey and these people.
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:45.520]  If you notice that even on Fox News, the only people they talk about are these seven people at the top, but they're not talking about anything else.
[2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:52.520]  Trump's come out on tweets and says Obama knew and Hillary knew and all these other people knew.
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:14:03.520]  But even Hannity, who is the one that's bitching about this every night about, you know, the fake Russia collusion, he's only going over the five top people.
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:06.520]  And I think they're just going to throw these people under the bus.
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:12.520]  And I don't think anything is going to come out about Obama involvement or the Clinton involvement.
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:17.520]  Well, keep in mind too, you have no idea what Obama could be thinking about.
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:24.520]  I mean, Trump was such an unknown entity to these people, they really don't even know what was going to happen when he got in office.
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:32.520]  So you got to think too, Obama has eight years of crimes that he's got to cover up for now that he's realized Trump is getting in.
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:34.520]  He would have never had to do that without Hillary.
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:40.520]  So he's got to spy on Trump and he's got to engage in this coup because Trump's a non entity.
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:43.520]  They don't know if Trump going to come in and really look for this treason.
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:48.520]  Is Trump going to come in and declassify this stuff? Is he going to look into the Iran deal? Is he going to look into this? Is he going to look into that?
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:52.520]  So they're like hitting the panic button on all these different fronts.
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:14:57.520]  And we're just all focused on Russian collusion because that's the distraction that they decided to run with.
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:07.520]  But it really is amazing how Obama has managed to just say nothing throughout this and the media just allows him to be totally silent.
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  That's stunning to me because they're going to be so angry when they finally learn that Mueller's not going to testify before Congress.
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:19.520]  When are they going to start coming after Obama? When are they going to start looking at Obama for answers?
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:21.520]  When are they going to start looking at Obama for statements?
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  And Obama's sitting back, I think, totally foggy right now wondering what he can say without entrapping himself.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  Because you've already seen Brennan through Obama under the bus, Clapper through Obama under the bus.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:42.520]  It all started with Obama. All the illegal spying started with Obama.
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:49.520]  Now we'll start to get all the strings attached with the declassification of the FISA applications and warrants.
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:54.520]  But Obama knows he was at the top of it. They all know it. He's guilty.
[2:15:54.520 --> 2:16:00.520]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders. I've got to get some relief.
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:06.520]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.

[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:39.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the most censored broadcast in the world.
[2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:42.520]  If it wasn't for your support at InfowarsStore.com, we wouldn't even be on air here today.
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:47.520]  Please tell your friends and family about what's happening with us and the censorship.
[2:20:47.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  And please continue to support us at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:55.520]  Alex has some plans for the future here, but it's tough with the censorship.
[2:20:55.520 --> 2:21:03.520]  And that stops us from expanding our reach by not being able to get on YouTube and Facebook and all the super media highways.
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:06.520]  So we're just contracted here to Infowars.com.
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:11.520]  But thanks to your support, we manage and we remain steadfast.

[2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:34.520]  And we thank everybody that supports us at InfowarsStore.com for keeping us on air.
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:37.520]  All right, I'm just going to keep going down the phone calls. It's the hot topic.
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:40.520]  Everybody wants to talk about it. The lines are still lit up.
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:44.520]  I do have some other news to get to. Maybe I'll pepper it in at some point, but let's just stick to the phone lines.
[2:21:44.520 --> 2:21:50.520]  In fact, we've got a caller calling in from Ireland who wanted to comment on what we've been discussing today.
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:52.520]  Patrick calling in from Ireland. Go ahead.
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  How are you? How are you?
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:55.520]  Good. Thanks for calling.
[2:21:55.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  Can you hear me?
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:21:57.520]  Yep.
[2:21:57.520 --> 2:21:58.520]  Can you hear me?
[2:21:58.520 --> 2:21:59.520]  Yes.
[2:21:59.520 --> 2:22:05.520]  I just wanted to say here, Ireland right, we're with nothing but just Democrat news, nothing.
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:12.520]  So you really are lucky in America to have Infowars. I can only get it now a day late because YouTube will obviously block this.
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:16.520]  But I can get it still on YouTube, but it's a day lease.
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:18.520]  Can you hear me?
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:19.520]  Yep.
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  Just as regards, it's interesting here, right?
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:33.520]  The media here for about a year after Trump got elected, they did hatch a job after hatch a job.
[2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:38.520]  Every single day you switch channel from every one left the square to another.
[2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:45.520]  They were nonstop, constant lies, lies, lies, doing psychological analysis on him and everything.
[2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:47.520]  Having all these professors in constant.
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:54.520]  Now they've gone silent at the moment and there's not a dicky board out of them about Pelosi and Osteoglai Nagler collapsing.
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:22:59.520]  I just believe it's the total evil wrapping around them that's bringing them down.
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:05.520]  Not that everyone gets sick as evil, but in their case, I have no doubt about it.
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:14.520]  I'm looking in from the outside, your country, the thought that comes to my head is that a house divided cannot stand and you are divided.
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:20.520]  And I believe you will, you will go into civil war and it's going to be a bloodbath.
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:26.520]  But the deep state will trigger with some massive event like taking out your financial heart, maybe like New York.
[2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  Why?
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:31.520]  I believe God has left you because because of the abortion.
[2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:36.520]  You're no longer protected by God.
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:37.520]  Well, it's all interesting.
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:41.520]  There's no doubt that things are on a razor's edge right now.
[2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:43.520]  I hope we can avoid a civil war.
[2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:52.520]  I hope that we can stop murdering our children, you know, but we're clearly seeing what the Democrats are trying to do right now.
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:54.520]  They are trying to divide the house.
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:56.520]  They want it to fall.
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:24:00.520]  When I just look at every character and I just go, these are totally evil people.
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:01.520]  Who the hell votes for them?
[2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:02.520]  Just look at them.
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:04.520]  But then I see the same thing happening in my country.
[2:24:04.520 --> 2:24:12.520]  The same demons from hell presenting off to just hoodwink the Irish people into voting for murdering our children.
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:19.520]  And we've got to pay for us, you know, and we've been told if someone else comes in from outside, pay for their abortions as well.
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:27.520]  And meanwhile, they're stuffing in military aid hotels all over our country.
[2:24:27.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  Well, the good news is Europe is seeing nationalism rising.
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:34.520]  Maybe that reaches Ireland.
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:35.520]  Maybe not.
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:42.520]  I don't know how politicized things are in Ireland right now, but unfortunately, I can only I'm only seeing what I'm seeing.
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:49.520]  The Irish people are politically pretty. This green thing has taken up, which is a false thing, as we all know.
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.520]  But the use seems to be carried away with this green thing here in Ireland.
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:58.520]  Yeah, it's all about, you know, the fake man made global warming narrative.
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:00.520]  Thanks so much for the call, Patrick.
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:01.520]  He just dropped abruptly.
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:03.520]  He was calling in from Ireland.
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  It was great to hear from him.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:07.520]  Let's go to Joe calling in from West Virginia.
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:09.520]  Go ahead, Joe.
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:12.520]  And to call in and talk about, can you hear me?
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:13.520]  Yep, go ahead.
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:20.520]  Okay, I just want to talk about what Mueller said, and I think they're going to appeal to Mueller and force him to testify.
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:24.520]  Who's the Democrats or the Republicans?
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:28.520]  The Congress is going to force him to testify.
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:31.520]  The Democrats won't.
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:33.520]  I don't think the Democrats will.
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:34.520]  The Republicans might.
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  I don't think the Democrats will.
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:39.520]  I don't know.
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:47.520]  I think the Democrats will move to have him testify and then move to impeach Trump.
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:49.520]  Well, they're already trying to get Trump impeached.
[2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:50.520]  There's no doubt about that.
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:53.520]  Mueller said he doesn't want to testify in front of Congress.
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:55.520]  He said he's done.
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:58.520]  I'd be shocked if the Democrats go against him on that.
[2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:01.520]  It'll blow up in their face, but hey, that's how everything seems to be working.
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:07.520]  So maybe that is the destiny.
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:08.520]  That might be.
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:13.520]  I mean, can I get a shout out to where I'm listening to Infowars at?
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:14.520]  Yeah.
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:19.520]  Yeah, I'm listening to Infowars on Cloud TV.
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:25.520]  It's $58.99 a year.
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:32.520]  And you can listen to RT and One American News Network all on Cloud TV.
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:37.520]  Cloud TV, yeah, one of the great carriers of the Alex Jones show and the Infowars broadcast.
[2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  Thank you so much for calling in today, Joe.
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:42.520]  Let's go to Donnie calling in from Phoenix.
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:45.520]  Go ahead, Donnie.
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:47.520]  Oh, I'm on my skateboard.
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:49.520]  It's Donnie.
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:51.520]  You're on a speakerphone.
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:53.520]  I can barely hear you.
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:59.520]  I was just calling in about I got stickers on the back of my truck.
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.520]  I got a bunch of Infowars stickers and keeps your tops off my tail.
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:12.520]  All right, everybody know, in the Frankincense, that's a great deal from the store as opposed to Whole Foods.
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:13.520]  It's like $30.
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:16.520]  Yeah, well, you've got a bunch of the Emerson Central's oils are great.
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:17.520]  The Frankincense is great.
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:18.520]  The Eucalyptus is great.
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:20.520]  It's cheap, too.
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:22.520]  Southern Screen and Bug Spray.
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:24.520]  I highly recommend it out here.
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  I'm a cool guy, but I was going to see, I was listening to Mueller.
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:33.520]  I got a pretty good ear and he sounds really broken and scared.
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:37.520]  And I think, I think he's pretty much toast.
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:41.520]  He's going to be thinking pretty hard tonight, I would guess.
[2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:43.520]  But anyways, that's just my input.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:47.520]  I got a pretty good ear and playing rock and roll for a long time.
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  I know what broken people sound like, you know.
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:51.520]  So broken how?
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:53.520]  I mean, what do you think?
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:56.520]  What do you think has him broken?
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:02.520]  Well, the way he retired and everything, you know, like his reputation is ruined
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:07.520]  or he's going to be exposed for crimes or what?
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:08.520]  Yeah.
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:11.520]  Obviously, he's worried about going to prison.
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:13.520]  I would say, I mean, his reputation shot.
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:15.520]  That's why he quit.
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  Maybe that's the only thing he could think of to do.
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:22.520]  Well, I'm not sure what, I'm not sure what would land him in prison.
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:26.520]  As far as this special counsel investigation is concerned, but who knows,
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:31.520]  maybe there's some other stuff with the Epstein files being reopened
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:33.520]  that he may be afraid of there.
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:34.520]  Thanks for the call, Donnie.
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  All right, here's the deal.
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:38.520]  I've got so many callers to get to.

[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:50.520]  I may not get to it.

[2:31:25.520 --> 2:31:27.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:31.520]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:35.520]  Um, I've used the, uh, SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products,
[2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:37.520]  so thank you so much for that as well.
[2:31:37.520 --> 2:31:40.520]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[2:31:40.520 --> 2:31:43.520]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula,
[2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:46.520]  with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth.
[2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:49.520]  It, it, it is next level. It really is good, so thank you.
[2:31:49.520 --> 2:31:52.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:59.520]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night,
[2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:01.520]  so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:08.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[2:32:08.520 --> 2:32:10.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[2:32:10.520 --> 2:32:13.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:15.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acid.
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:18.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acid.
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:20.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:23.520]  The vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:26.320]  Let's crush five different types of caffeine
[2:32:26.320 --> 2:32:28.280]  That's turbo-force, plant derived
[2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:32.520]  Five hundred milligrams, low bar, D, fairy, bad
[2:32:32.520 --> 2:32:34.520]  I'm a low bar, plant derived
[2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:39.020]  Five hundred milligrams, low bar, D, fairy, bad
[2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:41.020]  That's turbo-force, I tell you what
[2:32:41.020 --> 2:32:43.020]  I'm gonna lie, I need my brain sure
[2:32:43.020 --> 2:32:46.520]  And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:49.520]  We work out, next level, level, force, level, force
[2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:53.520]  We work out, next level, level, it's turbo-force
[2:32:53.520 --> 2:32:55.520]  And get the fish oil
[2:32:58.520 --> 2:33:02.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:08.520 --> 2:33:12.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence
[2:33:12.520 --> 2:33:14.520]  And the heart of the Resistance
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.520]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer
[2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:20.520]  There's so much going on
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:23.520]  But the hot topic is the Mueller statement today
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:26.520]  We've been taking your calls on it, we will continue to do so
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:29.520]  Folks, don't forget, InfowarsStore.com has massive

[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:19.520]  We want to continue to expand
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:21.520]  They're trying to make that impossible by censoring us
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:24.520]  Off all social media so we can't reach new audiences
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:27.520]  So we need you to tell friends and family about the broadcast
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:30.520]  And to shop at InfowarsStore.com

[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:44.520]  If you're not filtering the water at your house, you're nuts
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.520]  In fact, I think it was Bernie Sanders
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:49.520]  Just put out a story about how water in South Carolina
[2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:51.520]  Is totally polluted
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:53.520]  Yeah, no kidding
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:55.520]  That's why we sell water filters
[2:34:55.520 --> 2:34:57.520]  So you don't have to drink the polluted water

[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:30.520]  At InfowarsStore.com
[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:33.520]  Okay, let's continue on with the phone calls
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:36.520]  Mike in Texas, go ahead, Mike
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:41.520]  Greetings from a Creep Corps Parkway Central alum
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:43.520]  Hello
[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:46.520]  There are several reasons why
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:49.520]  Jeremy in California is wrong
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:52.520]  Number one, the
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:55.520]  Justice Department relied on a regulation
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:57.520]  To launch their investigation
[2:35:57.520 --> 2:35:59.520]  But they never had a predicate crime
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:02.520]  Instead, they launched it as a counter-intel investigation
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:04.520]  To use foreign assets
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:07.520]  Because they couldn't surveil a U.S. citizen
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:10.520]  You know, CIA isn't allowed to do that
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:13.520]  As far as I know, the FBI isn't allowed to do it either
[2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:17.520]  Number two, Trump would have to have a
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:20.520]  So-called mens rea, a state of mind
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:22.520]  That where he knew he was guilty
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:26.520]  And was therefore trying to defeat the investigation
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  Clearly no one in the world knew
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:31.520]  That he was innocent more than Donald Trump
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:34.520]  So for a couple reasons, there's no way
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:38.520]  They're gonna try to charge him with obstruction
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:41.520]  That's just absurd
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:47.520]  Right, and the real obstruction was done by them
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:49.520]  They're the ones that don't want the
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:51.520]  Declassification of all these files
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:53.520]  And the FISA warrants
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:55.520]  While they call for total declassification
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:36:57.520]  Of whatever they want
[2:36:57.520 --> 2:36:59.520]  Yeah, and by the way, the Deputy Assistant Director
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:01.520]  Is not McCabe
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:04.520]  I don't know if he reported to McCabe
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:07.520]  But that's another position altogether
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:09.520]  Yeah, I think it was either Dan Coates
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:11.520]  Or someone else, I can't remember
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:14.520]  But it was his department
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:16.520]  Yeah, but McCabe's going down
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:19.520]  On perjury charges if you get nothing else
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:22.520]  I mean, Trump has all these guys
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:23.520]  Five ways to Sunday
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:25.520]  It just does William Barr want to prosecute
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:27.520]  It's really what it comes down to
[2:37:27.520 --> 2:37:29.520]  All right, thanks, Owen
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:30.520]  All right, hey, yeah
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:32.520]  There was a little local color from Mike there
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:34.520]  Being St. Louis native like myself
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  Let's go now to...
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.520]  I even forget who I wanted to go to next
[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:43.520]  Let's see here
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:45.520]  Let's go to Gene in Oregon
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:47.520]  Go ahead, Gene
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:49.520]  Owen, how are you doing, man?
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:50.520]  Good, thanks for calling
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:52.520]  That last caller sort of hit what I was going to tell you
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:54.520]  You know that IG report that just came out
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:56.520]  I didn't really want to talk about this
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:37:58.520]  But you brought it up because you were upset with it
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:01.520]  But, you know, the IG is just like Mueller
[2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.520]  He doesn't prosecute anything
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:06.520]  He has to give it to Barr
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:08.520]  Barr makes the decision
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:10.520]  That report that you just read was the IG report
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:12.520]  He's deciding not to prosecute
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:14.520]  Well, it's not his decision
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:16.520]  It's Barr's
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:20.520]  Yes, but it's worded
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  It's worded like, yeah, we're just going to pass
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:24.520]  On further charges here
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:26.520]  But that's not his call
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  That's all I wanted to tell you about that
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:30.520]  Because I know you were really
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:32.520]  Ticked off about that one
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:34.520]  But with Mueller
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:36.520]  Mueller has nothing to do but to double down
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:38.520]  You know, he's a liar
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:40.520]  Everything he said was a lie
[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  In his speech
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:44.520]  You know, it was totally debunked
[2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:46.520]  And he has to double down on it
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:48.520]  Because of what?
[2:38:48.520 --> 2:38:50.520]  President Trump declassified
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:52.520]  All the documents
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:54.520]  And like you guys have talked on the show
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:56.520]  You know, why did he
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  Include the secretaries
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:00.520]  The secretary of defense
[2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:02.520]  Why did he include the secretary
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  Of commerce?
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  Because they're releasing the documents
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:08.520]  On Uranium 1
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:10.520]  And where does Mueller fit in?
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:12.520]  Uranium 1
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:14.520]  Yeah, I forgot about that too
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:16.520]  With Mueller's ties to Uranium 1
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:18.520]  And the Epstein files
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:20.520]  He has to double down, dude
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:22.520]  That's going down
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:24.520]  That's why he's not going to testify
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:26.520]  Because they don't want him to testify
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  That, oh yeah, I knew the whole thing
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:30.520]  Was a joke the day I took the office
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:32.520]  Of an inspector
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:34.520]  You know, an inspector
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  Whatever he was
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.520]  Yeah, Mueller's corrupt is the day is long
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:40.520]  Around 9-11
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:42.520]  Uranium 1, Epstein files
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:44.520]  And now the Russian collusion
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:46.520]  And that's why he came up and did that
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:48.520]  Because he just told everybody
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:50.520]  In Congress you can do whatever you want
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:52.520]  But I'm not testifying
[2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:54.520]  Because he's in deep water
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:56.520]  Well, that's going to be really interesting
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:39:58.520]  To see what happens with that
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  Because the Democrat constituencies
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:02.520]  Want him to testify
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:04.520]  We want the Republicans in the
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:06.520]  Intel committees to ask him questions
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:08.520]  During testimony
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:10.520]  It's just wild, man
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:12.520]  Just unbelievable
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  Yeah, I forgot, he was part of the anthrax
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:16.520]  He was part of the Enron
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:18.520]  Let's go to Jefferson in Virginia
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:20.520]  Go ahead, Jefferson
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:22.520]  Hey, Ellen, how's it going?
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:24.520]  Good
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  I wanted to say much
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:28.520]  That they were saying earlier that
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:30.520]  A.G. Barr is the guy who makes the decision
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:32.520]  On prosecuting and that's a good thing
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:34.520]  I think he's still on our side
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:36.520]  When it comes to
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  This Mueller
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:40.520]  Announcement today, he admitted essentially
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:42.520]  That he used fake manufactured evidence
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:44.520]  To get the indictment against the Russian
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:46.520]  Military guys for supposedly
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:48.520]  Hacking the DNC
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:50.520]  That had to be manufactured fake evidence
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:52.520]  That he used in that grand jury
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  So he guilty of a crime right there
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:56.520]  Hold on, let's actually bear down on that
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:58.520]  For a second, I forgot about this
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:00.520]  The DNC never even turned their servers over
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:02.520]  So not only did he never question
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:04.520]  Assange, when did they
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:06.520]  Ever investigate the actual servers?
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:08.520]  Correct
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:10.520]  And I'm not sure how
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:12.520]  William Binney got the metadata
[2:41:12.520 --> 2:41:14.520]  That it couldn't be downloaded that fast
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:16.520]  So
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:18.520]  It has to be fake evidence that he used
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:20.520]  In the grand jury to get around that problem
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  And he never brought up the download times
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:24.520]  So that's where we can get him
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  He can actually be prosecuted
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  I think for using fake evidence
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  We just had to push that or declassify that
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:32.520]  That whole, it's called marble framework
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  The CIA and the NSA can create
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:36.520]  False
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:38.520]  Metadata and use it in court
[2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:40.520]  It's parallel construction
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:42.520]  No, this is actually, this is interesting
[2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  Because
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:46.520]  The reason why he's able to get away with this
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.520]  Is because the media will never hold his feet to the fire
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:50.520]  And the average
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:52.520]  Leftist Trumpator that wants to see him impeach
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  Doesn't even understand
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:56.520]  What he's ignoring here
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:41:58.520]  And that's the fact that all of these claims
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  About Russian hacking
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:02.520]  Or meddling and all of this stuff
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:04.520]  There is zero basis to this day
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  They have literally presented
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:08.520]  Zero evidence of that
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:10.520]  Mainly because the evidence is classified
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:12.520]  And it's all made up, it's all fake evidence
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  And we just had to press that point
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:16.520]  I got a funny thing for you
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:18.520]  We have a new Indian name for Nancy Pelosi
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:20.520]  It's called
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:22.520]  Three things holding up two fingers
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  He should
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  The president should always refer to her
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:28.520]  As three things holding up two fingers
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  And if you're not sure what Jefferson is referencing
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:32.520]  Thanks for the call Jefferson
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  The other day, Nancy Pelosi
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:36.520]  If she wasn't drunk, we feel really bad for her
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:38.520]  Held up two fingers
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:40.520]  When she was talking about three things
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:42.520]  Yeah
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:44.520]  You know, Nadler is passing out
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:46.520]  In the middle of an event
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:48.520]  Pelosi can't even get through a press conference
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:50.520]  Without sounding like a bumbling idiot
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:52.520]  This is the state of the Democrat Party
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:42:56.520]  Everybody knows that supplements
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:58.520]  Are amazing
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:00.520]  That what God gave us for Mother Nature is incredible
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:02.520]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:04.520]  Industry in the world
[2:43:04.520 --> 2:43:06.520]  So upset
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:08.520]  The problem is people forget
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:10.520]  To take them
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:12.520]  And that's why the whole industry has moved
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:14.520]  Towards packets that you take in the morning
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:16.520]  And you take at night

[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  Two stories here
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:56.520]  And then we'll squeeze into maybe a call or two
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:47:58.520]  Nix of them
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:00.520]  Sex slave was an illegal immigrant
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  Whose status was used to keep her in line
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:04.520]  So you got all kinds of stuff coming
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  About the Nix of them sex
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:08.520]  Call and even its ties to the government
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:10.520]  So that's going to be interesting
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:12.520]  When that gets fully exposed
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:14.520]  But the media probably won't report on it
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:16.520]  That's why they censor us because we do report on it
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  The Democrats are continuing to force
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:20.520]  Biden down our throat
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:22.520]  Biden polls saying Biden is
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:24.520]  He's running away with it
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  He's got the lead
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:28.520]  Where they get these numbers, who knows
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:30.520]  But what is with this guy
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:32.520]  He literally cannot keep his hands off women and children
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:34.520]  At an event
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  Last night Joe Biden had a young girl
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:38.520]  10 year old
[2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:40.520]  Asked him a question
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:42.520]  He literally came up to her, grabbed her
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:44.520]  Took her back behind the scenes
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:46.520]  And was groping her for
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:48.520]  A long period of time after that
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:50.520]  So he went Joe Biden
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:52.520]  Keep his hands off of children
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:54.520]  What is wrong with this guy
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:56.520]  He literally cannot keep his hands
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:48:58.520]  Off of children
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:00.520]  Sick, creepy, freak show
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  Missouri's last abortion clinic
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:04.520]  Says it may lose its license this week
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:06.520]  So Missouri is going one way
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  Ending abortion
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.520]  Illinois is going the other way
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:12.520]  Illinois House makes abortion fundamental right
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:14.520]  With late term bill
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:16.520]  So two states bordering each other
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  One way on abortion to stop murdering innocent children
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:20.520]  State on from Missouri
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  The other one Illinois going the other way
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  U.S. service members seeing
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  Wearing MAGA inspired patches
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:28.520]  That Trump's speech may have violated DoD rules
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:30.520]  So yeah, you're not allowed to support the president
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:32.520]  It's bad and we need to make
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:34.520]  A national case out of the U.S.
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:36.520]  Service members
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:38.520]  Liking Trump, they're not allowed to do that
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:40.520]  Armies, Google Earth on steroids
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:42.520]  Can look inside buildings
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  So basically they basically can just do anything
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:46.520]  Now, and that's ancient tech
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:48.520]  Now it's just been integrated with
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  Google Earth
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:52.520]  CNN announces more layoff as
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:54.520]  Zucker reveals network is losing
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:56.520]  $10 million a year
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:49:58.520]  That's from Paul Joseph Watson at infowars.com
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  So go to infowarsstore.com
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:02.520]  And make sure we continue to kick CNN's ass
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:04.520]  As they continue to have us censored
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:06.520]  So CNN has us censored
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:08.520]  And we just kick their ass
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:10.520]  25% of Americans say they worry about money all the time
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  Cut the
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:14.520]  Taxes
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:16.520]  Cut the taxes
[2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  Did I say cut the taxes? I think we should cut the taxes
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  People will be having great sex
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  Without any human contact by 2025
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:24.520]  Well I wouldn't call that great sex
[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:26.520]  Then that's a simulation
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:28.520]  That's what they want, just like they simulate
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:30.520]  News
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:32.520]  Just like they simulate communications
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  Now they're going to be simulating sex
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:36.520]  From ABC News
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  A thief snatched a tip jar filled with college tuition savings
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  From a family business
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:42.520]  That happened in New Orleans
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:44.520]  Some guy walked into a bar, stole an entire tip jar
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:46.520]  From a nice bartender
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:48.520]  And it was pretty sad
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:50.520]  So if you are a bartender, listen
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:52.520]  Keep your eyes peeled
[2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:54.520]  Teachers allegedly told to favor black students
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:56.520]  In racial equality training
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:58.520]  This is in New York
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:00.520]  So now black students receive the attention
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:02.520]  Of the school
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:04.520]  While the white students don't
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:06.520]  But that's not racist
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:08.520]  This is not normal
[2:51:08.520 --> 2:51:10.520]  In the U.S. during the last 30 days
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:12.520]  Is it weather weapons? Is it man-made global warming?
[2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:14.520]  Who knows, but it's been devastating
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:16.520]  You just had a racist attack
[2:51:16.520 --> 2:51:18.520]  In South Africa
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:20.520]  Basically, if you're a white farmer
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:22.520]  In South Africa, you're clinging to your gun
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:24.520]  24-7 because you never know
[2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:26.520]  When you might get attacked
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:28.520]  There's another story on that at enforce.com
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.520]  I don't have it in front of me
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:32.520]  Here's one from Dan Lyman
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:34.520]  If you're a German
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:36.520]  In Germany, you get nothing
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:38.520]  But if you come from some other foreign land
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:40.520]  You get everything
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:42.520]  U.S. risk devastating blow from China's rare earth
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:44.520]  Mineral monopoly
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  I remember an info wars reporting on this five years ago
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:48.520]  Nobody else did
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:50.520]  Somali parents sending their kids back
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:52.520]  To Africa to escape London knife crime
[2:51:52.520 --> 2:51:54.520]  Epidemic, wow
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:56.520]  So now Somalia is a safer place to raise your kid
[2:51:56.520 --> 2:51:58.520]  Than London
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:00.520]  Suspect behind
[2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:02.520]  Leon Parcel Bomb
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:04.520]  Attack is an illegal migrant from Algeria
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:06.520]  Open borders is really working
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:08.520]  For Europe
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:10.520]  Alright, let's go back out to the phone lines
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:12.520]  And go to
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:14.520]  Let's go
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:16.520]  To Julian in New Mexico
[2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:18.520]  Go ahead Julian
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:20.520]  Hey Owen, how you doing?
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:22.520]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment
[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:24.520]  You know, let us not forget
[2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:26.520]  Who we're dealing with here
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:28.520]  Robert Bowler is one of the worst individuals
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:30.520]  In our
[2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:32.520]  The history of our government
[2:52:32.520 --> 2:52:34.520]  Is responsible for some of the most heinous
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:36.520]  Deep state
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:38.520]  Operations out there and you nailed it
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:40.520]  Right on the head today
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:42.520]  About, you know, the media has
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:44.520]  The majority, you know
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:46.520]  Of the public under MKUltra
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:48.520]  Project Marklinburg
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:50.520]  You know and Robert Bowler
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:52.520]  Was the man, let us not forget
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:54.520]  Who cut Jeffrey Epstein
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:56.520]  One of the sweetest deals
[2:52:56.520 --> 2:52:58.520]  Was also one of the most heinous men
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:53:00.520]  Out there to walk away with a slap
[2:53:00.520 --> 2:53:02.520]  On his wrist for the things that he's done
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:04.520]  And Robert Bowler was
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.520]  Appointed, you know, the cover-up
[2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:08.520]  Job for 9-11, you know
[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:10.520]  And the American public
[2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  Doesn't even realize, you know
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:14.520]  How deep this man goes
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:16.520]  So for him to
[2:53:16.520 --> 2:53:18.520]  Basically come out today
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:20.520]  Was basically him just saying, you know
[2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:22.520]  I got away with the biggest cover-up
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:24.520]  In US history and I
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:26.520]  Washed Hillary Clinton Obama's hands clean
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:28.520]  And the sad part about it
[2:53:28.520 --> 2:53:30.520]  Is that the media, like you said today
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  Is going to take this narrative
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:34.520]  Spin it, run with it
[2:53:34.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  And they're going to try to say
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:38.520]  You know that there was obstructive justice
[2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:40.520]  Obstructive justice
[2:53:40.520 --> 2:53:42.520]  But they just couldn't pin it on him
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:44.520]  Because of what Robert Bowler said
[2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:46.520]  In the press conference this morning
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  That it's unconstitutional
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:50.520]  And it's just really sad
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:52.520]  And the caller that called earlier
[2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:54.520]  You know said something about
[2:53:54.520 --> 2:53:56.520]  You know that he
[2:53:56.520 --> 2:53:58.520]  Trump shouldn't interfere
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:00.520]  Trump has the constitute
[2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:02.520]  He has the executive power
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:04.520]  To fire Coleman
[2:54:04.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  He has the executive power to do so
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  It's not obstruction of justice
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:10.520]  You know, that's the thing about it
[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:12.520]  That's one of the narratives
[2:54:12.520 --> 2:54:14.520]  They're trying to say
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:16.520]  It's just the deception, the lies
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:18.520]  It's really sick
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:20.520]  And the fact that Epstein gets to walk
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:22.520]  A major pedophile sex trafficker
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:24.520]  When you read those reports about him
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:26.520]  And he gets nothing
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:28.520]  But Julian Assange is treated like a war criminal
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:30.520]  Just makes you sick
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:32.520]  It really shows you the clown world for what it is
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:34.520]  You know, we really just need to pray so hard
[2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.520]  Just beg God
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:38.520]  Just beg God to intervene and save us
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  From whatever karma
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:42.520]  Is going to come from all this
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:44.520]  Because the evils and the crimes
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:46.520]  And everything that's been going on in this country
[2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:48.520]  The people that have been burying in their head
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  In the sand and ignoring, it's going to come home to roost
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:52.520]  And we better just pray for God
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:54.520]  He allows us some time
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:56.520]  To maybe get ourselves out of this mess
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:54:58.520]  But man, it's bad
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:00.520]  I mean, it's bad
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:02.520]  Thanks for the call, Julian
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:04.520]  Let's go to Jan in Utah, a final caller
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:06.520]  At least for me today, Mike Adams is about to take over
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:08.520]  Go ahead, Jan
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  I just want to say that I agree
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:12.520]  With the man from Ireland
[2:55:12.520 --> 2:55:14.520]  And I'm really happy that you just said what you did
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:16.520]  Because I think anytime
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:18.520]  A nation upholds and legalizes
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:20.520]  Sin, the judgments of God
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  Come down upon it
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:24.520]  But I believe that there's more good people
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:26.520]  In this country still than bad people
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:28.520]  And the only thing that can say this
[2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:30.520]  Is praying to God
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:32.520]  And that's it
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:34.520]  It really is
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:36.520]  And there are obviously works of man
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:38.520]  That are going to have to take place too
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:40.520]  For us to
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:42.520]  To rid ourselves of this
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:44.520]  Satanic corruption
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:46.520]  In the West
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:48.520]  But
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:50.520]  I think we both know what true karma would be
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:52.520]  Unless God decides to intervene here in the West
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:54.520]  And it's not good
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  Well, he can
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:55:58.520]  And he will
[2:55:58.520 --> 2:56:00.520]  If we trust him and do pray to him for that
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:02.520]  And a separate individual
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:04.520]  Like myself, what can we do really?
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:06.520]  We can try to expose it
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:08.520]  And try to let others know the truth
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:10.520]  But then what do they do?
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.520]  We may know the truth, but what do we do about it?
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:14.520]  But I'm really thankful
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:16.520]  For people like Alex Jones and yourself
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:18.520]  That aren't afraid to report the truth
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:20.520]  And I've been listening to Alex Jones for years
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:22.520]  And this is the first time I've ever called in
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:24.520]  Because I'm really
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:26.520]  Concerned about the state of our own country also
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  No, it's
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:30.520]  It's a tough pill to swallow, Jan
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:32.520]  When you look at all the corruption
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:34.520]  And then you see people like Julie Nassange
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:36.520]  Treated like a war criminal
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:38.520]  A guy that exposes war crimes
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:40.520]  While war criminals
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:42.520]  Like Hillary Clinton
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:44.520]  Get to walk free, it makes you sick
[2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:46.520]  And if the average citizen
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:48.520]  Can't look at that
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:50.520]  And say, what the hell is going on here?
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:52.520]  Something isn't right
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:54.520]  Then they've been lulled to sleep by the media
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  They've been lulled to sleep by sports
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:56:58.520]  By pop culture, by everything
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:00.520]  And it's the tools of the devil
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:02.520]  And we've fallen under mass psychosis
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:04.520]  In this country
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:06.520]  Mass brainwashing
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  Call it MK Altra, call it Project
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:10.520]  Mockingbird, call it whatever you want
[2:57:10.520 --> 2:57:12.520]  We know what it is
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:14.520]  We don't shake ourselves free of it
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:16.520]  And we have a chance to manifest it right now
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:18.520]  As humans to do something about this
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:20.520]  We elected Trump, we wanted to clean out
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  The rotgut, we wanted to expose the corruption
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:24.520]  We wanted to try to write the ship
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:26.520]  We wanted to try to write ourselves
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:28.520]  And we've got these damn demons
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:30.520]  That are keeping us from doing it
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:32.520]  Ugh, I don't know where we're going from here
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:34.520]  Jan, thank you so much for the call
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:38.520]  I don't want to go to Civil War, folks
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:40.520]  I don't want to see
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:42.520]  Many of this happen, but I mean

[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:14.520]  So what are your thoughts on what we've seen
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:42.520]  And heard so far today?
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:44.520]  And what I'm going to cover are details
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:46.520]  Of why it's clear that Robert Mueller
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:48.520]  Is a criminal
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:50.520]  An enemy of the people of America
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:52.520]  And should be among those
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:54.520]  Who are arrested by military police
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:00:56.520]  And held for military tribunals
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:00:58.520]  In my opinion
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  I don't know if that's the Infowars
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:02.520]  View on this, but that's my analysis
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:04.520]  And I'm going to share it here with you
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:06.520]  And give you my reasoning why it's necessary
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:08.520]  To restore the rule of law in America
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:10.520]  It's not an act of vengeance
[3:01:10.520 --> 3:01:12.520]  Against the enemies of Trump
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:14.520]  It's an act of restoring the rule of law
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:16.520]  So that's coming up in a whole lot more, Owen
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:18.520]  No, I mean, it's basic stuff
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:22.520]  If you, you know, let's say you have a friend
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:24.520]  Or a cousin or whatever and they're
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  Possessed by the devil
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:28.520]  You have an exorcism, right?
[3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  I mean, that's what you do
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:32.520]  We need an exorcism in this country
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:34.520]  That's what this really comes down to
[3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:36.520]  And I mean, Mike
[3:01:36.520 --> 3:01:38.520]  We're basically kind of left
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:40.520]  And I don't know
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:42.520]  I hate saying this
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:44.520]  Because I don't actually feel it's true
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:46.520]  But it does feel like where we're at
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:48.520]  Where we're kind of just at the behest
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:50.520]  Of the President and Barr
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:52.520]  Right now to see
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  If we're ever going to get justice in this country
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  I mean, are we going to have another situation
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:01:58.520]  Where Mueller just walks away
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:00.520]  And just covers up massive crimes?
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:02.520]  I think
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:04.520]  Many American patriots, conservatives
[3:02:04.520 --> 3:02:06.520]  Constitutionalists, even veterans
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:08.520]  Are patiently waiting
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:10.520]  For Trump and Barr
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:12.520]  To invoke the rule of law
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:14.520]  They are, the patriots of America
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:16.520]  Are holding back
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:18.520]  I think if Trump were not president
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:20.520]  I think if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:22.520]  My, my guess is we'd already be
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:24.520]  In a civil war at this point
[3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:26.520]  Trump has prevented that
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:28.520]  And Trump has a chance to prevail
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:30.520]  Against this deep state
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:32.520]  And the patriots and the law-abiding citizens
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:34.520]  Of America do not want to resort
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:36.520]  To having to invoke
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:38.520]  The self-defense of their nation
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:40.520]  They are willing to, as a last resort
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:42.520]  But they will never initiate violence
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:44.520]  But at the same time, oh, and I'm going to cover this too
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  In this coming hour, the left
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:48.520]  Has now reached a point of desperation
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  Where they could unleash any kind of deep state
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:52.520]  Attack, bomb, dirty bomb
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:54.520]  Chemical weapon, mass shooting
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:56.520]  Anything to change the narrative
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:02:58.520]  But there's a very important reason
[3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  Why that would actually
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:02.520]  Boomerang back against them
[3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:04.520]  And I'll cover that also
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:06.520]  As the show continues
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:08.520]  Well, and anything they do
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:10.520]  Will boomerang back against them
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.520]  Again, it just comes down to
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:14.520]  Will there be people in positions of power
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:16.520]  That want to actually do something about it
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:18.520]  And you know, Mike, I wonder too
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:20.520]  Because there's no doubt there's stuff like that in the works
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:22.520]  And this is an international criminal cabal
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:24.520]  We're dealing with
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:26.520]  So even if, you know, the members of the deep state
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:28.520]  Here and, you know, globalists
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:30.520]  Or whatever secret society members here
[3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  Even if they have lost
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:34.520]  The reins of the ability
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:36.520]  To do something like that in the West
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:38.520]  This is an international criminal cabal
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:40.520]  We have a wide open southern border
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:42.520]  There's no telling what they might do
[3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:44.520]  But I have a feeling in response to this
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:46.520]  They're going to try to initiate
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:48.520]  And activate their left wing
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:50.520]  Street thug squads
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:52.520]  Like the Nazi brownshirts
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  I'm just wondering if the morale is really there
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:56.520]  And if the energy is really there
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  I mean, they're going through
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:00.520]  New levels of trying to intimidate
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:02.520]  And set me up
[3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  I don't even want to talk about what I'm dealing with right now
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:06.520]  Well, their morale will be shattered
[3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:08.520]  The moment they're engaged
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  Owen, it's that simple
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:12.520]  Again, the American patriots are holding back
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:14.520]  And patiently waiting for the rule of law
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:16.520]  To be restored
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:18.520]  But if the domestic terrorism wing
[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:20.520]  Of the Democrat party, i.e. Antifa
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:22.520]  If Antifa takes to the streets and starts carrying out violence
[3:04:22.520 --> 3:04:24.520]  I believe at this point
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.520]  They would be met and engaged
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:28.520]  And the anti-patriots and the morale of the leftists
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:30.520]  Would be shattered
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  Within the first magazine
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:34.520]  And here's what I don't understand
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:36.520]  How do these antifa people not see
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:38.520]  They're the ones being drug around by the FBI
[3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:40.520]  The CIA that they claim to hate
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:42.520]  Trump isn't from the government, man
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:44.520]  Trump is outside of the establishment
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:46.520]  That's why they hate him
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:48.520]  Why can't you see that yet?
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:50.520]  How is this MK Ultra so strong?
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:52.520]  Mike Adams takes over on the other side
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:54.520]  I've not shut down our speech
[3:04:54.520 --> 3:04:56.520]  We're at infowars.com
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:04:58.520]  And newswars.com
[3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:00.520]  And we're defeating the leftist tyrants
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:02.520]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans
[3:05:02.520 --> 3:05:04.520]  But almost all of them said we used to love you on air
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:06.520]  It was so good to see you on
[3:05:06.520 --> 3:05:08.520]  You know, the iTunes or on YouTube
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:10.520]  Are you coming back?
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:12.520]  We're at infowars.com
[3:05:12.520 --> 3:05:14.520]  We're at newswars.com
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:16.520]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:18.520]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:20.520]  They're trying to destroy us
[3:05:20.520 --> 3:05:22.520]  InfoWars is still chatting along
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:24.520]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news
[3:05:24.520 --> 3:05:26.520]  Today, infowars.com
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:28.520]  Woo!
[3:05:30.520 --> 3:05:32.520]  infowars.com
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:34.520]  Cause that's much people out here
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:36.520]  I'm talking about infowars.com
[3:05:36.520 --> 3:05:38.520]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com
[3:05:38.520 --> 3:05:40.520]  We knew this censorship was coming forever
[3:05:40.520 --> 3:05:42.520]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:44.520]  And it's all free to air
[3:05:44.520 --> 3:05:46.520]  Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want
[3:05:46.520 --> 3:05:48.520]  People go to infowars.com
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:50.520]  That's where they find it
[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:52.520]  There's things called websites
[3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:02.520]  We now take you live
[3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:04.520]  To the Central Texas Command Center
[3:06:04.520 --> 3:06:06.520]  And the heart of the resistance
[3:06:06.520 --> 3:06:08.520]  It's Mike Adams
[3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:10.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:16.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[3:06:16.520 --> 3:06:18.520]  This is Mike Adams here
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:20.520]  Owen, are you still in the studio?
[3:06:24.520 --> 3:06:26.520]  Thanks for bringing me in
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:28.520]  Sorry about that little glitch there
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:30.520]  In any case, I got a big show lined up
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:32.520]  For you here for the rest of the hour
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:34.520]  Owen did a great job, of course, for the first three hours
[3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:36.520]  And now we're going to get into
[3:06:36.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  Analysis of Robert Mueller
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:40.520]  Why the military tribunals' arrests
[3:06:40.520 --> 3:06:42.520]  Need to begin taking place
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:44.520]  And why it may be weeks or months
[3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:46.520]  Before that happens
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:48.520]  So here's my analysis
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:50.520]  And again, my disclaimer is
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:52.520]  I don't know if my analysis
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:54.520]  Happens to match up exactly
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:56.520]  With the rest of infowars
[3:06:56.520 --> 3:06:58.520]  Or Alex Jones' analysis
[3:06:58.520 --> 3:07:00.520]  That's actually the great thing
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:02.520]  About being a fill-in guest for Alex Jones
[3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:04.520]  Is Alex never tells you
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:06.520]  What to say
[3:07:06.520 --> 3:07:08.520]  There's no mandatory view
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:10.520]  You know how the mainstream media
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:12.520]  They all get their marching orders every day
[3:07:12.520 --> 3:07:14.520]  Use these words, use these phrases
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:16.520]  And they're all tested to try to demonize Trump
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:18.520]  Here on infowars
[3:07:18.520 --> 3:07:20.520]  All of us who are fill-in hosts or guests
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:22.520]  Or fourth-hour hosts
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:24.520]  We get to say what we want to say
[3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:26.520]  And we're never given orders
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:28.520]  Nothing ever happens
[3:07:28.520 --> 3:07:30.520]  Like that
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:32.520]  I've never had a call from Alex
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:34.520]  You have to talk about this, it never happens
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:36.520]  So this is my analysis, it's mine alone
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:38.520]  And I don't know if everybody else agrees with it
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:40.520]  But here it is
[3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:43.520]  It's clear, especially from Robert Mueller's statements today
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:46.520]  That Mueller was in on this from the very beginning
[3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:48.520]  The entire Russia collusion hoax
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:50.520]  Was a farce to begin with
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:52.520]  Where is paragraph one
[3:07:52.520 --> 3:07:54.520]  Of the justification
[3:07:54.520 --> 3:07:56.520]  For the special counsel in the first place
[3:07:56.520 --> 3:07:58.520]  Where's the crime
[3:07:58.520 --> 3:08:00.520]  That was supposed to be investigated
[3:08:00.520 --> 3:08:02.520]  You see a special counsel is only supposed to be
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:04.520]  Initiated when there's a crime
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:06.520]  To be investigated, but there was no crime
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:08.520]  Mentioned in this
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:10.520]  And that's why it was packaged as
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:12.520]  An intelligence investigation
[3:08:12.520 --> 3:08:14.520]  So that they could have it go on and on
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:16.520]  Through the midterm elections
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:18.520]  Take over the house
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:20.520]  And then have impeachment proceedings
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:22.520]  Against Trump
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:24.520]  Robert Mueller has been part of this from the start
[3:08:24.520 --> 3:08:26.520]  And in my analysis
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:28.520]  His complicity goes all the way back
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:30.520]  To Hillary Clinton, uranium one
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:32.520]  And the corruption at the highest levels
[3:08:32.520 --> 3:08:34.520]  Of the FBI that has been in place
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:36.520]  For decades
[3:08:36.520 --> 3:08:38.520]  It goes way beyond James Comey
[3:08:38.520 --> 3:08:40.520]  Or Christopher Wray or Robert Mueller
[3:08:40.520 --> 3:08:42.520]  It's been going on for decades
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:44.520]  So I believe that
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:46.520]  As William Barr and Donald Trump
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:48.520]  Are now at war against the deep state
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:50.520]  That's essentially what it is
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:52.520]  There is a civil war
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:54.520]  Inside the administration
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:56.520]  And all the stay behind networks
[3:08:56.520 --> 3:08:58.520]  Of Obama and Hillary Clinton
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:00.520]  From her State Department days
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:02.520]  Those stay behind networks are traders
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:04.520]  As Liz Cheney said the other day
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:06.520]  They are carrying out literal acts of treason
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:08.520]  And William Barr
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:10.520]  And President Trump
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  Are working to clean out
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:14.520]  That swamp and then working to restore
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:16.520]  The rule of law
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:18.520]  But they have to be very careful how they do this
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:20.520]  They cannot overreach
[3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:22.520]  You can't declare martial law too early
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:24.520]  Not until the evidence
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:26.520]  Against the traders is overwhelming
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  And in the public domain
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:30.520]  So this effort to
[3:09:30.520 --> 3:09:32.520]  Declassify documents
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:34.520]  Which will take time because of the retractions
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:36.520]  And the internal reviews that need to take place
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:38.520]  Or redactions I should say
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:40.520]  This will take some time
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:42.520]  But as this takes place over the next few months
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:44.520]  What I believe is happening is that
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:46.520]  Barr and Trump are in effect
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:48.520]  Building a case
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:50.520]  For the invocation
[3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:52.520]  Of military police arrest
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:54.520]  The invocation of the insurrection act
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:09:56.520]  Which is essentially a form
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:09:58.520]  Of localized temporary
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:00.520]  Martial law in certain jurisdictions
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:02.520]  In order to seek out
[3:10:02.520 --> 3:10:04.520]  Arrest, charge
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:06.520]  And hold for trial
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:08.520]  The traders, the deep state traders
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:10.520]  Who literally tried to overthrow
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:12.520]  The president of the United States
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:14.520]  And overthrow a democratic election
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:16.520]  Those are crimes against the state
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:18.520]  Those are crimes against we the people
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:20.520]  Effectively
[3:10:20.520 --> 3:10:22.520]  And those crimes have to be outed
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:24.520]  And they have to be prosecuted
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  Otherwise we don't have the rule of law
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:28.520]  In this country
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:30.520]  The point here is that this is not about vengeance
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:32.520]  This is not about revenge
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:34.520]  Against those who try to take down Trump
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:36.520]  But failed. This is really
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:38.520]  About the rule of law
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:40.520]  And if we are going to resume
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:42.520]  Or restore the rule of law
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:44.520]  In this country, we must hold accountable
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:46.520]  Those who have sought
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:48.520]  To, they conspired
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:50.520]  To violate the rule of law
[3:10:50.520 --> 3:10:52.520]  To overthrow our constitutional republic
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:54.520]  And to silence the voice
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:56.520]  Of the people
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:10:58.520]  Just what overturning an election is
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:00.520]  To silence the voice of the people
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:02.520]  And note that these same
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:04.520]  Deep state traders have ordered
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:06.520]  The tech giants, like Facebook
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:08.520]  And Google and YouTube and so on, Twitter
[3:11:08.520 --> 3:11:10.520]  To also silence the voice of the people
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:12.520]  This coordinated censorship
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:14.520]  Is an extension
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:16.520]  Of the treason that is being carried out
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:18.520]  Against the United States of America
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:20.520]  It is not simply coincidence
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:22.520]  It's not simply parallel to it
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:24.520]  It is an extension of it
[3:11:24.520 --> 3:11:26.520]  It's all the same policy
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:28.520]  Which is that those deep state traders
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:30.520]  Whether they run tech companies
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:32.520]  Whether they declare sanctuary cities as mayors
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:34.520]  Or governors of sanctuary states
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:36.520]  Or whether they ran
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:38.520]  The FISA court fraud from inside
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:40.520]  The FBI or whether they planted
[3:11:40.520 --> 3:11:42.520]  Illegal spies into the Trump campaign
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:44.520]  All of these individuals
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:46.520]  That I named, including, by the way
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  Treasonous federal judges
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:50.520]  Or district judges
[3:11:50.520 --> 3:11:52.520]  Who are now engaged in dictatorial
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:54.520]  Fascist judicial
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:56.520]  Supremacy decisions that are trying
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:58.520]  To overthrow our constitutional
[3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:00.520]  Republic. All of these individuals
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:02.520]  Are, in fact, in my view
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:04.520]  Guilty of treason
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:06.520]  Against the United States of America
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:08.520]  And there are many so-called journalists
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:10.520]  Who are complicit in this
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:12.520]  They were accomplices in this
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:14.520]  They worked with deep state leakers
[3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  To push false
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:18.520]  Or misleading information
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:20.520]  To poison the minds of the American people
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:22.520]  As part of a plot to overthrow
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:24.520]  This country. All of these
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:26.520]  People need to be held accountable
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:28.520]  And it's easy for all of us
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:30.520]  Info wars fans, patriots
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  Veterans, all of us
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:34.520]  It's easy for us to be impatient
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  About this, to say, now, now
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:38.520]  It needs to happen now, we've got to take our country back
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:40.520]  Now, and I get that
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:42.520]  But we also have to have patients
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:44.520]  With the process that it takes
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:46.520]  To make this a lawful
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:48.520]  And legitimate
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:51.520]  Restoration of the rule of law in America
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:53.520]  And that's going to require these
[3:12:53.520 --> 3:12:55.520]  Previously classified documents to come out
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:12:57.520]  It's going to require analysis of those documents
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:12:59.520]  We need to continue
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:01.520]  To listen to the good reporting
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:03.520]  Of people like Sarah Carter, for example
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:05.520]  You know, I'm talking about sort of
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:07.520]  Mainstream media reporters, John Solomon
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:09.520]  You know, Cheryl Atkinson and so on
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:11.520]  In addition to the independent media
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  That you're watching right now
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.520]  All of these voices are important
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:17.520]  We need to have patients with this process
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:19.520]  Now, but here's the big risk
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  During this time
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:23.520]  This gives the radical left
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:25.520]  The deep state left a chance
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  To activate their false flag operations
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:29.520]  To try to cause massive chaos
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:31.520]  To try to cause
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:33.520]  A distraction
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:35.520]  Chaos to rip President Trump
[3:13:35.520 --> 3:13:38.520]  Off of his plan to expose the deep state
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:40.520]  The deep state may literally
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  Unleash every terror
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:44.520]  Cell that they had previously set up
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:46.520]  They may activate every mass shooter
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:47.520]  Manchurian candidate
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:49.520]  They may unleash every dirty bomb
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:51.520]  That they've ever been able to acquire
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:52.520]  In terms of material
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:54.520]  They may even pay off terror groups
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:56.520]  To sneak across the border
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:13:58.520]  Bring in dirty bombs from Mexico
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:00.520]  And then unleash them with
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:02.520]  You know, conventional kinetic explosives
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:04.520]  Somewhere in the United States
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:06.520]  And one of my great concerns about this
[3:14:06.520 --> 3:14:08.520]  Is that they may
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:10.520]  They are so evil at this point
[3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:12.520]  They are so cornered, they're like cornered rats
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:14.520]  They may try to take out our president
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:16.520]  With an area effect
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:18.520]  Dirty bomb weapon
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:20.520]  That doesn't even kill the president
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.520]  Immediately, but rather
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  Poisons him with radiation
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:26.520]  That would impact his health
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:28.520]  And perhaps terminate his life
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:30.520]  In the months ahead
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:32.520]  And for the deranged deep state left
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  They would consider that a victory
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:37.520]  But they would kill maybe half a million people
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:39.520]  In order to take out President Trump
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:41.520]  Through such a false flag scenario
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  But a real dirty bomb
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:45.520]  A false narrative
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:48.520]  I'm very concerned that they may try that
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:50.520]  I think that the deep state traders of this country
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:52.520]  Are so desperate
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:54.520]  And are so evil and so malicious
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.520]  That they would absolutely try to
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:00.520]  They would kill hundreds of thousands of American people
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:02.520]  If they got rid of Trump in the process
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:04.520]  That's the point where we are in history
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  And by the way, if they did manage
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:08.520]  To do something like that
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:10.520]  And let us pray that they would never succeed
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  In something like that
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:13.520]  If they did
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:15.520]  If they harmed Trump or took out our president
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  That would unleash
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:19.520]  What I call the Second Amendment activation
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:21.520]  The national immune system
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:23.520]  The patriots of Americans
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:25.520]  Who love their country
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  Want to protect their country
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:29.520]  And are tired of us being overrun
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:31.520]  No, over
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:33.520]  Overran and
[3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:35.520]  Enslaved
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  By the tyrannical
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:39.520]  Fascists of the left
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:41.520]  We're tired of it
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:43.520]  It's time to stop that
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  And it's time to take America back
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:47.520]  We'll have much more straight ahead on the Alex Jones show
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:16:10.520]  This is Mike Adams. We'll be right back.
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:21.520]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:24.520]  The United States is the empire of the world
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:27.520]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:29.520]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:33.520]  Shows that World Wars I and II left England broken
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:35.520]  Its former colony, the U.S.
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:37.520]  Had to save the empire
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:39.520]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:41.520]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:41.520 --> 3:16:43.520]  The deep state began with World War I
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:47.520]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:49.520]  Available at Amazon Books
[3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:51.520]  Okay, so a watch is good
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:53.520]  And some jewelry, better grab some flowers too
[3:16:53.520 --> 3:16:54.520]  Hey, whatcha doing?

[3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:56.520]  Oh, yeah.
[3:16:56.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip to the store
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:00.520]  Then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return
[3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:02.520]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:03.520]  I'm guessing you do?
[3:17:03.520 --> 3:17:05.520]  Yes, I'm going to show you the easy, quick way

[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:55.520]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[3:17:55.520 --> 3:17:56.520]  In modern medicine
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:17:58.520]  Introducing pollen block
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:01.520]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:03.520]  To alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:18:03.520 --> 3:18:07.520]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:10.520]  Eye comfort and respiratory function
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:13.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:15.520]  Noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:18:15.520 --> 3:18:19.520]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:22.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:25.520]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:28.520]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet
[3:18:28.520 --> 3:18:30.520]  That helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:18:30.520 --> 3:18:33.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective
[3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:35.520]  It is not an antihistamine
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:38.520]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:40.520]  By blocking the activity of tryptase
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:43.520]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:45.520]  And inflammatory responses in the body
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:48.520]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:18:50.520]  Head to infowarslife.com
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:19:19.520]  And grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:21.520]  And enjoy the air you breathe
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:50.520]  And enjoy the air you breathe
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:51.520]  1-3-9
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:24.520]  All right, continuing here on The Alex Jones Show
[3:20:24.520 --> 3:20:27.520]  Thank you for joining us. This is Mike Adams
[3:20:27.520 --> 3:20:30.520]  Just leading off here, I really want to urge you
[3:20:30.520 --> 3:20:34.520]  To continue your support for the Independent Media Infowars
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:38.520]  Is a crucial platform for fighting against the deep state
[3:20:38.520 --> 3:20:41.520]  That has literally tried to overthrow this country
[3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:45.520]  And all of us who contribute to Infowars are doing so
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:49.520]  Out of a sense of patriotism, out of a sense of love for our country
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:53.520]  Love for our president and what he stands for
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:20:55.520]  The constitution, all these things
[3:20:55.520 --> 3:20:57.520]  You can go to infowarsstore.com
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:00.520]  There's a Memorial Day special that continues all this week
[3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:03.520]  The eight-pack power pack
[3:21:03.520 --> 3:21:05.520]  Which is a combination of many of the top products
[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:09.520]  Is 50% off through that Memorial Day sale
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:12.520]  Survival shield, brain force, many other products
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:14.520]  That are on special right now
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:16.520]  This is a fantastic way to support this network
[3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:19.520]  And also support your good health at the same time
[3:21:19.520 --> 3:21:21.520]  It's the Memorial Day mega sale
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:25.520]  Don't miss that at infowarsstore.com
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:27.520]  I even told Alex before on air
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:30.520]  That I think it's the nutrition of his products
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:34.520]  And nutrition that I take as well as a food scientist
[3:21:34.520 --> 3:21:37.520]  I think this is what has enabled us to stay so alive
[3:21:37.520 --> 3:21:39.520]  And so active and so informed during this time
[3:21:39.520 --> 3:21:42.520]  Of incredible stress and attacks
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:45.520]  And economic sabotage and death threats and everything
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:47.520]  Nutrition saves your life
[3:21:47.520 --> 3:21:50.520]  Nutrition also saves your life in a survival scenario
[3:21:50.520 --> 3:21:53.520]  By the way, because it allows you to adapt to stress
[3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:57.520]  I can't tell you how important it is to have turmeric
[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:02.520]  During an SHTF scenario
[3:22:02.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  I can't say that on the air, but you know what I'm talking about
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:06.520]  You need some adaptogenic herbs
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:09.520]  You need some essential oils for first aid
[3:22:09.520 --> 3:22:12.520]  Manuka honey, for example, just to say one item
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:15.520]  Manuka honey, not only can you eat it
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:18.520]  Not only can you barter it as a sweetener or a first aid item
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:21.520]  You can put it on your skin, it's antibacterial
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:24.520]  It can treat burns and simple wounds and everything
[3:22:24.520 --> 3:22:27.520]  And guess what, it stores for over 100 years
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:29.520]  So it's the ultimate barter item
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:31.520]  You should think about these things
[3:22:31.520 --> 3:22:34.520]  A lot of these products you can get at infowarsstore.com
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:36.520]  I don't know if they've got Manuka honey, but maybe they do
[3:22:36.520 --> 3:22:38.520]  Or maybe they will in the future, in any case
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:41.520]  A couple other quick programming notes
[3:22:41.520 --> 3:22:43.520]  In the interest of self-defense
[3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:46.520]  And exercising our Second Amendment rights
[3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:48.520]  I have a video coming out tomorrow
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:52.520]  I'm going to ask infowars to post it on infowars.com
[3:22:52.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  It's a personal tour of my personal battle belt equipment
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:01.520]  My rig, what I have set up for my rifle
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:05.520]  My sling, my optics, my battle belt, the magazines
[3:23:05.520 --> 3:23:08.520]  The tourniquets, the trauma pads
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:12.520]  The knife set up, which pistol I use, which everything
[3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:14.520]  It's a detailed review
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.520]  That's the health rangers battle belt video coming out tomorrow
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:19.520]  Hopefully it'll be on infowars.com
[3:23:19.520 --> 3:23:21.520]  It'll also be on rightion.com
[3:23:21.520 --> 3:23:23.520]  Our video website
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:26.520]  That's good information, but I always encourage you to keep it legal
[3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:29.520]  We're not advocating any kind of instigating
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:33.520]  Of any kind of violence or anything of the kind
[3:23:33.520 --> 3:23:36.520]  In fact, we are the ones who are holding back
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  We are saying, wait, let's wait for this process
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:43.520]  Of Trump and Barr to work its way through the system
[3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:48.520]  But if radical leftists pull some kind of nationwide communist
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:51.520]  Coup takeover attempt and they take to the streets
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:54.520]  And they start pulling people out of their homes
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:57.520]  And fashion them on the heads with spiked baseball bats
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:01.520]  My prediction is that patriots will engage those domestic terrorists
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:04.520]  And all patriots need to be ready to do that
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:06.520]  In the defense of their communities
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:08.520]  In the defense of their local law enforcement
[3:24:08.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  Because believe me, local sheriffs and sheriff's deputies
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:15.520]  And police officers, they will need your help
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:19.520]  I know this because every time I'm out at a gun range
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:22.520]  And I'm doing my exercises, I'm doing bilateral shooting
[3:24:22.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  With an AR, I'm doing rapid transitions, reloads, things like that
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:29.520]  I always, when cops are there, they're always coming up to me
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:32.520]  And asking me about their gear, do I have recommendations
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:35.520]  What technique am I using, how am I doing that
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  Some of them recognize me, they thank me for being on the Info Wars
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:41.520]  And they ask for my help
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:43.520]  Cops, by and large, are good people
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  But they don't have good gear
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:48.520]  And they're not allowed enough time for training
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:51.520]  And usually they're not given enough ammo to practice
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:53.520]  To a point of proficiency
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:57.520]  I know that sheriffs and sheriff's deputies are often given 50 rounds a month
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:00.520]  50 rounds a month for training
[3:25:00.520 --> 3:25:02.520]  Okay, that's not even a warm-up
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:04.520]  When I'm on the range, 50 rounds
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:07.520]  That's just, I'm just making sure the trigger is working properly
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:11.520]  In 50 rounds, I'll go through a thousand rounds
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:13.520]  In a typical training
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:15.520]  That's how you achieve proficiency
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:19.520]  And sadly, a lot of cops and a lot of law enforcement don't have that level of proficiency
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:22.520]  They will need the help of military veterans
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:25.520]  They will need the help of citizens who are well trained
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:31.520]  They will need assistance by law-abiding citizens as this civil war unfolds
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:34.520]  Which at this point, sadly, it looks inevitable
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:36.520]  It looks inescapable
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  And on that point, I really want to mention
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:46.520]  The power grid going down, at least locally or regionally, is a very high probability as these things unfold
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:51.520]  And wherever you are, in America, maybe around the world
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:53.520]  But especially if you're in an American city
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  You need to think about how are you going to get by when the power grid is down
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:01.520]  There are several scenarios where the power grid might go down accidentally
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:04.520]  It might be hit with a cyber war false flag attack
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:08.520]  It might be subjected to an EMP effect attack
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:13.520]  If a deep state rogue nuclear missile gets launched into high altitude
[3:26:13.520 --> 3:26:15.520]  And detonated there for an EMP effect
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:19.520]  Or it might be taken down by substations actually being attacked
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:22.520]  And deliberately taken down outside the cities
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:25.520]  Rendering the power grid inoperable inside the cities
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:29.520]  I want you to remember, without a power grid, not only do you have no water
[3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:31.520]  No running water because the pumps don't work
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:34.520]  You have no fuel because the gas station pumps don't work
[3:26:34.520 --> 3:26:39.520]  You have no lights unless, of course, you have flashlights and batteries and things like that
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:41.520]  Which you should have
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  But also, the food stamps don't work
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:45.520]  Retail transactions don't work
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:46.520]  ATMs don't work
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:49.520]  The banks can't process transactions
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  And there are over 40 million people in America who depend on food stamps
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:58.520]  40 million people who probably have done nothing to prepare
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:03.520]  They've depended on the government to allow them to eat every day
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:09.520]  And they go cash in those food stamps every day to get, I don't know, Doritos or Pop-Tarts or whatever they're buying with that
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  Garbage sodas, you know
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:15.520]  What happens when those 40 million people don't have those food stamps?
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:19.520]  They go berserk, they go crazy, without electricity
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  Cities like Los Angeles are not survivable by most people
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:27.520]  In fact, some of these liberal cities are barely survivable today
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:32.520]  Just because of the decay and the destitution and the collapse pushed by liberal policies
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:37.520]  You've got typhoid, an 18th century disease out of control in Los Angeles
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  Needles and feces in the streets of San Francisco
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:47.520]  Homelessness, substance abuse rampant across Seattle, cities in a state of accelerating collapse
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:50.520]  Add to that a power grid failure
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:54.520]  That's a recipe for a total collapse, complete lawlessness
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:59.520]  And a Mad Max scenario at least temporarily in those cities
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  Do not be caught in those cities when that unfolds
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  That is my warning to you today
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:08.520]  Do not be caught in a city
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:12.520]  And there will be no warning time, you must relocate out of those worst zones ahead of time
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:14.520]  If you're not already out
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:16.520]  You need to be outside the inner city
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:18.520]  Get outside the suburbs if you can
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:21.520]  Get to rural America if you can in advance
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  Because what's coming, sadly, it's going to involve a lot of suffering
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:28.520]  A lot of loss of life, a lot of desperation
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:33.520]  And even the average American living in Los Angeles has no idea where to find water
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:37.520]  Where to find food, how to do anything
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:41.520]  The average person, I know there are some, you know, survivalists who do know that
[3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:43.520]  But that's not the majority
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  Much more straight ahead, more analysis coming
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:47.520]  This is Mike Adams here, infowars.com
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:49.520]  We'll be right back after this break

[3:28:59.520 --> 3:29:04.520]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:06.520]  But you don't want to take another pill

[3:30:01.520 --> 3:30:03.520]  I'm so excited, I'm such a big fan
[3:30:03.520 --> 3:30:05.520]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:08.520]  I gotta do a shout out for the bone broth
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:13.520]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth
[3:30:13.520 --> 3:30:18.520]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk
[3:30:18.520 --> 3:30:22.520]  It tastes like oval-team, it tastes like oval-team, it tastes like oval-team
[3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:24.520]  Like good, whoa
[3:30:24.520 --> 3:30:26.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:30.520]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:34.520]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products
[3:30:34.520 --> 3:30:36.520]  So thank you so much for that as well
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:39.520]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:30:42.520]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula
[3:30:42.520 --> 3:30:45.520]  The turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth
[3:30:45.520 --> 3:30:48.520]  It is next level, it really is good, so thank you
[3:30:48.520 --> 3:30:51.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you

[3:31:58.520 --> 3:32:01.520]  In the western world's history
[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:05.520]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order
[3:32:05.520 --> 3:32:08.520]  Not to say the name Alex Jones
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:10.520]  Or infowars.com
[3:32:15.520 --> 3:32:17.520]  This is Nazi Germany level
[3:32:17.520 --> 3:32:18.520]  This is racketeering
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:19.520]  This is cartels
[3:32:19.520 --> 3:32:23.520]  Mr. President, we need your help, we need it now
[3:32:23.520 --> 3:32:25.520]  You can take on Big Tech
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:34.520]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization
[3:32:34.520 --> 3:32:37.520]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones
[3:32:37.520 --> 3:32:40.520]  Then when people say, okay, take him off the air
[3:32:40.520 --> 3:32:42.520]  Everyone else like Domino's would fall
[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:46.520]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever
[3:32:46.520 --> 3:32:49.520]  A standard of freedom and free speech
[3:32:49.520 --> 3:32:51.520]  Understand that they believe they can take us down
[3:32:51.520 --> 3:33:18.520]  We'll take everybody else down
[3:33:22.520 --> 3:33:28.520]  All right, we're going to continue with an analysis of the potential false flag attacks
[3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:32.520]  That deep state might unleash to try to change the narrative
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:34.520]  And of course destroy America
[3:33:34.520 --> 3:33:37.520]  Take Trump out of power and crush the American people
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:41.520]  Silence all voices of patriotism or nationalism
[3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:44.520]  Now, what's important to understand on all of this is that
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:48.520]  This could blow back on them catastrophically
[3:33:48.520 --> 3:33:51.520]  So allow me to explain how that could happen
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:56.520]  And again, thanks for joining me, Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones show, infowars.com
[3:33:56.520 --> 3:34:03.520]  Now, the desperation of the deep state means that they could try anything at this point
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:07.520]  Whatever power they have left, they know that they are fighting for their survival
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:10.520]  They're going to be exposed as time goes on
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  And many of them are going to prison
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:18.520]  Maybe declared guilty of actual treason, which could technically carry the death penalty
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:20.520]  Who knows, we'll see what the courts say
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:25.520]  But they are desperate, so they are willing to unleash absolutely anything
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:28.520]  And you may ask yourself, well, what power do they still have?
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:32.520]  Remember when Obama and Eric Holder ran operation fast and furious?
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:36.520]  They were putting guns into the hands of drug cartels in Mexico
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:38.520]  Trying to create gun violence
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:44.520]  Many people suspect that a lot of the big attacks over the last couple of decades
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:48.520]  From Oklahoma City to 9-11, even though those attacks were real
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:51.520]  There was real destruction and real loss of life
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:55.520]  But there were elements that were exploited by the deep state
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:34:58.520]  In order to pass, you know, the Patriot Act
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:00.520]  Or expand the Patriot Act that already existed
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:04.520]  Or expand surveillance powers that have now been weaponized against the people and so on
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:10.520]  So we know that throughout history, the deep state has in some cases been complicit
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:12.520]  In planning false flag attacks
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:15.520]  And in other cases, they have exploited attacks
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:19.520]  Or allowed them to take place by standing down America's defenses
[3:35:19.520 --> 3:35:21.520]  And what I find interesting in this is that
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:24.520]  You go back just a couple of years, the New York Times
[3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:31.520]  Ran an article about how the FBI would plot domestic terrorism attacks in the United States
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:35.520]  They would recruit homeless people and drug addicts off the streets
[3:35:35.520 --> 3:35:39.520]  Or find someone of Arab descent
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:41.520]  And they would pay them 50 bucks
[3:35:41.520 --> 3:35:43.520]  Here, get in this van, drive this van
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:47.520]  And they would tell them that they're going to blow up the Cleveland Bridge, for example
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:49.520]  That's an actual case, they found a bunch of homeless meth heads
[3:35:49.520 --> 3:35:54.520]  To take part in this FBI plot to blow up the Cleveland Bridge
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:35:56.520]  Or a bridge in Cleveland
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:01.520]  And of course, the FBI then stops the terrorist attack at the last minute
[3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:03.520]  And then issues a press release
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:05.520]  Oh, we stopped terrorism
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:10.520]  No, actually, the FBI has been running around the country plotting the terrorism acts
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:12.520]  And that's not just me saying that
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:16.520]  Again, that's the liberal media has been saying that for years
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:20.520]  I think even the Kansas City Star did a big story on that a few years ago
[3:36:20.520 --> 3:36:23.520]  If I'm not mistaken, it's a well-known tactic
[3:36:23.520 --> 3:36:28.520]  The point is that we know that Obama's deep state, which included the FBI
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:31.520]  And the DOJ and other deep state operations
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:38.520]  They have the means and they have experience at plotting domestic terrorism
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:45.520]  Bombings, drone attacks, even using radiological dirty bombs deployed by drones
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:47.520]  They were part of...
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:52.520]  I believe they were part of one drone attack that could have been deployed against the White House
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:54.520]  For example, I may have to fact check that
[3:36:54.520 --> 3:36:56.520]  My memory may be a little shady on that one
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:36:59.520]  But we know the FBI has engaged in many other attacks
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:04.520]  Many other simulated attacks that they stopped at the last minute
[3:37:04.520 --> 3:37:07.520]  And the FBI would tell you, well, they were using fake bombs
[3:37:07.520 --> 3:37:10.520]  They were using fake explosives, they wouldn't really blow up
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:15.520]  Well, how hard is it for these desperate deep state people to replace their fake bombs with real bombs?
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:17.520]  Not difficult at all
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.520]  And they have proven that certain elements within the FBI
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:26.520]  Have proven that they are, in fact, a domestic terrorism enemy of the state
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:30.520]  I'm talking about the James Comey people and those loyal to James Comey
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:33.520]  They are enemies of America, not the entire FBI
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:36.520]  I know retired FBI agents who are good people
[3:37:36.520 --> 3:37:38.520]  There's a lot of good men and women in the FBI
[3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:40.520]  There's still patriots in there
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:44.520]  But certain sectors of it, certain fringe sectors
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  Are in fact enemies of America
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:49.520]  And they could pull something off, something big
[3:37:49.520 --> 3:37:52.520]  Now, it may boomerang against them
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:37:54.520]  Here's my analysis on that point
[3:37:54.520 --> 3:37:57.520]  Because the bigger the attack that they try to pull off
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.520]  To try to take out Trump, if Trump survives it
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:05.520]  That would give Trump the ability to declare nationwide martial law
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:08.520]  In the aftermath of an attempted major attack
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:11.520]  You know, something on the scale of 9-11 or bigger
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:14.520]  An attempted deep state bombing of the LA port
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:17.520]  I keep coming back to the Los Angeles port
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  It's very easy for them to arrange to have a nuclear weapon
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:24.520]  You know, snuck into the port on a container ship, for example
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:27.520]  Even a dirty bomb in a container, a 40-foot shipping container
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:29.520]  That's not difficult for them to pull off
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:31.520]  And they hate America
[3:38:31.520 --> 3:38:34.520]  The only thing is, I think, they don't want to destroy California
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  So they may choose some other port
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:39.520]  If they could find a port that Trump liked or something
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:40.520]  Maybe they would target that
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:41.520]  These are evil people
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:42.520]  They're insane
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:43.520]  They're psychopaths
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:44.520]  They will try anything
[3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:48.520]  But in the aftermath of that, Trump could declare martial law
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:50.520]  And in that scenario
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:52.520]  He could then, under that martial law
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:56.520]  Go ahead and invoke the arrests of the deep state traders
[3:38:56.520 --> 3:39:00.520]  Have military police go out and seek out
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.520]  A whole list of people to be arrested
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:04.520]  Who have committed treason
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:06.520]  Who have been complicit in this attempted coup
[3:39:06.520 --> 3:39:08.520]  And those people, in my view
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:10.520]  Include specific governors
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:12.520]  Certain mayors of sanctuary cities
[3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:16.520]  They include certain treasonous district judges
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:18.520]  Who have been engaged in this judicial supremacy
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:20.520]  Trying to make sure that America is overrun
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:22.520]  And destroyed from within
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:24.520]  There are terrorist recruiters
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:26.520]  Who are posing as college professors
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:29.520]  In certain universities in California
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:30.520]  Who need to be arrested
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:33.520]  There are people posing as journalists
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:37.520]  Who have been working for mainstream media outlets
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:40.520]  Who are actual traders, domestic enemies
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:43.520]  They have carried out acts of not just sedition
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:45.520]  But treason against America
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:48.520]  And they would need to be on that arrest list as well
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:51.520]  There are a lot of people who should be on that list
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:53.520]  So you know how everything the deep state has tried
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:56.520]  Over the last few years has blown up in their own faces
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:39:58.520]  They never expected to get caught
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:00.520]  With this Russia collusion hoax
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:03.520]  They never expected Robert Mueller to issue a report that said
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:05.520]  Well, we don't have any evidence
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:08.520]  That Trump actually committed a crime
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:11.520]  They never expected the American people to out vote
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:13.520]  The Hillary Clinton vote fraud machine
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:16.520]  And elect Donald Trump to the presidency
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:19.520]  The deep state has never expected to be caught
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:22.520]  They have always seen themselves as above the law
[3:40:22.520 --> 3:40:27.520]  And never, they've never seen themselves as needing to be held accountable
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:28.520]  To anything
[3:40:28.520 --> 3:40:31.520]  And they have always thought that they would get away with everything
[3:40:31.520 --> 3:40:35.520]  And that's why they are so shocked by what's happening right now
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:37.520]  And that's why they are so desperate
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:40.520]  And that's why they are going to overshoot this as well
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  They're going to overshoot this
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:46.520]  They're going to, I believe, attempt to carry out a massive false flag
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:48.520]  It's got a boomerang against them
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:51.520]  They're going to get caught, they're going to get exposed
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  And the president may even use that to go after the deep state people
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:40:58.520]  Have them arrested, have them held for military tribunals
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:03.520]  While all patriots cheer as we take our country back
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:06.520]  And any left-wing domestic terrorism group that takes to the streets
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:09.520]  And tries to stop that process from happening
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:12.520]  Tries to stop the restoration of the rule of law in America
[3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:17.520]  I believe at this point would be met and engaged by American patriots
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:19.520]  Who are defending their nation
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:21.520]  And this is as it should be
[3:41:21.520 --> 3:41:28.520]  This is, I mean, I should say, stopping the treason is as it should be
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:30.520]  None of us want to see any of the violence
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:32.520]  We don't want to see the false flags
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:35.520]  We don't want to see this lawlessness that the left has been pushing
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  We want our country back
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:38.520]  We want our First Amendment back
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:39.520]  We want our Second Amendment back
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:41.520]  We want our religious freedom back
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:43.520]  We want our republic back
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  And if those people who are trying to take all that from us
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:48.520]  If they are willing to engage in violence
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:52.520]  Then we will have to meet and stop that violence
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:56.520]  We will have to take to...
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:00.520]  We will have to defend our country in whatever legal and lawful way as possible
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:05.520]  To support those forces that are invoked by President Trump
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:08.520]  Whether it be National Guard, whether it be military police
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:09.520]  Whether it be local law enforcement
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:12.520]  Those forces that are attempting to restore liberty
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:14.520]  To defend our nation and defend our borders
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:17.520]  And we should only hope that Trump would call for
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:20.520]  In fact, the militia to defend the borders
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:22.520]  The militia is...
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:27.520]  It's the constitutional self-defense, you know, immune system of America
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:30.520]  And there are hundreds of thousands of people who are ready to defend this country
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:33.520]  They're just waiting for the right authorization
[3:42:33.520 --> 3:42:35.520]  So to speak, not that they necessarily need it
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:38.520]  But they are waiting patiently to see if it's going to happen
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:40.520]  So that's my analysis so far
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:41.520]  One more segment coming up

[3:47:21.520 --> 3:47:24.520]  I've had more people come up to me recently in public
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:27.520]  And just thank me for what we are doing
[3:47:27.520 --> 3:47:30.520]  All of us who are independent media, patriots, pro-america
[3:47:30.520 --> 3:47:33.520]  Trump supporters, people who defend life
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:35.520]  And liberty and health and happiness
[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:37.520]  And it's been really interesting
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:39.520]  I've just had, for some reason
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:41.520]  People keep walking up to me now
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:43.520]  Maybe I've been out in public more
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:45.520]  Not at any announced places
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:47.520]  Because that can be dangerous
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  But just, I was in the airport in Houston
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:51.520]  Last week, a couple came up to me
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:53.520]  I was in a restaurant, a couple came up to me
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:55.520]  I was shopping in Austin
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:47:57.520]  A couple came up to me and was like
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:47:59.520]  People love what we're doing
[3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:01.520]  And we've got fans, even all throughout Whole Foods
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:03.520]  By the way, all walking
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:05.520]  Shopping for organics
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:07.520]  And yeah, we love America, defend the borders
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:09.520]  Eat organic food, stay healthy
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:11.520]  So we can stay alive and defend this nation
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:14.520]  And then not everybody fits into a nice little box
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:16.520]  You should eat organic, you should be healthy
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:18.520]  Because you're going to need your health
[3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:20.520]  And that's coming
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:22.520]  Now speaking to that, by the way
[3:48:22.520 --> 3:48:24.520]  As martial law unfolds
[3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:26.520]  Which I believe is going to happen
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:28.520]  I think Trump will at some point
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:30.520]  Invoke the Insurrection Act
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:32.520]  It seems to be the most likely scenario
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:34.520]  It's not 100%
[3:48:34.520 --> 3:48:36.520]  But when it happens, I really want to encourage
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:38.520]  You, all of us
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.520]  We have got to understand the difference
[3:48:40.520 --> 3:48:42.520]  Between martial law under Trump
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:44.520]  Versus a martial law under, let's say Obama
[3:48:44.520 --> 3:48:46.520]  Martial law under a Democrat
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:48.520]  Dangerous, fascist
[3:48:48.520 --> 3:48:50.520]  Police state that doesn't respect your liberties
[3:48:50.520 --> 3:48:52.520]  Martial law under Trump
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:54.520]  Is Trump trying to
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:56.520]  Arrest the deep state traders
[3:48:56.520 --> 3:48:58.520]  And reestablish the rule of law
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:00.520]  And ultimately hand America back to the people
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:02.520]  We should support
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:04.520]  That limited martial law action
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:06.520]  Those military police arrests of the traders
[3:49:06.520 --> 3:49:08.520]  Under Trump, I mean the traders
[3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:10.520]  Ordered, these actions ordered by Trump
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:12.520]  The arrest of traders
[3:49:12.520 --> 3:49:14.520]  Who were working under Obama
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:16.520]  I want to be clear that what I'm saying here
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:18.520]  Trump is trying to go to battle with the traders
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:20.520]  We need to support him in this effort
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:22.520]  So what that means is if you see troops
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:24.520]  On the streets
[3:49:24.520 --> 3:49:26.520]  You need to understand these are friendlies
[3:49:26.520 --> 3:49:28.520]  These are, for the most part, patriots
[3:49:28.520 --> 3:49:30.520]  National guard troops
[3:49:30.520 --> 3:49:32.520]  Are you
[3:49:32.520 --> 3:49:34.520]  And me, it's we the people
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:36.520]  A lot of listeners to this
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:38.520]  They're part of the National Guard
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:40.520]  A lot of listeners to this are part
[3:49:40.520 --> 3:49:42.520]  Of law enforcement
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:44.520]  Of active duty military
[3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:46.520]  Or they may be recalled up
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:48.520]  Because they're currently retired military
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:50.520]  But they could be reactivated by the way
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:52.520]  By the president
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:54.520]  We need to support this effort
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:56.520]  It's a big difference
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:49:58.520]  I mean troops on the streets
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:00.520]  Under the insurrection act
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:02.520]  Under the order of President Trump
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:04.520]  To
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:06.520]  Arrest the actual traders
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:08.520]  Who tried to carry out treason against this nation
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:10.520]  An open rebellion
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:12.520]  If you're trying to sweep in a communist revolution
[3:50:12.520 --> 3:50:14.520]  And take out our republic
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:16.520]  You should be thankful
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:18.520]  That the president has the courage
[3:50:18.520 --> 3:50:20.520]  To order limited martial law
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:22.520]  Insurrection act
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:24.520]  National guard troops to go out and seek out those arrests
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:26.520]  You should be cheering
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:28.520]  You should be waving American flags
[3:50:28.520 --> 3:50:30.520]  As this is happening because it's a necessary step
[3:50:30.520 --> 3:50:32.520]  To take our country back
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:34.520]  So be friendly to these people
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.520]  Be respectful
[3:50:36.520 --> 3:50:38.520]  Understand that they're putting their lives on the line
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:40.520]  Their lives are at risk
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:42.520]  And let's hope that they don't go door to door
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:44.520]  And try to confiscate weapons
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:46.520]  Because that's not going to go over very good with anybody
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:48.520]  I don't know about you
[3:50:48.520 --> 3:50:50.520]  But I'm not giving up my rifle
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:52.520]  To anybody
[3:50:52.520 --> 3:50:54.520]  I don't care if you're wearing a uniform or not
[3:50:54.520 --> 3:50:56.520]  I have the right to keep and bear arms period
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:50:58.520]  You need to go on down the road
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:00.520]  And keep on going
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:02.520]  But then again I live out in the country
[3:51:02.520 --> 3:51:04.520]  They're not going to bother me
[3:51:04.520 --> 3:51:06.520]  And if you live in the country they're not going to bother you
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:08.520]  Confiscate weapons
[3:51:08.520 --> 3:51:10.520]  I hope not
[3:51:10.520 --> 3:51:12.520]  But I do hope they go arrest the traitors
[3:51:12.520 --> 3:51:14.520]  And I hope they have a list of hundreds of traitors
[3:51:14.520 --> 3:51:16.520]  To be arrested because that's exactly what needs to happen
[3:51:16.520 --> 3:51:18.520]  My point is
[3:51:18.520 --> 3:51:20.520]  We've all had a long history
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:22.520]  Of kind of freaking out when we see
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:24.520]  Troops or troop transports
[3:51:24.520 --> 3:51:26.520]  These are Americans people
[3:51:26.520 --> 3:51:28.520]  What you should be freaking out about
[3:51:28.520 --> 3:51:30.520]  Is if it's United Nations
[3:51:30.520 --> 3:51:32.520]  Armored personnel carriers
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:34.520]  Blue helmets invading America
[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:36.520]  Yeah, that's invasion
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:38.520]  Okay, that's something to be
[3:51:38.520 --> 3:51:40.520]  To resist
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:42.520]  I mean the founding fathers gave you permission
[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:44.520]  To resist that
[3:51:44.520 --> 3:51:46.520]  If there's an invasion
[3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:48.520]  In Texas or New Mexico
[3:51:48.520 --> 3:51:50.520]  Or anywhere
[3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:52.520]  If there's a land invasion
[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:54.520]  If there's 5,000 UN troops coming into the country
[3:51:54.520 --> 3:51:56.520]  And starting to kill Americans
[3:51:56.520 --> 3:51:58.520]  You don't need to wait for orders from headquarters
[3:51:58.520 --> 3:52:00.520]  You don't need to wait for
[3:52:00.520 --> 3:52:02.520]  President Trump to say anything
[3:52:02.520 --> 3:52:04.520]  They're shooting Americans?
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:06.520]  You go after them
[3:52:06.520 --> 3:52:08.520]  You activate the Second Amendment defense
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:10.520]  You show them that America is not a place to be overrun
[3:52:10.520 --> 3:52:12.520]  America is not going to surrender
[3:52:12.520 --> 3:52:14.520]  To your globalist agenda
[3:52:14.520 --> 3:52:16.520]  Mr. Obama
[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:18.520]  America is going to defend itself
[3:52:18.520 --> 3:52:20.520]  America has a Second Amendment
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:22.520]  And president or no president
[3:52:22.520 --> 3:52:24.520]  Our founding fathers already gave us permission
[3:52:24.520 --> 3:52:26.520]  To defend this country
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:28.520]  It's called the Second Amendment
[3:52:28.520 --> 3:52:30.520]  And if for some reason the deep state manages
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:32.520]  That's the foundation of the Second Amendment
[3:52:32.520 --> 3:52:34.520]  That's practically just granting you permission
[3:52:34.520 --> 3:52:36.520]  It's time to take the country back
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:38.520]  Because the coup is on
[3:52:38.520 --> 3:52:40.520]  They assassinate Trump
[3:52:40.520 --> 3:52:42.520]  That's an act of war against America
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:44.520]  And let us pray that Trump will be protected
[3:52:44.520 --> 3:52:46.520]  And that they will not successfully take him out
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:48.520]  Even though they've tried many, many times
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:50.520]  We
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:52.520]  We know that
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:54.520]  Actually there is divine influence in this right now
[3:52:54.520 --> 3:52:56.520]  We know that Trump has had some level of divine protection
[3:52:56.520 --> 3:52:58.520]  And we know that
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:00.520]  You know how they say God doesn't always choose
[3:53:00.520 --> 3:53:02.520]  A perfect person
[3:53:02.520 --> 3:53:04.520]  To carry out God's will
[3:53:04.520 --> 3:53:06.520]  But God will choose someone who is perfect for the job
[3:53:06.520 --> 3:53:08.520]  That's Trump
[3:53:08.520 --> 3:53:10.520]  He's not a perfect person, he's a human being
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:12.520]  He's made mistakes in his personal life
[3:53:12.520 --> 3:53:14.520]  Throughout the years, whatever
[3:53:14.520 --> 3:53:16.520]  Everybody has
[3:53:16.520 --> 3:53:18.520]  But Trump's the perfect person to go against this deep state
[3:53:18.520 --> 3:53:20.520]  Because he won't take any more bull from these people
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:22.520]  He just says enough is enough
[3:53:22.520 --> 3:53:24.520]  And he goes to battle with them
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:26.520]  And that's what God wants for America
[3:53:26.520 --> 3:53:28.520]  And the fact that we are fighting back against
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:30.520]  The murder of unborn babies
[3:53:30.520 --> 3:53:32.520]  And even born babies
[3:53:32.520 --> 3:53:34.520]  Missouri now has just passed
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:36.520]  I think a law that outlaws abortion
[3:53:36.520 --> 3:53:38.520]  After eight weeks, I believe it is
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:40.520]  The heartbeat law
[3:53:40.520 --> 3:53:42.520]  Missouri, that's unexpected
[3:53:42.520 --> 3:53:44.520]  I would have thought maybe this would come from other states first
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:46.520]  But you know, Missouri has just done that
[3:53:46.520 --> 3:53:48.520]  And that's to its credit
[3:53:48.520 --> 3:53:50.520]  It's time to stop
[3:53:50.520 --> 3:53:52.520]  I mean, I can't believe I have to say this
[3:53:52.520 --> 3:53:54.520]  Yes, it's time to stop murdering babies in our country
[3:53:54.520 --> 3:53:56.520]  It's time to stop murdering babies
[3:53:56.520 --> 3:53:58.520]  Before they're born and after they're born
[3:53:58.520 --> 3:54:00.520]  Do we have to say that that's wrong?
[3:54:00.520 --> 3:54:02.520]  Do we have to say that
[3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:04.520]  Violence against children is wrong?
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:06.520]  The left is running around saying that
[3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:08.520]  A pregnant mother is not even a mother
[3:54:08.520 --> 3:54:10.520]  They're running around saying an unborn baby
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:12.520]  Isn't a human
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:14.520]  What do they think it is?
[3:54:18.520 --> 3:54:20.520]  A lizard?
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:22.520]  What is in their minds that they think
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:24.520]  An unborn baby is if not human
[3:54:24.520 --> 3:54:26.520]  See, they are insane
[3:54:26.520 --> 3:54:28.520]  And they're just insane enough to try
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:30.520]  To take over this country
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:32.520]  They're going to try a massive
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:34.520]  Communist takeover
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:36.520]  A cultural revolution type of event
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:38.520]  They're going to try false flags
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:40.520]  They're going to try all kinds of crazy stuff
[3:54:40.520 --> 3:54:42.520]  You and I, what we need to do
[3:54:42.520 --> 3:54:44.520]  Just to summarize this whole show
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:46.520]  Is support our president
[3:54:46.520 --> 3:54:48.520]  Be patient with the process
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:50.520]  That's happening with William Barr
[3:54:50.520 --> 3:54:52.520]  Who I have some
[3:54:52.520 --> 3:54:54.520]  Faith in for now
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:54:56.520]  We're going to watch him closely
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:54:58.520]  I don't have blind faith in William Barr
[3:54:58.520 --> 3:55:00.520]  But so far he's done some good stuff
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:02.520]  Let's see if he carries this out
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:04.520]  Sure is better than
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:06.520]  The previous attorney general that we had
[3:55:06.520 --> 3:55:08.520]  Had there who was a complicit in the cover-up
[3:55:08.520 --> 3:55:10.520]  By the way
[3:55:10.520 --> 3:55:12.520]  But support our president
[3:55:12.520 --> 3:55:14.520]  Have faith in the process
[3:55:14.520 --> 3:55:16.520]  But be ready to be activated
[3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:18.520]  In defense of your nation and the rule of law
[3:55:18.520 --> 3:55:20.520]  Be ready to support Trump's
[3:55:20.520 --> 3:55:22.520]  Defense
[3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:24.520]  Against the enemies of this nation
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:26.520]  Whatever Trump invokes
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:28.520]  Insurrection act, military police arrest
[3:55:28.520 --> 3:55:30.520]  Limited martial law in certain areas
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:32.520]  We need your support
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:34.520]  And the president needs to know that you support
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:36.520]  Him in those efforts
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:38.520]  These are strange times, folks
[3:55:38.520 --> 3:55:40.520]  All the rules that you may have known in the past
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:42.520]  Need to be thrown out the window
[3:55:42.520 --> 3:55:44.520]  You have to recalibrate to what's happening right now
[3:55:44.520 --> 3:55:46.520]  Trump has seized control
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:48.520]  Of the executive branch of government
[3:55:48.520 --> 3:55:50.520]  Through our voting
[3:55:50.520 --> 3:55:52.520]  He has been gifted that control
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:54.520]  Is a better way to say it
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:56.520]  He didn't take it by force
[3:55:56.520 --> 3:55:58.520]  We voted him into office
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:56:00.520]  But as a result, we have this very narrow
[3:56:00.520 --> 3:56:02.520]  Limited opportunity for Trump
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:04.520]  To use the power of the presidency
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:06.520]  To defeat the deep state
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:08.520]  And to take our country back
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:10.520]  And if Trump needs to use the military
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:12.520]  To get that done, I say Godspeed
[3:56:12.520 --> 3:56:14.520]  I say God bless you, President Trump
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:16.520]  We the people support you
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:18.520]  All of us in Texas, all of us
[3:56:18.520 --> 3:56:20.520]  In Arizona, Utah, Florida
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:22.520]  Even in rural California, Oregon
[3:56:22.520 --> 3:56:24.520]  Washington, all across this country
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:26.520]  Idaho, Wyoming, everywhere
[3:56:26.520 --> 3:56:28.520]  Even on the east coast as well
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:30.520]  We support you, President Trump
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  We'll back you up
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:34.520]  We're going to take our country back one way or another
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:36.520]  We just hope to do it
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:38.520]  In the most lawful
[3:56:38.520 --> 3:56:40.520]  The most peaceful way possible
