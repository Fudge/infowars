[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.480]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition
[00:44.480 --> 00:54.040]  obviously there is a avalanche a deluge a insane level of news and
[00:54.040 --> 01:00.120]  information coming up on the worldwide broadcast today and we are going to have
[01:00.120 --> 01:06.120]  open phones throughout the three hours as we go over all of the incredible news
[01:06.120 --> 01:13.400]  the latest on so-called immigration reform if you liked the abuse of
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.280]  Obamacare if you like the abject mega fraud you've got the Republican
[01:19.280 --> 01:24.840]  leadership you've got the Democratic leadership you've got the evangelical
[01:24.840 --> 01:31.400]  Christians the Catholics and many other groups lobbying for absolutely totally
[01:31.400 --> 01:36.000]  open borders and free welfare to all the groups that come in and if that doesn't
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.360]  bankrupt things fast enough or drive down your way just fast enough don't
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.040]  worry the offshoring of what's left of our jobs is accelerating and it is the
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.560]  trendy loving cool thing to do so I absolutely support it and Obamacare I
[01:49.560 --> 01:55.920]  think it's all a fabulous idea also support the black boxes that when you
[01:55.920 --> 02:03.680]  go to get gas they will wirelessly download and then tax you by the mile
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.200]  or some states are saying once a year they will jack into the black box and
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.800]  then charging multi thousands of dollars but they just say it's magic that
[02:12.800 --> 02:16.560]  these black boxes do this they promised when they were putting them in they'd
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.960]  never do that but they're just designed for that and to surveil you and track
[02:21.960 --> 02:25.320]  everything you're doing we've been talking a lot about this but now they're
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.880]  moving ahead with it to do it but if you're against being taxed by the mile
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.200]  you're racist so I support it you may say what does that do with being racist
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.720]  doesn't matter it's racist but to hear the article up on info works calm by
[02:38.720 --> 02:44.280]  Mike Adams feds planning a black box vehicle mandate to track tax and even
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.640]  remotely control all personal vehicles that's right that's in there as well
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.000]  with a little radio signal they send out to kill switch your vehicle that was
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.560]  lovingly added as well so sounds like freedom to me just like police now when
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.760]  they pull you over are going to start moving to have you wear a shock collar
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.840]  or bracelet and they're calling for that when you fly as well in fact in fact we
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.080]  should dig up those those videos with Homeland Security from a few years ago
[03:10.080 --> 03:13.880]  and dovetail it with a new shock bracelets police are getting just do you
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.760]  mind wearing this just because you're a terrorist you're all suspects of course
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.600]  the big giant out of control state historically the most dangerous thing
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.760]  oh it's above reproach don't even talk about it or you're an extremist and I
[03:26.760 --> 03:30.960]  just think the evangelicals are doing a great job out promoting a total open
[03:30.960 --> 03:34.400]  borders in the end of the country as we know it under globalism and then they
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.360]  get to also be listed in the official Army training manuals as extremist and
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.320]  that it's illegal to be one and that you'll be court-martialed if you are or
[03:44.320 --> 03:50.040]  give money to them so there you go in fact there's a Washington Times article
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.320]  about it want some torture with your peanuts yeah print that for me but
[03:53.320 --> 03:59.560]  there's also guys yeah there we are breaking it back in the 2012 coming
[03:59.560 --> 04:07.720]  next TSA electro shock bracelets so let's uh let's cover that later we'll
[04:07.720 --> 04:11.920]  do that in the next hour because I want you to know what's coming for you and
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.400]  your family and they'll be like come on man just wear the bracelet prove you're
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.120]  not bad and then of course the move will be have us wear the bracelets at all
[04:19.120 --> 04:22.480]  times you're gonna say what next we can't pack our kids lunches all that
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.760]  already happened oh and no jogging allowed at recess oh let me guess no
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.520]  going to the park if it's rained because the sidewalk slippery oh already
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.120]  happened where I live let me guess next they're gonna give kids in
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.600]  occupations and abortions without parental consent oh already going on
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.800]  coast-to-coast let me guess next they're gonna have cameras in the school

[04:45.240 --> 04:48.080]  gonna watch your kids with government-issued laptops oh been going on
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.600]  for five years oh let me guess next they'll have big off-short Google barges
[04:52.600 --> 04:57.360]  tied into all the Google glasses with the NSA watching everyone oops already

[08:25.360 --> 08:30.240]  my friends we've got a big broadcast lined up today and I have cleared the
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.200]  deck of guests because I want to exclusively get into a ton of news wide
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.240]  spectrum analysis of what's going on and I want to leave some time up and to
[08:40.240 --> 08:44.040]  take a lot of your phone calls as well so after I've shot out some of the
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.240]  different news items and topics out there well open the phones up for a free
[08:48.240 --> 08:54.280]  for all on this worldwide Monday transmission here are the headlines up
[08:54.280 --> 08:59.720]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com ap photo we've also found some
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.800]  video now as well checkpoint cops point guns at americans heads they even had
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.560]  the house surrounded with the person they believe shot at two police wounding
[09:09.560 --> 09:16.280]  them and didn't matter they use those an excuse to lock things down and at the
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.640]  same time then as people just drove through checkpoints right with the
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.760]  window rolled down actually shove in four two to three guns directly in your
[09:26.760 --> 09:32.680]  face at two inches away and this is what happened when dorner they would shoot
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.120]  up multiple vehicles with white women driving them that weren't even trucks and
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.360]  then they would shoot up black people's vehicles who were women and men and then
[09:44.360 --> 09:52.240]  they would shoot up a white guy driving a sports car just oh there's a white dude
[09:52.240 --> 09:55.480]  in a sports car we're looking for a black guy in a truck here let's go ahead and
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.880]  shoot it up but there's two white women two maids coming out with their own car
[10:00.880 --> 10:08.080]  and let's just shoot it up let's just shoot them and I've seen this now
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.520]  routinely every few weeks I see a story where they're looking for somebody or
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.280]  whatever they just randomly shut down highways and you pull up and the cops
[10:15.280 --> 10:19.840]  walk up aiming guns at you because I know that's in all the movies just like
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.560]  they have the prisoner training going on for at least 15 years all public
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.360]  schools where the kids elementary put their hands up and they march out with
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.640]  the cops aiming guns at them look this is all to acclimate the police the
[10:31.640 --> 10:34.960]  children the general public and if you're a cop listing of this and you're
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.760]  arguing with me you just don't know the facts because it's on record that it's a
[10:38.760 --> 10:45.400]  Rand Corporation program for acclimation into martial law and it has
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.600]  nothing to do with the safety of this country the government runs the drugs
[10:49.600 --> 10:52.800]  the government runs and launders the money the government runs the major
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.720]  sex trade for the select corporations that get the money and so the whole
[10:57.720 --> 11:01.760]  drug war the whole police state in fact look at the front page of info wars
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.760]  dot com that is from the event shows the sheriff's department with the guy
[11:06.760 --> 11:13.440]  dressed in a desert commando outfit in some fantasy with his m4 like he is
[11:13.440 --> 11:22.320]  god and just any excuse to run around and corral the public and they have all
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.240]  these excuses but this has never been done before in america it's not done
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.200]  really anywhere this is the this is a country being conditioned and you see
[11:31.200 --> 11:38.000]  it everywhere I have pulled in to a restaurant by central market in south
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.600]  austin this and I'll get into the news this Saturday to meet my wife who was
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.280]  coming back from a swim meet with the kids and she was going on to do some
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.080]  exercise I was gonna pick them up and I turn into a place I've probably eaten
[11:51.080 --> 11:54.840]  200 times the last five years and I'm driving slow through the parking lot it's
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.000]  all my crew gonna test I drive fast on the highway sometimes I'm never in a
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.360]  parking lot and it's a pretty much empty parking lot and I'm driving up and
[12:05.360 --> 12:11.600]  then I just cut across one lane of a parking spaces to park up front at the
[12:11.600 --> 12:17.120]  restaurant and so I drove across an open parking lot as everyone does and this
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.360]  woman on a one of those three-wheeled segways it's not a segue but it's like
[12:21.360 --> 12:29.480]  one zooms up behind me and is in this you know gunfighter stance and she kind of
[12:29.480 --> 12:36.800]  look like well she looked like kind of like a short janet Reno and so I get
[12:36.800 --> 12:40.600]  out of my car she's bugging her eyes out she goes this is private property I can
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.600]  have you thrown out of here for driving like that and I went what'd I do well you
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.280]  drove right across that arrow the wrong way and well it's an empty parking lot
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.400]  but I said okay and she said just so you know and I went whoa that's it I'm
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.360]  turning my camera on so I've got the whole exchange I go up she goes in the
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.200]  restaurant after that to tell him I'm being a troublemaker like I guess hoping
[13:00.200 --> 13:05.040]  they would ask me to leave or something and the manager was a listener and he's
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.320]  like laughing at her he goes man that's like crazy I do that all the time
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.160]  everybody does and he goes can I see the video and I showed him and he goes are
[13:13.160 --> 13:16.680]  you gonna air it he goes you know I probably would and I said no I see so
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.680]  pathetic I'm not going to so I go in the restaurant order food to go my kids are
[13:21.680 --> 13:24.440]  gonna be there in 30 minutes I'm gonna take them home to eat order them some
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.360]  organic food to go I walk out put my kids in the truck when my wife comes in
[13:28.360 --> 13:33.120]  meets me and Darren McBrain pulls up behind me I got video of this he goes
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.480]  man I'm getting my haircut right there and this woman comes in in the commando
[13:37.480 --> 13:43.360]  outfit the security guard he goes it looked like she was armed and she comes
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.640]  in he goes I just had a big run in with Alex Jones he keeps racing around our
[13:46.640 --> 13:49.960]  parking lot all the time and I keep telling him to stop and he almost ran
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.160]  over kids and all this stuff so I'm like whoa now I've almost run over children
[13:55.160 --> 14:01.120]  there's no one in a parking lot I'm driving five miles an hour I mean this
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.560]  country is just unbelievable and I kept saying to her this has never happened to
[14:05.560 --> 14:10.480]  me in my life but I'm having contact with security guards and police now almost
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.240]  every other day I had just had contact with them on the green belt jogging and
[14:15.240 --> 14:19.920]  and and they were harassing other people while I was down there and I'm
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.920]  starting to freak out I mean they are on our back and now I guarantee you they
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.960]  now pull you over and just randomly get your wife up against the hood get your
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.600]  daughter right beside her I'm gonna put on one glove and go in medically it's
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.400]  serious assault period but with the same glove for orifices and they do it in
[14:36.400 --> 14:39.000]  front of you and we'll have another guy sitting there with a gun and a rock
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.560]  ready stance you try something you're going down you're gonna die it is all
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.400]  about their religion of dominating us it is so sick and so now I guess I got a
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.200]  drive-through guys aiming guns at me I've got to just always be taught I'm a
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.440]  suspect by the criminals that run the government I mean I mean look at this
[14:55.440 --> 15:02.560]  photo from the Associated Press scroll down a bit for TV viewers if you look at
[15:02.560 --> 15:07.120]  it and look at how that citizen is looking at them he pulls up and some
[15:07.120 --> 15:14.440]  young cop has his gun right in his face and then there's some obese cop who
[15:14.440 --> 15:19.720]  looks like he weighs 400 pounds in a German curtsle helmet staring at him as
[15:19.720 --> 15:25.360]  well I mean just give me a break our government publicly has armed all the
[15:25.360 --> 15:32.200]  drug cartels in Mexico it's just all a big joke it's this whole gangster
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.800]  culture all of it so I'm gonna be getting into that today and you know tie it
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.240]  into last week the Florida woman arrested for spraying boyfriend with a
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.240]  water gun to make him stop playing video games in America a boyfriend would
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.040]  call the police because his girlfriend sprayed him with a green water gun and
[15:49.040 --> 15:56.680]  they would arrest her by the way they now arrest you if you play tag at school
[15:56.680 --> 16:01.760]  I have articles on that I mean this this country is a madhouse of criminals I
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.040]  mean it's like the guy in Florida released two heart balloons to his girlfriend
[16:07.040 --> 16:10.640]  in the parking lot the state police see it and he's been charged with felonies
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.920]  assaults on the environment they're not going to stop okay it's the spirit of
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.440]  the age it's happened everywhere else it's here so that's some of the news
[16:20.440 --> 16:25.360]  we're gonna be breaking down on that front 20 drills that prove the DHS's
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.320]  official enemy is the American people that article just went up on info wars
[16:29.320 --> 16:33.720]  dot com great research by Kim M from planet info wars dot com her story is

[19:18.040 --> 19:22.600]  fulfill them and they wonder why they're so unfulfilled because it's designed to

[24:17.920 --> 24:36.320]  they need to review this secret world and its power in their government because
[24:36.320 --> 24:43.040]  you run into this rat's nest of concealment and lies time and time again
[24:43.040 --> 24:49.960]  then and now wait a minute that's Bob Woodward on face the nation actual truth
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.760]  on face the nation I am shocked you know what I think we should do by the way
[24:54.760 --> 24:57.800]  Bob Woodward's high-level naval intelligence that was the system going
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.100]  after Nixon when he starts doing stuff like that he represents the major
[25:01.100 --> 25:05.320]  elements of the intelligence community just want to let folks in on the fact
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.600]  that Bob Woodward is a super spy now let's expand out from that point when
[25:10.600 --> 25:15.720]  you get a super spy who's been posing as a journalist for four decades it's a
[25:15.720 --> 25:22.160]  big deal when they come out against the establishment it shows you even the
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.080]  establishment is getting upset because it's very dangerous to have a totally
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.000]  unaccountable rat's nest and in fact we've been trying to think of the new
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.320]  name of the Washington Redskins the Jerry Sandusky's to so many Congress
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.200]  people are pedophiles the pirates are an obvious one but not hardcore enough the
[25:38.200 --> 25:45.600]  tyrants the murderers the torturers the scum the filth the deceivers but the
[25:45.600 --> 25:52.480]  rats nest that's a pretty good name I mean it could be like a dirty rat a
[25:52.480 --> 25:59.800]  mangy rat and then that could be the symbol of the Redskins by the way I
[25:59.800 --> 26:04.000]  did a video over the weekend it's on info wars.com was from info wars nightly
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.280]  news Friday night my official name change is it's satire of the Washington
[26:08.280 --> 26:11.760]  Redskins and I saw some of the people in there going listen here cracker listen
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.520]  here honky or listen here you racist against natives we're gonna get you
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.920]  you racist and all this other stuff you know my point in the video is yes you
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.280]  could say that the name is insensitive if it's taken from some perspective I'm
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.760]  not even defending it I can't stand the NFL is a giant gladiatorial diversion
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.600]  the list goes on and on okay it was Rome Burns were obsessed with the gladiatorial
[26:33.600 --> 26:40.080]  events my point is I get up here and speak out against upwards of 49% of
[26:40.080 --> 26:47.640]  natives under a decade program in the 80s alone being sterilized I actually
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.640]  stand up against the natives having their land continually stolen and not
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.600]  allowed to have sovereignty and have real Native American leaders on like the
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.000]  late great Russell means I'm saying the whole Redskins thing is a political
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.600]  threat football to get us all fighting with each other unintended that's what
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.240]  I'm saying whenever the establishment brings up some
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.880]  racist you is to put salt in the wound and get us all fighting with each other
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.480]  while all of us are having our future raped by the globalist we did the math
[27:17.480 --> 27:20.160]  we should actually do an official piece on this because I forget the exact math
[27:20.160 --> 27:26.880]  earlier this year of their 6,000 superclass worldwide out of seven and a
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.720]  half billion people that do the math again guys if you can in the big
[27:31.720 --> 27:37.040]  calculator if you have seven and a half billion people roughly on the globe and
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.880]  Rothkopf head of the Kissinger group talks to all the top elite in his book
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.880]  that came out seven years ago and included their 6,000 superclass that
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.000]  own and run everything it's really less than that really about a hundred families
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.120]  really about 20 but if you want to say a hundred big ones but but let's just say
[27:54.120 --> 28:02.560]  it's 6 6,000 people what is 6000 not the 1% folks the the point zero-zero-zero-zero
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.940]  zero zero-zero with six zeros and I think like four two something the point
[28:06.940 --> 28:15.880]  is is that it was it it wasn't even a 99999999999999999999
[28:15.880 --> 28:18.880]  nines went on forever it wasn't even that it's
[28:18.880 --> 28:29.280]  99.9999999% of us. It was.000000 and then some four twos. I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[28:30.320 --> 28:34.720]  Okay. And so of course they want to get rid of the 10% that's the middle class. Now,
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.880]  the middle class just 30 years ago was about 35 to 40%, depending on how you looked at it.
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.040]  The new numbers that are out in Money Magazine, and I agree with them is about 10%.
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.560]  In fact, I got a whole list of statistics here. If I have time, I'll get to 29 incredible facts,
[28:48.560 --> 28:52.960]  which prove poverty in America is absolutely exploding. Oh yeah, the New York Subways,
[28:52.960 --> 28:58.240]  the cops finally found humanity there because there's tens of thousands of homeless, mainly old
[28:58.240 --> 29:06.160]  people. And I'll give one thing to New York cops. I have repeatedly whipped out a camera to videotape
[29:06.160 --> 29:12.000]  homeless on the subway or on the street and cops pop out from nowhere thinking that they're protecting
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  the homeless from being made fun of. And then I have to explain to them, no, I'm showing the
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.480]  poverty here. They're like, it doesn't matter. This person lives on the subway, this old woman,
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.480]  and you're not going to show this. So I still flipped the camera out and filmed it sideways,
[29:24.480 --> 29:28.880]  and it's in my film, Martial Law. And the cops telling me I can't, but they thought they were
[29:28.880 --> 29:34.160]  protecting her. They've been arresting these people, but the shelters have been full. So now
[29:34.160 --> 29:38.720]  the cops will not arrest or beat up the homeless people anymore, the real homeless. So they're
[29:38.720 --> 29:42.880]  just flooding all the subways. And there's all these videos and newscasts I saw this morning
[29:42.880 --> 29:48.560]  of the trendy New Yorkers being all grossed out by, you know, the old women sitting in their own
[29:48.560 --> 29:56.160]  urine. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[33:29.200 --> 33:43.680]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live I've covered some of the news but I want you to call in and
[33:43.680 --> 33:51.680]  tell me if you can go online to infoworks.com and look at the AP photos and others and then of course
[33:51.680 --> 33:56.000]  we have all the footage from Boston of them going door to door and dragging women out of their houses
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.880]  by their hair and driving by pointing guns at people in their cars that didn't even look like
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.880]  the suspect because it's all about setting the precedent that we're nobody that we're little
[34:06.880 --> 34:14.000]  and the system it's upper class it's establishment it has the power but I want to know what you think
[34:14.000 --> 34:21.040]  of the AP photo showing the checkpoint with cops pointing guns at Americans heads and earlier this
[34:21.040 --> 34:30.320]  year this happened in some fugitive hunt in Colorado that I saw on the news where they were just
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.240]  shutting down major highways and just pointing guns at families I've seen the you know countless
[34:36.240 --> 34:42.320]  pieces of footage from checkpoints in Iraq and unless a vehicle didn't stop or or unless they
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.080]  didn't meet the description of something suspicious even the Marines and the army didn't point their
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.040]  guns at people at major checkpoints they would have them aiming you know down at the ground they
[34:53.040 --> 35:00.640]  could swing them up in a half second because it's extremely aggressive and is just absolutely one
[35:00.640 --> 35:08.800]  step away from Nazi Germany and then statistically of course we know that the system is not protecting
[35:08.800 --> 35:14.560]  the general public it is the citizens themselves more than nine times out of ten that end up
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.400]  protecting themselves their property and now we have a standing army of trained paramilitary
[35:20.400 --> 35:26.800]  police who are trained to fight an enemy and so of course they see us as an enemy kill kill you
[35:26.800 --> 35:31.360]  know how do you answer the Marine Corps in the army and boot camp to yes sir you don't say yes sir
[35:31.360 --> 35:38.720]  sir no sir you say kill kill kill kill because they're trying to get normal people who aren't
[35:38.720 --> 35:45.120]  killers to become killers and so they've gone and picked through all the police and gotten their
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.920]  special paramilitary units and more and more they've got them out learning how to kill kill
[35:50.560 --> 35:56.000]  with the American people and set up checkpoints where they demand your papers now in Nazi Germany
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.840]  when they demanded your papers they would just walk up and ask for them and have a sidearm on
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.200]  or a man with a rifle behind them now they come up and say let us see your papers pointing guns at
[36:05.200 --> 36:11.840]  your head and you're like do i look like a suspect shut the bleep up or your brains will be all over
[36:11.840 --> 36:18.880]  your car scum now get his wife out in proptology exam her now you don't like it i'm gonna shove a
[36:18.880 --> 36:24.000]  gun in your mouth and blow your brains out we're only a few inches away from that level by the way
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.480]  the video is up on info wars.com jacari jackson went out to cover an open carry in downtown austin
[36:30.480 --> 36:36.480]  with black powder handguns that are totally legal and lawful texas only one of six states where you
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.880]  can't have handguns openly displayed we're trying to repeal that right now i'm trying to get that
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.200]  unconstitutional law overturned yeah texas is pretty pathetic folks we just think we're free
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.600]  that's why we're trying to actually become free and the state police ran up they read them the
[36:49.600 --> 36:56.240]  law and they said we don't care and and literally started assaulting the people they don't resist
[36:56.240 --> 37:02.400]  they take the handgun away the black powder handgun and then they and then the cops on video twist
[37:02.400 --> 37:08.560]  the guy's arm behind his back and shove it up in a torture move that mean they've got to sue them
[37:08.560 --> 37:13.520]  but see if you're torturing somebody at Abu Ghraib that's evil but if it's pain compliance with
[37:13.520 --> 37:18.400]  a slave with a blood bag with food because that's what the america people are now we are the food
[37:19.040 --> 37:25.760]  i mean folks your wife will be thrown on the front of a car and will be assaulted will be raped
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.840]  with the with their hands and and and and the head of the state police here in texas said
[37:29.840 --> 37:35.760]  we're gonna do it we're gonna keep doing it and we stand by it no judge no jury no warrant no probable
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.040]  cause no reasonable nothing we're gonna put our hands in your body and you're an animal you're a
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.440]  dog you know when i would work on cows doing artificial insemination working with a large
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.280]  animal that we would change gloves with every cow that came into the shoot you don't want to spread
[37:49.280 --> 37:54.000]  disease those are valuable cows and we would sit there doing the exams and doing the things and
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.360]  we would change the gloves each time a new cow came in and we're worse than cows we're there to
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.080]  produce money for this system and we're there to provide children for body parts for organ
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.440]  harvesting and that's it and the public acts like that so the public deserves it so you just get
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.120]  ready to drive up with your family and they're going to shove guns right in your face and if you
[38:13.120 --> 38:20.560]  don't like it this is going to blow your brains out if you don't like your wife getting getting
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.160]  getting uh getting a proctology exam or whatever you just try something punk even if you went a
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.960]  lawsuit on us we got your tax money to pay it scum they're going to get all your guns to
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.880]  take all the shots the government loves you so i want to know what all of you out there think
[38:38.880 --> 38:50.160]  about all this 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 now the capital police used to be good down there
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.760]  at the capital and they put a bunch of politicos in there that will run over to our camera guys
[38:53.760 --> 38:58.400]  and scream at them to turn their cameras off we have video of that to air induction others so
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.360]  they've definitely got a new crew over there they're not all bad but they're really back
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.520]  compared to what they used to be the average state police on the road are not as imperious but
[39:05.520 --> 39:08.800]  they're trying to make them that way they're trying to hire a crew like that but this is the
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.400]  conversion all over the country where the police are so arrogant in some jurisdictions they will
[39:14.400 --> 39:21.280]  pull over old ladies 85-year-old ladies in one case in texas with no criminal record and grab
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.800]  two thousand dollars out of their purse and keep it and say that's drug money no judge no jury and
[39:26.800 --> 39:32.800]  say we have an asset forfeiture law that allows us to do this and you know what the law does say
[39:32.800 --> 39:38.800]  that they had laws saying black people weren't humans too in this country they had laws saying
[39:38.800 --> 39:44.720]  they could conscript your sons and make them go fight illegal wars called the draft they had all
[39:44.720 --> 39:52.000]  sorts of laws that are unconstitutional garbage so you can take your law that says you can pull
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.760]  me over and take the cash out of my wallet no judge or jury and you can shove it but by the way
[39:57.760 --> 40:05.920]  here's the good news the globalists are going to rob all their dumb minions as well so i laugh
[40:05.920 --> 40:09.440]  because all the people that think they're really high and mighty all these nobodies that would
[40:09.440 --> 40:15.600]  never been successful in life with their ingenuity their ideas their charm their intelligence all you
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.640]  people that think you found power through the system oh by the way i didn't finish my story
[40:20.640 --> 40:27.760]  before i give the number out it's 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 what do you think of this photo
[40:27.760 --> 40:30.800]  in these videos up on the side of the cops shoving guns in people's faces
[40:30.800 --> 40:38.160]  i didn't finish the story about Darren McBrain so to make a long story short because i've
[40:38.160 --> 40:45.440]  forgotten didn't finish the story i drive through a parking lot five miles an hour by a grocery store
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.480]  the grocery store is probably 200 yards away this parking lot's so big it's an outdoor mall
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.200]  there's like 10 cars in this huge parking lot of a restaurant for some reason nobody was at this
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.880]  restaurant on saturday at like 115 i'm gonna meet my wife in 30 minutes i pull up my truck
[41:01.920 --> 41:07.600]  and this woman on like a weird three-wheeled segway in a uniform pulls up like a like a
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.680]  bad cop like you know like a cop that's arrogant from my view a bad cop a corrupt or not even
[41:11.680 --> 41:18.240]  corrupt just arrogant would be the word look just like big sis meets Janet Reno
[41:18.240 --> 41:25.520]  and when i say bad i don't mean doing anything illegal i mean bad in not the type of cop i
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.480]  would want but it's not even a cop it's a security guard and she's bugging her eyes out at me
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.080]  and so i get out of the car and she kind of you know tells me how bad i am and stuff and
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.200]  i was driving dangerously and i said no i wasn't i just drove in the main entrance and then cut
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.040]  across right there so i start videotaping her and then i go in she goes in and talks to the manager
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.720]  he kind of laughs at her she goes out and he goes you're gonna air that and i go no i'm probably
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.240]  not she's so pathetic then my wife gets there with the kids 30 minutes later i take the food that
[42:00.240 --> 42:07.520]  we're going home to eat get in the car darin Mcbrane shoots up behind me he's in the barber shop
[42:07.520 --> 42:17.120]  that's like 200 yards away and and this security guard drives up on a little thing with flashing
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.960]  lights jumps out runs in and says i just had the most horrible experience with Alex Jones
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.720]  you know he was recklessly driving could have run over children i'm sick of him recklessly driving
[42:28.720 --> 42:36.480]  around here so bearing false witness right there i'm recklessly driving not true i'm doing it all
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.440]  the time i almost ran over children none of it's true so it's like i've already forgiven her i'm
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.800]  thinking man man that's pathetic boy we're in trouble because everybody i know is having these
[42:46.800 --> 42:54.080]  contacts a guy in combat uniform with tim fruget we haven't aired this video yet and a metallica shirt
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.520]  tim never goes to walmart but his but his box fan was broken he likes a fan to sleep
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.520]  was he and his fiance we haven't aired this video yet we should air this now i forgot about
[43:05.520 --> 43:09.120]  this we have this for months we go ahead and air this we forgot to air it and they go let
[43:09.120 --> 43:12.960]  us see the receipt he goes here it is and they go you're going to show it to me right now it's
[43:12.960 --> 43:19.440]  going to reach for him and tim goes hey forget it i'm not going to shop here i got my fan right
[43:19.440 --> 43:23.440]  here i just paid for it go ask them because they were rude to him it's the it's the it's
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.200]  the arrogantness on top of it so he walks out and this guy comes out goes i'm calling the police
[43:27.200 --> 43:32.400]  on you he goes go ahead he goes don't ever come back to walmart we've got your name you're in a
[43:32.400 --> 43:38.400]  band list you'll be arrested he goes fine i won't and then the cops show up and he's like i got you
[43:38.400 --> 43:45.520]  now well he tim had called jacari jackson that lives right by it jacari gets there in about three
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.760]  minutes he's amazing he always answers the phone and got footage then the guy runs over and says

[43:54.960 --> 44:00.320]  footage you guys we never aired this piece did we okay well wait because i want to air it on the
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.720]  nightly news and really build it up because i've forgotten about this my point is is that
[44:06.240 --> 44:12.480]  everywhere i go now people will jump out and tell me what to do including citizens i mean
[44:12.480 --> 44:19.440]  this is like north korea or something and every week i see footage of where they'll have a checkpoint
[44:19.440 --> 44:23.760]  not at the end of a neighborhood not with people or they're looking for somebody and saying a blue
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.840]  pickup truck a white male with black mustache no they randomly will just stop everyone and come up
[44:29.840 --> 44:35.680]  and point guns at men women and children and then in new york city they've had three cases in the last
[44:35.680 --> 44:42.080]  year i know of where they shoot nine innocent people or where a repair guy is pulled over on
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.400]  the brooklyn bridge they go over and shoot him and then try to cover it up or a few weeks ago
[44:46.400 --> 44:52.160]  where they shot a bunch of people i mean it's like we're there in the game duck hunter or something
[44:52.160 --> 44:59.040]  just for them to shoot for their fun or their video game and man if a cop gets shot like happened
[44:59.040 --> 45:04.400]  in california they go nuts and like have a police riot on the public and then just decide it's time
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.800]  to shoot up a bunch of innocent people and oh there's two women with blonde hair we're looking for
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.720]  a black navy veteran here let's shoot up their vehicle oh there's some more white women let's
[45:12.720 --> 45:19.680]  shoot them up oh there's a black lady let's shoot her up and they shut down half the state in a big
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.280]  pity party over a couple dead people you signed up to be warriors you act like the most obsessed
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.560]  with safety cowardly people i've ever seen in my life and then it's like this upper class thing to
[45:30.560 --> 45:35.760]  wear camo and armor and strut around we're all supposed to be scared of you i see cops everywhere
[45:35.760 --> 45:39.440]  now that bug their eyes out and look at you like you're supposed to be scared of them hell i see
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.240]  a bully acting like that i want to stop your ass into the ground that's what happens when i'm walking
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.640]  around and see some guy posing like he's mr. tough guy wants to get in a fight with somebody
[45:49.280 --> 45:52.320]  i won't go down to sixth street even though they got some good restaurants down there
[45:52.320 --> 45:58.560]  there for at least five years because every time i'm down there even when it's not late they have
[45:59.280 --> 46:04.160]  roid head bouncers and cops with shaved heads and tattoos all over them starting fights with
[46:04.160 --> 46:09.520]  people and and shoving people and getting people's faces i don't want to be around you i don't go to
[46:09.520 --> 46:16.560]  mexico because the cops act a little bit like that a little bit like that and man i'm getting
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.480]  around when i see cops standing around in like some kind of combat outfit bugging their eyes

[46:32.480 --> 46:38.960]  a fairy tale man the stinking government's the threat it runs al qaeda i mean i can't imagine
[46:38.960 --> 46:42.960]  if i walked around acting like i was going to beat people up i would expect people to come over and
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.120]  get into fight with me i mean i grew up in dallas folks people that walked around like that if you
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.960]  walked around the street for two minutes like you wanted to fight somebody would just stop their car
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.400]  and get on go what are you looking at me like that for you want to get in a fight and there'd be
[46:54.400 --> 47:01.600]  people going to the hospital man you walk around like that you better be ready i am sick of your

[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  korea because i don't want to be around it i don't live in mexico i don't be around it and now i live
[47:16.000 --> 47:23.920]  in a third world country with a bunch of little boys playing soldier i'm sorry occasionally some
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.440]  of your little drug dealer pals shoot at you or something because they play shoot them up games
[47:29.440 --> 47:34.240]  all day and think they're you know cool prisoners or whatever i mean i'm so i hate the let me tell
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.720]  you the little gang member thugs act just like the cops it's the same thing i'll be at a gas station
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.040]  it could be white thugs black thugs white thugs you know wife beater shirts getting out bugging
[47:43.040 --> 47:47.760]  their eyes like look they got a problem i'm going oh god i go if i look down they're going to say
[47:47.760 --> 47:50.960]  something and then i'm not going to be able to handle it i'm okay i got the rifle right there
[47:50.960 --> 47:54.480]  in the back of my car i'm not going to get to fight with them but if they come over here i'm
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.880]  going to just get my car and drive off they try to they pull a gun how fast can i get to that rifle
[47:58.880 --> 48:04.240]  i mean this is the country i live in folks with all these little thug men and this thug culture
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.520]  and this gangster culture and this mtv want to be tough guy culture and all these hollywood movies
[48:09.520 --> 48:17.040]  with arnold schwarzzenegger and um and and that other roi head sylvester Stallone all acting
[48:17.040 --> 48:22.480]  tough running around and and people and you go see those movies it's full of cops and military
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.680]  actually believing all that's real but it's always the cadets it's not real soldiers that
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.040]  actually want to go see stuff like that because all it does is give them flashbacks they know it's
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.800]  not even real i know i've gone into a rant we're gonna go to your phone calls when come back i'm
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.640]  sorry i didn't even mean to go off into all that oh man i just i just can't handle it anymore
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.080]  i just can't handle it no more this country is such a joke i mean it's such a joke
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.120]  and i don't say that with pleasure i'm sad about it we have to admit that we're a joke
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.440]  if we're ever going to turn this country around we've got to admit and again it's not just the
[48:57.440 --> 49:01.760]  cops the cops on average i gotta say compared to the general public on average are better people
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.320]  but they got thug ones and they're even more dangerous when you get a little gangster want
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.880]  to be with a badge and a gun it's very upsetting to me i mean i walk in places and you'll see
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.960]  like some one little thug bugging their eyes out here something and you try to ignore them
[49:15.520 --> 49:21.280]  you know what it is i don't like fake men i'm gonna be honest with you i'm a very loving sweet
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.120]  caring compassionate person and i'm the type of person like a dog if somebody bugs their
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.680]  eyes out at me or gets in an aggressive stance i start getting an aggressive stance and i don't
[49:31.680 --> 49:37.520]  like that there's no reason for everybody to be acting like this and i rue the day i pull up and
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.880]  cops are pointing guns at me for their egos or whatever or because they're living in fear
[49:43.920 --> 49:47.680]  and that's why they're so upset when we have open carry rallies because they're the only ones
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.360]  they're allowed to have guns they're the only ones that are they're meh meh meh meh you know by the
[49:53.360 --> 49:59.200]  way pointing a gun at someone without probable cause without believing you're an imminent threat
[49:59.200 --> 50:06.560]  is is a type of assault and and it is menacing with a deadly weapon and it's illegal and there's
[50:06.560 --> 50:11.680]  a bunch of laws it breaks and i personally am sick and tired of it and and we don't have any

[55:51.440 --> 55:56.960]  you see and and this is all about you're not allowed to do anything that's why everybody
[55:56.960 --> 56:00.960]  now is going to come into contact with government bureaucrats and citizens that feel like they're
[56:00.960 --> 56:07.360]  part of the establishment the average jellyfish citizen who supports this system thinks that
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.080]  by groveling to it and embracing and it gives them power when actually it destroys their whole
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.960]  future but they don't know that they don't know america had more private property more wealth more
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.920]  power because we were the most aggressive most individualistic and we still had a lot of problems
[56:21.920 --> 56:29.440]  but we were the best now we've completely flipped that's how things often are in the world to where
[56:31.360 --> 56:38.400]  we are the lowest IQ most unhealthy dumbest people on average now we still have a huge group of people
[56:38.400 --> 56:44.640]  that are the hardest working most intelligent despite all that but we're now the the the dinner
[56:45.920 --> 56:52.240]  we're now what's left we're now blamed for it we're now bad and the big ultra rich lobby and

[57:05.200 --> 57:09.040]  but i was listening to the words to it again this morning and pulled them up on my iphone
[57:09.040 --> 57:15.920]  and it's absolutely true about life and that's what we're dealing with here is the system does
[57:15.920 --> 57:22.800]  not want people to ever have to go through losing because if you lose and go through adversity
[57:23.840 --> 57:31.200]  then you will learn how to win you've got to lose to know how to win it's very very simple
[57:31.200 --> 57:36.560]  but there's no dodgeball then there's no tag then there's no running and then you're not your mom is

[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.280]  where turn out they already had the fugitive at the house down the street surrounded it but
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.360]  why not just set up some checkpoints in there by area and point guns in the window in people's faces
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.960]  and they did this in boston so this is the policy this is what they're trained to do now
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  and then literally they've got job of the hut over there looking at the guy you know bugging
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.320]  his eyes out at him as well right now let's go ahead and let's talk to jeff in north carolina jeff
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.200]  you're on the air yeah thanks alex um keep up the good work i'm just calling in regards to
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.760]  that stunning picture there in sacramento area and you know what comes in my mind is betrick
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.760]  bonhoeffer and some of the things that he said and he alluded to in regards to his stance against
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:54.160]  the nazis and i think of course paraphrasing the point he made was if the people had arisen
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.680]  and had actually made those serving the system in terror to do their jobs it would never have
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:08.960]  gotten to the point that it did and unfortunately you know as a twice sworn defender of the constitution
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.760]  when you see those things going across the country uh it it is a high time that we exercise our
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.360]  natural rights to self-defense and utilize deadly force if necessary to defend against such uh
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.080]  let me ask you this i mean if you're driving up to a checkpoint with 100 cars and they're coming
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.280]  up to the window pointing guns at men women children whites blacks Hispanics they're looking for a
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.080]  white guy and they're aiming guns at white guys hispanics black people it'd be one thing if it's
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.920]  a red truck with a black guy or white guy that meets the description yeah you're going to get
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.160]  guns aimed at you but i mean just aim guns right at everyone and come over and question somebody
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.040]  with a gun right your face i mean i'm going to get angry about this you know i'm i'm along
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.000]  the brad pit lines and the glorious bastards i hate nazis and and i and what but what americans do
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.800]  with nazis is what we should do nazis should die that's what americans do to nazis it's really simple
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.680]  well it's definitely authoritarianism the issue is that who is training the police to do this
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:15.040]  because we saw them shoot up not one not two but three no no four vehicles
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.000]  in three cases white people that they clearly could see were white people and another case it
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.040]  was a black woman during the dorner thing remember that and then black guys that actually looked like
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.960]  dorner had shirts on saying don't shoot me i'm not dorner i don't blame them i mean my god if two
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:38.240]  blonde haired women get shot up and then another group of i mean i mean it's what do you say that
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.360]  insanity is i mean what is it we're broad daylight two women get in a car doesn't even match dorner
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.640]  and then you shoot their vehicle up well unfortunately my seven-year-old daughter has
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.200]  to be trained to understand and know that the police are not there to help her and that she
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:00.080]  needs to treat them at great arms length and to always expect the worst from them and that's just
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.400]  the place that we're at and you and i both know that they're recruiting the worst of the worst from
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:10.000]  fallujah and other locations that still need that i've talked to them i've met with them i confront
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.240]  them all the time that we're looking for that same rush that same buzz that they got over there
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.640]  from kicking down doors and kicking ass and taking names and using their weapons and they have to
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.280]  have that rush well i was about to say i mean more and more you see like a normal cop actually
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.040]  sitting there at the mall or on the street looking for things that's fine you say hi how you doing
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.000]  a lot of cops now the big roi head type guys they're bugging their eyes out just like thug
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.400]  bouncers that's why i won't go hear live music because i don't want to be around those type of
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:44.880]  guys you know i mean it's it's look i know thug bouncers that are now austin cops and again regular
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.880]  bouncers that are sitting there doing their job that's fine but you know the clubs where they hire

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:33.360]  well under homeland security military occupation martial law phase in conditioning that's coming
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:40.400]  on all over the country if there's a backfire by a school uh or if somebody shoots at the cops they
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.280]  will shut down sometimes half the city of a place like boston and then they'll go door to door and
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.240]  aim a gun at your wife or your husband or your children that look nothing like the suspect
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240]  they'll grab you by the hair just for a little extra fun because they've done it in felugia or
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.360]  they've done it in bag data they've done it in cobble we just talked to a veteran who was discussing
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.120]  and i've talked to some of these cops yeah it's the same deal they have this crazed door kicking
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.520]  training and they're doing it in america now and they love it they're addicted they enjoy it
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.000]  that's why you don't have a paramilitary police you have peace officers because
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.840]  a paramilitary police kill people and break things you know if we had a shooting in the
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.160]  ut tower like we had back in the early 60s it wouldn't have been a citizen charging up there
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.080]  to shoot the guy with a cop behind him and i've had the cop that did it you know who was with him
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.400]  it was a citizen that got the first shot off and hit him with a shotgun and that's on record
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:38.800]  nowadays if a terrorist aka citizen or if a food unit the irs calls us inventory or human resources
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.680]  if a human resource blood bag uh mosquito food tried to go up the tower to take somebody out
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.920]  they'd be shot in the back just slave with gun dead and that's the training uh if citizens pulled
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.240]  guns out uh and started firing on the tower to keep the guy down guaranteed the cops would kill
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.440]  every one of them the ut police would guaranteed you'd all be dead and they'd say well they saw
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.920]  him pull a gun and fire at the tower but you know someone was firing from the tower does it matter
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.360]  and then we go here's a gold medal you're a drone pilot here's a higher honor than a purple heart
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.440]  you are the greatest hero i mean this is the sicko system where you've got all these video
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.040]  game playing kids that then go join the military they get the mentally ill ones that love it and
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:32.240]  put them on the police force and so we have the photo uh in sacramento after a gang member
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.400]  shot and injured several law enforcement officials not servants but gods before going into hiding in
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.760]  sacramento suburb on friday police responded by setting up a checkpoint aiming guns and innocent
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.000]  people's heads yeah and i went and researched this this morning i saw the story yesterday
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  turns out they believe he was already in a house and we're surrounding it just while they did this
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.360]  i guess to keep him from fleeing uh this happened but but but imagine everyone in the neighborhood
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.040]  having a gun pointed at their head of course under dorner they did it to half of southern california
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.400]  and shot up a bunch of again blonde haired women because they look like a black guy uh the photo
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  as an ap caption to california highway patrol officer another emergency responder
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.680]  stop a vehicle at a checkpoint near the neighborhood where a federal immigration officer
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.680]  was shot and three local police officers were wounded during a violent confrontation with a
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:29.040]  suspect in sacramento suburb of roseville and it was after hours of local standoff the suspect
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.640]  32 year old gang member samuel nathan doran probably connected ms 13 or something i'm guessing
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.200]  eventually surrendered after leaving a nearby house in which he had been holed up what if there's
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.480]  a real drug war like they have in mexico with thousands dead per month in america what if the
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:50.720]  mexican drug gangs that aren't afraid to die actually start shootouts with the u.s police i mean
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.240]  will they just lie in random citizens up and shoot us the nazis would do that if you shot
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:02.000]  a nazi soldier they'd kill five or ten people in poland in ukraine other areas uh in the balkans
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.280]  as well if you shot an officer sometimes they would kill 100 200 people i'm not kidding you
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.400]  can look it up i got i told the story before his name was um what was the blind beast name hindrick
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.720]  something i know when he got shot while driving uh in uh eastern europe and then they kill i think
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.520]  like 300 people or something in the town as punishment and i think that's what they ought to
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.120]  adopt they should have killed all all those people in the neighborhood and burned their houses down
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.920]  just to show them and that's pretty much already how it is so i want to give you that idea
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.280]  uh out in sacramento i mean maybe that's what it was with the dorner deal hey there's some
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.080]  blonde haired women shoot them there's a white guy shoot him there's a black lady shoot her you
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.640]  know just shoot their vehicle up so uh there you go and we have that article we're going to be
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.000]  getting into that we're going to your calls and then at the bottom of the hour there's some big
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.920]  breaking news on the obama care situation and here's forbs despite glitches these are not glitches
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.640]  this is all according to plan obama care profit windfall to insurers well underway oh there's no
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.600]  glitch involved in the doubling and getting rid of the law and a gang rape you financially
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.680]  and so we got a big stack on that i'm going to get to and then we're going to get into
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:25.600]  to nsa denies obama knew of spying on german leader and of course we know directly where
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.160]  they've learned this tactic of not knowing anything on fast and furious uh not knowing
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.960]  anything uh on the irs persecuting uh tea party groups of course then it turned out the white
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:46.240]  house ordered it well obama says he knows nothing this time as well simply classic to have this
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:53.120]  going on and unfolding all right let's uh go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:59.440]  jeremy in toronto canada well in the past they didn't just set up checkpoints like in
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.760]  boston over half the city and then sit there and air guns uh or or or or point guns that people
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.480]  point blank and grab women by their hair do you think this is a good idea and should they have
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.800]  just nuked boston to get the bad guy i mean perhaps that's the idea is it good to have troops
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:23.120]  marching up and down the street aiming guns at people should we uh should we do that i think
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.200]  we all know the answer to that alex i have a lot of friends that live in um america and we've been
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.920]  talking a lot about your politics lately i just had something i came across um yesterday that
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.640]  really disturbed me if you can just give me a couple minutes of your time here i'm a first-time
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:47.440]  caller for the record long-time listener um it was a report now it's unconfirmed but it's a report
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.000]  by um a reporter north carolina by the name of pamela chauffeur i don't know if you've covered
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.880]  this before but she interviewed an unnamed um source he was a staff sergeant in port lewis
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:07.200]  and um some of the new what what she said was quite disturbing that there were guillotines stored
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:14.560]  in fort long fort bragg fort hood and across the nation also in germany also stated in this
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:21.200]  interview were 102 thousand box cars with shackles yeah listen brother i appreciate your call i've been
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.840]  on the air 18 years and i've heard this for 17 years every week and it's always a truck dumped
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.400]  over in houston or a truck dumped over in albuquerque here a truck dumped over in new york and had
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.040]  the marshal law signs and there's guillotines at all the basis what there are is trains with mobile
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:47.200]  one-room prison torture cells that were shipped by the tens of thousands to uh afghanistan and iraq
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.480]  to carry out torture and execution operations and they've now deployed these all over the united
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.680]  states and no one that i know in media or anywhere else ever covers the civilian inmate labor camp
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.680]  program the emergency centers establishment act program the open army field manuals training
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.960]  for gun confiscation quarantining of cities uh all of it is public but no one will ever touch it
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:19.760]  they will say i heard alex said there was a plan for marshal law when that we know the cog plans
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.920]  we have the miami herald articles and for whatever reason citizens don't communicate by actual facts
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:34.160]  it's like oh i heard google is cia now it was founded by the cia and nsa on record look it up
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:41.520]  in tutel 14 years ago it's on record and so i'm not mad at the caller it's just
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.880]  i could go do an interview with an unnamed source and have them talk about how they saw the guillotines
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.320]  and people would freak out it'd be seen 10 million times but if i actually show you civilian inmate
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.400]  labor camp program on screen right now publicly declassified that they have these camps already
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.720]  set up for slave labor around the country primed with federal and state prison labor no one no one
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:13.440]  cares i mean if i have footage in my police state films of marines training to put militia members
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.600]  on their knees and shoot them in the back of the head on video and then the marine officer running
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.480]  up saying turn your camera off doesn't get more dynamic you know people say about that it's fake
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.320]  even though i have the newscast the news articles that i was in covering it and that event is on
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.360]  record to have happened people will not believe it they will believe nothing real everything fake
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.800]  i don't mean to go off and ran i want to go to more calls here and i'm not mad at the caller
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.400]  bringing that up it's just that they already guillotine you with the hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.200]  in the water they already guillotine you with a gmo designed to kill the mammals that eat it over
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.400]  time it's called softkill they already guillotine you uh with the aluminum dioxide you know the
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.480]  whole chemtrail program it's not called chemtrails it's called geoengineering atmospheric uh testing
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.160]  giant five billion dollar a year program adding it to the jet fuel the airline pilots the companies
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.920]  don't even know there's only a few thousand people that are but it's all public how they do it where
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.200]  they do it all of it's totally public so it's the biggest mystery in the world just like the
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:25.520]  federal reserve is totally private owned by six foreign banks and then everyone debates is it really
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:32.160]  federal when it's not federal on record it's a hundred years old this year so i'm gonna go to

[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.120]  i'm going right back to your calls and at the start of the next segment i will cover a massive
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.200]  stack of news and give you a quick breakdown of what i think the problem is i'll see some story
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.080]  and get mad about it and start ranting but at least i'm awake at least i'm not in a coma going
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.400]  along with all this and thank god you're waking people up i either hear that everybody's waking
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.040]  up or nobody's waking up it's very funny it's either or and you hear that with the callers
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.520]  i know you experienced that out there i would i would first tell people hey you know they've
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:40.080]  taken folks pension funds and raised their taxes to basically bail out foreign banks in europe and
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.240]  that's already starting here you know that america's losing its basic freedoms you have power to stop
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.560]  it you have power to make a difference the main reason people laugh at you is they're in a trance
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.880]  their tv heads they don't believe in themselves and so you start telling them about bad stuff
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.400]  that's going on i mean i used to hear 18 years ago from old timers that they were training foreign
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.280]  troops i didn't know that it was in news articles and documents till later i mean just a few years
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.560]  ago they had the winter olympics in canada and they had us troops up there patrolling the streets
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.400]  and vice versa here now and they have deal signed to quote use mexican and canadian troops here in
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:28.240]  america so yes that is a plan under the fema directives in le09 was one of the places where
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.400]  they admitted a lot of it national level exercise 09 where they simulated 15 nations coming in and
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.360]  helping stabilize america from a battle with domestic insurgents and i have a new article out
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:49.120]  today that's up on info wars dot com 20 drills that prove the dhs that dhs's official new enemy
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:54.320]  is the american people that's kind of a cockamamie headline actually came up with that headline it's
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.600]  probably it's official dhs admits the american people are their main enemy but whatever the
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.040]  point is is it's from their own website everything they do is to fight the tea party and got owners
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:12.880]  i mean that's all they do so because what does the tea party want they don't want foreign banks
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.680]  to take over they want low taxes they want family rights they want religious rights they want basic
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:24.320]  america and so they've got to be demonized and you notice they aren't let's go ahead and go back
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.480]  to land in an arizona they'll go to frank truth raider david robert and others so so most people
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.120]  you talk to say you're crazy what are you saying to them like let's say i'm your neighbor and you
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:41.520]  come over you say hi bob how you doing what do you say to me he looks at me and he says what where
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.040]  are you getting all this stuff i said i study i watch certain programs i don't watch box news
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.480]  because what i hear on the alex jones show i hear on box a few days later so what's good is
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:27:00.480]  it watching box or any of them other programs i give out my subscription to other people so they
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:07.840]  can see it for themselves and i had a federal officer across the street he was a parole officer
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.120]  talking to a friend of mine and i went over there and i started asking him questions about the bnaa
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.240]  and he said no it isn't and i said you got a damn computer right there why don't you look it
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:26.080]  because i won't back down from anybody you dare to talk to a god oh yeah i'm i said you can i this
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.480]  is my exact word you can arrest me right now for what i'm saying but you know y'all are a bunch
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.640]  of crooked you know and i said and then he looks and he says oh i guess it is and i says you're
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.280]  here a police officer i said what what are you gonna do when shit goes down and he says well
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.480]  i'll probably go home to my kids and i said well that's probably a good answer well brother i gotta
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.040]  i gotta let you go but but this this profanity thing people are doing you get delayed out on
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:58.080]  the radio and that's 90% of the audience is amon FM stations and then you don't get heard i want
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.640]  to hear what you have to say i know you're upset but let's try to keep the english clean myself
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.960]  included i use a few little minor you know non-fcc violating pejoratives let's all just stop it
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.240]  together let's make a commitment okay but i understand why you're scared or concerned or
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.680]  angry yes the ndaa the government says they could secretly disappear us torture us and kill us
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.360]  that is the sign confession the government's rogue and illegitimate we don't want to be enemies with
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.240]  the bureaucrats the cops any of these people but there's been major psychological studies done
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:36.160]  in fact here's one of them i'm going to carry this book and get this get this phd's psychologist
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:41.520]  slash that guy who's gone the psychopath next door national bestseller and this is what i've
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.840]  already found historically researching with this book which we're not selling it so i'm giving
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:52.560]  it a free plug here boils down the whole deal how throughout history why do governments always go so
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:02.000]  bad because you get bad people that want the power in them i mean why do you end up you know having
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.560]  perverts that like to abuse women so many times that end up running topless bars because that's
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:12.560]  what they're attracted to i mean why do bears climb up in trees and try to get beehives down
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:17.600]  because it's got honey in it i mean why do pedophiles go to schoolyards try to pick up kids
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:23.360]  because they're pedophiles folks and so that's why you keep the government on the shortest leash
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.600]  instead the government says we're all secret you can't touch us you can't look into us
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:34.240]  you can't question us that's terrorism but we're gonna do whatever we want including body cavity
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.200]  searches of women all over the country on the side of the highway where you'll have two or three
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:44.080]  women lined up and the cop doesn't even change their glove just the body cavity searches sexual
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  assault now it's a medical malpractice attack by an unlicensed raper we're on the march the empires

[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:38.880]  800-25-99231 the good news here is that whether it's bob woodward of the washington post or whether
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:47.520]  it's latimer putin of russia uh whether it is the pope in roam whether it is uh cy hirsch of new
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:55.200]  yorker magazine or whether it's the wall street journal a few months ago basically the la times
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:02.400]  you name it everyone left right libertarian center anyone that cares about their children
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:09.600]  anyone who cares about stability anyone that cares about any justice who doesn't want to
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.640]  live in a third world country is freaking out right now the government is run by criminals at
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.520]  every level who aren't even watching each other they're looting everything they don't care if
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:24.640]  anything works anymore suddenly trains and buses are breaking down everywhere highways are falling
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:31.520]  down i've got statistics pouring in stuff's just rotting everywhere because false reality has been
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:38.480]  brought in a false paradigm communism fascism any of these systems end up collapsing because
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.200]  they're based on fraud well the globalists created an offshore globalism where their tax
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.840]  exempt they have unlimited trillions they control money at the issuance point they get first use of it
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:58.560]  tax free um interest free in some cases they just get absolute free uh you know money up front in
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:05.520]  the form of derivatives and they're able to buy up the world while trying to restrict everyone else's
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.600]  capital so that they can take over the rest of the markets they don't dominate when they already
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:17.120]  dominate and vertically integrate almost everything they want to shut everything down as a tool of
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.400]  political control and i know i say that every show because that's the essence it's the heart it's all
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:28.080]  of it this isn't some tyranny where they just want to run things this is a tyranny where they're
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.720]  really anti-human and really anti-civilization and their excuses well humans are destructive
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:41.760]  humans are overpopulated so we've got to shut things down and reduce things to control people
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.640]  but then meanwhile they make the public as decadent and dumb down and slothful as they can
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.560]  and the globalist target the most intelligent the most beautiful the most hard-working as their
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:58.480]  competition and write white papers saying that this would be incredibly cold-blooded it was just
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:04.960]  pure eugenics but instead it's eugenics to make everyone dumb slobs ahead of the culling
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.640]  but they need them all as dumb slobs first to go along with the scientific control grid going in
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.720]  where every appliance will have tracking surveillance kill switches and taxation switches in it
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.800]  taxing and tracking and micromanaging everything you do they know you're resilient they know once
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.800]  you wake up you'll get back to being hard-working and aggressive and they're going to run a whole
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:32.640]  robot drone combat robot war on us once this whole thing's in place and they're going to
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.040]  artificially shut everything down incrementally where there's almost no way to stop them i mean
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:44.160]  it's so hellish what they're setting up and they say all this i've made films and covered it here
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.080]  this is not my opinion i told you obama care wasn't going to work it'd be death panels doubling in
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.880]  price the system wouldn't work up front because it's not meant to work it just lets them double
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.160]  your insurance cut the quality of care the only people who are going to get health care of the
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.360]  illegal aliens i'll explain that in a minute and that's only till they get them here once they fully
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.280]  collapse stuff they're not going to get anything and the fences are there to keep them in here
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.600]  man you think they're going to they want to use the west to keep the third world down so they
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.960]  don't have their own revolutions use us as a steam valve which burns up the west at the same time
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.800]  it's all been stated it's all been planned by the gangster globalist who aren't smart enough to
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.880]  look 10 steps down the road what this is going to do i'm going to your calls but let me get the big
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:41.040]  news blitz and settle down a bit and do this right now document cam please here's the obama
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:49.440]  care stack despite glitches obama care profit windfall to insurers well underway that's right
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.480]  since it was passed three years ago their average stock has doubled well it's accelerated that increase
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:00.240]  and is set to quadruple in the next two years so there you go oh wonder why they wrote it
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:07.280]  because they wanted to help you just like when they have a captive audience like iraq or india
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.760]  they go around giving people live polio vaccines that paralyze them on the spot and then it's just
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:18.640]  in the back of the newspaper all 60 000 here 50 000 there 20 000 here paralyze now the rest all get
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:25.360]  cancer but it's okay bayer put the aides in the factor eight for the little chemophiliacs because
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:32.960]  they love you uh-huh these big global big pharma big bank combines they really want you to have a
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:38.000]  nice life they really want open borders because they care too did you know it because they care
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.720]  they do they care a lot about you that's why they created hitler and linen our government
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.120]  with the british government created hitler and linen on record because they wanted to help
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:55.440]  everybody i see the general public there's like these little little naive arrested development
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:01.200]  naive little kind of petulant self-righteous children that have no idea how anything works
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:09.520]  all of us cbs news whitewash is it bayer sold hiv risky meds no nbc actually got it right they
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.880]  knowingly for 10 years put hiv and hepatitis in all their factor eight and shipped it out it came

[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.360]  be one of hillary's special friends that's how you get to the justice department now people say well

[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.800]  these groups historically in every other culture always are not allowed because it causes problems
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.320]  in the society and then it's allowed and then those groups take over and say your kids are ours
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.680]  because they don't reproduce see and see that's my issue i i'm not thinking about what you're
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.280]  doing in your bedroom and it's not all the gay or lesbian people that act like this but it's the
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:28.000]  political folks historically that do okay and it's in the communist goals that were released to congress
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.320]  that the kgb was intercepted in europe with to do this folks because this is how they break down
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.840]  society okay period and that's what's going on i don't know how i went from one of her classmates to
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.600]  to hillary's girlfriend because i'm not saying that's happening with this classmate i'm just saying

[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.440]  and facebook this is breaking right now barack obama's twitter and facebook hacked by the syrian
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:44.560]  electronic army and uh you can uh see what they hacked and put through of course 90 percent of
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.760]  those followers are fake so it doesn't even matter on michelle's side it's only 76 percent are fake
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:56.320]  according to reports that have analyzed it but the president obama's official twitter and facebook
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.800]  accounts which have been combined audience of 76 million followers were hacked by the syrian
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.880]  electronic army and used to promote a link to a video which highlights how us back rebels are
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:10.080]  committing terror attacks in syria this account was compromised less than a day after obama's
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.160]  presidential campaign website was also hacked by the sea the syrian electronic army confirmed
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:21.600]  to info wars that they were behind the attack so i just might want to mention that and again uh
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:28.400]  we are against al qaeda so we we don't work with the syrian uh the free syrian army of the um
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.600]  well the free syrian armies the al qaeda folks we definitely don't work with them but we don't
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:36.080]  officially work with the syrian electronic army but obviously they do tweet out some of our stuff
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:42.640]  as well and i guess it's anti al qaeda people these are these are real terrorists uh perhaps uh to
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.280]  temporarily evade detection the link to the video was tweeted out next to a nondescript message that
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:56.960]  read immigration is a bipartisan issue exactly and so uh that is what's going on right now so info

[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.200]  gentlemen on the corner and um something stuck out about them because they had on plain clothes but
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:13.600]  they had on the military boots um i paid no mind but i'm still watching them at the same time and uh
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.560]  i see this man these are the same men and they walk by two or three times but they're fumbling
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:24.400]  with the cigarette pack so i say that's kind of odd and um this lady comes out of starbucks
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:30.400]  and um she stands next to me these men do the same routine in which she asks for a cigarette
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.320]  she likes the cigarette i think nothing of it two seconds later hold on i want to hear this i'm

[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.600]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:31.360]  well al-qaeda shakes iraq with surge of violence the u.s and nature are openly training al-qaeda
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:38.160]  in iraq right up against the border with syria to invade obama has admitted that in press conferences
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:43.440]  that's how evil this government is and and and what a coma they think you're in but meanwhile
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.800]  they've got secret police all over the place i see it constantly who who treat and act like the
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.520]  general public are all criminals and these average cops run around like they're in a secret agent
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.480]  movie actually believing that they're you know looking for drug dealers and stuff because all
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.360]  they're allowed to bust is very low-level retail dealers you know somebody's selling very small
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.160]  amounts uh little wannabe thugs because all the big dealers launder their money properly
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.960]  through the local big banks and the pay officer made and you know that's how this works uh but
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.320]  i'm just guessing i don't know what frank in downtown austin was going to the ymca yeah there's
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.800]  a great ymca down the river i used to go down there when i lived closer to downtown uh and he
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:27.840]  was like an evil american uh going to use the public transit to go down there off from congress
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.720]  and so you see these guys walking back and forth that are in bad plain clothes outfits but why not
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.360]  they could wear police uniforms no one would notice it nowadays and then a woman comes out of starbucks
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:44.880]  playing secret agent tell us what you saw okay so as she comes out she's just an innocent civilian
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.120]  that's not even you know coherent to what's going on notice how you use the term they want you to
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.000]  though we're all civilian they're all the military that means upper class they're all civilians too
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:02.240]  go ahead correct so as she asked for the cigarette she continues to light it two seconds later the
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:08.240]  patty wagon that you see on six street is in front of us there's three bike patrol officers
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:14.400]  and they're arresting her in front of starbucks she's crying she's avid they tell her oh it was a
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:20.480]  hooker was it a hooker thing no it wasn't even that so let me let me tell you i just blew my mind
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:26.160]  okay so as this is going on i'm not trying to be around this to be affiliated but i'm like wow
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.400]  that's you know that's sad so i jump on the first bus i see and take it to the next street which is
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.200]  in front of uh what's going to be seventh in the front of the cbs as i get out there there's a man
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:43.120]  smoking on the bench i tell him be careful they just arrested a lady down the street for smoking
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.120]  so as he says that he comes next to me and i start telling the story okay as i'm telling him this
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:56.640]  the same man with the same boots walks in front of me tumbling the same pack of cigarettes i promise
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:02.880]  you alex this man offered the man i was standing next to a cigarette all right this is big this is
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:08.240]  big get me john bounder rob do i want to send because we'll break this nationally i guarantee i can
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.000]  tell this this is her story hold on hold on hold on i believe you i'm actually aware of this some
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.920]  other parts of the country in san francisco so now they're starting in here they technically
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.880]  can arrest you for no seatbelter whatever and they do it now to get you enrolled to get you in the
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.360]  system to hope you do something so they can hurt you and then claim you know resisting because
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.160]  they want to give everybody a record so what you saw is a new sting and we'll go downtown and get
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.240]  them to admit it we'll go down to the police department get their spokesman they now have
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:40.320]  a sting arresting people that smoke at the bus stops in violation of the ordinance it's not enough
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:46.960]  to give you a ticket and they send people up with cigarettes to try to then see you doing it so so
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:53.280]  i'm guessing what happened tell me what happened let me finish this okay so as he offers he offers
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.240]  the man did not even ask for the cigarette alex he was smoking one of those rolled up cowboys
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.280]  cigarettes as i was speaking to him he accepts the cigarette puts it behind its ear as as i'm
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.640]  telling him be careful i see the patrol officers coming from starbucks down this way wait a minute
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.080]  it wasn't cigarettes were they planning weed on people no no sir you you misunderstood me he was
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.480]  smoking a cowboy roll-up cigarette when i when i know what were they arresting him for what were

[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.640]  they grabbed this man shoved him into the glass of cbs he's asking why am i being arrested they
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:39.760]  tell him you know what you did you know what you did and and i'm sitting there i'm backing up i'm

[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.800]  you a very important historical story here briefly they go back to frank in texas calling from
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:37.360]  austin texas then back to other calls and then big news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:44.480]  of news i haven't covered yet and some important breaking news the first laws that hitler
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:51.600]  used to get the country to do everything he said was a ban basically on smoking in public
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.080]  and they started it with taxes and regulations pretty soon you couldn't smoke in your own house
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.520]  hitler was a big vegetarian and also anti smoking that's on record and so the first big
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:06.320]  nazi laws were anti smoking and i'm not defending smoking but now they're trying to even ban cigars
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:10.960]  and pipes and things that are obviously recreational and then next it'll be alcohol and then salt and
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.440]  you've already seen what they've done it is the nanny state but aspartame's okay
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:26.720]  gmo's okay radiation levels are okay the un said 15 years ago and we covered this at the time
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.600]  that they were going to set the first global law would be a smoking ban and so you see these
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.160]  campaigns and they sound reasonable first it's restaurants then it's bars then it's in public
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:43.120]  i happen to know about cases in san francisco where they go out with patty wagons and arrest
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.160]  people smoking on the street uh claiming it violates an ordinance if it's within so far of a
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:54.720]  bus stop and of course they should just give them a ticket and we shouldn't even have this rule
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:59.760]  what the control freaks don't understand is next it's going to be their their ox that's
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:05.840]  going to be gored but guys do a search austin arresting smokers uh because i don't think this
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:10.720]  is broken yet and i can tell the callers telling the truth uh but it doesn't matter we can blur
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:16.000]  his face if he wants or whatever i don't think you should be scared of them um if they try any
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.960]  reprisals that's that's really serious civil rights violation right there but uh frank we're

[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:40.560]  reporter and i want to drive you to where this happened and then i want you to describe what
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:46.160]  you saw so we have that then we're going to go next down to the police department um and then
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:50.720]  we're also of course the police are listening to this but we need citizens when you're on congress
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.840]  in other areas if you see this videotape and and again just don't get within about 15 feet and the
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.320]  cops can't say interfering with their stuff but these are undercover cops you know they're not
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:04.000]  even going to bust the whores because it's turned out a lot the awesome police department runs most
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.840]  of those they've actually been arrested before doing that so they're not i guess they're not
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:13.840]  busting the hookers down there uh and harassing them and again i i don't really approve of uh
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  prostitution but i mean you know the government is robbing and raping everyone the government
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:25.440]  ships in the drugs the government is on record doing all this corrupt stuff um you know after
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.120]  we've arrested all the bankers and the globalist and they're not putting poison in the water
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:34.480]  supply and stuff then i would believe a government wanted to arrest hookers uh because they actually
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:38.160]  care about people now the truth is they want to run the hookers and they want to shut down the
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:43.200]  hookers that don't launder money with them and that's well known how many austin police captains
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.080]  have been arrested running the hookers and that's just when higher ups want to clean up the image
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.360]  so i'm sick of it and i don't even get on my high horse about the police running the hookers and
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.280]  stuff but i mean you know you want to get us in the system austin's famous outside austin
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:05.840]  lago vista for the woman at her mailbox by her house you know 100 yards from her house in the
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:09.680]  neighborhood but you drive 10 miles an hour just like my kids back when i live in a neighborhood
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:13.280]  like that's go you know go in the neighborhood they start unbuckling they start getting out they
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:19.440]  start jumping around the car 100 yards from her house the big group mailbox area in the upscale
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.160]  neighborhood lago vista but it gets worse her husband went on the news and complained about it
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.160]  the lago vista police came in front of neighbors a week later the defters on the news and beat him
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:34.400]  up in his front yard we actually got her and him on the show i think last time i heard she was like
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.840]  winning a lawsuit against him but the point is and he about he was a medical doctor and they pulled
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:44.160]  up in his front yard and said you don't like art he said yeah i don't like it and they beat him up
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:50.000]  in his front yard this was on the news so i i agree they should have lined him and his whole
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.960]  family up and just shot him right there that'll treat him you know some respect and i love the
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.760]  nanny state austin i love five hundred dollar tickets if if if you don't uh you know if you
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:05.760]  follow a bike rider too close but they can cut in front of you do whatever they want i'm going to
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:10.880]  shut up here because it took the end of the hour that last segment and everything uh frank
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.400]  uh but but first off recap tell the whole story where they're slamming the guy up against the
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.600]  window who hasn't even you know smoked the cigarette they gave him i want all and then you know what
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:26.640]  you did because see that they have to play along like when they arrest amish for selling milk to
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.280]  their neighbors they have to say you know what you did like what we're doing is normal what we're
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:39.760]  doing is okay what a joke so you see one patty wagon you get on the bus you go the next stop you
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.440]  warn the guy but but before we do that let me just play all this in the air right now
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:50.560]  can we send in 30 minutes a car with my reporters to pick you up and do a news report on this most
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:57.440]  definitely i'm at the west gate regal cinema currently okay you're at the uh well you don't
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.200]  need to say that on air i'm fine i mean i'm not i'm here to tell the truth alex and like i said you
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:07.440]  you are inspiration to all of us and just know that when the rev when the revolution happens
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:13.040]  you will have the revolution behind you i just want to tell people in austin simplified if you smoke
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:19.040]  if you give a cigarette if you accept the cigarette if you're smoking by a bus stop
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.600]  they are going to arrest you and tell you you know what you did they are not going to read
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.800]  your rights like they did those two people that i saw and and and what's so sick about it is that
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:34.480]  they have on both sides of their bicycles countless number of the zip ties so the new
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.960]  the new slogan for austin is one cigarette one arrest what do you think about that alex
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.360]  absolutely so so i mean go back and recap the whole story and then and then i'm going to get
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:50.000]  your number uh and and or tell us exactly where you're going to be uh and tell uh john harman
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  and then and then we'll have uh they're getting suited up and ready right now they'll probably
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.680]  pick you up let's say at about let's say two o'clock uh we're going to have the crew pick
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:03.760]  you up it'll probably end up being on the radio tomorrow the video audio report because you know
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.600]  we've got to interview you and then go down to the austin police department and then who knows
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:11.120]  we may be able to catch them still doing it right now we'll drive up down congress with you but
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.280]  get you to get out and scrub what you saw but i love the assault you're saying they didn't just
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.720]  say okay under this ordinance we can arrest you not just ticket you they slammed him up against
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.320]  the glass but but but start from the beginning of what you saw this morning okay i'm starting my
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:31.200]  normal routine to where i go to the ymca every morning so i stand in front of the bus stop in
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:37.600]  front of uh it's congress and uh six which is a starbucks as i'm standing there these two men
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.920]  that like you always say the bug-eyed the steroid freaks they're real they're real big you know you
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:47.040]  can't mistake them but what threw them off with the whole outfit was their military combat boots
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:53.760]  still on so of course i'm like wow those are two military or police officers as they walk back and
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:58.240]  forth through that little strip they keep fumbling around with their cigarette pack and both of
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.200]  their packs are full as if they're wanting somebody to say hey do you mind if i have one of those
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:08.080]  which i don't smoke so i don't even you know this is absolute criminal entrapment by the way
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.400]  and i know the cases literally that's like having a cop woman who's super sexy
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:20.160]  sit there and go come on baby come on baby just five dollars come on baby come on baby come on
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:26.960]  baby i mean it's total entrapment please continue so i'm watching them and it's weird because they're
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:34.640]  not even smoking cigarettes a lady comes out of starbucks she's maybe 18 19 she stands next to me
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:39.440]  and another gentleman that's on a skateboard they have two half cigarettes already in their hands
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:45.920]  the man walks by she asks him may i have a cigarette which i think nothing no because i've seen
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:50.400]  that countless times in austin and by the way they don't even know about the little ordinance
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:54.960]  it's it's not even posted in most areas they just have guys here have a cigarette okay sure
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:03.520]  boom we got you but don't keep going see and so as she accepts the cigarette there are all of a
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:09.120]  sudden the patty wagon and three bicycle cops jump out like it's Pablo Escobar El Chapo on the corner
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:16.240]  you know it's ridiculous and they get out and they initially turn around and arrest her you know
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:20.720]  what you did you know what you did i don't stick around to see that because i'm not even trying
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:25.520]  to be around them when they're in that mode alex so i don't even ride this bus i jumped on the next
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:31.440]  bus to take it to the next street so i don't have to be around that as i get off the bus i see a man
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.640]  smoking a cigarette on the bus stop i tell him hey they're arresting people for smoking at the
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.800]  bus stop which i thought that's what it was for smoking he says okay and uh walks back to where
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.800]  the cbs is with me we're standing there he's smoking all of a sudden the same guy in the
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:55.120]  military boots comes by and i say well it's weird and um he offers the man the cigarette this time
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.600]  would you like one the man didn't even really ask but i don't know how it went down but it
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:04.240]  was something like that so he has a cigarette not the cigarettes in the back of his ear he's
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:10.320]  still smoking his cigarette he had which was like a roll-up cowboy uh cigarette all of a sudden the
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:15.600]  police are coming from the next street over so i guess he's because he has his uh his uh earphones
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.520]  on from the iphone through i guess you could talk into it sure so tell us what he did to him and
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:25.360]  how it ended tell us tell us what he did to him okay all that happened was uh they came up i told
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.720]  him that you should you should put it out they grabbed him stand them up against the grass
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:38.000]  put the put the zip ties on put the zip ties on and then i'm sorry i'm distracted um they put
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:43.120]  the zip ties on him stand them up against the grass he's asking why are you arresting me you
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:48.640]  know what you did you know what you did you know what you did that's all they said to him i was you
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:54.960]  know what you did and then finally after the 56 time he says you asked for a cigarette he didn't
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:03.120]  ask for a cigarette i mean i was always oh oh oh so it's a panhandling ordinance that must be what
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:10.000]  it is is they're tricking you oh this is so abusive this is so evil you got all the people
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.440]  just like in new york the cops want to rest the homeless that are on the subways they have no
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:18.800]  other choice now you see all the diabetics with their legs sawed off lined up there oh so is that
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:26.560]  what it was it wasn't the smoking it was the panhandling no sir it was it was each it was one
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:32.240]  of each because they can't say that she asked for a cigarette and they arrested her okay and then
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.320]  they can't arrest somebody for giving a cigarette away so which one is no no i understand so was
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:43.520]  it cigarettes or was it a panhandling it was cigarettes elix unbelievable i'm telling you it's
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:49.200]  so predatory and notice they target the absolute weakest they can and no one knows you come to

[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:51.360]  homeland security announcements they have billboards going up with jumbo tron saying report your
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:56.160]  neighbors we are living in the running man all we need is jesse ventura up there doing
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:02.480]  cadre cola ads and we've arrived yeah they say you your opinion is important we're going to give
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:12.320]  you 500 points for participating what 500 points of light is this taken from the the the bush doctrine
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  or listen it's all about scientifically getting your data and having computers wargame how to
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:22.880]  manipulate you and how to bankrupt you and suck you dry i appreciate your call i mean the government
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.320]  is there to hurt you period but to make it look like it's trying to help you and the minions of
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:33.280]  the government they don't even know they they're always given a cover story it is war against
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:38.880]  humanity it is eugenics uh let's talk to robert in new hampshire uh you're on the air what do you
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:44.000]  think i see you're calling in about the ap photo of the checkpoints in california where they walk
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.760]  up and shove guns in your face in your car men women and children what do you think yeah that's
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:55.680]  correct alex um you know that it they say a picture can speak a thousand words and um
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:01.040]  if that were ever true it certainly is in this case uh you know i'm um the first thing i want to
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:05.040]  do is just thank you and all your listeners for your time this afternoon god bless you and yours
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:10.480]  for me and mine always there uh and uh you know i just wanted to make the point on the second
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.160]  amendment that you know people seem to forget and you've been saying this for years and years alex
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:21.200]  that i've been listening to you and and and just to crystallize it that much more you know the second
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:28.080]  amendment uh it's about states rights and it's about um you know the right and the duty of the
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:34.160]  people to you know protect the state i mean when it talks about the militia george washington i
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:38.480]  believe it was him said that when we considered the soldier we didn't forego the people james
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:42.320]  madison asked to define them the word militia has written in the second amendment i believe
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:49.360]  it was him he said uh you know the militia is the entire body of the people so that being said um
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.160]  the second amendment all it does is it acknowledges the necessity of the well-regulated militia
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:59.680]  for the security of a free state and then it acknowledges the people as that militia so
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:04.640]  you know the people have a duty to protect states rights if you remember alex you know
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:09.600]  the original colonies when when the state started signing on with the union to begin with i don't
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:14.480]  think if the union had said you know once you sign you're not going to enjoy a first or second
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.960]  amendment right well sir this is terrorist talks saying that states even exist our country
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:26.000]  doesn't exist only loving world government bankers above the law uh and saudi arabian princes consuming
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:33.200]  snuff films of small children only that exists but i mean to be serious about this the world
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:39.200]  is clear history is clear if you lay down you will be usurped you will be conquered you will be
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.720]  overrun you will be dominated and americans have been taught that land of the free home of the brave
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:51.040]  means having no freedoms and groveling and rolling around on your belly so a nation of sheep as thomas
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:57.040]  everson said will be ruled by wolves and you're absolutely right god bless you appreciate nicole

[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:14.560]  i've been figuring it out as i go though we've trailblazed in some areas not in others we are

[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:48.640]  to do that uh so 800 2599231 i don't know the fella from uh sacramental california where they set
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.200]  up checkpoints and come up and shove the gun in your face now what's worse having the gun shove
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:58.320]  in your face or them pulling your wife out of the car and doing proctology exams brutally on her
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:04.720]  i don't know maybe having the gun shove in your face i don't know next it'll be shoot you or
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:11.200]  have a proctology exam then obviously the proctology exam will be better but i just i just worship
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:16.000]  the government i think this is so american this is so good i think everybody should just submit to
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.440]  all of it by the way let's shift gears uh over here you know this is why i'm so frustrated
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:30.320]  i cannot go to mexico which i've been to probably let's not exaggerate 30 times in my life i cannot
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:35.760]  go to mexico because i don't live there and i will probably never go back to mexico now because even
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:40.320]  in the nicer resort areas it's a hellhole and they have been taught to hate folks that live in america
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:47.440]  by our media and it's not the same place it is a hellish pit of evil uh now many cities in the
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:55.360]  us are now like this and in some cases our police are more gunish than the mexican police so i can't
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:36:01.200]  really leave america can i plus they're putting in restrictions so it's hard to leave i mean wow
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:08.400]  it's like man if i'm gonna get out i better do it soon and it's really sad that our country's
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.840]  turned into this but then i look at the jellyfish public or even public that aren't jellyfish they
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:23.280]  don't think of it as their job to be involved they just think of themselves as just these people that
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:28.080]  go through life and so it's going to allow the worst elements take over so we're doomed i mean the
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:37.360]  word is we are doomed doomed if we don't turn this around now the good news is bob woodward has come
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.360]  out and said that we have a secret government that needs to be dealt with and america's in trouble
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:46.800]  we played the clip last hour a lot of other prominent people are saying man we really are
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:53.440]  sickeningly corrupt and out of control yeah and here's the thing about this 100 historically
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:59.200]  when it gets to this point it either reverses itself or it gets hellishly bad
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.600]  hellishly bad and i guess i've got to really come to the realization why i get so angry on
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.840]  air and start yelling and streaming is i'm mad at these people man i don't want to have to fight a
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:15.120]  horrible tyranny i don't want to have to be dealing with all this i mean i love this country there's
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.920]  a lot of good stuff in this country and i know there's a lot of good people that work for the
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:25.120]  system and corporations everything else but listen you better do something i can't just sit up here
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.840]  and talk about this and fix it i'm just one little guy that reaches 15 million people a week but
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:35.040]  that's that's only a big deal if you act on that information that's the only way that's a big deal
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:43.840]  what do you think the duke would think about this somebody like john wane this this image of americana
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:49.600]  who was patriotic and wasn't perfect but he believed in free market family private property
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:54.080]  second amendment i mean think about aliens somebody like the duke is today i think of the duke
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.400]  because when i went out to uh one of those beautiful places in the world my second time
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:05.680]  being there last year to guling's lodge in monument valley john wane used to stay where he shot many
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.400]  of his movies just so beautiful now john wane used to hang out there a lot of times in the year too
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.560]  many wooden shoot movies they shot like i think it was like 40-something movies there because they
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:22.320]  liked it i don't know why i've digressed off into that me and paul watson were
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320]  first
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.240]  i mean conversation this morning i'm not gonna repeat it is this pointless
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.440]  anyways the the issue here is is that i've got all this news and i'm procrastinating going into
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:42.400]  it then back to your calls was the caller able to get back in from california i guess not
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:47.600]  all right well i'll just go to these people in a minute okay sorry the phones had a heart attack
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:53.120]  for a minute or a stroke all right let's let's get into the news or what made me think of mexico
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:39:02.240]  100 pro abortion storytelling events organized across the country i already mentioned that but
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:10.080]  i thought that i would just uh remind you that's the type of stuff that is going on nationwide
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:14.400]  and then meanwhile they have evangelical pastors this is what made me think of the
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:21.840]  mexico situation marriott ceo united on immigration and this out of bloomberg these are the same
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:31.120]  the exact same evangelicals that have been listed as terrorists by the pentagon and there's such
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:35.680]  lap dogs of the faith-based federal takeover the violates the first amendment with federal money
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:41.680]  of religion that they're there turn your guns in open the borders up they will do anything for
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:48.880]  federal taxpayer money immigration reform pitch gets aggressive some advocates turn to civil
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:54.480]  disobedience to press for action and they'll be called angel cakes doing this foreigners in our
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:58.480]  country you know i saw an article in the awesome american statesman this morning in fact i even
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.280]  bought the paper so i could cover it and i forgot left it in my truck and it was all about oh texas
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:08.400]  is a majority of hispanic and now they're going to fight back against the injustice of the white
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:13.920]  people i mean it's like texas is hispanic i don't care as long as people are free market
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:20.160]  pro-family pro second amendment pro-liberty but it's they're making it to be hispanic
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:25.360]  you've got to be a communist and not like white people and you've got to have the struggle so
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:31.280]  they just assign all cultural heritage into being anti-white anti-free market anti-liberty
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:36.640]  and most hispanics that i know actually rebel against this and don't want to be part of it but
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.160]  people that work for the system i don't care what color you are you adopt this ideology it's a cult
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.720]  and i'm like america is hispanic white folks get all their kids aboard it because the government
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.880]  sits right on top of them make sure it you know it happens more than half the blacks get aborted
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:57.520]  white folks don't have kids anymore most white folks i know are marrying somebody else other
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:02.320]  than who's white and so all you hear is white white races white white white races 24 7 don't
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:07.280]  worry the world's only got seven percent white people and they're going to be gone in a hundred
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:11.600]  years and then it'll be this group fighting that group but don't worry about them the singularity
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:14.960]  is going to happen the bio weapons going to be released they're going to reduce the population
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:20.400]  they're going to wipe everybody out they've just got everybody fighting with each other ahead of
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.800]  this and everything is about the white devil unless you're one of these casino owners who's
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:29.760]  got offshore banks and doesn't pay taxes who's calling to nuke iran or whether you're one of
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:34.160]  these big mega banks or one of these big defense contractors it's all a big joke to them they don't
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.440]  fly in the airport with a tsa they don't drive down the same roads as you the cops don't mess with
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:47.040]  people with two bodyguards in the front of their limo they know to mess with little people that's
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:53.520]  how the whole system's geared now by globalists that are shutting down society so and the media's
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.640]  up there telling the 30 million illegals who get the welfare everything that's and free
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:03.840]  instate tuition that citizens don't get to bring them here as an incentive to drive down wages and
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:09.360]  now it was in bloomberg last week that the government is encouraging employers who are putting their
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:14.240]  people to part time most americans that are the working poor now going to part time under obama
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.200]  care because the companies just can't even stay open they don't get a big exemptions like mcdonald's
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.600]  and others and so they're getting the message now lay them off to 20 25 hours a week 30 hours max
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:30.560]  lay people off to the 30 hours or 29 hours i guess is the technical number and then they're
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:37.840]  getting the word that that this is the new system and you need to put your employees on welfare
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:43.760]  and employers are signing them up for food stamps which will then further allow employers to lower
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.560]  wages even more that's the opposite of free market that's government involved in a real free market
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:54.400]  folks wages go way up in a real free market service goes way up because there's competition
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:59.680]  but they've told you that's the opposite so we have this fascist economy on top of a communist
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:06.960]  economy and now the country's being fully broken right now in front of us obama care is a missile
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:13.120]  blowing the country's engine of prosperity wide open and they've got all these snot nose evangelicals
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.000]  and southern baptist and the black baptist convention and the and the and the liberal catholic
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:24.240]  grips and all of it you know in the major catholic newspaper this year saying time to abolish the
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:29.440]  constitution i mean and as long as you say it's liberal hey i want nazi germany for obama let me
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:35.120]  sign that petition right now remember that from last week i mean it is just a cult of morons
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:42.240]  an absolute cult of morons who don't who think that by complying they're going to get some more
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:46.640]  goodies and then they get this tiny goodie and they think that's all there is in the world and
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:50.720]  that's just how the globalists want you thinking a tiny welfare check that barely pays for you to
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:57.200]  have any type of life and then now you're just somebody who floats around in the system they've
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:00.880]  got you exactly where they want you and now they're going to use that horde of people
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:07.680]  against the tiny middle class 10 percent that's left we're gone it's over your prosperity the
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:15.520]  ladders for you to get into prosperity are gone if you go back and look at americans working blue
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:21.440]  collar working class folks from 50 years ago they were wealthier on average than people anywhere in
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:29.120]  the world our poor were the upper class in third world countries now our poor are just like people
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:35.200]  in third world countries but they don't know it because they're just bathed in poisonous pop culture
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:40.400]  and decadence and mindlessness and then poison food and water and they're under mind control the
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:45.520]  television the culture the cops are under mind control everybody's under the different degrees
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:51.840]  of it including myself we're all susceptible and so i get hardcore here and tell it like it is so
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:58.960]  people hear it putting away they've never heard it put before that's what i'm trying to do here
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:03.600]  that's what i'm desperately trying to tell you you got the republican leadership and the democratic
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:08.720]  leadership for obama care you knew it was going to be an absolute destruction i went and looked at
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:13.280]  the bill and the and the and the key points i couldn't believe how evil it was i couldn't
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.840]  believe i'm not i can't believe they're actually implementing it as a total screw job but that's
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:25.920]  what it's designed to do i knew from past operations they'd run how bad it would be but i mean not
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:39.280]  this bad so you've got that and it doesn't matter if it destroys obama it doesn't matter because he'll
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:44.320]  just leave his job was to come in be the savior betray you as the judo scout and then bring in
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:53.120]  the next group the next puppet look at this story it's up on info wars dot com mccain thinks
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:59.120]  hillary is a strong candidate for 2016 you know kurt nemo writes a lot of great articles he actually
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.120]  wrote the article where that big casino owner said new guy ran last week and finally got picked up
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:09.760]  by the jewsland post saturday but nemo's headline should probably read mccain pushes fellow globalist
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:18.240]  stooge or or or republican establishment whore pushes a globalist candidate but there it is
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.960]  mccain thinks hillary is a strong candidate which of course he isn't a strong candidate until they
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:28.560]  force feeder down the american people's uh throat so we actually have a clip of hillary she's
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:36.880]  announcing her 2016 run early and this is breaking here exclusively ladies and gentlemen right now
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:45.200]  we have another info wars dot com exclusive this video is hillary just released minutes ago
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:50.560]  on her youtube channel this is breaking hillary is announcing a 2016 run ladies and gentlemen here
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:47:01.040]  it is
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.040]  uh oh rand paul look what you've done there's some water on it
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:15.680]  melding oh what a world what a world judge report dot com info wars dot com
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:25.040]  i'll get you in your little dog too you're best everyone no more language no more freedom
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:32.960]  we control everything uh trendiness i'm liberal and of course the problem with hillary clinton being
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:38.000]  a lesbian i mean we knew about her 18 years ago when i first got on here that she was a lesbian
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:43.680]  the girl friends all of it how clinton only likes to beat women and bite them with bloody chunks out
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:48.560]  of their faces while he rapes them that's what he does like a pit bull he glaches on to their lip
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:52.960]  for and he beats them and then grabs them starts choking them this is came out in court he settled
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:57.200]  by the way and then he bites them while he does it which is like a psychopathic trait i later
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:02.000]  learned in criminology doing research that's what hardcore psychos do is they bite you so clinton
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.640]  likes to rape women because he's liberal and makes it okay and then all the feminists defend him
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:09.600]  because i mean after all that's what they really like is being beaten upside the head they're
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:14.240]  actually anti-female anti-family you know your establishment feminist likes to be humiliated
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:19.040]  as much as possible that's the criminology because they're not really feminist but the point is and
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:23.200]  they just want to wreck other you know healthy women and you know have glorious time about saying
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:30.160]  i had an abortion proudly running around but uh side issue i went off to that rant about hillary
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.320]  it's not that she's a lesbian because there's some nice lesbians out there like there's other folks
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.400]  you know i don't what's going on in your bedroom i'm not don't think i'm obsessed with what you're
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:44.080]  doing i quite frankly aren't even thinking about it my problem is that as having to post says our
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:50.480]  first lesbian president as they as they celebrate uh on the having to post that is that she's black
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.680]  male folks i mean hillary doesn't just you know have a bunch of girlfriends in the Lincoln bedroom
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:02.640]  hillary is into all sorts of occult stuff which by the way is well known she is a witch and i don't
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:06.720]  mean just your run-of-the-mill nature lover you know you know person that gets into it because
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:12.000]  they think it's trendy or whatever okay i'm talking about on her knees to bath on that okay
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:18.800]  blood drinking but media matters a lot of fun with that then i can go find all the clips of her
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:23.120]  and the cultic rituals with along with tony blair and all the rest of it and skull and bones
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:28.640]  and then and bohemian grow i mean they're all into it folks my goodness i mean i had to dodge it
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:33.120]  growing up in dallas texas because we lived in the richest county in texas rock wall it was like
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:39.360]  sate satan central kook lux clan was also all over the place just all a bunch of gangs people

[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:21.840]  insatiable appetite to just wreck everything and camille paglia of course uh read her books
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:27.280]  over a decade ago eloquently breaks down this decadent cycle you cannot deny it and she's a
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.920]  lesbian so uh you know the point is that's what's going on that's what's happening and the bible
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:38.240]  says that when men cease to be men the women will and women and children will rule over you and nichy
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:43.040]  basically plagiarize it but it's true and so i say and by the way total collapse always follows
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:49.120]  this so enjoy all the curses enjoy collapse enjoy death enjoy a sorrow enjoy losing everything

[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:41.440]  in a manic face here i finally got some food during the break feeling a little bit better here
[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:46.880]  sorry i've been ranting too much i've noticed i don't eat anything get low blood sugar
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:51.600]  that begins to happen contrary to other folks getting less energy i kind of get more but it's
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:58.080]  a kind of bad energy but we're going to be going back to your phone calls in the overdrive segments
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:03.440]  some stations carry it some don't info wars dot com forward slash show steve watson has an article
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:10.800]  up on info wars dot com bias politifact website claims obama promises on existing health plans
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:17.360]  still half true that's like saying that panocchio was telling the truth when his nose was growing
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:26.960]  so there is that report there's some scientific news i want to get to but getting back to
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.560]  you uh the other news that's unfolding i wanted to talk about this you have
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:41.520]  the trials that are taking place in england over phone hacking for news corps and the wall street
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:48.720]  journal reports a new core news corp founder and former employees i read that wrong news corp
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:57.920]  former employees await trial criminal case against former executive brooks and seven others could
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:04.080]  embarrass media giant british government because the police and mi5 and mi6 were involved as well
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:10.320]  now again i think it's wrong what news corps did and i'm not defending news corps but when you
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:16.000]  have this war on the press in england and the us and a war on whistleblowers and members of news
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.840]  corps being uh you know arrested and indicted or harassed uh for stories they're breaking and
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:26.720]  washington times reporters getting swat teamed over gun investigations and then their files are
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:32.560]  taken and then it turns out the gun investigation is fake you add this to all the other stuff going
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:40.480]  on it's a real backdrop of authoritarianism and so that's why this is going on all of the big
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:47.760]  establishment media especially tabloids are heavily involved in japping phones hacking phones
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:53.760]  eavesdropping listening to people this is how it's done and i'm not saying that's a good thing
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:57:00.080]  if we had all the members of the british government spying illegally and blackmailing people arrested
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:04.960]  and the us government in trouble for fast and furious and the nsa and persecuting the tea party
[02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:12.640]  and all that then i would say okay now arrest whoever's involved covering this up in news corps
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:19.120]  but i was told by high-level sources and years later it came out that that's why news corps has
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:23.840]  been promoting so much police state stuff and really toe in the line and not messing with
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:28.720]  obama like they should is because the word is the justice department was looking at inditing
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:34.240]  rupert murdoch that came out about a month ago that indeed they're using in his leverage and may
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.840]  indict rupert murdoch man i don't want to live in the country like that where where basically
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:46.000]  al capone is the equivalent of obama and eric holzer and then you've got some mid-level capo
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:53.520]  in another regime who's not doing stuff one one hundredth as bad that's rupert murdoch who i could
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.440]  care less about throw him out with the garbage as far as i'm concerned but the point is is that he's
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:06.000]  not the one saying the tea party's terrorist and he's to be arrested he's not the one shoving
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:11.200]  obama care down our throats that rips off poor people and raises seven taxes on blue collar
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:16.320]  workers that makes me mad okay when i see poor people getting harassed and nickled and dimed
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:20.000]  and given tickets for stuff out of you know inspection stuff it makes me mad because i know
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:24.800]  those families are trying to work and they're going to try to push them on the welfare i take
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:32.160]  it personal okay so i take this big fat stinking criminal offshore government very very seriously
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:36.160]  and that's why i'm angry at it that's why i'm focused on it all right i'm going to come back

[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:21.680]  sir about living there uh in that area uh yes sir jones i just want to thank you for what you do
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.360]  and oh don't thank me don't thank me so i have to because i'm the first time caller i'm sorry sir
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:34.880]  i know no now under my friend florida government loves you stop it go ahead i probably am um as
[03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:39.760]  soon as i can afford your filter i'll be buying one but nonetheless here's the story in california
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:46.960]  okay just discuss me okay i live in sacramental and uh that's just about 17 miles from where i live
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:52.160]  in roseville and uh to see that guy with the gun two inches from that dude's face in that picture
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:57.760]  discuss me i cannot believe this you've got to be kidding me man i mean i'll give him the fact
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:02.400]  that he had his finger alongside and he was at least not a liberal gun owner and didn't have
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:07.200]  his finger on the trigger but nonetheless it's a loaded gun in your face and it's an ar-15 which
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:12.720]  none of us should own of course only they should own them isn't interesting how we should not own
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:18.240]  ar-15 but they should own them because they always have them in the pictures they always come through
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:24.000]  your house with ar-15 let's get on to the kid who's 13 years old he was just murdered by the police
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:30.640]  now i know obama wants to save just one kid if i could just say one kid i would disarm all the
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:38.640]  lawful americans on earth well what about the freaking uh the uh the little boy that was just
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:44.640]  killed by the policeman why don't we disarm him why don't we set a precedent that says when you
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:50.240]  shoot an innocent little kid for playing with the toy then you were disarmed and locked in prison
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:56.960]  policeman well it's worse than that i mean it's worse than that is that they've got the police
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:02.000]  doing this no hesitation training and so they're shooting each other they're shooting their wives
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:06.240]  when they come home i mean they are just scared to death uh they do it all the time they had to
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:10.720]  fire a cop a few weeks ago in austin because they told the guy get out of the car just to the random
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:15.280]  you know traffic stop and the cop just shot at him because the guy had the wallet in his hand
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:21.600]  and it's like man we shouldn't have cowards as police i mean i'm sorry uh sure your safety's
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:27.040]  important have the training be on the lookout but if you're just like barney five you should not be
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:32.080]  on the police force i appreciate your call it's like barney five on steroids jessica in alaska

[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:43.680]  like the crazy person what can i do here in alaska to be more proactive you know i'm 30 years old i'm
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:49.280]  a mother or two i'm i'm the concerned about my children and my family's safety when all of this
[03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:53.600]  when shit hits the fan excuse my language i'm gonna let you go ma'am because we can't can't have that
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:57.280]  on air and it's been happening a lot more it's kind of like people's token deal so we gotta let
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:13:01.920]  folks go when they do that that's the way you can sign off i guess on your call ma'am i understand
[03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:06.720]  your frustration about what's going on look the majority never prevails they sit there and suck
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:12.880]  their thumbs it takes a highly motivated minority to change things and that's why as much as we
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:18.720]  criticize police let me tell you what's really scary the most awake people after the military are
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:23.600]  actually the police in my experience because they're in the middle of it they see the baloney
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:28.960]  they're being given to do they see the the the demonization of liberty lovers and and they see
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:33.120]  how they're not allowed to go after real criminals but are just sicked on the general public for petty
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:38.000]  stuff to raise revenue so when people call you conspiracy theorists that's because they're
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:43.840]  intellectually lazy they don't think of themselves as ever being involved in anything so why are you
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:50.960]  telling them that something's even going on being concerned is something that weirdos do
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:57.200]  they want to go home and watch television they're under literal psychosis they're under mind control
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:02.000]  induced from 60 years of television and so you've got to warn them hey
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:10.960]  hey cancer is up IQ is being lowered our country is losing our basic liberties our standard
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:16.320]  of living is going down and they may not even wake up then probably won't but down the road
[03:14:16.320 --> 03:14:21.040]  they will remember that's how cognitive dissonance works to get around the learned helplessness
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:25.600]  and the normalcy bias you've got to just plant the seeds that's why giving them a copy of one
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:30.880]  of my films or sending them a video link because they're well produced well documented fast-paced
[03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:37.760]  my films are really the best work we do and the nightly news that's at prisonplanet.tv share a
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:41.440]  membership with your friends and family or almost everything we do there ends up getting put on
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:46.080]  youtube so find whatever subject it is and give that to friends and family tell them
[03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:51.920]  about info wars.com and if they laugh at you move on these are poor victims it's like you
[03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:57.440]  ever seen a poor mentally ill person who's also mentally retarded on the side of the street
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:03.440]  who's homeless and you go up and try to talk to them or help them because they're not just the
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:06.880]  normal drug addict or whatever that's you know robbing people in the parking lot it's it's like
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:13.040]  a really seriously mentally retarded person who's also mentally ill and they've been in and out of
[03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:16.960]  the system for 20 years and they're sitting there drooling on the side of the road you can tell
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:20.320]  they're actually totally freaked out and screwed up and you just have that feeling when you're in
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:24.320]  a parking lot that you want to give them some money and try to help them ask do you have family
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:32.960]  or whatever and they will laugh and giggle at you when you say hey do you have family you have
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:38.640]  some place to stay have you been to the Salvation Army they will genuinely all they know to do
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:43.760]  and you can see the pain in their eyes is even though they're retarded what's the politically
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:50.480]  correct term around I get in trouble because they just say that word is a handicap they will look
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:55.600]  sad for a minute in their eyes but then go start laughing at you and then we'll say something rude
[03:15:55.600 --> 03:16:01.120]  to you even though you've just given them $20 and that's kind of how the general public is
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:07.600]  they'll go conspiracy theorist and it's a few clicks above a phenomenon I've seen
[03:16:08.400 --> 03:16:14.000]  with really seriously handicap people that they've been treated bad and put down so many times
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:21.680]  all they know is to be mean to you because everybody's been mean to them now sometimes
[03:16:21.680 --> 03:16:25.360]  you try to help a mentally retarded person who's on the streets and then they start crying and
[03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:31.600]  thanking you and then then you start crying you know the best way for me to help people is to be
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:36.320]  up here on air and be nasty and do what I do because you got a lot of nasty yuppies out there that
[03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:39.600]  think they're in charge and think they have all this power and that think they're on the winning
[03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:44.240]  team because they don't care about anybody and I'm here to let them know when they have that car
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:50.000]  wreck and break their back next week or when they go in and get diagnosed with cancer next year I
[03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:54.880]  want them to remember I warned them and I told them so that when they beat the cancer or when they
[03:16:54.880 --> 03:17:00.000]  finally grow up through the adversity they're going to go through that they will then go out and
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:04.320]  understand that it's now time for them to help others or maybe when their kid gets diagnosed
[03:17:04.320 --> 03:17:08.480]  with cancer next week I'm trying to stop your kid getting diagnosed with cancer I know it's a weaponized
[03:17:08.480 --> 03:17:13.440]  program I'm very upset about it I I take it very personal I have a giant heart I'm not saying I'm
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:20.640]  some good guy folks I I have a very big heart if you study a lot of psychology the real psychology
[03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:24.720]  not the pop psychology you'll learn of course anybody that has a big heart and is also very loving
[03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:30.080]  also has a very large vicious side and I have that as well the problem with these losers is there's
[03:17:30.080 --> 03:17:34.720]  a lot of wimps that are into tyranny because they think darkness gives them power it doesn't give
[03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:39.200]  them power and I want to get off my preaching horse here because I've got to get back to calls
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:43.280]  and cover more news we're on to the bottom of the hour here in overdrive we're going to skip this
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:51.520]  network break it's just that you are not going to be fulfilled being a thug out there and when
[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:57.040]  you are talking to the general public that's wearing their sports jersey and doing whatever
[03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:01.120]  they're just trying to think about how they can get more money and how they can get a better rebate
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:06.640]  on a car and how if they just looked cooler or if they just lost 10 more pounds that they would
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:12.240]  they would they would be somebody they they don't they laugh at you because they're not somebody
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:16.880]  and you're here trying to make them somebody you're here trying to get them to join the human race
[03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:24.800]  and do something and stand for something and not just have us blow this planet up and fail as a
[03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:31.680]  species and don't feel bad when they giggle and they laugh at you because I'm telling you the
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:38.320]  same response I've gotten from mentally ill people and and seriously mentally handicapped when you
[03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:45.280]  try to help them and if you're mean to them then they grovel to you it's when you're nice to them
[03:18:45.280 --> 03:18:50.000]  they then act mean because all they've ever been is treated like crud and so you're going to somebody
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:55.200]  who feels powerless and who feels like a victim and who watches zombie shows and the culture of
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:19:00.480]  death all day fantasizing about death and murder who's being programmed that humanity is crap
[03:19:00.480 --> 03:19:04.400]  that's what all the zombie shows are the Pentagon admits it is to condition you that all humanity
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:09.520]  is ugly and gross so you actually become what they want you to do so you turn your survival
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:15.520]  instinct off and crawl in a hole and die and the problem is if the public does become total zombies
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:19.360]  and they become my enemy then I've got to deal with them like they are zombies I'm trying to
[03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:24.720]  stop them from being zombies and lift the zombie curse that the new world order has put on them
[03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:31.040]  so that you're not men you're not women you're zombies you can say well I'm not a zombie really
[03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:35.920]  all you care about is sports that don't matter all you care about is acting cool when all of that
[03:19:35.920 --> 03:19:41.360]  is great when you're 14 you're designed to be leaving the hut identifying what group you want
[03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:45.920]  to be with kicked out of your parents hut you're supposed to go find a group you're going to be
[03:19:45.920 --> 03:19:52.640]  with a hunting crew what you think of as a gang or or or or a bandit crew you're going to be joining
[03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:57.440]  or a fishing crew you're going to be joining and then you show your skills and your success in that
[03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:01.760]  and then and then and then you find a woman I mean you guys have been hit with scientific
[03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:06.720]  technologies to think that the television is providing you with what will make you successful
[03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:15.120]  it's providing you a fake template to wreck you it is a scientific war machine and the minute
[03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:19.200]  you figure out that that's not just rhetoric is the minute you start defeating the enemy
[03:20:19.200 --> 03:20:24.720]  you don't have to have it all together I certainly don't but I've got human instincts I've got life
[03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:32.000]  force I've got survival mechanism and I've got war programming to defend my people that are the
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:40.160]  human race and I've activated my my resistance systems they're not the best out there they're
[03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:44.320]  not even in the top 10 percent I guarantee you if other people have been put under the stresses
[03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:49.840]  that I was put under growing up which aren't even that heavy compared to some you know soldier you
[03:20:49.840 --> 03:20:56.240]  know soldier child in Africa or something but the pressures I was under are 20 times 30 times what the
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:04.320]  average child goes through and that was old-fashioned to let me get beat up 20 30 times that was old
[03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:09.200]  fashioned to let me go break bones playing sports that was old-fashioned to let me you know get hurt
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:14.640]  snow skiing that was old-fashioned to let me climb 100 foot trees that was old-fashioned to let me
[03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:21.600]  go do things like that because my dad was not some macho tough guy he didn't want a total jellyfish
[03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:27.040]  you think it's because they're liberal they don't want your kid playing tag or or boxing they want
[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:35.120]  your kid to be a victim if lions or tigers could could could program society would they have gazelles
[03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:40.960]  with feet and with legs no they'd have gazelles that were tailor made like a mcdonald's happy meal
[03:21:40.960 --> 03:21:46.960]  out of window and that's what you're like the general public is wrecked they don't have survival
[03:21:46.960 --> 03:21:52.160]  instinct they don't have any real tribal instincts it's all misprogrammed into garbage and they're
[03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:58.880]  all aimlessly wandering around in circles bumping into each other digging deeper into the decadence
[03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:05.600]  society and folks decadence is not like it to go out and have a good time that's the fake church
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:12.640]  modern thing that's the Pharisees christ was there to get people to totally shift their
[03:22:12.640 --> 03:22:17.680]  paradigm completely not nitpick because if you change somebody on the inside it will then change
[03:22:17.680 --> 03:22:23.200]  the outside and so people think oh i don't want to be a loving person i want to be evil that's
[03:22:23.200 --> 03:22:32.400]  where the fun is all the messages say that but that's not really the truth so they want to rob
[03:22:32.400 --> 03:22:38.080]  you of your entire future they want to rob you of your destiny and that's their greatest crime
[03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:44.640]  you know if if if we had an elite that did all sorts of bad things it'd be one thing but the
[03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:50.640]  fact that they actively wage war against the infant and try to hurt them with baby formula
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:55.520]  that they've got tuned just to the point where it won't kill your kid in africa and asia they tune
[03:22:55.520 --> 03:22:59.280]  it where it does kill a large portion because they want the brain damaging to be so heavy
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  that it ends up killing a large portion of the children and then that's not even an issue when
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:09.040]  a hundred thousand kids you know die in china because a bad a bad formula or you know 50
[03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:13.120]  thousand kids in one african country because a bad formula it's just like all the kids die because
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:17.760]  a formula but we want to stick our hands down your pants because of al qaeda i mean come on folks
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:24.240]  the the system murders millions and it's a statistic but then we'll take one child shot with a gun
[03:23:24.240 --> 03:23:30.080]  and then collectively tell us that gun owners are to blame it's all pure crud and our enemies are
[03:23:30.080 --> 03:23:35.040]  losers i look at them and they have enough knowledge to know how humans work and then they
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:40.800]  use it against their fellow humans because they're not spiritually smart enough to know what that does
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:46.640]  to them and their progeny you wonder why these elites have such degenerate families are so unhappy
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:52.640]  statistically are so disease-ridden believe me i've got the intel on a lot of elite families
[03:23:52.640 --> 03:23:58.320]  have known some of them i have a lot of other connections they are committing suicide and record
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:04.000]  numbers they are drug addicts they are satan worshipers they are completely unfulfilled
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:10.080]  because they don't care about anybody else of course and so they think if they kill more people
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:15.280]  that is going to fulfill them that is not going to fulfill you it didn't fulfill linen it didn't
[03:24:15.280 --> 03:24:21.200]  fulfill Adolf Hitler it did not fulfill any of these people and their lust for the innocence blood
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:27.040]  will never be quenched you people are of your father the devil and that's why your failures
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:32.880]  show the only thing that will quench you if you're too far gone and can't come back and have no goodness
[03:24:32.880 --> 03:24:39.760]  in you and have totally crossed over into the regions of hell is to kill yourselves you want us
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:46.720]  to die that's your inward outward expression of projecting on us that you want us to die no you
[03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:52.880]  need to die you need to kill yourselves you want to kill us and kill our minds so you can be better
[03:24:52.880 --> 03:25:00.160]  than us do the right thing kill yourselves kill yourselves i said of the establishment kill
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:05.760]  yourselves stop killing the innocent stop killing the beautiful stop killing the culture stop spewing
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:12.400]  your ugly art stop spewing all your corruption stop doing it on purpose to make us like you you die
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:19.680]  how does that sound you die but you kill yourselves isn't that a thought i know you're attracted to
[03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:26.960]  that i oh isn't i know that's a thought you have a lot now i'm sad you're too far gone some of you
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:32.320]  if you have any inkling and want to repent you can do that but before you want to kill the innocence
[03:25:32.320 --> 03:25:41.440]  you kill yourselves that self-defense for me to tell you that and i know you'll make a decision
[03:25:41.440 --> 03:25:48.560]  and i know you'll follow through on it very soon let's go ahead and take a call let's talk to
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:57.520]  pete in texas pete you're on the air during heavy overdrive alex yes go ahead hey um when
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:03.920]  send you hook happened last year um i uh sort of assumed it was true so i didn't really look
[03:26:03.920 --> 03:26:10.640]  into it even though there was rumors of uh paid actors and then uh i definitely listen they definitely
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:14.720]  had paid actors they like to kill real kids they've got gag orders they've toured the building down
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:20.080]  he was on a bunch of drugs they look they kill real people they like that but they definitely
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:26.000]  had actors scripted to take advantage of it and bloomberg got caught uh like the day before
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.680]  putting a memo out saying get ready to exploit the next shooting like he was he was geared up
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:38.160]  months before but but they said okay get ready so show massive like all the evidence points towards
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:42.640]  it being massively staged but they of course they killed some real kids i mean why not that's
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:51.120]  enjoyable for them go ahead so i started looking at some of those videos online and uh they're not
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:56.960]  just actors but they're really really bad actors i know no no they'll be laughing on watch this and
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:04.960]  go over and start doing fake crying i know it's amazing it's ridiculous and then i saw the uh
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:13.200]  the fake feints that happened like uh last week totally staged totally fake obvious to somebody
[03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:22.800]  who has half a brain it was ridiculous totally ridiculous i know it is amazing and then again
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:26.640]  they don't even it's like a holy roller church where they find out what your illness is at the back
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:30.960]  and then they have the preacher say at the front once they get people collapsing and doing all that
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:36.640]  then all the other women join in just like uh what's the response the sympathetic response
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:41.600]  is the name like if i was to walk into a restaurant and vomit right next to a table
[03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:48.000]  i think i could even do that to wake people up if i get 10 million views go in vomit right next
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:52.800]  to somebody's table they a lot of people start vomiting as well so so that's that that's how
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:59.040]  they program everybody do you see what i'm saying yeah this it's just blatant psyops it's ridiculous
[03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:04.240]  most people fall for it it's bad yeah but all you gotta do is realize that the globalists are the
[03:28:04.240 --> 03:28:08.720]  enemy tell your brain this is the enemy brain tell me how to deal with them and your brain will
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:13.440]  start at a subconscious level giving you all the weapon programs in the info war using the truth you
[03:28:13.440 --> 03:28:19.920]  need so that's how this works your only issue will be what your one body can do against the enemy
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:26.960]  and then all you do is just say god set me and my will that you created against the enemy i am
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:32.880]  fearless i am a broken vessel but but energize me and i'm telling you if you just say that prayer
[03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:38.960]  just reach up to the heavens god will answer they're so scared of good people you could see
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:46.720]  spiritually what bloated hunchbacked maggots our enemies are you would laugh at them they fear death
[03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:50.960]  they fear everything they are the most slimy pathetic creatures i've ever seen god bless
