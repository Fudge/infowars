[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:20.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:30.960]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is the 8th day of August the 8th month of the 8th year 2008 and
[00:30.960 --> 00:34.960]  I believe the Olympics also kicked off today but that's not what we're really gonna be talking about
[00:35.520 --> 00:42.240]  here on the air today it is the Alex Jones show and I am Jason Burmist sitting in now there's tons
[00:42.240 --> 00:47.840]  of stories to cover a couple mainline ones I want to get out of the way right off the bat first of
[00:47.840 --> 00:54.400]  all president or former president Clinton has been tapped to speak at the DNC and lo and behold
[00:54.400 --> 01:01.680]  he will be speaking just before whoever the vice presidential nominee is now you know that would
[01:01.680 --> 01:06.720]  tell me that it's probably going to be Hillary Clinton I've been saying this for some time now
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.480]  who knows maybe they're just setting us up uh... you know for people like me to say that but it
[01:10.480 --> 01:16.320]  sure does look like bill will be introducing his wife who will be the nominee for the vice
[01:16.320 --> 01:21.760]  presidency of the united states we all know barack is going to get the presidential nomination so
[01:21.760 --> 01:25.440]  I want to talk about that by the way we're going to be taking your calls most of the day today we
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.640]  have bob Chapman from the international forecaster dot com on later and we also have jonathan
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.240]  ellenoff of we are change colorado and he's going to be talking about some great developments
[01:36.240 --> 01:42.240]  he was actually able to get a permit for we are change colorado about a thousand feet from the
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.600]  pepsi center on they are in an entire park we're going to go over all that but great work jonathan
[01:47.600 --> 01:55.280]  and as you all know alex jones and crew will be covering the dnc live from denver colorado it's
[01:55.280 --> 01:58.960]  going to be a great time i'm looking forward to it i'm going to be sitting and hosting while that
[01:58.960 --> 02:05.360]  goes on and folks it's important we go to the dnc now why a lot of people say oh it's the republicans
[02:05.360 --> 02:11.360]  the neocons the ones that did this to us know this is a global agenda and just because the
[02:11.360 --> 02:18.720]  bush administration will no longer be in office soon does not mean this agenda ends uh let's let's
[02:18.720 --> 02:24.960]  get real let's get really real right now barack obama is a globalist okay he is a minion he's a
[02:24.960 --> 02:30.720]  good speaker he's a charismatic younger candidate that people feel like they can relate to they
[02:30.720 --> 02:38.000]  believe it when he says that he has changed you can vote for yeah he's not changed you can vote for
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.200]  there's no change there this is a guy that got caught getting off of his plane to go meet with
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.840]  hillary clinton in secret in the same exact area where the builder bird conference is being held
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.320]  a lot of people will tell you all that's a coincidence nothing happened there but then
[02:54.320 --> 02:57.520]  they gave three separate stories about where they met and what they were talking about
[02:57.520 --> 03:05.680]  so you do the math then a week ago he goes to berlin in germany and he gives this big staged
[03:05.680 --> 03:09.440]  speech in front of all the people i mean they're pretty much predestined that this guy is going to
[03:09.440 --> 03:12.480]  be the president of the united states don't think there's many people out there that really
[03:13.120 --> 03:18.240]  believe that mccain has a fighting shot or that he's there for anything else but to take a fall
[03:18.240 --> 03:25.600]  okay but he gets up there and he starts telling the citizens of the world that they will be doing
[03:25.600 --> 03:34.720]  more and not less in this new world a world that stands as one according to barack obama
[03:34.720 --> 03:42.880]  now he did not say new world order specifically he did not use that phrase however when uh
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.840]  sky news covered the uh speech it was even evident to them sky is a branch of fox news by the way
[03:47.840 --> 03:54.000]  that this was a new world order speech and that is what they called it okay so for all you people
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.440]  out there thinking that barack obama is the lesser of two evils no he's actually probably
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.240]  the eviler of the two because he is in a slicker package that more people will be fooled by
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.960]  much like bill clinton mesmerized most of the population back in the 90s you know a lot of
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.840]  people still to this day tell me how great the clintons were and you know how we need to get back
[04:15.840 --> 04:22.320]  to bill clintons form of economics and his foreign policy or his domestic policy but you see
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.040]  he tried to ratchet up the police state too he used oklahoma city he killed all those people
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.600]  at wake up he could have let those people live there was no reason to come in with a tank fire
[04:31.600 --> 04:37.440]  bomb that establishment kill all those children when we get back we're going to talk about this
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.440]  new recent development of them trying to frame out of as part of iraqi intelligence this is

[08:39.840 --> 08:45.600]  and i want to talk about this story in the huffington post now the huffington post yesterday
[08:45.600 --> 08:53.040]  reported that uh... they were that the administration was trying so badly to link al qaeda
[08:54.240 --> 09:00.000]  to uh... saddam hussein and uh... you know his regime even after the fact that after
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.920]  they had actually invaded the country and uh... cost quote unquote regime change
[09:05.920 --> 09:12.080]  okay they were still interested in linking out and only linking out of but also trying to prove
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.760]  uh... the niger weapons thing and uh... you know the urinary the uh... enriched uranium all that
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.560]  bull and how do they how the how are they trying to do this well turns out in their little deck of
[09:22.560 --> 09:29.600]  cards there remember the deck of cards i mean we're so sick people bought those cards i know my
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.040]  my friends had a hand on gas stations we all remember the deck of cards the oh so evil deck
[09:35.040 --> 09:41.440]  of iraqis well turns out that the jack of diamonds is a millionaire on the u s's dime that's right
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.600]  let me say it again the jack of diamonds is a millionaire on the u.s is done this guy was a
[09:45.600 --> 09:51.360]  paid informer from the start and what they wanted him to do just shows you how far these people will
[09:51.360 --> 09:57.520]  go i mean sure will throw out plans about painting up pt boats and saying that they're iranian and
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.480]  throwing in u.s navy seals to get shot at and start a shootout and probably kill those people and
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.160]  you know start a false flag event in order to go to war but what they wanted to do here was
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.600]  to manufacture a little bit of evidence after the fact to try to say that they were justified in
[10:11.600 --> 10:18.000]  uh both of their invasions and what they said was was that we need you to write this letter and we
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.440]  need you to date at 2000 prior to 9 11 and we need you to say that otta was running around and that
[10:23.440 --> 10:30.400]  you were helping fund him through saddam hussein and i'm like wow so they really were trying to
[10:30.400 --> 10:37.760]  pin a relationship between otta and saddam hussein and then say that somehow through this depleted
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.440]  uranium wmd scam he was raising them money see so it took care of two things at once
[10:44.480 --> 10:47.680]  first of all he would have weapons of mass destruction even if you didn't find them because
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.480]  of this letter who knows what he did with him but he absolutely had them and then two
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.880]  he may have been involved in 9 11 i mean they only tried to make that link oh i don't know thousands
[10:56.880 --> 11:04.560]  of times yet i'll still hear you know neocons and people in denial tell me that they never said they
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.880]  knew where the weapons of mass destruction were when you know doll rumsfeld got on tv several
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.200]  times and all were there in the torobora mountains we know exactly where they are they're showing
[11:15.200 --> 11:22.400]  like intricate diagrams of these cave dwelling operations that just don't even exist i mean
[11:22.400 --> 11:30.560]  you should see somebody listen type in uh i want to say al qaeda cave or taliban center i mean you
[11:30.560 --> 11:37.200]  would think i this is something that a doctor know out of a bond flick the way they they made this
[11:37.200 --> 11:42.160]  mountain look like like like a military operational center well i got news for you the only people
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.320]  that would be able to turn a mountain into this type of military operational center would be a
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.440]  westernized government much like ours or maybe europe's not many other people are going to be able
[11:51.440 --> 11:58.240]  to do that but they really did you know put the fear of the bogeyman into all of us and that's
[11:58.240 --> 12:02.400]  you know that's why i just put together this new film fabled enemies just wrapped it up
[12:02.400 --> 12:10.480]  yesterday uh mastered the dvd going out today and this this film really deals with not what
[12:10.480 --> 12:17.440]  didn't happen on 9 11 but what did and who was involved uh you know after i've traveled the country
[12:17.440 --> 12:24.080]  for the past couple years with loose change i got a good amount of the same questions why didn't
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.840]  you talk about this why aren't the israelis in your movie what's the connection to saudi arabia
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.120]  and you know i would go on and i would answer these things but never really be able to give
[12:35.120 --> 12:41.040]  a full spectrum analysis well now my film is on the way and i really think i've done a bang up
[12:41.040 --> 12:48.000]  job of not only coming up with 80 new news footage stuff nobody has ever seen ever ever it's not on
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.160]  youtube uh i guess a couple of the clips are now on youtube but mostly it's not on youtube uh very
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.600]  tough stuff to find i mean i literally combed through archives to find this stuff and to give
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.160]  you the overview we start with 9 11 and the reason i start with 9 11 is because i want to make it
[13:04.160 --> 13:13.120]  clear to people there was no other suspect other than osama bin laden no other suspect okay uh if
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.440]  you watch from that day literally before the second tower even gets hit some of the news
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.880]  organizations are talking about him as a suspect okay we're talking to talking heads like tim russer
[13:22.880 --> 13:30.640]  tom brokaw um katie kerrick matt lauer oliver north oliver north says something outstanding
[13:30.640 --> 13:36.960]  he's like oh i'm told by insiders that osama bin laden likely deployed more than 50 terrorists
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.880]  unbelievable so i take you back to that mindset i mean they're literally literally was no one
[13:44.880 --> 13:49.120]  else okay i've got them saying they're 90 percent certain it was bin laden this is before this is
[13:49.120 --> 13:53.920]  less than 12 hours after the attack these people are saying this you know they can't catch anybody
[13:53.920 --> 13:59.760]  they can't stop any of these attacks yet uh they know exactly who did it as soon as it's over
[13:59.760 --> 14:06.800]  so i make that point pretty strongly in the first couple minutes of my film now i move on from there
[14:07.440 --> 14:14.080]  i show you how the hijackers repeatedly had intelligence ties not only trained at us bases
[14:14.080 --> 14:19.840]  but lived with fbi agents protected from members of the cia by other members in the fbi and the
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.200]  cia by the way see there's always some people that are trying to do the right thing they're
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.280]  compartmentalized they believe in this country they believe in the constitution and bill of rights
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.840]  they think they're doing good for the world and in most cases they are but then when they
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.960]  go after people that are involved in black operations they don't understand why their
[14:38.960 --> 14:44.640]  investigations get pulled why gag orders begin to happen to them why the reputation is ruined
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.400]  why they become paper pushers it's because they tried to rock the boat they tried to get in on
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.560]  this black op so that brings us to the next chapter of the film we go over you know the fbi
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.640]  cover up we go over uh... you know larry claiming of judicial watch bringing robert right and other
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.160]  people's stories forward and we also covered john o'neill the man who was in charge of going
[15:06.160 --> 15:12.000]  after bin laden for the fbi and what happens to him well he's so upset that they keep obstructing
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.360]  his investigations he decides to leave he gets hired by crawl to become head of the world trade
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.720]  center security he moves his desk in the day before nine eleven days killed during the attack
[15:22.720 --> 15:28.160]  and completely silence and that's just uh... you know the first few chapters and we really
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.720]  start getting into the horde hardcore stuff saudi involvement israeli involvement pakistan
[15:32.720 --> 15:39.440]  being set up u.s government officials admitting that foreign governments are involved in nine
[15:39.440 --> 15:46.080]  eleven it's it's a powerful film we hope you see it's going to be available september first
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.840]  on the web and we're gonna have some trailers for you this weekend so i'm i'm very excited
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.920]  about it uh... i want to thank alex jones for giving me the opportunity to put this film out
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.480]  i think it is a great piece to go along with loose change final carter loose change second
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.920]  addition especially if you want to see something that doesn't have anything to do with the pentagon
[16:05.920 --> 16:09.840]  strike doesn't have anything to do with what happened to chanxville doesn't have anything
[16:09.840 --> 16:14.720]  to do with the control demolition of the world trade center is a very different movie folks
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.520]  and i hope you support me and check it out in fact if you go to myspace dot com slash fable
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.560]  that means you can be our friend on myspace and help get the word out it's amazing what you can do
[16:25.360 --> 16:31.360]  with a little bit of motivation in this country another big story that i wanted to cover and i
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.640]  covered briefly with alex jones earlier in the week was this cab driver because now they're saying
[16:36.640 --> 16:42.000]  well he could be out in his earliest five months and what carib driver am i talking about i shouldn't
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.720]  even say cab driver limo driver bin laden's limo driver now again let's go over it this is his third
[16:48.720 --> 16:54.560]  trial let me say it again it is his third trial he's been picked up since the quote unquote beginning
[16:54.560 --> 17:00.240]  of the war on terror okay it's just unbelievable to me the guy got tortured for years and years and
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.800]  years in guantanamo bay they tried him twice for terrorism they found nothing let me say that again
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.600]  they found nothing these are rigged military tribunals this isn't a jury of his peers okay these
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.640]  are people off the street these are people in the military saying oh no he doesn't have anything to
[17:16.640 --> 17:20.800]  do with terrorism you know this guy was probably just trying to feed his family he took a job
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.760]  as a limo driver for a rich guy he has no idea what's going on so then they bring this other
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.720]  show trial and that's what it is it's a show trial it's something to put into the consciousness of
[17:30.720 --> 17:40.560]  the american people through msnbc fox news cnn ap all the mainline websites that al-qaeda is real
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.560]  they're around every corner and we're getting them look at this guy where we're sentencing him
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.240]  so anyway he got sentenced to five and a half years and they're saying well
[17:48.960 --> 17:55.680]  he could be out in five months or not at all or not at all this guy had his hands

[18:03.120 --> 18:07.840]  because he knows he's not getting out well listen they're not letting him out in five years so he
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.920]  can tell the horror stories of how he was tortured again and again in a private military prison
[18:13.920 --> 18:21.040]  only to be brought to trial three separate times so they can convict him of driving a limousine
[18:21.040 --> 18:26.080]  and then send him back to torture it's absolutely incredible don't you think alex

[27:45.760 --> 27:50.640]  saying that that they have invaded georgia and then i'm going back several months ago

[28:26.640 --> 28:31.600]  of south oasia and the numbers of refugees and climate so they're literally there to kill the

[28:51.440 --> 28:58.400]  this you set the stage for a global battle and if you don't think that they want some kind of a global
[28:58.960 --> 29:05.840]  conflict to bring in a global solution you just don't know this country's history you just don't
[29:05.840 --> 29:11.440]  understand how they brought the united nations into being how they tried to get a league of

[29:16.560 --> 29:23.440]  war two they were able to get a form of global government in the united nations this is very

[35:52.960 --> 35:58.400]  the west to scare the population to submission all over russia they are encircling funding
[35:58.400 --> 36:04.240]  chechen rebels you name it to attack russian forces to elicit a response and this is literally
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.200]  the incredible bravada and arrogance of the new world order crowd in washington london and tell
[36:09.200 --> 36:15.520]  of eve poking russia and there's no doubt this is a major hot escalation here we will be forced
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.560]  to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods the russian foreign ministry
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.160]  said in a statement now i'm trying to pull the one up from a couple months before that
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.680]  where they threaten the use saying we have nuclear weapons we're going to pull that and
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.080]  read that on air for you the ministry did not detail what its response might entail
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.000]  that ought to rise the secretary of state hail the agreement as a step forward for international
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.400]  security but see this article is boiling it down just over missile defense and and and radar
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.280]  which missile defense is meant to be moved in so that russia can't counter strike
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.280]  with missiles if they're hit so that their response missiles can be shot down
[36:49.280 --> 36:54.880]  this is the equivalent of when the russians moved weapons into cuba during the cuban missile crisis
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.080]  in 1961 bermas well i'm finding very very interesting about this is the timing i mean
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.080]  this is literally happening on the day that the olympics is kicked off and the international
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.600]  community is pretty much preoccupied and all the drones out there are pretty preoccupied as well
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.480]  i've queued up this uh... cnn clip should we throw it on alex yeah let's uh... let's do that in
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.440]  just a moment and then after we do that russia moles arms and balero's to counter us shield
[37:19.440 --> 37:24.480]  this was roiders two days ago wednesday august 6 russia may consider deploying a strategic bombers
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.880]  or station tactical missiles that's frogs in its close ally balero's to counter uh... measured to
[37:30.880 --> 37:34.720]  plan u.s. missile shield in europe moscow envoy and meant set on wednesday
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.320]  so they're threatening and been threatening to invade a bunch of different countries
[37:38.320 --> 37:42.400]  that were basically through covert means that the globalist went in had those governments
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.880]  overthrown put in uh... pro u.s. governments who are setting up the same torture squads the whole
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.760]  nine yards bring bring another form of tyranny into the region and uh... this affects us all
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.480]  ladies and gentlemen we don't have fallout shelters we don't have bunkers the new order does
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.520]  in its order out of chaos they want to bring in a global crisis to offer their solution
[38:03.520 --> 38:06.880]  uh... jason go ahead and play it you got it
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.000]  putting to russian state television uh... to be a major development in this uh... in this crisis
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  between uh... russia and georgia over the breakaway georgian territory of south asetia
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.480]  uh... pictures that have come in broadcast on russian state television channel one television
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.040]  fact in this country uh... over the past uh... uh... several minutes or so
[38:27.040 --> 38:33.200]  uh... show a convoy of russian tanks and armored vehicles uh... moving according to the commentary
[38:33.200 --> 38:40.320]  on the on the television station into the breakaway territory of south asetia so crossing
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.920]  at the russian frontier into the neighboring country of georgia to bolster i expect
[38:45.920 --> 38:52.720]  at the uh... russian peacekeeping forces that already uh... on the ground in south asetia as a result
[38:52.720 --> 38:58.800]  of an international agreement to bring to an end the ethnic fighting that took place in that territory
[38:58.800 --> 39:04.880]  in the early nineteen nineties now according to state television at these tanks and armored vehicles
[39:04.880 --> 39:12.000]  should be uh... approaching the uh... regional capital uh... skin valley uh... within the next
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.600]  step or so uh... and and that would obviously put them in dire we're going to play more of this in
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.960]  a moment but this is just an incredible whitewash all the tanks are coming to take over the capital
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.000]  it's just a friendly happy thing from back in the nineties we know russia's threatening everybody
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.280]  and this is how they spend it to not divert the public from worshiping uh... the globalist uh...
[39:33.280 --> 39:42.960]  shindig known as the olympics uh... please continue
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.640]  confrontation with the georgian forces uh... that say that they have completely encircled
[39:48.640 --> 39:54.080]  that main city in south asetia so a very dangerous very dramatic development
[39:54.080 --> 39:57.200]  in this crisis these are two armies coming together andrew
[39:57.200 --> 40:03.520]  to back that up or respect about thirty seconds muscular response to this matter because skin valley
[40:04.160 --> 40:10.320]  within the next hour or so uh... and and that would obviously put them in direct confrontation
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.640]  with the georgian forces uh... that say that they have completely encircled that main city
[40:16.640 --> 40:22.240]  in south asetia so a very dangerous very dramatic development in this crisis that we're apparently
[40:22.240 --> 40:29.840]  now witnessing andrew what why such a muscular response to this matter because russia does
[40:29.840 --> 40:33.360]  recognize uh... georgia's sovereign territory
[40:35.520 --> 40:41.280]  it does and russia repeatedly restates that the fact that it respects georgia's territorial
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.640]  integrity but at the same time it always says that it will protect russian citizens
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.760]  and over the course of the last decade or so what's happened in south asetia is that
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.840]  many of the ethnic ascetians that want independence from georgian rule have taken the option of
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.720]  russian citizenship they've been fast tracked towards russian citizenship and so now perhaps
[41:02.720 --> 41:08.480]  as many as ninety percent of the population in south asetia hold russian passport it's really
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.080]  very much supported the separatist movement uh... the separatist government is very much supported
[41:14.080 --> 41:19.360]  by mosco by the kremlin and it's on that basis that the russian foreign ministry and russian
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.080]  officials and the kremlin say that they uh... that they'll do everything they can to protect
[41:24.080 --> 41:30.160]  russian citizens in addition to that as i mentioned there are russian peace a force of russian
[41:30.160 --> 41:36.240]  peacekeepers in the territory of south asetia and we understand from the interfax news agency and
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.640]  from other russian officials that have been broadcast on state television and elsewhere
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.080]  but a barracks of the russian peacekeepers stationed in south asetia came under attack
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.040]  uh... from artillery shells from the georgian side
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.920]  okay we've now got some uh... audio and video of fierce fighting we're gonna play for you
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.520]  here in a few minutes while he's queuing that up let me give you some of the background
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.400]  on this russia because the population in russia itself in the heart of the cancer that was
[42:04.400 --> 42:11.200]  communism that the european u.s and british banks funded uh... what ninety plus years ago
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.760]  that had run out of steam the even the east german security apparatus wasn't oppressing
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.280]  people like they were supposed to anymore they had to stage this collapse
[42:19.280 --> 42:22.880]  they put all the hammers and sickles back on the vehicles
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.560]  they have basically just brought in uh... kind of a commie slash fascist system so we're not
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.080]  saying russia's good but we're not saying iran is good but above all of this sits this larger
[42:34.080 --> 42:40.560]  globalist system that manipulates these uh... the different factions together now russia now
[42:40.560 --> 42:45.760]  with all this oil money and natural gas money is reasserting itself uh... the anglo-american
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.600]  establishment backed up by london in dc has been moving in and and aggressively pushing russia
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.400]  taking more and more of its satellites over uh... that he had had uh... you know when it partially
[42:56.400 --> 43:02.000]  collapsed that it had lost so there's a fight over these different sectors going on right now
[43:02.000 --> 43:08.320]  this is an example of a major flare-up let's go back to the late nineties in the final days of
[43:08.320 --> 43:14.240]  the attack on syria with the handover of uh... more than one quarter about what twenty seven percent
[43:14.240 --> 43:21.440]  roughly of syria uh... to hardcore al-qaeda groups uh... backed up uh... of course according to
[43:21.440 --> 43:28.640]  government uh... senate reports uh... by the cia and uh... al-qaeda going in and attacking the serbs
[43:28.640 --> 43:33.360]  it'd be like uh... foreign government attacking it'd be like a cuba attacked texas and mississippi
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.240]  louisiana florida and then when federal forces came into the area the united states and
[43:38.240 --> 43:45.520]  nato came in and bomb them the russians poured in and mass went down into pristina uh... the regional
[43:45.520 --> 43:51.200]  state capital of uh... what is now officially the country of kosovo today our media lied and said
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.280]  that wasn't the plan to make that be a breakaway but that was the plan the entire time and there
[43:55.280 --> 44:00.960]  was almost a shooting war with u.s special forces uh... on the ground at that time with uh...
[44:00.960 --> 44:10.080]  uh... large uh... groups uh... of russian special forces backed up by a major columns of armor
[44:10.080 --> 44:16.880]  and aircraft and there was a tent standoff there and so now we're seeing fierce fighting flare up
[44:16.880 --> 44:33.520]  uh... jason go ahead and play that uh... newest clip for people here it is
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.880]  seeing images of car driving through a city is all artillery
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.880]  detonation explodes missile launchers tanks just oh my god look like hundreds of tanks
[44:42.880 --> 44:50.960]  uh... the russians always love their uh... their propelled self-propelled uh... missile
[44:50.960 --> 44:57.200]  platforms that have the scores of missiles in them just unbelievable massive russian invasion
[44:57.200 --> 45:02.400]  this looks like scenes of world war two now that we're seeing here on the screen right now
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.760]  again we're posting all of this on prisonplanet dot com and info wars dot com right now
[45:07.760 --> 45:15.600]  um... there's a massive massive columns of russian armor artillery self-propelled
[45:17.360 --> 45:28.560]  any personnel and any armor missile platforms again this is uh... press from miles away
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.080]  videotaping different plumes of artillery and missile barrage uh... impacts vermus that's pretty
[45:34.080 --> 45:40.240]  hardcore not only is it hardcore but i want to reiterate that this is not the russian military
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.720]  invading another army okay they're attacking civilians that there's no army to fight here
[45:44.720 --> 45:47.600]  they're literally going there to take over a territory and they're attacking
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.360]  civilian villages this is on well well that was one blurb in the in the in the in the cnp
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.720]  they're talking about civilians that have been in revolution against each other in a struggle
[45:58.720 --> 46:04.480]  by the pro russian forces in that province against the main line georgian so it's it's similar
[46:04.480 --> 46:11.920]  states always use minority groups in regions to export larger crises that can bring down a government
[46:11.920 --> 46:18.000]  so what you have is you have two different sides fighting like two dogs with a uh tug of war
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.200]  and this is escalating but but they did report there are georgian government forces
[46:23.200 --> 46:30.320]  forces that came in to surround the breakaway uh... sector that borders russia and so basically
[46:30.320 --> 46:36.480]  you have russian forces going in to back up rebels uh... in the uh... ethnic minority area
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.640]  that see themselves as russian as you heard ninety plus percent holding russian passports
[46:41.280 --> 46:46.960]  so it's it's very similar what you saw with the coast of uh... situation where the u.s went in
[46:46.960 --> 46:53.680]  and used islamicist out of the uh... the the leninist state of albania uh... to attack uh...
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.240]  again the u.s using communists to go after free marketeers uh... who were setting up their own
[46:58.880 --> 47:02.960]  wonderland i mean serbia was becoming a first world nation people were vacationing there
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.800]  they were building up their own industries that had to be destroyed so don't don't think this is
[47:06.800 --> 47:11.040]  the u.s and then they're fighting communist uh... this is the exact opposite of that both sides
[47:11.040 --> 47:15.280]  are evil that's how it works so they train us that one side's good one side's bad no
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.400]  just like the bible says almost all governments are completely and totally uh... wicked here's some
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.600]  of the other news we have coming in for those that don't know masses i mean bermas we're here
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.640]  watching this video how many missile launchers how many artillery uh... self-propelled uh...
[47:30.640 --> 47:35.360]  artillery systems how many tanks were we seeing just from those video clips it looked like hundreds
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.160]  yeah i mean uh... missile launchers alone in the five seconds they were on the screen saw a couple
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.400]  dozen you know what i'm saying well just endless hills of them just it showed a field going away
[47:44.400 --> 47:49.120]  would just scores of them yeah it cut to masses of armored columns of tanks going in
[47:49.680 --> 47:52.960]  and doesn't look like they're covering it right on the ground there either other than these tanks
[47:52.960 --> 47:56.640]  coming in all you're seeing are these huge plumes of smoke when they then when they launch that's
[47:56.640 --> 48:01.040]  right you've got two different video feeds they're showing one from inside georgia uh... what looks
[48:01.040 --> 48:07.200]  like about four to five miles away huge plumes on the horizon i mean these are gigantic plumes
[48:07.200 --> 48:11.680]  because they're the the other many miles away and these things are filling half the screen then you
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.120]  have uh... western reporters uh... that are on the russian side watching the armored columns go in
[48:17.120 --> 48:21.760]  yeah and the time you know there's russian forces are just pouring into georgia this looks like a
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.800]  major invasion yeah and the timing is very very suspect to me this is a time when we're talking
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.840]  about possibly invading pakistan or that musharov may be overthrown and all of a sudden they're the
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.640]  enemy and i've heard a lot of talk that russia and pakistan may form an alliance against us in this
[48:36.640 --> 48:40.240]  next world war three i know there's a few people on the horizon that have been talking about that
[48:40.240 --> 48:43.360]  i didn't really think that was possible do you think that's going to be a possibility right now
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.320]  this is all just completely amazing uh... caucuses and crisis georgia invades rebel region
[48:50.320 --> 48:55.280]  london telegraph the caucuses have descended into a crisis after georgian groups launched
[48:55.280 --> 48:58.480]  a full-scale military assault against moscow black rebels

[49:42.080 --> 49:46.720]  to a portion more blame on moscow and the separatist forces it supports
[49:46.720 --> 49:51.440]  for taking the volatile region of the brink of war you got all these arrogant globalist up there

[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:09.920]  against uh western buildup of weapons uh in our territories and on the borders of our territories

[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:40.640]  numbers huge numbers of what looks like regular russian infiltrate infantry ap and cnn are both
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:45.600]  reporting than the last few months as you just heard the georgian president say there has been a
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:52.320]  buildup in quote drills militaries do this that's why they have urban warfare drills all over the
[1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:55.840]  united states we've gotten the documents we've got emergency managers and police chiefs on who
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:10:00.000]  were briefed about this now it's declassified but i told you this 10 years ago or be technical
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.640]  nine years ago uh our military has been doing long-term drills so that if they really have
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:09.120]  martial law and takeover our cities people will say oh well we've seen troops do this many times
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:14.080]  we're being acclimated for a takeover as well just as the russians were building up and preparing
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.920]  uh to where the georgian military didn't know when they actually but you finally were getting
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:22.240]  ready to strike because there had been months and months of massive military buildup and quote
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:31.360]  war games and drills on their border so uh russia is basically striking back we're not choosing
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:36.000]  sides here we're coldly reporting the facts the crime syndicate that controls the us we always
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:41.200]  have the psychology of we you know we're backing the georgians know uh the criminal bankers have
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:47.120]  control of this nation a lot the most dominant faction the anglo-american faction they have
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:54.000]  been overthrowing governments all over the place uh in the last uh decade all around russia scores
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:00.160]  of nations they've had military overthrows they have had elected overthrows uh they have had
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:07.440]  sabotage i mean the list goes on and on russia has now been pushed back into military stance
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:12.640]  they have built back up putin of course is the prime minister he has his puppet uh as the new
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:18.720]  president uh over there now the russian military has been gearing up for the last decade uh the
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:26.720]  last uh well now eight years since putin got into 99 massive uh military buildup i want to
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:32.880]  finish up with what the georgian president is saying we just left off with him when he was
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:38.640]  talking about how this was preceded by drills and then a sneak attack kind of like hitler
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:43.280]  doing drills on the border with poland and russia and then the sneak attack with operation
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:51.600]  baba rosa here we go as soon as the suitable pretext was found yesterday they moved in but
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:57.520]  uh you know it was uh meant to be this way as we found out all the way through and they didn't hide
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:02.160]  very much that you know they've been preparing they've been looking at world opinion how they
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:07.040]  would react to this preparation and in the end they just moved in it's unheard of unparalleled
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:14.640]  it's absolutely outrageous i think it uh i mean since and let me just add they they did this on
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:19.280]  the olympics day because they know the globalist are using the olympics as this image of world
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:24.880]  government this image of it being unity under the control of the globalist this hitlerian image
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:28.880]  you know he drew the rings he designed the olympics he designed the torch all of it look
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:33.920]  it up it's in the encyclopedia they know this is a high holy day for the globalist now starting at
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:39.840]  eight oh eight a.m and eight seconds eight eight eight on eight eight eight lighting the torch
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:47.200]  doing all of this uh and then meanwhile we see this launched on this date knowing that the media
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:55.120]  would basically cover it up this is unprecedented and unparalleled i agree with the georgian president
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:02.480]  on that russia invaded um afghanistan in the soviet union invaded afghanistan in 79 or
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:08.800]  for a soviet union invaded checoslova back in 68 with its tanks on hungary in 56 nothing like that
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:15.200]  has happened in a post-war world and that's certainly very very troubling because your
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:19.440]  government has had very close relations forgive me your government has had very close relations
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:25.760]  with nato are you in contact with nato authorities are you making any appeal to outside nations to
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:34.560]  intervene i spoke yesterday with secretary general of nato before russians started before russians
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:40.080]  got involved because we were already felt that he was going up uh you know separatists that operate
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:44.880]  in georgia that are not independent fighters they they claim to be part of russia this is a small
[1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:50.240]  enclave where population is less than 30 000 people in the middle of georgia they're going to use the
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:55.760]  mexicans for this here you better believe that's gonna happen government since 1992 uh and uh mark
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:00.160]  my words within the next 10 years you're going to see this in texas and california and that will
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:06.960]  be international i4 troops here in the us if things continue is a 95 chance within 10 years you
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:11.680]  heard it here first you will have the same thing here and they will be backed by mexican troops
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:16.080]  they're already doing forays into the u.s their cia backed this is our own government attacking
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  ourselves i just want you to remember this using enclaves to do this and i feel so sorry for mexican
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:25.680]  americans they're going to be in the middle of all this i just wanted to add that historical caveat
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.480]  so the whole situation was abnormal but a small tiny part of the part of country claiming to be
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:38.960]  part of another state but the point was that when temperature was went up uh i i phoned secretary
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:44.560]  general of nato to express my concern and ask for his mediation now unfortunately the whole thing
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:51.360]  has erupted has erupted before he had time to react uh i spoke with him today again but it's
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:55.760]  not only about nato you know certain russians have been irritated by our contacts with nato but
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.720]  president putin in the past and our prime minister putin has many times told me that
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:06.160]  he it's totally unacceptable for him and not only my close relations with the united states and the
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.280]  west in general but the political system that jordan has opted for democracy freedom and that's i
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:17.120]  think the major irritant in this part of what russia regards this as exclusive back here what should
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:26.320]  the west and the united states do now wake up wake up this is what is happening now it's not about
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:33.360]  georgia it's about the basic values the west has the basic values u.s has always always preached us
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:40.560]  you know the uh we are we are a small country but you know we are attacked because we wanted to be
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:44.560]  free we are attacked because we wanted to build genuine democracy we are attacked because we
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:49.920]  built a non corrupt free enterprises okay let's comment on that again both sides are corrupt
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:53.360]  both sides are criminal that's the new world order system but let's talk about the facts
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:16:00.000]  weapons systems by the united states and nato have been moved in to georgia they've been moved
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.200]  in to czechos czechoslovakia the czech republic into ukraine and into several other nations
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:11.120]  and the russians have said stop moving high tech weapons systems into our nations and it has come
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:16.000]  out in fact erin i need your help erin's doing five jobs i don't have the personnel he's in

[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:04.640]  number was 8 000 u.s special forces arrived but but but just under that basic search of uh
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.480]  of uh what search did you do what search did i tell you like u.s special forces in georgia

[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:42.560]  of that let me tell you right now that again u.s forces are there probably battling russians
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:48.960]  right now more us special forces to age fight against insurgents uh tuesday november 20th
[1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:56.640]  2007 and uh that is in georgia quote finding insurgents now no no that's the long headline
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:18:01.520]  that's out of afghanistan okay okay no it's it's it's in georgia just like the bbc you know what
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:06.640]  read me the bbc right now read that for everybody out there listening the 2002 bbc one we just had
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:09.920]  yeah go ahead and read that one that's the latest i'll find the the one i'm talking about during
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:14.960]  the break you got it um all right five u.s military advisors have arrived in the former
[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:19.200]  soviet republic of georgia c five that's how they they tell you but it's thousands of us
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.200]  in what is uh being seen as a possible new front for the u.s war on terror and believe
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:28.080]  and this is way way back in the day when we were all still called by fear we're just like oh the
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:33.520]  war on terror at least uh u.s six helicopters have also been sent and the the unconfirmed
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:40.160]  u.s media reports say up to 200 special forces may be deployed oh no it's it's 9 000 now and this is
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:44.640]  way back then the u.s is stepping in because of reports that fighters are allied with of course
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:49.200]  osama london's al-qaeda terror network meanwhile they really used al-qaeda to attack the russians
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:53.600]  in syria which is always you know their brothers and the russians had to go in and fight al-qaeda
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:57.840]  didn't that come out no three yeah yeah no no that came out at the time oh it was a no too it came
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:02.560]  out like right after no no no i'm going back to syria oh okay the point is how asinine
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:06.960]  this is that russia's al-qaeda i mean it's just unbelievable uh president george w bush defended
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:12.400]  u.s military plans after russia russia which has traditionally regarded georgia as part of its sphere
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:18.000]  of influence had criticized the u.s involvement as long as there is al-qaeda influence anywhere we
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.040]  will help the the host countries route them and bring them to justice mr bush said this is a new
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:28.640]  front that's how dumb i think the american people are nothing to do with al-qaeda the u.s clearly
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:33.680]  using al-qaeda against russian territories and russian satellites and then they have the nerve
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:38.720]  just like they say iran is al-qaeda when they're sheite the opposite group the arch enemy of al-qaeda
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.200]  well most people let me get this straight exactly let's get this straight al-qaeda comes from saudi
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:50.160]  arabia they're suing the majority muslim group 80 82 if you want to get technical okay this is
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:56.160]  ridiculous russia is not al-qaeda they've been fighting us back to al-qaeda in afghanistan
[1:19:56.160 --> 1:20:03.920]  and in chechnya and in georgia the united states seems to be celebrating over its triumph of
[1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:08.640]  reducing government debt but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record
[1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:15.840]  high in 1999 reaching a peak of 14.8 trillion dollars marking 10.57 percent annual increase
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:21.200]  outpacing its previous 10 years the u.s economy receives its currency by taking on debt through
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:25.840]  private banking institution called the federal reserve system in the year 2000 debt growth
[1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:32.000]  collapsed to only 4.5 percent it's bad enough that the u.s citizens is bound by debt in order to have
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.800]  commerce however shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years

[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:31.040]  russian tanks tens of thousands of troops poured into georgia there is a battle over one of the
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:38.400]  major cities there between georgian forces and the russian military and pro russian separatist in
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:44.000]  the area the olympics launched today this is not getting one one hundredth the news attention it
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.560]  deserves russia has threatened in the last six months repeatedly to use any military option
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:56.560]  in quote including their nuclear weapons against nato in the u.s if they continue to build up
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:03.760]  military forces uh in surrounding former territories of the soviet union you can just google russian
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:08.000]  foreign minister threatens military option against the west you'll get all of the different threats
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  uh they're now living up to that threat with conventional armored columns of tanks uh self
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.280]  propelled missile platforms anti personnel missile platforms anti armor missile platforms
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:29.520]  i'm now seeing some video of some helicopters uh this is just amazing that this is going on
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:36.800]  and we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg uh the uh georgian president is begging for help
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:42.560]  and asking why this isn't getting any attention uh just geopolitically if russia is allowed to
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:47.200]  do this and i'm not calling for military action against them i'm just stating the facts this
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:54.400]  will embolden them this is a test a major trial balloon to invade areas of Czechoslovakia they
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:59.520]  have threatened to attack areas of the ukraine i've got to pull up from memory and and from
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:04.800]  online all the other places i know it's more than what is it it's all it's close to 10 different
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:09.920]  regions and countries and sectors there's a whole bunch of nations the scores of them all around
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:14.240]  russia that they are threatening to invade some of the stands they're threatening to invade
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:20.400]  they've been shooting their mouth off about going into areas uh just north uh of afghanistan
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:26.000]  russian troops have been building up again around afghanistan uh they've been reportedly
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.120]  talking about alliances with pakistan if the united states attacks the united states has given nukes
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:36.080]  to pakistan this is the new world order folks they hand out nukes to everybody hand out weapons fund
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:42.720]  every muslim al-qaeda group you can imagine to attack russia and then they get on the news and say
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:49.680]  oh we've sent us special forces into georgia in the last six years seven years now it's about six
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:55.280]  and a half to be technical uh to quote fight al-qaeda this is such a sick joke when they used al-qaeda
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:59.760]  against the serbs when they used them against the russians in afghanistan when they used them
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:06.800]  against the russians uh in chechnya and i'm not choosing sides i'm report see most of you out
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:11.040]  there especially neocons and liberals you look at things through your political perspective
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:16.320]  i'm just coldly reporting the facts here now this is going to make oil explode we're going to watch
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:21.600]  and see this is going to make oil go up you are probably going to see other true separatist groups
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:27.120]  terrorist groups make moves now today or tomorrow while this is happening that's how world war
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:31.600]  start everybody starts making their moves everybody lines up and then there's flashpoint
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:36.720]  and a lot of things happen i pray to god this deescalates the georgian forces are now battling
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:43.200]  russian troops i mean there is massive artillery barrages uh they've got the russians always have
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:50.960]  loved these big mobile missile batteries that you know you know firing these things with
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:56.240]  cluster bombs shooting out of them uh you know at a thousand feet off the ground i mean it is just
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:04.800]  massive bombardments cities on fire just all sorts of battle i'm going on right now and our media
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:09.760]  and i'm still scanning during the breaks other major channels are acting like this isn't even
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:15.040]  happening i can't believe that it's not even being covered and that's why russia obviously attacked
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:20.880]  because they're being attacked they're being encircled they're being prodded they're being
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:24.560]  pushed so let's get this straight the new world order is attacking the american people's liberties
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.120]  they're encircling russia russia's enslaving its people china's enslaving its people it's just a
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:34.640]  bunch of criminal governments running around fighting with their own people and making moves
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:41.120]  against our dollar against our currency against our name and now making moves and russia has said
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:47.920]  we will nuke you russia has said we may preemptively use even our nuclear arsenal you can pull up the
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.840]  russian foreign minister quote on that they said we will use military options including our nuclear
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:58.720]  weapons an incredible statement the russians do not shoot their mouths off folks they do not play
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:06.080]  games i told you going into this fall is the most dangerous time in world history we have ever had
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:11.600]  more dangerous in the cuban missile crisis that's every historian we've had on white house uh experts
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:19.360]  former white house historians analyst top cia analyst uh economist former you know people like
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:26.000]  bob Chapman and intelligence and in economics we are being hit from every angle this is only the
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:30.800]  beginning it does not look good going into the fall gray that the taunt and cooler heads prevail
[1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:36.080]  but the neocons are a bunch of arrogant wicked child molesting old men and they think this is
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:41.040]  beautiful and wonderful and they want nuclear war they want death destruction they they they just
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:46.720]  love evil so all of you smart mouth neocons out there who like war well you just might get something
[1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:58.080]  with russia now we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:07.520]  listener ask yourself can i be deceived matthew 24 states four times in the last days many will
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:12.800]  be deceived there are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist what do you know
[1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:18.800]  about the beast it's mark and the antichrist is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer
[1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:25.920]  in belgium is it's mark an implanted chip a tattoo the national id card or 666 is the antichrist a
[1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:31.600]  person title or both some believe these things are in the future others believe that it's in the past
[1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:37.200]  first john states the antichrist is already in the world what is the truth and what is a lie
[1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:41.600]  are you willing to search god's word for the truth friends these answers are in the bible

[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:11.600]  grounds here and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did truth rising is a breakthrough
[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:20.720]  9 11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story widman eba director
[1:32:20.720 --> 1:32:27.360]  on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe this film follows the growing
[1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:33.040]  momentum of 9 11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters
[1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:37.280]  he had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown he takes his hand off and
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:43.840]  you hear three two one and it was boom boom boom boom boom this is an emergency transmission
[1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:51.520]  worldwide download truth rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:57.200]  the dvd at info wars.com if we don't expose the government sponsored terror they're going to commit
[1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:06.640]  more acts and bring in martial law. Federal agents we are armed what would you do if you
[1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:16.480]  knew all the things we knew we have to stand up but you turn over to nothing what if you saw
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:24.080]  all of the things that sprung would you stand tall and strong oh would you turn my father
[1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:34.000]  or just came by the office he said that early this morning he saw it on cnn at about seven
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:37.840]  he turned on the tv laying in bed and uh
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:45.040]  that they were just calmly reporting that oh russian troops are rolling in to help with some
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:50.000]  peacekeeping then meanwhile the georgian presidents we're under attack help us we're under attack and
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:57.280]  it's just massive bombardments of several major cities uh just what appears to be we've personally
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:02.480]  seen from different camera shots different terrain hundreds of tanks hundreds of uh
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:09.760]  self-propelled missile batteries there finally i got the technical term from my memory self-propelled
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:19.040]  missile batteries anti personnel self-propelled missile batteries let's be clear u.s special
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:26.960]  forces are in georgia are deployed with the georgian military it is a foregone conclusion i would say
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:36.800]  99 percent chance that special forces are in forward areas deployed and directing georgian
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:44.880]  forces against spitznets russian special forces and it is about a 60 i would say 70 dead reckoning
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:49.840]  right in there that u.s troops have already probably been killed today that's right ladies and
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:58.960]  gentlemen there was a huge cold war as you know uh more than 4 000 u.s troops died from 1960 to 1964
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:04.080]  when the official conflict with the gulf of tunken resolution was signed after that staged
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:12.160]  false flag event in vietnam mainly marine and army quote advisors 4 000 died and they kept
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:20.160]  it secret for four years that's a thousand plus it was like 4 600 is the official number you can
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:27.120]  go look it up it's over 4 000 so around around 1100 1200 a year dying and they just kept it secret
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:32.320]  there have been thousands dying in the battle the now eight-year battle in columbia over
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:36.640]  cocaine fields not to eradicate cocaine but to get control of that for the new york stock exchange
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:42.560]  as reported by roiders this will cause oil to explode in fact let me just check oil prices
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:48.560]  right now uh guys i've see they're all final mastering a dvd they're all doing that right now
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:53.360]  and normally i have people feeding me info it's hard to surf while i do this hey uh
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:00.560]  check oil prices for me you got a terminal open i got the board operator out there he just arrived
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:09.920]  uh i want to check oil i bet oil's up right now just amazing i'm wondering what gold's doing
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.480]  right now let's go ahead and take some phone calls for those that don't know georgia is under
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.880]  attack as russian tanks roll in i was going to take off today and my i had a lot of businesses
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.600]  to take care of at home and with accounting and with the move to the new office my wife said why
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:31.120]  are you going in to the old office where bermas is doing the show today and i said i've got a bad
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:36.800]  feeling i i told her i need to go into the office i got a bad feeling and i came in and said oh
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:40.800]  bermas is dropping by hey do you hear the latest stage al-qaeda news and he's like yeah and all
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:49.440]  of a sudden he goes look at this on singing in russia invading georgia all right i said i'd take
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:54.320]  phone calls bob chapman's been moved 30 minutes earlier he'll be on with us next hour he uh fought in uh
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:01.200]  secret operations against the russians in the um 60s
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:07.680]  late 50s early 60s and he's been talking about how this was going to happen for months here on the show
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:11.520]  roberta in new york are on the air go ahead
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:19.760]  i hello yes go ahead yeah i'm sorry alex was roberto but um yeah first time a caller a long
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.400]  time listener i was just uh wanted to get a question into you and uh maybe a comment
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:29.840]  if i have time afterwards yeah i was wondering um i'm sure you've read 1984 where uh goldstein
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:35.440]  depicts the perpetual war scenario where um you know you can never really figure out who the enemy
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:40.560]  is um my question to you alex is and you know and you made a reference to how they're trying to
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:45.920]  switch al-qaeda to russia now you know or anybody who fit that description when it's convenient
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:52.560]  do you think that we are moving into that uh puts uh like 1984 type of scenario or maybe the
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:58.320]  algis huxley brave new world well and i just well it's a mix of the 1984 slash oldest huxley uh thx
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:06.320]  1138 chemical lobotomy shaved head slave drone social worker society it's a it's an amalgamation
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:12.800]  of the two and social planners of course wrote books about how both those books were just basically
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.640]  exposes on two different merging systems of total enslavement the final revolution by the elite
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:23.200]  against free humanity so we could never resist and never think again destroying the language
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:30.080]  destroying the family tearing everything good apart uh but uh we know there's two major globalist
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:35.680]  power blocks we know that mafias do fight with each other uh we do know that they normally have
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:41.040]  agents within each other's camps but always do and so god knows what's happening here but we know
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:45.680]  this it's bad for liberty it's bad for freedom it's bad for the dollar it's it could lead
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:51.120]  into a wider war in fact probably will at least in several other breakaway republics uh their
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:56.400]  former satellites of the soviet union and us special forces are there in the front lines
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:04.080]  involved in all of this and are no doubt engaging russian forces right now thanks alex now i just
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:10.880]  wanted to um uh just go a little bit off topic if it's possible um i suffer from uh chrome disease
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:15.840]  and uh you know i i don't know how i got it to be honest there's no known cause but well it's a
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.920]  cover story for an autoimmune just like muscral dystrophy is autoimmune and it's all tied in with
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:27.680]  poisons in the fertilizers let me give you the cocktail the fertilizers are the byproduct of chemical
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:35.520]  waste plants the chemical waste of cracking oil uh with the fluoride and other chemicals breaking
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:43.120]  down the molecules uh and it is then dumped into uh both yard fertilizer it's even worse but also in
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:49.600]  farm fertilizer and so that basically attacks the nerves in the body uh to where the body just
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:54.880]  starts shutting down and then attacking itself uh after some of the nerves are damaged uh are
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:00.080]  mutated due to so many continuum insults the mercury and the vaccines in hundreds of studies i
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:03.840]  just ran into it again in a major government study without even looking for it yesterday
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:09.120]  about femorisol not just tied to neurological problems but all nerve problems and uh neurological
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:15.280]  and neuron degenerative diseases uh crones is an autoimmune response and it's a cocktail umbrella
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:21.200]  mass diagnosis uh but in almost every case and again hundreds of studies on this this has even
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:26.800]  been in major medical journals in every uh do you know definitively diagnose crones disease now
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:34.320]  there's many crones like other diseases they find viruses from the measles mumps and rubella shots
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:41.920]  and uh because they they take up resonance in the large and small intestine
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:52.960]  uh which are a symbiosis area for viruses and bacteria in the uh in the uptake of nutrients
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:57.360]  and so that's an area that allows more things to take up residency because they're needed
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:03.920]  also there's tie-ins not just with the viruses uh in the vaccines that are taking up residency in
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:12.000]  the intestinal uh wall in the membrane but it's also then shown in correlation to heavy antibiotic
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:18.640]  dosages when children are small in relation that seems to accentuate killing the old viral
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:25.120]  colonies that are healthy you'd healthy viruses uh sent you know meant to we have viruses in our
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.240]  gut that eat hundreds of different types of bacteria uh that's why humans routinely in the
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:33.920]  the past could eat rotten meat you know your natural viruses there that would immediately
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:41.280]  kill those bacteria uh but but but but but the but the antibiotics go in and kill the bacteria
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:47.840]  that the viruses are living in and on the viruses tend to grow in the fecal matter of the bacteria
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:51.680]  if you want to get into i've read all the studies on this it's incredible and so basically the
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:56.400]  gut has been assaulted by viruses through vaccines and antibiotics and that's the major
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:01.040]  cause of that i gotta let you go though sir because we've got a war brewing right now
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:06.480]  okay uh not brewing it started the only question is how bad will it get mark in georgia in the
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:14.160]  united states not in um malarus go ahead thank god i know it's coming here but it's not here yet
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:20.320]  oh you may remember some time ago i mentioned the reese commission for those that wish to google it
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:27.600]  r w c e and uh i found out later it was norman dodd not christopher dodd the presidential candidate
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:33.920]  uh look i found a source on that uh i i imagine you would see the current events as being consistent
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:38.960]  with the warnings of the reese commission and why they were stifled that basically the ultimate goal
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:44.800]  of this mindless bloody conflict that has come obviously being contrived by an intervention
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:52.320]  as foreign policy is that ultimately we're going to reconcile and make peace and lead as i understand
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:58.560]  it lead to a merger of the united states and russia into a world government yes the builder bar group
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:06.880]  has said this in leak documents 35 years ago trilateral commission in 1975 and do the math on
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.560]  that uh more than 30 years ago 33 years ago right and they've stated that yes they would then have
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:18.320]  the stage collapse of the soviet union and that this was even in the state department document
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:22.880]  7277 and i have the newark times and all these hundreds of mainstream articles and a binder
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:29.680]  around here somewhere 72 77 yes yes that bernadine smith uh put together with all the news articles
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:35.040]  i got to find that in storage when you say 72 77 the source of that again is state department
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:40.880]  document 7277 i'm seven i'm going from memory on that that's fine but that's the state department
[1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:47.200]  document on how they would merge nato and russia and then with the united states yes
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:53.200]  okay well here's the thing uh what i found is that alan stang has a tract called um basically
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:44:00.880]  foundations pay the way and i scanned it made it into a pdf box uh document and uploaded it onto
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:08.880]  my site at do you love jesus dot org letter u slash foundations with a capital f dot pdf
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:16.240]  and um like i say i i just tried to warn people that don't as jesus said in john 724
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:23.600]  don't stop judging by mirror appearances make a right judgment don't base your conclusions on the
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  stated goals because as sir arthur kane and oil said through sherlock holmes nothing is more
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:35.440]  misleading than a quote obvious fact yes i gotta jump i gotta jump sir k c in minnesota you're on
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:44.160]  the air go ahead hi elix i was uh one of the point out of fact that or what i believe is that
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:51.920]  this is actually a provocateur because um it supposedly started when um when georgia shot
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:59.920]  down a couple of russia's planes for um because they attacked a civilian hospital and that just
[1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:06.880]  seems insane if i mean why why would they respond in such a in such a manner when they could be easily
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:12.320]  crushed by georgia secondly there's u.s troops in georgia and in there that the mainstream media
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:19.040]  has reported that so um i i just think it would be absolutely insane for georgia to shoot down
[1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:24.480]  two of russia's planes and then then you've got michael the president well i mean georgia admits
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:30.240]  they shot the planes down right they admit they shot the planes down but but the thing is is
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:38.160]  why would why would why would rush all right so russia's gonna they're gonna shoot two of
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:43.680]  it were they're gonna shoot one of their hospitals and i just don't it doesn't make any sense and
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.840]  then you've got michael on cnn right he goes on cnn and he's talking about being a freedom loving
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:56.800]  democracy loving he even said he loved america you know and it just seems it seems pretty uh
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.920]  it seems like the u.s is is meant to get involved and intervene in this
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:07.120]  well he's certainly begging for that right now we're gonna find out in short order what's going
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.080]  to develop but think about it kind of clearance to get on to get on cnn i mean how could they just
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:16.640]  have him on immediately like immediately like that well they didn't happen immediately this
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:23.120]  started the media started reporting on this about two hours ago saying it was an armed conflict
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:28.720]  my father saw cnn he said at about seven a.m this morning reporting russians are coming in to help
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:32.480]  so a lot of deception that is very bizarre
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:40.000]  okay listen i appreciate your call we're going to go to dr paul craig roberts who was out of the
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.920]  house what we called his wife basically got him on the phone got him back to the house
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:48.400]  dr paul craig roberts former editor of the wall street journal former head of policy
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:52.800]  department of the treasury the father of reaganomics we've also got bob chatman coming up i'll have
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:56.960]  him both on together but he's in about 10 minutes as long as dr roberts can give us the reason i
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:02.640]  thought of dr roberts this morning and ray mcgovern but he couldn't come on today he's uh in a business
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:09.040]  meeting the reason i thought about roberts and and and bob chatman and of course ray mcgovern and
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:13.360]  others as they've all been saying this is the real neocon target this is about to erupt this is very
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:19.840]  serious dr paul craig roberts thank you sir hey elix what do you think of this you predicted it
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:30.880]  well i don't think we can uh do anything about it it's all our fault anyhow we you know we we've
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:40.320]  tried to turn uh georgia uh which sits there on the black sea uh you know warm water ports for
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:46.160]  russia we've tried to turn them into uh you know another american puppet state we've interfered
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:51.920]  in the elections we financed you know we buy them basically i think the guy running the country now
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:58.160]  is just another one of our paid puppets and we play like it's all about freedom and democracy and
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:07.760]  what it's really about is trying to uh cause trouble for the russians and um uh they put
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:15.680]  up with us for a good while because uh they didn't want any trouble and i think they decided they
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.120]  put up with us too long because we now you know have a puppet state on their border
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:29.360]  and there are parts of georgia that don't want to be part of an american puppet state they want to
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:34.960]  be with their separatism want to have their own countries they're not very big one part
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:41.280]  but i think where the violence or alleged violence is at the moment is just sort of in the middle
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:50.720]  of georgia on the top right next to rusher the other part uh is far more strategic it is uh
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:49:00.880]  on the western end of georgia and it borders the black sea and um these are two different
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:08.480]  separate uh parts of georgia and it's a key crossroads what about the thousands of us special
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:14.480]  forces confirmed to be there and the reports are uh that they are clearly advising georgian
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:20.320]  forces uh dr roberts it looks like we may have us troops uh in the middle of battles right now
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:27.760]  with russian uh russian armored brigades well the the bush administration is criminally insane
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:35.520]  and it wouldn't surprise me if the other morons have a situation like that uh if irresponsible
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:43.280]  in the extreme is another reason to impeach the moron um the last you know we we're not about
[1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:48.560]  to be able to hell we can't even occupy bagdad and they're going to get into a war with russians
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  the russians have got 20 000 nukes well that's why i say this is irresponsible in the extreme
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:03.760]  it's the insane neil conservatives who totally control the bush administration and who totally
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:10.240]  control the republican party they're insane people that you know they hated reagan because he wouldn't
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:16.800]  go to war with the soviet union uh reagan used to say no i don't want to win the cold war want to
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:23.440]  end it and they hated reagan and they were always up to something and they write all these aggressive
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:34.960]  papers about how we need to take over everything and um they were using money and the prefix of
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:46.080]  democracy to to buy georgia so you know it's not in georgia's interest to be at odds with russia
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:51.040]  and and be part of nature stay there sir let's talk about how you see this breaking down the russian
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:55.200]  foreign minister three months ago threatened to use nuclear weapons on the west so they continue
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:59.120]  to move in military forces and encircle them well they're right back with dr paul greg roberts

[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:30.400]  they always run into an enemy they can't beat
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:41.040]  and this is a big development dr paul craig roberts why do you think we see the images of
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:45.920]  bush and putin on stage together in beijing both looking very uncomfortable uh why do you think
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:51.040]  the russians chose this date 888 to go in because it would be a lot of international
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:57.440]  distraction in the media wouldn't want to mess up their little olympic games but the russians
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:04.240]  the russians didn't choose this day to go in the russians have peace creeping have peace keeping
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:10.800]  troops in the two breakaway regions who were made in touch they had and have had for a long time
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:18.240]  and also the u n has people there now the attack as i understand it as i say i've been out all
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.760]  morning but the attack came from georgia yes they admitted quote georgian forces were trying to
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:30.960]  push separate us out yeah and georgia attacked the two provinces in which they are russian
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:39.440]  peacekeeping troops so the the origin of the conflict uh it came from the american puppet
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:47.600]  state of georgia and i'm absolutely certain dick cheney is behind it and why why did dick cheney
[1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:54.240]  choose this time well conveniently bush is out of the country and pudin is out of the country
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.240]  you know you just saw that so clearly uh absolutely we're here reporting what they're
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:05.760]  reporting and if you really look into it they admit quietly in the background that the georgian
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:11.760]  forces were quote intensifying attacks and going after russian forces and the media spins it when
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:17.280]  russia pours in troops to support its troops that it's russia attacking yeah right the the
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:24.720]  american media just is a it just lies for the neocons and it lies for the bush administration
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:29.600]  it's totally unreliable you can't believe a word the american media says if they say anything correct
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:37.440]  it's just an accident but uh the rest of the world's media has made clear that this attack
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:44.560]  originated from the georgians and it it attacked an area in which they have been russian peacekeeping
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:53.840]  troops for a number of years and since 99 yeah also you well that's almost a decade and also you in
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:00.880]  people are are there i don't know what is the extent of the un presence well the big wild
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:04.480]  card here that i want your analysis on sir and that's what we've got you're here just a key point
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:10.800]  you just brought up hiding in plain view um that georgia really started this is us special forces
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.520]  i've got different numbers of five thousand nine thousand they've been in and out helicopters
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:21.440]  tanks missile systems russia has warned them to get them out saying the u.s was building up forces
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:27.200]  the we probably got us special forces in the fight or at least advising it right now look
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:35.440]  u.s special forces rely on heavy firepower they can't fight any better than the rest of our troops
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:41.680]  they just have all this airpower and firepower and that's how we prevail there's not enough
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:49.120]  u.s special forces to take on the russian army and uh this is a well i'm looking at these spitz
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:55.840]  gnats and i like rombo film you know this is their territory they border this country well i'm
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:59.680]  looking at the spitz gnats here and they have to say they look a lot tougher than our troops
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:06.720]  well where that where they are where they're tougher or not they border georgia they've
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:12.560]  occupied georgia for two centuries was part of the soviet union it's the homeland of joseph
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:21.280]  stalling and they're not likely to accept georgia as an american puppet state and it's just not
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:27.520]  going to happen and the the the russians are economically stronger than we are because they
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:34.240]  have massive trade surfaces energy and they've got just as many nukes and they're not going to put
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:38.800]  up with that moron in the white house or one minute we'll be back in one minute dr roberts

[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:30.560]  we are going to have clips coming up a little bit later of the
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:37.680]  georgian ambassador to the uk the russian ambassador to the us statements georgian conflict with
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:44.480]  breakaway province many dead mccain calls for russia to withdraw from georgia bottom line it is
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:52.000]  admitted but quietly just mentioned by cnn and in the ap that russian military were attacked
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:58.400]  in the early morning hours by armored columns of the georgian military backed up and advised by
[2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:06.000]  u.s special forces and advisors just an incredible provocation the media is basically smoke screening
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.960]  it mainly reporting on the russians pouring across the border out of russia proper from the
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:18.720]  north to support their forces inside it is huge it appears to be hundreds and hundreds of tanks
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:24.720]  if not more dr paul craig roberts is our guest uh what do you think is most important in all of
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:29.360]  this i see it as how does this tie into iran jerusalem post reporting two more carrier groups
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:34.320]  going into the gulf right now that the iran attack is on red mcgoverns said yesterday
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:39.040]  and ron paul has said that it's probably on for october uh the russians are threatening
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:45.760]  Czechoslovakia ukraine and others where us uh weapon systems are being built up right now
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:56.880]  dr roberts all right yes i think we agree totally that every sense our president reagan reached
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:04.800]  agreements with gorbachev uh these were good agreements and the russians banked on them and
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:12.080]  they've been betrayed by every subsequent american administration we did everything we said we wouldn't
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:20.320]  do we brought nato to the borders we're putting uh missile systems uh in former uh parts of the
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:28.800]  soviet empire uh we're we are interfering with money uh in the elections of the former
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:37.280]  soviet republics such as georgia where we've managed to install a puppet and this kind of
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:44.240]  provocation is is extreme initially the russians weren't much able to do anything about it because
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:50.880]  they were in disarray from the destruction of of communism from the few oligarchs that grabbed
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:59.760]  all their resources and the army was demoralized and but now they're back in some much better shape
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:06.000]  and they're they have a lot of economic strength in the largest trade surplus in the world they
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:11.680]  have massive energy supplies they have europe under their thumb because all of europe is dependent
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:20.320]  on the natural gas gas problem and uh the they have managed to beat the americans out of the gas
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:26.880]  pipeline in central asia and why is cheney doing this who's behind this what do they want i don't
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:36.240]  know that i i don't know that it it may just be uh years of frustrations of not being able to use
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:42.640]  power and now they got it and they don't how much longer have it maybe just a few months
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:50.080]  and maybe that's it they just want to use this power they people get carried away they they get
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:55.920]  overwhelmed with hubris and they think they're you know they're invincible and they read all these
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:02.560]  papers that they write themselves about the superpower of the invincible army and they
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:07.040]  they get carried away i mean why in the world is that the march off into russia or napolitan march
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:11.680]  off of it why did you predict this why did you predict you've been saying this every time you're

[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:15.040]  we found bbc reports and others listing us military forces backing the georgian government
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:22.000]  now here is a wahhabist news report out of saudi arabia this is the type of stuff they're
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:27.600]  reporting out of caucuses news caucus news russian military ready to invade georgia us
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:32.800]  since thousands of marines in response than it footnotes that marines are there by the thousands
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:37.120]  not just army special forces and i've double checked this and pulled up another uh report
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:42.160]  and they've got photos and video of it this is unbelievable so we have no idea how many
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:47.840]  us troops are there the bbc says it's undisclosed uh that really is a 64 million dollar question
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:52.160]  dr roberts will be with us till the end of this segment i do want to try to sit dr roberts up for
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:57.840]  my sunday show after this is fleshed out so i'll talk to you during the break coming up in about
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:02.160]  12 minutes sir i want to bring in bob Chapman who was in army intelligence and worked with
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:06.000]  some other agencies we can't get into he's had one of the largest newsletters out there
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:11.200]  um for decades and of course he'll put out gary allen's book uh and was partners with him none
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:15.040]  their call conspiracies he's been fighting the globals for a long time he has really been predicting
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:19.520]  this every week with us we're going to go back to dr roberts here in just a moment for any other
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:24.960]  key info he wants to cover but briefly bob because i want uh paul craig roberts uh to be able to
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:30.000]  comment on what you have to say bringing in uh some of the research you've been doing give us
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:38.400]  your take on uh this situation okay who's behind it uh zabina broshinski uh read is the recent
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:44.640]  stuff he talks about it and uh and they want to have brushfire wars uh they want to get
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:50.480]  rusher into this thing to pay to keep people's minds off the off the economic and financial
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:55.520]  carnage that's going on none on the united states but throughout the world um you saw what they
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:10:01.200]  did in cost of vote uh that's another war waiting waiting to happen uh the russian said today they're
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:08.880]  going to use use missiles all along the frontier with europe uh if poland uh seeds to uh include
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:13.200]  missiles in their country um and incidentally that congress has already rejected it once
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:22.000]  same thing on jackoslovakia yes check republic and uh over over in uh the training uh in georgia
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:27.920]  has been going on for a long time we talked about it before in the show uh there's a thousand uh
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:33.920]  private contractor uh israeli trainers in there they've been in there for a long time i did see that
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:44.400]  yeah that came up this morning um on the debka uh 426 p.m. g gmt at uh two o'clock
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:54.320]  and um and at issue uh here really is the re-roading of the pipeline uh caspian oil and gas
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:11:02.000]  to reach the uh turkish terminal part of seyhan incidentally i wrote about this
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:10.240]  in 1982 i saw them setting this thing up and uh rather than using the the russian network
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:16.640]  that's available and uh they want to put this the pipeline in between why did rick cheney
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:24.080]  as dr roberts just said trigger uh doing this on 888 and having uh georgian mainline army
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:29.280]  backed up by u.s special forces attack russian forces why did they decide to do this today
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:37.760]  uh i that i don't know i i i just can't answer you know timing can't be that fine i mean
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:41.760]  we know something's gonna happen we know how it's gonna okay let's bring dr roberts in
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:45.280]  because we're gonna have we're gonna have bob with us for the rest of the show i'll go ahead
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:50.720]  dr roberts you've got the floor well the reason they they did it today is they've got bush out
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:56.960]  of the country and prudent out of the country so i'm thinking this is pretty much tells you that
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:03.920]  uh this is not a bush operation or prudent operations a cheney operation i i agree with
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:10.800]  everything that's been said except uh the reference to rejinsky he's not a neocon he despises them
[2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:17.520]  and he he would be warning against this type of thing and and has warned against taking
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:25.920]  NATO to their frontiers and and so on this is a neocon operation they may be it probably
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:33.200]  also has something to do with trying to control the oil pipelines which i think they've already
[2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:39.360]  lost that battle what do you think of the news that israelis are there i don't know is don't know
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:50.240]  why what they would be able to uh contribute they can't even beat uh a small militia hezbollah
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:58.000]  and i don't know why american marines would be there because they haven't got enough numbers
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:06.400]  to stand against uh any actual attempt by russian army bob it looks to me like insanity
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:13.840]  uh alec you know everything this everything this regime is done is insane none of it makes any
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:20.960]  logical sense you're saying megalomaniac is what we're dealing with i think cheney's insane yeah
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:26.640]  uh bomb uh and i want dr roberts to comment on this but during the break you were saying
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:32.800]  you think this is quote a good thing uh i mean how is this a good thing you think the neocons
[2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:40.720]  have finally gone too far yes i i do and uh they met the russian forces that have but they've
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:46.160]  been just waiting for this because they don't want it but they're certainly prepared and it's
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:54.080]  a battle they can't win the united states and and their allies so to speak and uh and uh
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:14:01.120]  said that what they're doing is another in essence a piecemeal operation that can't be
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:09.040]  successful and he's absolutely right and but again the the the cy war and this is keep the
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:15.760]  people's mind off what is going on in the united states economically and financially i agree let's
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:19.840]  go back to dr roberts and we'll get your full takeout for the break dr roberts how does this
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:25.120]  play into i brand is this does this make the escalation there more sure or does it lessen that
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:32.640]  i mean how do you see that developing oh well um alec it depends on how far this goes and if
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:40.640]  american troops come into conflict and pitch battles with russian troops uh it's probably
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:44.800]  going to put their end thing on ice i don't i don't think they would be able to do that
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:52.000]  um and i don't understand why they would risk an arm combat uh encounter with the soviets
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:15:00.000]  on soviet territory i mean this is their border uh all the supply uh
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:06.640]  um lines and everything you need to have that kind of a conflict i mean russia is not a militia
[2:15:06.640 --> 2:15:15.040]  it's that's an army and they've got jets and missiles and tanks too and and armor piercing
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.480]  weapons so all the kinds of of advantages that we have when we go up against third world countries
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:25.840]  like iraq they start there yeah this isn't the poor starving basically unarmed muslims who've
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:30.400]  got courage but aren't trained in fighting i mean because i'm i mean i'm looking at our
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:36.720]  broken down torn up overused military the basic ranks filled with farm boys and poor inner city
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:40.560]  people who most of them didn't get proper nutrition when they were kids and frankly look like
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:46.080]  their pushovers compared to these russians these guys look completely vicious well i i think that
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:54.160]  this is something this is either over being overplayed in the news or chain is insane and he's
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:16:01.600]  he's trying to pull some big conflict off before bush or putin can get back home and stop it could
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:08.720]  this be the october surprise a lightning conflict brush fires all over uh former uh soviet satellites
[2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:14.960]  i mean could this be the october surprise a a kind of curveball now we can't know we don't have the
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:23.120]  resources to have uh brush fires all over the soviet or russian borders we and we have very
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:30.000]  limited resources that we learned in iraq and in afghanistan and uh and and so you know even
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:36.560]  there plans to attack around don't involve troops so i don't i don't understand uh what they're
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:42.720]  thinking this may be being overplayed in the news why are you saying that we're seeing
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:49.360]  hundreds and hundreds of tanks uh huge artillery barrages uh to the president of georgia begging
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:55.120]  for help on tv pathetically uh you know playing it up your why are you i mean i respect your opinion
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:00.320]  why are you saying it could be overplayed well the the georgian president is an american puppet
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:07.840]  and so there's it's some play going could be just a play going on uh if russia wants to
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:11.680]  invade georgia they will do it i mean there's nothing we could do about it well they've definitely
[2:17:11.680 --> 2:17:17.360]  invaded that area well i don't know if they've invaded they i think what they did they may have
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:27.120]  sent in forces into the uh small breakaway uh area where they already had peacekeepers and
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:33.280]  whether you in had just like that in pristina uh at the end of the last coast of a takeover
[2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:41.600]  well i don't think they've sent their troops into uh the non breakaway parts of georgia if they do
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:47.760]  that then they will have made a decision that they're they're going to just get rid of the georgian
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:53.120]  government which is an american puppet if they make that decision uh we're not going to be able
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:58.720]  to even about it we can't we don't have any troops to send there to fight the russian army so that's
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:05.040]  the big question is it localized only to these two small breakaway areas or are they going to go
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:14.160]  to the capital i don't think they'll go to the capital unless uh the georgians and the americans
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:20.800]  start a war if we do start a war the russians probably will prevail given that it's their
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:29.120]  backyard nine hours and uh we're certainly not going to be able to uh send any occupying army
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.640]  there we haven't got one well we're going to find out in the next days the next hours and days that
[2:18:34.640 --> 2:18:40.640]  uh follow so i guess are you saying that's the key then in your opinion is how wide this is going
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:48.800]  to really be that's right how wide is this how wide is this going to be uh what can what can
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:55.440]  change and get away with uh he's in charge bush is out of the country uh the neocons are insane
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:03.280]  i've never i don't know about saying and uh so it may be they're trying to initiate some kind of
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:09.040]  nuclear thing oh my god you know you know the the idiot neocons like that billy crystal they
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:14.400]  write things like what's the good of having nuclear weapons if you can't use them they all think that
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:22.880]  way uh back in the reagan years uh sort of the problem we had with them they wanted to
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:28.720]  nuke rut for the Soviet Union they're crazy they're insane people and i don't understand
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:35.920]  why anybody would let anybody that crazy get into the government at any level they may be creating
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:40.400]  a crisis to try to stay in power this this could really turn into something bad quickly
[2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:43.360]  dr roberts let me say bye to you during the break we'll come back with bob Chapman on the other
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:48.160]  side of your phone calls but i want to see if you can look at your book and tell us if you can come

[2:20:13.440 --> 2:20:21.600]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story widman eba director on the

[2:24:25.360 --> 2:24:29.520]  they're watching on the news what they're seeing little tidbits of information that we may miss
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:38.640]  or not bring up 1800 259 9231 bob Chapman what's amazing here is you read deeply into the news
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:45.360]  and and scan the press releases you will see that georgian forces came in and clashed with russians
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:49.840]  in the early morning hours then russians that were massed from the border seeing this build up
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:58.800]  spilled in this morning about six hours ago and the media is spinning it like russia did it without
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:05.040]  saying that mccain calls on russia withdraw from georgia republican u.s presidential candidate
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:09.120]  john mccain today urged russia to immediately withdraw from georgia and said the united states
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:13.040]  should call for an emergency united nations session russia should immediately and unconditionally
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:17.680]  cease its military operations withdraw all forces from the sobbing territory of georgia
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:22.800]  see they're making it a big split the russians have always been there mccain told reporters in
[2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:26.480]  iowa the u.s should immediately convene an emergency session of the un security council
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:33.600]  to call russia to reverse course i mean this is escalating i i i hope it settles down but
[2:25:33.600 --> 2:25:38.240]  you're watching the same images i'm seeing i mean the media at first when they first
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:42.480]  started finally reporting on this three hours ago was like oh russia sent in a few people
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:46.720]  to just bolster its peacekeeping it's having some trouble with you know rebels fighting with each
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:51.680]  other on both sides pro russian pro georgian and then now it comes out no georgian forces came in
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:58.320]  what well what would be yesterday now and hit russian forces and uh this is just incredible
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:05.920]  bob german well first of all the russians have already long previous to the united states
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:12.880]  uh ask the u.n. security council for an emergency meeting so the russians were the ones who asked
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:22.720]  first yes the georgians attacked russian peacekeeping troops in mass and the russians did bring in
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:30.320]  and back up troops and in order to protect their peacekeeping troops this is an incredible
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:36.560]  provocation well you know we talked about it before and we knew it was coming
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:42.400]  if you listen to this at least to this program and a handful of others the american public
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:51.840]  certainly didn't know and um russia is legitimately there and the petitioning has been going on for
[2:26:51.840 --> 2:27:02.960]  over 10 years and it's been accepted by the u.n. so georgia has created an act of war and um
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:11.280]  how far they intend to go with it remains to be seen it's a battle they cannot win georgia i mean
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:16.640]  why did they do it then we know us forces totally run it the third largest contingent of troops
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:24.400]  after u.s. british is georgian in iraq this is a little little military enclave of the globalist
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:28.800]  i mean they did they did this on purpose which they admit they did this is incredible
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:36.240]  yeah and they just want another conflict and as i said earlier to divert people's thinking
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:41.200]  because they can't do a ran uh the divert people's thinking about the economic and
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:48.400]  financial chaos that's going on and if you look at what preceded this uh you know one week one
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:56.640]  day this week we're up 325 points the next day we're down to treat 225 today we're up 225 the
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:02.000]  market is is getting bombed the u.s. government and is here in there holding the market up
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:08.400]  and they knew this was coming and that's why they're in in the market in mass uh uh two weeks
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:14.880]  ago they attacked the commodity market uh the precious metals market and they started to take
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:25.520]  the u.s. dollar and the usdx index from 72 up to over 75 all of this is market rigging by the
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:35.440]  united states government in anticipation of this latest uh entry uh into uh limited or perhaps
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:41.760]  major warfare i think it's going to turn into major warfare and uh the pipelines at stake
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:49.440]  israel wants that oil coming to a lot and uh in turkey wants to transversing its property
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:56.240]  and the russians don't want that to happen and uh as uh mr robert said
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:08.320]  uh the regime and in georgia is a puppet regime and uh what'll probably happen here
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:17.040]  is if the georgian troops don't withdraw then war will begin in earnest and georgia will be taken
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:24.480]  over by the russians and as mr robert says the america doesn't have the will with all the sent
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:29.600]  troops in in in any great number then what are the neocons thinking marines that have been said
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:34.640]  and that's entirely unfair well stay there i want to get your take your analysis on why
[2:29:35.760 --> 2:29:40.560]  if the cards are stacked against the neocons why they keep doing this i mean like you said the
[2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:45.280]  israelis couldn't even beat hezbollah we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen the world is heating
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:53.040]  up and i think this is only the beginning unfortunately stay with us we're on the march

[2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:56.640]  i'm on cnn i'm on abc news i'm on fox it's just hardly even a headline it's oh george
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:34:01.280]  says country is under attack by russia see that's a deceptive way to lie because they're not actually
[2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:09.760]  lying but the letter of the law george says you know they say they're under attack by russia
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:14.080]  meanwhile it was george that attacked russian forces that's buried in all the stories
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:20.160]  the mccain comes out says how dare you russia pull out it's terrible what you did so they
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:23.920]  start a fight with him and then say look russia you attacked you have to leave
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:29.760]  and the simple mind of american people will probably say yeah i don't like russia being in
[2:34:29.760 --> 2:34:38.000]  georgia inside the us how dare russia invade the south that's worse than what
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:45.760]  lincoln did then we already have one civil war my god the russians have attacked georgia
[2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:49.200]  literally folks you're gonna see that you're gonna hear that i'm not joking
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:55.760]  right that's how dumb the public is they'll probably think that it's georgia russians attack
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:03.360]  georgia i'm not even joking you think i'm joking i'm serious and uh i just hope this de-escalates
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:08.000]  and last time what happened is the russians poured into pristina
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:18.240]  at the end of the attack of the us finance with the communist muslims what a weird combination
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:28.880]  uh out of uh albania into kosovo and then they have when the russians came in and
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:33.520]  with the big armored columns and had mixed had serious standoffs with the us troops
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:43.840]  then weasley clark gave the order to sir peter jackson uh the head of the nato forces to bomb
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:49.440]  the tarmac to bomb the pristina airport where the russians were landing with their big cargo jets
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:59.520]  and and and discorging tanks and special forces and jackson said no so the us did give the order
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:06.640]  to attack russians once before and that's been going back into ancient times and that was part
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:13.120]  of russia sirbio was and then they held back of course the during the crusades uh one of the
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:21.200]  invasions by the muslims so it's it's a big big part of their history there and then the russians
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:27.040]  were in a stalemate they didn't you know shoot they didn't fire the british refused to attack
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:34.400]  under orders by weasley clark who's supposedly a liberal i mean it's both parties who was the
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  general in charge on the ground but again the higher ups jackson said no out of england nato
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:47.920]  had at the time and then a deal was made the russians okay we promise we'll never break away
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:56.080]  kosova we just want to tell money for both sides let un peacekeepers come in and nato peacekeepers
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:04.080]  i4 let them come in and fully encircle you from macedonia into northern albania into kosova and
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:09.760]  up to the central areas of sirbio proper and then of course they lied and cheated and years later
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:15.680]  had it break away and handed over and then ethnically clenched uh the serbs the serb minority
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:23.600]  that's a large minority it was like 37 percent you go look it up and it just keeps happening as
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:28.400]  a domino and russia sees them moving and all these weapons around them and then they have the
[2:37:29.920 --> 2:37:37.760]  georgians that's on the black sea folks that's not in the us um that's for neocons and liberals
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.200]  out there that have been drinking fluoride had a lot of vaccines and their brain damage i'm serious
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:46.480]  that's that that's that's that's over eastern europe bordering central asia
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:54.480]  and they attacked them they attacked them yesterday last night and uh you notice the
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:59.440]  media is real careful not to say russia attacked they say oh the georgia says in every headline
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:05.120]  it's the same georgian president says they're under attack georgian president says russia attacking
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:11.040]  you know they won't come out and say because the fact is us back georgia with marines and army and
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:15.440]  others attacked them again any other key points you want to make bob chairman or go calls
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:23.440]  i just think the geopolitical aspects and that's the balkanization of those states surrounding
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:29.840]  russia anything to cause disruption it's been going on as uh mr robert's pointed out earlier
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:37.920]  uh for a long time and not only in georgia uh with the rigged elections but also uh in the
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:45.120]  ukraine and uh and other countries in that region and uh you know the administration for the past
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:53.040]  eight years has been fast at uh trying to create problems and particularly political problems
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:39:00.080]  and now they're really too ready to go at it and it's going to be as a series of brush wire fire
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:07.360]  wars and this will be one of them uh kosovo will ignite soon and they'll have russia fighting on
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:13.760]  two fronts uh the missiles will be pointed at installations from russia into europe as well as
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:19.040]  major european cities yeah let's stop there what does it mean to you when the russian foreign
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:23.680]  ministry and the head foreign minister repeatedly in the last six months over and over again the
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:28.800]  latest was in july say we'll use military action you keep moving weapons and troops and training
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:36.160]  on our borders we may use military option including nuclear that's a quote and that's true and uh the
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:44.640]  missiles that they intend to put in uh along the border uh in regard to the polish missile situation
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:54.160]  uh are non-nuclear so at least at this point but uh the whole thing is escalating and it's part of a
[2:39:54.160 --> 2:40:01.200]  plan to keep the world in turmoil because we're headed into trouble and as they pointed out earlier
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:07.200]  in the markets themselves this was all prearranged because you know they were trying to drive the
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:14.160]  stock markets out the the bond market up uh commodities and precious metals down drive
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:21.040]  the dollar up because in anticipation of this this is not going to get better in south asencia
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:27.520]  it's going to get worse and our our troops are in there and they're going to be in a
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:34.400]  mangle machine they shouldn't be there and that i wouldn't want the duty i'll tell you that i i'm
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:40.560]  very very disappointed that us troops are in there now the israelis are contractors they're
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:46.560]  ex-military people and uh you know when you're in a mercenary you you take your money and take
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:54.240]  your chances but um a very disappointed america marines have been sent in there uh because we're
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:40:58.560]  not getting the tales about the maneuvers it's just that two of the major cities are under
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:06.480]  bombardment uh that there's forces clashing uh and the georgian president's acting like he's been
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:15.280]  attacked when he started it and uh i mean i'm getting your georgians are no match for the russians
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:20.960]  they'll have them for breakfast whether they get israeli or american advisors are not
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:26.960]  is irrelevant the russians are far better trained and then you we were talking about
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:33.040]  kosovo tracy who's the president of kosovo which was stolen a state that was that's been with
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:40.800]  Serbia for thousands of years has been stolen this guy is one of the worst criminals in the
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:48.880]  region he's a known narcotics trafficker well that's where all the opium from uh afghanistan
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:54.880]  which is being cultivated by the cia and mi6 is being sent there for distribution to europe and
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:58.800]  the united states and by the way and that's really what that's all about it even comes out in the
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:03.440]  news it'll show our forces and i've talked to troops coming back they guard the poppies that's
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:07.360]  what our troops are there for us to guard the heroine for your kids and it's right out in the
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.920]  open they don't even hide it anymore they openly send down special forces to take control of the
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:17.360]  cocaine in columbia i mean it's just right out in the open meanwhile swat teams will swat team you
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:22.720]  all day long they'll mail marijuana to a mayor's house they want to get thank god the mayor didn't
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:29.680]  open the box they go and kill both his dogs as the dogs run away and it's just a joke yeah we're
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:36.720]  in for real trouble everywhere and so uh keep your powder dry and uh keep everything while
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:41.120]  oiled bob what do you think is going to mean if you had to deadwreck and estimate how this is
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:45.040]  going to unfold what do you think is going to happen well i think it's going to get worse
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:50.320]  i think the russians are going to be forced to move and they're going to go move into georgia
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:56.560]  it's as simple as that and i don't i don't think they'll stop i mean they've been attacked
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:02.320]  uh they'll they'll probably hold back to see if the georgian forces will pull back i don't think
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:08.880]  they will and uh if they they move forward they'll be decimated they will be decimated
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:15.520]  russian air power alone will will just take out the entire entourage i mean their bases are just
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:23.520]  hundreds of miles away the whole thing like dr robert said is insanity these people are nuts
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:32.720]  well it's just like the crazy police now tasering people to death beating women up on video not
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:39.440]  getting in trouble just all of this it's it's it's we have become insane as a nation and all these
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:47.760]  petty bullies are just on psychopathic power trips well uh if they continue to do what they're
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:55.040]  doing uh they're going to have problems well why would the russian foreign minister threaten to
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  use nuclear weapons against us i mean that's unprecedented and the media just doesn't even
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.320]  hardly report on it well look at right russian counterintelligence is every bit as good as the
[2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:10.080]  u.s and european and they know things that they're not going to tell us that they know and they know
[2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:15.760]  exactly what the united states great britain and europe are up to they know all about the
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:20.320]  illuminati they know who runs europe i mean who do you think they just kicked out of there
[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.200]  all of those oligarchs who were all financed from europe well they were all rothschild front
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:30.880]  that came out that's right exactly and so it's the same group doing the same thing
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:37.840]  they want to control russia and russia is in a position to cause them grievous harm not only
[2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:46.080]  physically they now have six hundred billion dollars in gold and foreign exchange and all
[2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:52.080]  they have to do is start selling dollars and the whole bottom will come out of the u.s market
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:45:02.160]  and maybe maybe that's what the neocons the illuminati want we're going to find out
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:08.800]  is very very bullish for gold and silver i'll tell you that well putin's top economic advisor
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:14.240]  dr tanya karajna repeatedly has gone on russian television and said the illuminati runs the u.s
[2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:19.120]  uh she calls it the death's head group which it translates means skull and bones
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:25.760]  uh and imagine that imagine a top advisor to one of our president saying uh there's a satanic
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:30.240]  group runs europe in the u.s and they're going to stage world war three she said that seven years
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:36.080]  ago and she knows six and a half and she said they stage nine eleven two i forgot she's absolutely
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:41.440]  correct and we're on the right track and we're putting the truth out there on these programs
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:48.480]  and we are injuring them grievously because your program and programs like you are picking up more
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:53.520]  and more listeners every day because people want the truth and they're not getting it in the news
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:59.920]  it's as simple as that and we know that and they know that and so we're making some great headway
[2:45:59.920 --> 2:46:10.800]  here well i hope the psychopathic satis that run our society uh they're not going to stop
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:14.640]  it's just all got to fall apart everybody's got to be bankrupt and live it in the streets
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:19.040]  before all the smart mouth cops and all the punk government people and all the yuppies and
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:23.120]  all the know-it-alls you know they've just got to have it fall completely apart before they grow
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  up i think yeah and half of them won't be around to see it because that's the way these kind of
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:33.360]  things end up you talk about population control well you've got it coming
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:39.200]  well things are certainly escalating do you think they're going to hit iran
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:46.240]  um not a not a chance nope i do not and uh if you listen to the european alumnus
[2:46:46.960 --> 2:46:53.760]  uh which is uh headed up by bryzinski uh at least in the front of the rank
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:47:00.080]  uh and that these are you know i i disagree with mr robertz on this these are his ideas
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:04.720]  well let's be clearly reading this guy for years you know i started subscribing to foreign affairs
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:11.520]  in 1960 cfr and which is the organ of the of the council in foreign relations and these people
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:15.360]  are brash they can write out and tell you what they're going to do no i don't know if he in fairness
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:20.800]  to you and robertz he's talking about bryzinski's public statements but you're right in policy reports
[2:47:20.800 --> 2:47:25.600]  he's been calling since the mid 70s for this encirclement for the brush fires he's been saying
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:31.520]  don't attack iran he said this a few months ago rushes the enemy and so you're right robertz is
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:39.360]  going off his public statements well and that's where psycho political warfare comes in and uh
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:45.600]  he gotta be trained to look for these things and i was and you know but not that i'm going to be
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:52.080]  right all the time unfortunately i'm right too often and uh this is where this is headed
[2:47:52.800 --> 2:47:58.880]  and you know it's just not good and everything that you've said here on the program and the
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:05.440]  doctor and myself uh is from right on i mean it is the way it is i don't think the listeners even
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:15.520]  understand how big this is to have the georgian military backed by the us attack russian forces
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:22.160]  this is huge this is this is unprecedented and it's some type of a test balloon i mean obviously
[2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:28.320]  this is a probe by cheney and the new order neocons the angle american arm uh to test and
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:34.160]  see what russia will do and then russia knows that if they do pull back out that any deals
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:41.280]  reached with the us will be broken so i don't think this yeah yeah and this is like you know
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:48.800]  akin to ireland attacking great britain uh the uh england it's very similar
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:58.640]  are now you meet you might even you know compare this to hit was marching to sedate land
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:05.520]  which was a german enclave or danza because of akia no well
[2:49:08.640 --> 2:49:13.360]  for those who know history this is horrifying i don't think most of the thumb suckers out there
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:18.800]  the establishment people who listen to show and laugh at it you know it's just we've been too far
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:24.080]  long removed from pain and suffering and hardship or the real world and i just see these giggling
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:29.440]  smirking laughing people that laugh everything we talk about and it's not funny and i i really
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:34.960]  feel sorry for him bob yeah because a lot of them aren't going to be with us five years from now
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:40.720]  and they'll say well why did this happen and then the any answer is you you refuse to listen
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:48.000]  and you won't think you don't care anything about anything except what's going to make you happy
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:59.120]  and you you you don't have any responsibility everything is a situation ethics you do what
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:05.600]  you feel like doing will make you feel good and that's not how you're supposed to to deport your
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:15.040]  life a good example is up until perhaps twenty years ago everybody saved for the last ten years
[2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:21.280]  we we have a deficit in saving but yet people are spending more than they have and and what
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:26.960]  does that mean it means that people are borrowing money to continue this extravagant lifestyle
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:31.120]  that they have it's not only in america it's in a number of other countries and if you tell them
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:35.120]  it's going to destroy our country they laugh at you and call you a conspiracy theorist really
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:40.160]  i guess i'm i mean this is about denial they want to believe the pipe dreams don't they bob
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:47.280]  that's right scott erin mike uh... mick jim mark we're gonna get to all of you wide open phones

[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:56.000]  issue but predominantly what's happening in georgia something you may not think it's a big deal
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:03.120]  believe me it is a big deal us back forces attack rusher alabama state code makes it

[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:54.880]  them a cancer belt death camps prepared all mainstream news bob chatman's our guest
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:55:01.520]  scott narrow zone you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead yeah i definitely believe uh
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:06.480]  that this is going to escalate into a big confrontation and possibly world war three
[2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:13.120]  i do have a question for bob chatman um how soon do you think this is going to drop our oil
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:16.800]  i mean raise our oil prices because i know they've been dropping recently do you think it's
[2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:20.480]  going to go the other way and do you think the feds are going to stop if it escalates into a
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:24.400]  bigger thing and we get involved do you think of the feds are going to stop dumping money into
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:29.120]  the economy to try to save at that point well i would say the opposite which which further destroys
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:33.840]  us down the road gets us in more debt to the bankers but makes it be a more smooth slide
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:37.200]  into slavery as the financial times of london said they wanted two years ago
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:42.720]  and i would have expected oil and gold to explode today instead they actually dropped a little
[2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:48.080]  which uh he's covered they admit they're going in and trying to suppress those markets bob chatman
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:55.840]  well you pretty well covered it and um uh that's why oil and precious metals have been down
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:01.680]  in anticipation of this event uh this has been planned for a long time and they wanted to make
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:07.040]  sure everything was going their way uh it'll be detrimental to the dollar so the gains the dollar
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:13.200]  was up a penny and a half today on the usdx index and at one time i don't know what it's up now but
[2:56:13.760 --> 2:56:17.920]  i would assume it would be negatively affecting the dollar the dollar as well what about interest
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:26.800]  rates uh interest rates uh will remain unchanged officially you saw it in england and the european
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:31.760]  central bank did yesterday but real interest rates are going up real interest rates are going up
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:37.840]  uh they've become a wavering in here now you look at the us 10-year treasury note it's been trading
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:49.440]  from about 390 uh to uh 416 and um uh i would think that uh it might go the yield might go down
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:56.560]  here because there might be a uh a small of like the quality and if you notice they had the stock
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:01.360]  market up over a couple of hundred points this morning all in anticipation of this did they
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:08.160]  launch this attack on russia on the launch of the olympic games the smokescreen i think it was
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:13.600]  an effort to keep it out of the news uh they'll bring it back into the news when they need it
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:20.000]  and uh and they'll say well we can't do this we can't do that uh the economy stalled because we
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:26.160]  got this war going on and we have to work toward the war effort now and it's the same crap that i
[2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:34.080]  saw in the 1940s when i was a kid you know roosevelt set up and and allow the japanese to bomb pearl
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:39.120]  harvest so we could get into the war and here i'm watching all my neighbors come home and boxes for
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:45.920]  what well the same thing with the thousand marines who are in a in a in a a ringer over there now
[2:57:45.920 --> 2:57:52.160]  and it shouldn't be there and they shouldn't be in harm's way uh you know our troops have
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:58.480]  to defend our country not go off into foreign wars we don't have alexander the great washington today

[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:25.840]  strong u.s. ally in the region the democratic republic of georgia the violence could significantly
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:32.240]  destabilize russia's ties with the west and even influence the actions of u.s. troops in iraq
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:36.960]  u.s. today's london correspondent jeffrey stinson answered some questions about the conflict
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:42.960]  what are georgia and russia fighting over georgia launched you hear that georgia launched about
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:48.480]  even people are in the message board saying we made that up with dr roberts last hour you people
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:54.320]  just never seems to amaze me little neocon cowards georgia launched a military strike let me say
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:00.320]  that again georgia launched georgia launched georgia launched georgia launched a military strike on
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:07.120]  the province of south ose asia i've been pronouncing that correctly aimed to reclaim it after 16 years
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:11.920]  of semi independence okay now that was an international agreement set up agreed to by the parties by
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:16.720]  the u.n. they engage in an active war as bob chatman said but what does he know he was encounter
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:22.960]  intelligence against the russians in response russia sent tanks into moscow says georgian forces
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:27.200]  had killed russian peacekeepers there and were committing acts of ethnic cleansing of native
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:32.880]  russians living there why does moscow care what georgia does in its own provinces its own provinces
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:36.880]  see that spin georgia which borders russia as a former soviet republic it declared its independence
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:42.800]  in 91 after the collapse of communism more than 70 000 people in south areas speak russian and carry
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:48.800]  russian passports relations between the two have been tense and moscow tries to reassert influence
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:53.600]  over nations that border it georgia has aligned itself with the west and wants to join nato a
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:58.400]  desire bush administration supports and has of course a bunch of us forces marines and army
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:03.280]  they're backing it up right now bob is there any doubt right now that us forces are in are fighting
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:10.480]  the russians no doubt whatsoever and and there's no doubt whatsoever that this whole episode
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:18.480]  is the work of the united states great britain and western europe and they are the they the ones
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:25.360]  at fault they are trying to start a war has nothing to do with the freedom of the federal
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:33.440]  federal republic of of georgia that's laughable because the the election was rigged there and
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:41.200]  that's how that president got into power and of course the what's really important to them
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:47.120]  is to put the pipeline through there that's why the israelis have over a thousand mercenaries
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:55.200]  they are training people it's just incredible bob to be seeing this unfold let's talk to erin and

[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:20.400]  well that's all admitted what we need to do is break down the fact that russian
[3:08:20.400 --> 3:08:32.640]  has been attacked by us backed georgia or us georgia backed by us attacks and kills russian
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:45.680]  forces i mean that is unprecedented in a 10 year agreement with russian forces in that area for
[3:08:45.680 --> 3:08:52.400]  peacekeeping in an ethnic russian area when this is part of russia has been part of russia in the
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:59.600]  past just unbelievable look the military industrial complex owns and runs our society and they just
[3:08:59.600 --> 3:09:05.440]  want more wars and before all the good old boys weigh in on this and think it's a great thing
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:13.200]  it is bad for our future bad for our economy bad for everything just amazing let's go back
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:19.920]  to your calls let's talk to mick and pa mick you're on the year thank you so much for taking
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:26.320]  my call alex and uh it might sound a little bit out there but 40 50 years of obsessive compulsive
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:34.560]  disorder concerning what what is truth what's going on in this war i believe we are they are
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:40.560]  setting in the fourth suit the powers that they are setting up this war to start world war four
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:48.960]  war so we do go in and we lose world war four and the usa is handed over to uh
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:53.680]  communist china and the powers in the world well they've said that china and russia will be the
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:58.160]  center of it and that the globalists have engineered all this to to bankrupt the us so
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:03.440]  they can buy it up destroy our names so we won't be the superpower that is exactly what's going on
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:10.000]  here uh let's get bob Chapman's take on that i can't add much to that boy that's a perfect alex
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.920]  you're absolutely right and this program's been going on for a long time i i think they
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:22.560]  decided in the late 50s early 60s when you saw the first g a at and free trade and globalization
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:27.920]  get underway and then we jumped off the gold standard in august the 15th of 71 and you put
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:33.120]  the two of them together and it's been downhill ever since and that was deliberately taking us downhill
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:41.840]  absolutely i think may shake some people to their senses hopefully maybe our military
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:48.080]  will save us but if you look the only thing forced done in the way of these forces of evil in the
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:54.400]  world was christianity and what used to be the usa and people who study that said they didn't
[3:10:54.400 --> 3:11:02.480]  simply take over russia and china and swatter off 40 to 60 million innocent little peasants
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:08.240]  they swatted off 40 to 60 million christians and i think that's what's in line for the usa
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:14.960]  they'll get the usa they'll get the christians they'll get the utopola usa at once and the world
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:19.760]  enters thousand years of dark ages and i don't know do you think there's any prayer or military
[3:11:20.640 --> 3:11:25.520]  may step in and realize what's going on hey i appreciate your call i think you've already
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:31.760]  seen admiral fowlin and others say no to attacking iran uh and so that might be why that may not happen
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:36.880]  but most experts we have one say it is going to happen ron paul uh of course dr roberts
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:42.720]  rama govern think it's on currently now bob says he doesn't think it's on i hope bob's right
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:48.560]  bob that's one of the few areas that uh you differ with on our other gallery of experts
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:56.080]  well i think it's because uh i watch the enemy you know if you're going to understand the
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:02.400]  criminal mind you have to be able to think like them and there are very few normal people who can
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:09.760]  think like criminals because it's alien to them and i think i have that ability uh they are criminals
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:15.680]  and i listen to everything that they say because they always tell you what they want to do because
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:23.200]  if they have this egotistical bravado about them that you know part of them being what they are
[3:12:23.200 --> 3:12:27.760]  they have to let you know how superior they are and when when they're in that process
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:31.360]  they also let you know that something's going on at some time
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:39.360]  to spit specifically what's going on and so uh my take very often is different than others and
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:46.800]  again unfortunately i usually am right and that's not good for the world all right thank you for
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:53.440]  the call uh let's go ahead and talk to jim in texas jim you're on the air hey alex enjoyed
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:59.200]  listening to your show for all the years i was listening to an interview on uh i guess right
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:03.680]  wing meal count radio the other day with Nancy Pelosi i don't know but let's not associate it
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:09.520]  with right wing pro second amendment and pro america this is the fake right wing okay you're
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:15.520]  making me laugh like that guy going down in that movie that i saw when i was a kid called dr strange
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:21.680]  love you know there's nothing that guy can do about it but uh i just think that you know they could
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:29.680]  get somebody in in the congress you know more people like kucinich and ron paul it would put
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:36.400]  a lot more light on what's going on you know i've been listening and i just i've turned a lot of
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.760]  my friends on to what's going on and we're all sitting around here at a break at work right now
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:46.080]  listening to your show and they're just like their mouths are open they can't believe what
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:50.960]  they're hearing well let's be clear here it isn't like we just jumped on this today and said see
[3:13:50.960 --> 3:13:57.280]  we told you so who would have thought you'd have us backed georgian forces with marines and army
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:02.960]  attacking sneak attacking russian peacekeepers who were there lawfully killing them and then
[3:14:02.960 --> 3:14:08.400]  john mccain saying the russians are bad i need to pull out and allow this takeover to happen we
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:13.920]  didn't just say this today or last week or last month but years ago we said that would be part
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:20.000]  of the cards we're right we know what we're talking about is the point bob jetman well i agree with
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:27.120]  you and uh and i just wish we could breach more people and i wish there were more people like
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:33.600]  alex on the radio like a thousand more every day so that the public would finally get the truth and
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:39.040]  wake up well they just haven't been thinking in a complex way about the way the world really
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:45.040]  works they haven't studied history and most americans again can't find georgia on a map in the us
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:53.440]  much less georgia uh in in uh europe uh in uh eastern europe on the border of central asia
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:15:01.440]  they just they just can't do it and all and all they're hearing on the news is russia attacks georgia
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:06.480]  but then you read into all the deep headlines and they go no georgia attacked and killed the russians
[3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:12.080]  and the russians fought back now the russians have generally been showing restraint and will
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:15.920]  probably be restrained i i hope they are but bob you're saying you don't think that you think
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:21.120]  they're going to go ahead and uh because if it's a provocation by the by the globalist controlling
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:26.960]  the us it's not us doing it but using our name and our military and and and through through us
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:33.200]  us another sub-puppet of georgia if they started the fight to try to escalate it i guess they'll try
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:38.640]  to order the georgian military to keep attacking the russians to try to uh listen to an escalation
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:41.520]  so we'll just see what happens in the next hours and days
[3:15:45.840 --> 3:15:52.480]  time will tell okay thank you so much uh jim mark in seattle you're on the year worldwide
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:16:00.000]  hi alex uh i really enjoy your show um you know what what amazes me is uh i heard
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:06.560]  that lindsay williams say on your show exactly what's been occurring you know i forgot that two
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:11.680]  weeks ago he said oil would drop a bunch and that there'd be a conflict with russia he did say that
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:18.480]  yes he did and it's just blowing me away oils down again today and you know even with this conflict
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:25.680]  you know gold is kind of broke an important uh a technical line and uh you know it just
[3:16:25.680 --> 3:16:30.800]  reminds me of some of these you know false rallies i've seen in the past in other words the stock
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:37.600]  markets up over 300 points now and uh i just i want to know what your guests think because i have a
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:42.560]  lot of respect for mr chapman and and every all your guests alex i really enjoy your show
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:52.400]  so thank you bob well earlier in the conversation i said that they have in the last two to three
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:17:00.800]  weeks taken commodities precious metals uh and and down in price uh although the commodities
[3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:07.520]  were overpriced i believe and uh and the precious metals just kind of got thrown out with the bath
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:14.160]  water um the the markets and they always go down late in the summer and i mean if this follows all
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:21.040]  the trends it'll be way up in the fall that's correct by the end of september uh it there
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:28.800]  probably if history is correct uh will be a tremendous reversal uh but you don't know until
[3:17:28.800 --> 3:17:36.720]  you get there uh but it you know uh this is the fourth time that this uh 850 5560 level
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:46.240]  has been tested or the end of day uh 845 and um that happened to be the old high area previously
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:56.000]  in 1980 and uh so we're just going to have to relaunch uh and i think that will happen but the
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:18:04.800]  most disturbing factor and and and more i will say this is more disturbing is the uh performance
[3:18:04.800 --> 3:18:12.320]  of the stock market it is so obvious what the united states government is doing i mean markets
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:18.320]  don't act that way i mean i've been at this for 50 years i was a stock broker for 28 years i own
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:26.320]  my own firm i mean i know that business i know what propels markets and or what should propel
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:33.760]  markets and uh i i believe that uh that the the whole thing is rigged on the stock market and
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:40.800]  today is a wonderful example i mean how could you have what could be a new world war with the market
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:49.440]  going up 300 points with other dreadful news at the same time and massive layoffs everywhere uh
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:55.360]  and but the fundamentals are industry shutting down dollar going down debt going up and the
[3:18:55.360 --> 3:19:00.320]  market's doing wonderful that's the plunge protection team thank you anything else anything

[3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:54.880]  military advisors captured the capital of breakaway early friday august state bringing the georgian
[3:23:54.880 --> 3:23:59.360]  russian conflict over the province to military climax russian prime minister vladimir putin
[3:23:59.360 --> 3:24:03.920]  threatened a military response former soviet georgia called up its military reserves that
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:09.120]  the russian war planes bombed its new positions in the renegade province wow i mean renegade
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:15.200]  province the russians have always been there in that province now this is just incredible
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:24.080]  we are here watching us israel backed nato backed forces attack and kill russian troops
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:29.920]  and then if you read the major headlines in the u.s. it's georgia says russia attacking because
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:36.480]  they they don't want to lie outright so that's a semantical deception that's like if you walk over
[3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:39.840]  and punch me in the face two or three times and then i start fighting back and then you say
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:46.080]  alex jones is attacking me but no everybody saw that you hit me first or vice versa uh
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:52.240]  they just treat us like such morons but then in the israeli publications and farm publications
[3:24:52.240 --> 3:24:58.320]  the truth is all being reported but here man we are just i mean we really are pathetic bob
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:03.600]  chetman i want to go to more calls but i just really get sick by the ignorance they know the
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:08.960]  public's ignorant so they just abuse us in ways that are so amazing and now bring us to the brink
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:17.840]  of war with russia again russia is now engaging u.s israeli and georgian forces this is incredible
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:23.760]  and the stock market's at 300 points that's even more incredible
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:40.960]  oh god i mean i mean you know they're messing on their on their on their own work i mean
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:46.000]  you know once this thing goes down it's not coming back they're all going to be at a job in
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:52.480]  uh selling apples for ten cents a piece or whatever well i mean all over austin media
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:57.360]  companies k i laid off 14 people this morning is that even in the news we have inside people inside
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:02.400]  k i did is that news that 14 people got laid off this morning i mean you never heard it well it's
[3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:06.720]  just a little tv station the point is layoffs everywhere everything's falling apart yuppie's
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:11.840]  dancing around everything's fine oh russia's evil they attack us kill them meanwhile if you read in
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:16.800]  the bottom of all the papers they admit that we attack them folks our government is attacking
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:22.800]  russian troops and killing them now this is unprecedented and the average yuppie probably
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:27.360]  thinks it's funny there's people on the comment sections on info wars saying we're making this up
[3:26:27.360 --> 3:26:33.840]  bob but wait till they step on one of those dead bodies and i get that fluid all over their boots
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:35.920]  and have it stinking for the next two weeks
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:43.760]  they don't get it they've never seen people die and it isn't nice
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:48.720]  well you know it's sick what's happening but i have to say it
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:56.400]  this country is going to fall this country is rotten and mentally ill and i just hope it
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:02.000]  doesn't end in nuclear war bob i hope it doesn't either because you and i are going to end up
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:08.880]  crispy critters yeah i'm in austin texas that's a major target uh with all these military bases
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:14.560]  around it and being a capital now whatever you can always move over the border you know well if
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:18.400]  nuke's ever start going out the yuppies will probably come out and say oh no it's a suntan
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:23.120]  it's not a nuke i'm not joking they'll probably run into it they'll probably drive in the mushroom
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:30.080]  clouds going no it's good it's al-qaeda oh i love it oh bill clinton save me i think you know uh let's
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:35.360]  talk to drew in california drew her on the air then scott and texas and others hey elix hi i think i
[3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:40.880]  have an eight eight eight connection for you like bob chatman said you need to know your enemy so i
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:46.560]  look at numerology and astrology like nine eleven in the way that washington dc set up for uh...
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:53.600]  or seven seven or uh... or the bali bombing or the or the madrid bombing was on another date
[3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:59.440]  they always do it on weird dates okay i got this for you the astrology symbol for jupiter
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:06.080]  which looks like a twenty four is eight plus eight plus eight if you look at the mythology for jupiter
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:12.560]  it held the same role as zoos in greece and america is great well now jupiter jupiter jupiter jupiter
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:18.880]  is the roman yeah and is the roman name for sus correct and if you look at tex marz's book mysterious
[3:28:18.880 --> 3:28:25.680]  monuments page ninety seven you'll see america is greece reincarnated and um you got that other
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:32.000]  weapon rods of god is the lightning bolts of zoos you heard of that one yes so that's my point with
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:37.440]  the eight eight eight uh... connection that's the best i can give you yeah they always do their
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:42.080]  bombings on weird dates uh... they're completely insane yeah because they're after this numerology
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:46.960]  astrology and if you study what they study you can see this is how they connect things
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:50.720]  and they think if they attack russia on eight eight eight it'll give magic powers
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:56.160]  oh most definitely yeah completely insane exactly we got richard nixon saying they have
[3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:01.600]  homosexual orgies folks you can't make this up homosexual orgies potbellied old republicans
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:08.000]  running around like this i mean you know who can make this up pretty funny huh bob

[3:32:56.720 --> 3:33:02.160]  they're ramping up world events seems that they're ramping up restriction of the internet
[3:33:02.960 --> 3:33:07.600]  lately i've been trying to think of ways nonviolent ways that we can back these guys off
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:12.320]  and ways that we could possibly use the internet while we still have it
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:20.800]  to have some sort of advantage i wanted to toss an idea at you guys and see what you thought
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:30.720]  uh they seem to be making a list of us um about a million or so plus of people that don't see eye
[3:33:30.720 --> 3:33:37.920]  to eye with the current administration or what have you why not us make a list of them the top
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:46.320]  criminals from rockefeller and roth child all the way down to anderson cooper's uh intern uh i was
[3:33:46.320 --> 3:33:53.360]  wondering what the legality and the uh feasibility of an idea like this well i mean you could make
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:58.880]  lists of criminal people or people involved in the new world order if you want and put those out
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:02.880]  but understand most the million people on the list and i appreciate your call are totally innocent
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:07.920]  its housewives school teachers somebody that took a picture in an airport that's just about
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:12.480]  setting the precedent for a list and then they say oh if you went off the list just come file with
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:17.520]  us as a trusted traveler so that's really another program i mean they can't do anything to a million
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:22.720]  of us it's all bravado it's all just will we roll over to them as they nally around guys in pink

[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:47.920]  absolutely right i was watching it from early this morning and they were provoked um georgia
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:52.720]  did attack the russians first and then the news the media changed the story around uh when
[3:36:52.720 --> 3:36:57.920]  you know the official story or whatever they like to call it you know you're absolutely right back

[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:20.320]  love the show um just got several things a couple questions i wanted to ask i don't know
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:25.440]  i tend to ramble so you told me when you've heard enough um one thing i was wondering i heard you
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.000]  talking about some contest the other day and one was for writing a new declaration of independence
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:35.600]  you gotta go to info wars dot com big giant banner for the contest okay and then i had a question for
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:43.440]  bob chappan um i like i have a u s a today from july 25th with an ad about these new presidential
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:50.480]  coins issued since by the world monetary exchange fund something i'd never heard of i was wondering
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:55.360]  if he knew anything about that um it seemed kind of interesting to me it said never circulated in
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:01.040]  the public straight from the private vaults of this world monetary exchange i thought that was
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:09.120]  kind of interesting and um also i was at the ron paul revolution rally in washington dc a little
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:14.320]  bit ago and i was talking to this guy that i met there i believe he said we are changed since an
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:18.160]  addy and we were talking about like how he had tex marz on and he was talking about how they
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:22.800]  signal each other through architecture and whatnot and he said uh have you noticed that they
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:28.080]  haven't changed or updated the one dollar bill that has the olsen eye on it right and perhaps
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:32.800]  you know maybe that was a more subtle form of architecture and uh you know they've changed
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:38.720]  every other bill but that one so that was kind of interesting and uh i know that's a lot there's a
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:42.800]  lot to go i'm gonna let you go because we gotta move on to other collars so there's a lot of
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:48.640]  questions there and i end up forgetting what they all were um well i can there's one of them that
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:55.440]  ted should answer and that is on that uh coin that he mentioned that came out um what usually
[3:38:55.440 --> 3:39:01.040]  happens with those collector type coins is they usually end up getting sold for close to melt
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:08.320]  value uh in the aftermarket or when you go to sell them and so i usually pay a premium that you
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:15.120]  shouldn't have to pay uh my feeling is uh uh you should look at those kinds of coins after they
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:20.480]  have been issued to see where they settle at and i wouldn't go in and purchase them right off the
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:25.120]  bat i think he was asking yeah some will go up some will go down some will stay the same
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:30.640]  you never know which coin will it'll become the really uh famous ones or or or incredibly
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:34.880]  collectible kind of like baseball cards but i think his question was who is this particular
[3:39:34.880 --> 3:39:40.480]  mint who is this group this world i've never heard of them and they pop up and from time to time
[3:39:41.040 --> 3:39:47.440]  and they last for a while and then they disappear yeah okay uh let's go ahead and go back to laser
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:52.400]  in the uk one more time see if laser's phone's working laser just dropped off oh he just dropped
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:57.120]  off laser if you can call back in and your line works will get you on air it was breaking up
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:03.280]  but i believe what he was saying was i heard part of it was that he got in the news was first
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:07.440]  reporting the georgians that attacked the russians and a glorious victory and killed the evil russian
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:13.280]  troops and a vicious illegal sneak attack how wonderful now that's in us today but at the
[3:40:13.280 --> 3:40:21.200]  bottom of the story oh by the way we attack the russians i mean attacking russians and then saying
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:26.400]  because they're with al qaeda yes i pulled up mainstream articles saying our troops were there
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:33.280]  to fight al qaeda i mean how dumb do they i guess now well i mean they've put out news reports saying
[3:40:33.280 --> 3:40:39.600]  that i am secretly another 9 11 truthers were secretly raised in afghanistan and our al qaeda
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:45.760]  not to mention that i was born before all that started and that they were our allies till 1990
[3:40:45.760 --> 3:40:49.920]  i mean it just made up but people say oh my god alex jones is secretly al qaeda
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:41:02.480]  i mean i hope that i hope alex that mr potin sees or meets mr bush again at those olympics
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:08.000]  and goes up and whispers in his ear you just began your worst nightmare
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:15.600]  god only knows what's really going on i i i just i'm not i'm not joking when i say americans are
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:21.280]  going to think russians attack georgia in the u.s and i'm not joking when i say they go on the
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:26.320]  message boards on my on info wars dot com on the comment area and say i'm the european union
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:30.560]  doesn't exist and then you follow their handles back to their myspace accounts and places in
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:36.320]  their facebook and their troops i mean they really think the eu doesn't exist bob they there's
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:42.000]  there's hit pieces on me saying uh... that i'm lying that there's no african union when it was
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:47.600]  announced a decade ago i mean i i mean these people aren't joking bob they don't know anything
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:56.400]  no you're right they don't and and they fight you when you do try to tell them when you're just
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:04.000]  trying to help them and uh... you know you only can do what you can do and i've always told people

[3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:02.080]  no global research uh... dot c a article says that georgia troops that took part in a nato
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:08.160]  exercise in the region watched uh... artillery fire on the south of city and capital on august
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:13.840]  first killing six people there is direct connection between exercises of nato troops in the latest
[3:44:13.840 --> 3:44:19.600]  attacks on us and that's in a global research article well that's what all these drills are for
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:24.960]  here in the u.s. anniversaries prepare us to be attacked by our by our leaders the mob criminals
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:29.440]  that are gonna loot everything we've got send all those to the message boards on prison planet
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:34.000]  everywhere i want i want to be the place to be i want all the key info people to see this for
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:40.320]  themselves this the headline should read with all this data in it u.s. military launches sneak
[3:44:40.320 --> 3:44:46.640]  attack on russian troops uh... you know under cover of georgian army i mean that's basically
[3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:51.440]  what we're dealing with and this is just outrageous thank you for the call yes i've got those articles
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:56.880]  oh jeez this is so criminal bob this is so criminal
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:03.760]  it certainly is and uh... you know again our troops are in harm's way they shouldn't be there
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:10.960]  and it's wrong wrong wrong and uh... i've got headlines guys have already served three tours
[3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:16.560]  and you know now they're putting them in another war it's just disgusting
[3:45:16.560 --> 3:45:22.640]  and reportedly according to israel papers israel's kind of the boss over there
[3:45:24.800 --> 3:45:29.040]  israel's done what according to some israeli publications you mentioned one of them that
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:34.240]  it israel's dead cut yeah yeah but israeli forces are kind of running the whole shindig
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:40.480]  and that's correct they've been in there for a long time uh... leading up to this invasion
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:47.120]  and that actually it's an invasion so if i was russia i'd just uh... you know bring my best troops
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:53.200]  down and when you get them in position just uh... open up with alia missiles the whole works and
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:46:01.200]  just obliterate them that's what i do well that's what's happening right now i mean you gotta
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:07.920]  remember i spent years working against the russians when they were the soviets and so you know i don't
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:12.800]  have any love for them but unfortunately they're in the right here i mean they're being golden
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:20.960]  pushed into war they're being attacked by foreign governments it's wrong do you agree with uh...
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:26.320]  with dr roberts that that that the neocons are now completely insane i think so
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:31.600]  uh... they're they're insane with their own power at least the american version there are
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:36.480]  i mean there's a method to the madness here but the point is they're delusional you know they think
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:42.560]  they're sane but but they're crazy well and that's that's that's a given
[3:46:43.280 --> 3:46:47.680]  and incidentally uh... they're not all sane over in europe either i wrote a piece
[3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:55.120]  that's in wednesday's issue on the europe uh... about saccozzi in his background and uh... and
[3:46:55.120 --> 3:47:00.000]  then i've gotten some letters at the end of the which will be going on tomorrow's issue pertaining
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:06.720]  to that and uh... it's it's another dog's breakfast these people that are running france are out of
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:11.840]  their minds as well and they just created the Mediterranean union which is all over the news
[3:47:11.840 --> 3:47:15.520]  but people say it doesn't exist when we talk about it it's unbelievable military tactic of
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:19.440]  denying everything as they attack i want to bring ten Anderson up and i just want to leave this
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:24.880]  short and sweet for people i like to buy gold when it appears it's at a low whether it was
[3:47:24.880 --> 3:47:31.520]  two hundred and sixty five dollars or uh... you know three you know three forty or or or
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:35.680]  five hundred or six hundred or seven hundred or nine hundred i've bought it all those levels
[3:47:35.680 --> 3:47:40.320]  coin here coin there i think now is a great time to buy because things are so unstable
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:44.480]  who knows what's coming in the future uh... they've been artificially trying to depress gold which
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:50.880]  is a buying opportunity with all of this uh... out there the dollar being devalued all of it
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:56.880]  is it a good move to move into uh... these call these these coins that ten anderson's offering
[3:47:56.880 --> 3:48:04.320]  right at melt bob chairman well you know you buy them when nobody wants them
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:09.600]  this is a tremendous opportunity to buy nobody knows where the bottom is
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:12.080]  it could be right here and in all probability is
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:18.240]  so take advantage of it you know if you got enough to buy ten units well maybe buy five here and see
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:25.200]  what happens in if you've got to pay uh... eight eighty four well that's okay if you pay eight twenty
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:30.960]  four the second five that's okay too so that's a way to look at it let's bring ten anderson up
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:34.560]  these are semi-nomismatic coins uh... at billion prices
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:39.120]  ted i wanted to have you on the day with so much is happening and i wanted to point out to people
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:43.920]  getting out of fellow reserve notes is a good thing everybody i know who you know is paycheck to
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:49.760]  paycheck will go to positive two thousand dollar fifteen hundred dollar paycheck uh... in the bank
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:53.200]  and then the bank will say even though they've had bank accounts for years the bank will say oh
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:58.000]  you can only have a third of that money out or you can't pay your bills for six seven days two weeks
[3:48:58.880 --> 3:49:05.280]  we're just holding your money and uh... now i'm seeing other banks go under all this craziness
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:10.160]  but the government saying oh no everything's fine don't buy gold while they pack on trying to drive it
[3:49:10.160 --> 3:49:14.800]  down tenerson yeah i'm right here alex i can tell you right now this market little market
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:20.160]  dip that we had here recently is what gold behaves like normally in the summer and right now
[3:49:20.160 --> 3:49:25.280]  we're sitting in a price range where gold was it jumped up over a hundred dollars here last time
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:30.560]  and what did it take bob maybe uh... about four or five days for gold to go from eight eighty
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:35.840]  roughly in that range to nine hundred and fifty i mean right now is a very good buying opportunity
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:40.400]  and i'd really suggest that if you get the uh... if you have the opportunity and you have some cash
[3:49:40.400 --> 3:49:44.000]  put it into gold i mean this russian thing is just one of the problems we have
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:48.560]  we got way too many problems in the market right now tell me about the coin offers you've got
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:52.960]  yeah i do i've got the british sovereign right now it's a great coin it's at two hundred and thirty
