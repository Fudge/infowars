[00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:09.799]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.381]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:13.322]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:23.130]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.012]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.275]  It is the eighth day of August, the eighth month of
[00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:35.597]  The 8th year, 2008, and, uh, I believe the Olympics also kicked off today, but that's not what we're really going to be talking about.
[00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:41.802]  Here on the air today, it is the Alex Jones Show, and I am Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.823]  Now, there's tons of stories to cover.
[00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:47.405]  Uh, a couple mainline ones I want to get out of the way right off the bat.
[00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:55.551]  Uh, first of all, President, or former President, Clinton, has been tapped to speak at the DNC, and lo and behold, he will be speaking
[00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.882]  Just before whoever the vice presidential nominee is.
[00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:05.484]  Now, you know, that would tell me that it's probably going to be Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:18.627]  I've been saying this for some time now, who knows, maybe they're just setting us up, you know, for people like me to say that, but it sure does look like Bill will be introducing his wife, who will be the nominee for the vice presidency of the United States.
[00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:22.829]  We all know Barack is going to get the presidential nomination, so I want to talk about that.
[00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.009]  By the way, we're going to be taking your calls
[00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:36.391]  Most of the day today, we have Bob Chapman from the internationalforecaster.com on later, and we also have Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado, and he's going to be talking about some great developments.
[00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:43.436]  He was actually able to get a permit for We Are Change Colorado about a thousand feet from the Pepsi Center.
[00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.917]  They are in an entire park.
[00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.759]  We're going to go over all that, but great work, Jonathan.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.423]  And as you all know, Alex Jones and crew will be covering the DNC live
[00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.312]  From Denver, Colorado.
[00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:56.452]  It's going to be a great time.
[00:01:56.452 --> 00:01:57.612]  I'm looking forward to it.
[00:01:57.612 --> 00:02:00.794]  I'm going to be sitting and hosting while that goes on.
[00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:02.434]  Folks, it's important we go to the DNC.
[00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:02.934]  Now, why?
[00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:08.096]  A lot of people say, oh, it's the Republicans, the neocons, the ones that did this to us.
[00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:10.817]  No, this is a global agenda.
[00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:18.660]  And just because the Bush administration will no longer be in office soon does not mean this agenda ends.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.440]  Let's get real.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.901]  Let's get really real right now.
[00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:23.945]  Barack Obama is a globalist, okay?
[00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:24.745]  He is a minion.
[00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.765]  He's a good speaker.
[00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:30.707]  He's a charismatic, younger candidate that people feel like they can relate to.
[00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:36.029]  They believe it when he says that he is change you can vote for.
[00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.110]  Yeah, he's not change you can vote for.
[00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.130]  There's no change there.
[00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:49.854]  This is a guy that got caught getting off of his plane to go meet with Hillary Clinton in secret in the same exact area where the Bilderberg conference is being held.
[00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:54.205]  A lot of people will tell you, oh, that's a coincidence, nothing happened there.
[00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:57.767]  But then they gave three separate stories about where they met and what they were talking about.
[00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.588]  So you do the math.
[00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:02.430]  Then a week ago, he goes to Berlin!
[00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.171]  In Germany!
[00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:07.213]  And he gives this big staged speech in front of all the people.
[00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:10.795]  I mean, they're pretty much predestined that this guy is gonna be the President of the United States.
[00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:18.640]  I don't think there's many people out there that really believe that McCain has a fighting shot or that he's there for anything else but to take a fall, okay?
[00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:30.441]  But he gets up there and he starts telling the citizens of the world that they will be doing more and not less in this new world.
[00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:34.845]  A world that stands as one, according to Barack Obama.
[00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:38.629]  Now, he did not say a new world order specifically.
[00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.078]  He did not use that phrase.
[00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:52.581]  However, when Sky News covered the speech, it was even evident to them, Sky is a branch of Fox News by the way, that this was a New World Order speech, and that is what they called it.
[00:03:52.581 --> 00:04:04.384]  Okay, so, for all you people out there thinking that Barack Obama is the lesser of two evils, no, he's actually probably the eviler of the two because he is in a slicker package that more people will be fooled by.
[00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:07.385]  Much like Bill Clinton mesmerized most of the population.
[00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:10.532]  Back in the 90s.
[00:04:10.532 --> 00:04:21.861]  You know, a lot of people still to this day tell me how great the Clintons were and, you know, how we need to get back to Bill Clinton's form of economics and his foreign policy or his domestic policy.
[00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.303]  But you see, he tried to ratchet up the police state too.
[00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.105]  He used Oklahoma City.
[00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.126]  He killed all those people at Waco.
[00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.247]  He could have let those people live.
[00:04:29.247 --> 00:04:34.191]  There was no reason to come in with a tank, firebomb that establishment, kill all those children.
[00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:43.175]  When we get back, we're going to talk about this new, uh, recent development of them trying to frame Ada up as part of Iraqi intelligence.
[00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:47.181]  This is the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:13.994]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:17.818]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:25.044]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:28.447]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:36.355]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:10.088]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:11.670]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.231]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:17.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:21.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:28.955]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:32.277]  I am not Alex Jones, I am Jason Bermas.
[00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:40.062]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and TruthNews.us, among others.
[00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:44.244]  And I want to talk about this story in the Huffington Post.
[00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:56.031]  Now the Huffington Post yesterday reported that the administration was trying so badly to link Al-Qaeda to Saddam Hussein,
[00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:06.716]  And, uh, you know, his regime, even after the fact, after they had actually invaded the country, and, uh, caused, quote-unquote, regime change, okay?
[00:09:06.716 --> 00:09:18.223]  They were still interested in linking ATA, and not only linking ATA, but also trying to prove, uh, the Niger weapons thing, and, uh, you know, the uranium, the, uh, enriched uranium, all that bull.
[00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:20.264]  And how do they, how are they trying to do this?
[00:09:20.264 --> 00:09:25.187]  Well, turns out, in their little deck of cards there, remember the deck of cards?
[00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:26.828]  I mean, we're so sick!
[00:09:28.106 --> 00:09:29.287]  People bought those cards.
[00:09:29.287 --> 00:09:31.589]  I know my friends had them, they had them at gas stations.
[00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:36.812]  We all remember the deck of cards, the oh-so-evil deck of Iraqis.
[00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:40.875]  Well, turns out that the Jack of Diamonds is a millionaire on the U.S.'
[00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:41.236]  's dime.
[00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:42.276]  That's right, let me say it again.
[00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:44.878]  The Jack of Diamonds is a millionaire on the U.S.'
[00:09:44.838 --> 00:09:45.199]  's dime.
[00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:51.683]  This guy was a paid informer from the start, and what they wanted him to do, just shows you how far these people will go.
[00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:55.326]  I mean, sure, they'll throw out plans about painting up PT boats and
[00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.994]  Saying that they're Iranian and throwing in U.S.
[00:09:58.994 --> 00:10:04.602]  Navy SEALs to get shot at and start a shootout and probably kill those people and, you know, start a false flag event in order to go to war.
[00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:13.473]  But what they wanted to do here was to manufacture a little bit of evidence after the fact to try to say that they were justified in both of their invasions.
[00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:14.294]  And what they said was,
[00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:27.450]  Was that we need you to write this letter, and we need you to date it 2000, prior to 9-11, and we need you to say that Atta was running around, and that you were helping fund him through Saddam Hussein.
[00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.710]  And I'm like, wow!
[00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:41.696]  So they really were trying to pin a relationship between Atta and Saddam Hussein, and then say that somehow, through this depleted uranium WMD scam, he was raising them money.
[00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:43.477]  See, so it took care of two things at once.
[00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:48.755]  First of all, he would have weapons of mass destruction even if he didn't find them because of this letter.
[00:10:48.755 --> 00:10:51.600]  Who knows what he did with them, but he absolutely had them.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.445]  And then two, he may have been involved in 9-11.
[00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.511]  I mean, they only tried to make that link, oh, I don't know, thousands of times.
[00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:13.567]  Yet, I'll still hear, you know, neocons and people in denial tell me that they never said they knew where the weapons of mass destruction were when, you know, Donald Rumsfeld got on TV several times, and, oh, they're in the Tora Bora Mountains!
[00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:14.848]  We know exactly where they are!
[00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:22.354]  They're showing, like, intricate diagrams of these cave-dwelling operations that just don't even exist.
[00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:25.116]  I mean, you should see some of the- Listen, type in, uh,
[00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:29.977]  I don't want to say, Al-Qaeda cave or Taliban center.
[00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:33.318]  I mean, you would think, this is something that a doctor knows.
[00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.739]  Kind of a Bond flick.
[00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:40.642]  The way they made this mountain look like a military operational center.
[00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:41.682]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:11:41.682 --> 00:11:50.026]  The only people that would be able to turn a mountain into this type of military operational center would be a westernized government, much like ours or maybe Europe's.
[00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:52.107]  Not many other people are going to be able to do that.
[00:11:53.442 --> 00:12:01.823]  But, they really did, you know, put the fear of the boogeyman into all of us, and that's, you know, that's why I just put together this new film, Fabled Enemies.
[00:12:01.823 --> 00:12:07.204]  Just wrapped it up yesterday, uh, mastered the DVD, going out today.
[00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:16.106]  And this, this film really deals with not what didn't happen on 9-11, but what did, and who was involved.
[00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:22.687]  Uh, you know, after I've traveled the country for the past couple years with loose change, I got a good amount of the same questions.
[00:12:23.783 --> 00:12:25.383]  Why didn't you talk about this?
[00:12:25.383 --> 00:12:28.104]  Why aren't the Israelis in your movie?
[00:12:28.104 --> 00:12:31.125]  What's the connection to Saudi Arabia?
[00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:36.827]  And, you know, I would go on and I would answer these things, but never really be able to give a full-spectrum analysis.
[00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:47.649]  Well, now my film is on the way, and I really think I've done a bang-up job of not only coming up with 80% new news footage stuff nobody has ever seen, ever, ever.
[00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:49.310]  It's not on YouTube.
[00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.331]  I guess a couple of the clips are now on YouTube, but most of it's not on YouTube.
[00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:55.298]  Very tough stuff to find.
[00:12:55.298 --> 00:12:59.462]  I mean, I literally combed through archives to find this stuff.
[00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:02.064]  And to give you the overview, we start with 9-11.
[00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:10.992]  And the reason I start with 9-11 is because I want to make it clear to people there was no other suspect other than Osama bin Laden.
[00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:13.114]  No other suspect, okay?
[00:13:13.114 --> 00:13:19.400]  If you watch from that day, literally before the second tower even gets hit, some of the news organizations are talking about him as a suspect.
[00:13:20.197 --> 00:13:20.817]  Okay.
[00:13:20.817 --> 00:13:28.902]  We're talking heads like Tim Russert, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Oliver North.
[00:13:28.902 --> 00:13:30.763]  Oliver North says something outstanding.
[00:13:30.763 --> 00:13:36.987]  He's like, oh, I'm told by insiders that Osama bin Laden likely deployed more than 50 terrorists
[00:13:39.463 --> 00:13:40.023]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:40.023 --> 00:13:42.064]  So, I take you back to that mindset.
[00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:45.665]  I mean, they're literally, literally was no one else, okay?
[00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:48.006]  I've got them saying they're 90% certain it was Bin Laden.
[00:13:48.006 --> 00:13:52.747]  This is before, this is less than 12 hours after the attack these people are saying this.
[00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:54.027]  You know, they can't catch anybody.
[00:13:54.027 --> 00:13:56.648]  They can't stop any of these attacks.
[00:13:56.648 --> 00:14:00.609]  Yet, uh, they know exactly who did it as soon as it's over.
[00:14:00.609 --> 00:14:04.951]  So I make that point pretty strongly in the first couple minutes of my film.
[00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.652]  Now, I move on from there.
[00:14:07.652 --> 00:14:09.052]  I show you how the hijackers
[00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:12.243]  Repeatedly, had intelligence ties.
[00:14:12.243 --> 00:14:15.746]  Not only trained at US bases, but lived with FBI agents.
[00:14:15.746 --> 00:14:18.228]  Protected from members of the CIA.
[00:14:18.228 --> 00:14:19.750]  By other members in the FBI.
[00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.011]  And the CIA, by the way.
[00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:25.055]  See, there's always some people that are trying to do the right thing.
[00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:26.356]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:14:26.356 --> 00:14:27.477]  They believe in this country.
[00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:29.398]  They believe in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:14:29.398 --> 00:14:30.980]  They think they're doing good for the world.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.101]  And in most cases, they are.
[00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:40.591]  But then when they go after people that are involved in black operations, they don't understand why their investigations get pulled.
[00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:43.232]  Why gag orders begin to happen to them.
[00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.333]  Why their reputation is ruined.
[00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:48.334]  Why they become paper pushers.
[00:14:48.334 --> 00:14:49.695]  It's because they tried to rock the boat.
[00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:51.936]  They tried to get in on this black op.
[00:14:51.936 --> 00:14:54.797]  So that brings us to the next chapter of the film.
[00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:57.118]  We go over, you know, the FBI cover-up.
[00:14:57.118 --> 00:15:01.660]  We go over, uh, you know, Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch bringing Robert Wright and other people's stories forward.
[00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:09.004]  And we also cover John O'Neill, the man who was in charge of going after Bin Laden for the FBI.
[00:15:09.004 --> 00:15:09.964]  And what happens to him?
[00:15:09.964 --> 00:15:14.788]  Well, he's so upset that they keep obstructing his investigations, he decides to leave.
[00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:18.491]  He gets hired by Kroll to become head of the World Trade Center Security.
[00:15:18.491 --> 00:15:20.292]  He moves his desk in.
[00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:24.015]  The day before 9-11, he's killed during the attack, and completely silenced.
[00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:27.685]  And that's just the first few chapters.
[00:15:27.685 --> 00:15:30.087]  Then we really start getting into the hardcore stuff.
[00:15:30.087 --> 00:15:31.007]  Saudi involvement.
[00:15:31.007 --> 00:15:32.228]  Israeli involvement.
[00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:34.430]  Pakistan being set up.
[00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.631]  Okay?
[00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:35.911]  U.S.
[00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:41.776]  government officials admitting that foreign governments are involved in 9-11.
[00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.598]  It's a powerful film.
[00:15:43.598 --> 00:15:44.278]  We hope you see it.
[00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:47.241]  It's going to be available September 1st on the web.
[00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:48.602]  And we're going to have some trailers for you.
[00:15:49.352 --> 00:15:50.673]  This weekend.
[00:15:50.673 --> 00:15:52.715]  So I'm very excited about it.
[00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:56.118]  I want to thank Alex Jones for giving me the opportunity to put this film out.
[00:15:56.118 --> 00:16:13.353]  I think it is a great piece to go along with Loose Change Final Cut or Loose Change Second Edition, especially if you want to see something that doesn't have anything to do with the Pentagon strike, doesn't have anything to do with what happened at Shanksville, doesn't have anything to do with the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center.
[00:16:13.353 --> 00:16:14.814]  This is a very different movie, folks.
[00:16:15.544 --> 00:16:17.024]  And I hope you support me and check it out.
[00:16:17.024 --> 00:16:23.665]  In fact, if you go to MySpace.com slash Fable, that means you can be our friend on MySpace and help get the word out.
[00:16:23.665 --> 00:16:29.446]  It's amazing what you can do with a little bit of motivation in this country.
[00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:35.227]  Another big story that I wanted to cover, and I covered briefly with Alex Jones earlier in the week, was this cab driver.
[00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:39.688]  Because now they're saying, well, he could be out in as early as five months.
[00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:41.868]  And what cab driver am I talking about?
[00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:43.029]  I shouldn't even say cab driver.
[00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:43.769]  Limo driver.
[00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:44.869]  Bin Laden's limo driver.
[00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.398]  Now again, let's go over it.
[00:16:47.398 --> 00:16:49.839]  This is his third trial.
[00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:50.360]  Let me say it again.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.161]  It is his third trial.
[00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:56.203]  He's been picked up since the quote-unquote beginning of the war on terror.
[00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:57.564]  Okay?
[00:16:57.564 --> 00:16:58.544]  It's just unbelievable to me.
[00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:02.026]  The guy got tortured for years and years and years in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:03.947]  They tried him twice for terrorism.
[00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.128]  They found nothing.
[00:17:05.128 --> 00:17:06.889]  Let me say that again.
[00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:07.509]  They found nothing.
[00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:09.230]  These are rigged military tribunals.
[00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.111]  This isn't a jury of his peers.
[00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:11.571]  Okay?
[00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:12.612]  These aren't people off the street.
[00:17:12.612 --> 00:17:14.593]  These are people in the military saying,
[00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:17.376]  Oh no, he doesn't have anything to do with terrorism.
[00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:20.377]  You know, this guy was probably just trying to feed his family.
[00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:23.137]  He took a job as a limo driver for a rich guy.
[00:17:23.137 --> 00:17:24.758]  He has no idea what's going on.
[00:17:24.758 --> 00:17:27.118]  So then they bring this other show trial out, and that's what it is.
[00:17:27.118 --> 00:17:27.838]  It's a show trial.
[00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:43.061]  It's something to put into the consciousness of the American people through MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, AP, all the mainline websites, that Al-Qaeda is real, they're around every corner, and we're getting them.
[00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:43.821]  Look at this guy.
[00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.561]  We're sentencing him.
[00:17:45.342 --> 00:17:51.364]  So anyway, he got sentenced to five and a half years and they're saying, well, he could be out in five months.
[00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:53.225]  Or not at all.
[00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:54.625]  Or not at all!
[00:17:54.625 --> 00:18:01.268]  This guy had his hands, his head in his hands, weeping and crying like a little baby.
[00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.433]  When he was sentenced to this because he knows he's not getting out.
[00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:23.429]  Listen, they're not letting him out in five years so he can tell the horror stories of how he was tortured again and again in a private military prison only to be brought to trial three separate times so they can convict him of driving a limousine and then send him back to torture.
[00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:26.031]  It's absolutely incredible, don't you think Alex?
[00:18:28.493 --> 00:18:40.653]  And they have now, Burmese, put out more fake intel center videos claiming that people out of Pakistan are going to attack the Olympics.
[00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:42.286]  You know what?
[00:18:42.286 --> 00:18:47.550]  I read an AP thing right on the way in here that they're now gearing up to go into Pakistan because it seems like that is the next enemy.
[00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.171]  They've geared us up.
[00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:50.973]  That's where they flew the 6,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda chiefs out to.
[00:18:50.973 --> 00:18:52.594]  But I mean, how incredible is it?
[00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:53.255]  On C-130s, by the way.
[00:18:53.255 --> 00:19:03.564]  That it's now coming out that they ordered the FBI to manufacture evidence that Iraq sent the anthrax letters, that they've been ordering people to write fake letters saying yellow cake.
[00:19:03.564 --> 00:19:04.905]  I mean, these are complete criminals.
[00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:08.386]  Absolutely convicted in the court of public opinion.
[00:19:08.386 --> 00:19:13.328]  The public's being financially robbed by them and some of the neocon followers still love it.
[00:19:13.328 --> 00:19:17.049]  And so I want to tell them, don't worry, you're going to get hurt and hurt real bad.
[00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:22.511]  Listen, I took off today because I've got a lot of business I've got to take care of, but I'm like an addict.
[00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:28.873]  I am walking by the door out here doing work and hearing you in here.
[00:19:28.873 --> 00:19:30.714]  I never covered this Monday when it first broke.
[00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:34.075]  People think I'm trying to bash police, but I'm not doing that.
[00:19:35.935 --> 00:19:40.177]  These are the type of stories we end up ignoring, but now it's gotten worse.
[00:19:40.177 --> 00:19:44.338]  Police raid Maryland Mayor's home and kill his dogs, and the police say they're proud of themselves.
[00:19:44.338 --> 00:19:48.039]  So I thought we might just mention that when we get back, and then get back into your Alciateda stuff.
[00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.140]  We'll cover that when we get back.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.180]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:01.877 --> 00:20:05.198]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:07.459]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:09.040]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.701]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:13.602]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:13.602 --> 00:20:17.224]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:20:26.885 --> 00:20:31.772]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:35.553 --> 00:20:37.996]  How dare you?
[00:20:37.996 --> 00:20:43.240]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.963]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:45.963 --> 00:20:52.449]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[00:21:37.703 --> 00:21:38.143]  The U.S.

[00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:27.634]  CNN reporting Georgia has been attacked by Russia.
[00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:30.637]  That's Georgia in Eastern Europe.
[00:24:30.637 --> 00:24:31.317]  We're not kidding.
[00:24:31.317 --> 00:24:33.459]  I'm looking at CNN.com right now.
[00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:41.226]  Georgia's president said today, this is 21 minutes ago, that his country is under attack by Russian tanks and warplanes.
[00:24:41.226 --> 00:24:47.112]  And he accused Russia of targeting civilians as tensions over the breakaway Georgian region of South
[00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:51.396]  Ozzetti appeared to boil over into full-blown conflict.
[00:24:51.396 --> 00:25:03.368]  Now remember, the Russian Foreign Minister just four months ago threatened to nuke the United States in Western Europe if they continued to move in weapon systems into Georgia, Ukraine, and other areas.
[00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:06.512]  They moved those weapons in two weeks ago.
[00:25:06.512 --> 00:25:07.653]  Russian forces have hit.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.121]  Burmese, I'm afraid that you can ride shotgun today, but that's it.
[00:25:12.121 --> 00:25:14.142]  I'm just not going to be able to get my other chores done.
[00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:18.263]  I can't sit here on 888 while Russia is invading.
[00:25:18.263 --> 00:25:21.844]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, listen, this is how World War III can start.
[00:25:21.844 --> 00:25:24.424]  People go, wait, you say it's World War III, it's World War IV.
[00:25:24.424 --> 00:25:27.465]  The neocons call it World War IV.
[00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:29.886]  They call the Cold War World War II.
[00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:35.577]  World War 3, so they're calling this World War 4, but this is what they plan.
[00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:44.240]  Encircling Russia, encircling China, fighting with the Arabs, and staged terror as a pretext to move into the Middle East, and this is it.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:52.422]  And McCain's saying, if we get into a world war, which he's saying could happen a month ago, or actually three weeks ago, that he's going to call for a national draft,
[00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.631]  Uh, this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:55.631 --> 00:26:01.202]  This is the globalists creating world conflict so they can wage war against individual populations.
[00:26:01.202 --> 00:26:02.425]  Farmers, read the report to people.
[00:26:03.123 --> 00:26:04.284]  Sure thing, Alex.
[00:26:04.284 --> 00:26:05.385]  Let's break it from the top.
[00:26:05.385 --> 00:26:06.386]  This is amazing, by the way.
[00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:08.068]  If you go, you can watch a little video.
[00:26:08.068 --> 00:26:11.511]  I mean, there are really tanks literally rolling down the streets, Alex.
[00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:12.112]  Hundreds of them.
[00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:13.413]  Yes, it's not a joke.
[00:26:13.413 --> 00:26:17.037]  This isn't just one little offensive by one military unit.
[00:26:17.037 --> 00:26:18.478]  Georgia's President said- Hold on just a minute.
[00:26:18.478 --> 00:26:19.640]  Let me get the alert out here.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.080]  Alright.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.924]  Hey, call Watson and Nemo and all them and tell them Russia's invaded Georgia.
[00:26:24.304 --> 00:26:25.665]  Full coverage right now.
[00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:26.586]  Alright.
[00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:32.850]  All day they've been bombing Georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population.
[00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.713]  But I was driving in right before the show and this isn't even news.
[00:26:35.713 --> 00:26:37.234]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[00:26:37.234 --> 00:26:38.294]  No big deal at all.
[00:26:38.294 --> 00:26:45.380]  It had to have started at least an hour or two ago and we're just getting it 15 minutes to go on the... it's not even AP, it's CNN.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.861]  I mean it's not even being reported by
[00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.371]  By my little news blurb over at Yahoo, let's keep reading.
[00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:56.573]  President Mikhail Saskovitch told CNN, an exclusive in here, this is the worst nightmare one can encounter.
[00:26:56.573 --> 00:27:04.636]  Hundreds of people, possibly thousands, are fleeing South Ossetia to the Russian region of North Ossetia, Alania.
[00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:06.516]  The United Nations reported Friday.
[00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:08.377]  So they've kind of been gearing up.
[00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:09.257]  I know this is right now.
[00:27:09.257 --> 00:27:11.878]  Well, the Russians said, we will nuke you.
[00:27:11.878 --> 00:27:12.078]  Wow.
[00:27:12.665 --> 00:27:15.768]  And about 400 more are believed to have fled to other parts of Georgia.
[00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:18.470]  I hate it when the United Nations has to report this.
[00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:24.595]  No, wait, our enemies will edit this show where I just talked about the Russian Foreign Minister threatening nuclear attack.
[00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:27.457]  They will edit it to where I just said that Russians have launched an attack.
[00:27:27.797 --> 00:27:32.441]  Kind of like ABC News during Y2K announced they came out and said a missile's been fired from Russia.
[00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:34.702]  NORAD's telling us if it's coming to the U.S.
[00:27:34.702 --> 00:27:42.528]  I reported the ABC News and my enemies edited it to make it sound like that we were saying a missile had been launched from Russia.
[00:27:43.008 --> 00:28:05.370]  We're just reporting what CNN is saying that they have invaded Georgia, and then I'm going back several months ago, you can pull it up, when the official Russian foreign minister said, we will use nukes on you, we will attack, we will go into Georgia, we will go into Ukraine, we will go into other areas that you've been moving your special forces into, and yes, U.S.
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.912]  special forces are in Georgia.
[00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:07.172]  Go ahead.
[00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:12.216]  Now they're saying 150 Russian armored vehicles are down in South Asia.
[00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:14.797]  You can watch the video so you can see these tanks rolling down.
[00:28:14.797 --> 00:28:15.738]  No, they'll say we made it up.
[00:28:15.738 --> 00:28:17.739]  Yeah, they'll absolutely say we made it up.
[00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:20.782]  But I want to let people know that this is a quote now.
[00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:29.868]  We are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in the villages of South Asia, and the numbers of refugees is climbing.
[00:28:29.868 --> 00:28:33.030]  So they're literally there to kill the civilian population.
[00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.533]  Ethnic cleansing, folks, in this day and age, and Russia is conducting it.
[00:28:37.117 --> 00:28:37.897]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:37.897 --> 00:28:38.878]  This is unbelievable.
[00:28:38.878 --> 00:28:39.858]  I'm gonna go out here and work on it.
[00:28:39.858 --> 00:28:40.378]  You keep going.
[00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:41.359]  Yep, you got it.
[00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:42.339]  So here we go.
[00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:45.861]  I mean, let's hope this isn't the kickoff to World War 3 or 4, whatever you want to call it.
[00:28:45.861 --> 00:28:48.962]  But this is not good news.
[00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:55.845]  When you have multiple world conflicts like this, you set the stage for a global battle.
[00:28:55.845 --> 00:29:05.368]  And if you don't think that they want some kind of a global conflict to bring in a global solution, you just don't know this country's history.
[00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:06.529]  You just don't understand
[00:29:07.802 --> 00:29:09.902]  How they brought the United Nations into being.
[00:29:09.902 --> 00:29:15.903]  How they tried to get a League of Nations before that, in the wake of World War I. And were unable to do that.
[00:29:15.903 --> 00:29:22.925]  But in the wake of World War II, they were able to get a form of global government in the United Nations.
[00:29:22.925 --> 00:29:25.665]  This is very, very scary.
[00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:32.006]  When Russian tanks are rolling down streets, killing civilians, you better get worried, folks!
[00:29:32.006 --> 00:29:35.827]  The Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:55.201]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:30:02.721 --> 00:30:06.323]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:06.323 --> 00:30:08.784]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:08.784 --> 00:30:11.825]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:17.568]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:17.568 --> 00:30:21.470]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:01.328]  Attention!
[00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:05.291]  This is an extremely urgent news update on the global food shortage.
[00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:12.356]  If you've ever wanted to produce your own dirt-cheap survival foods, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:12.356 --> 00:32:23.364]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all kinds of survival foods in event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:32:23.364 --> 00:32:24.685]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:28.008]  This course teaches you how to store food for pennies on the dollar.
[00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:30.690]  Hunger is spreading across the globe.
[00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.772]  Food riots have already broken out in over 20 countries.
[00:32:33.772 --> 00:32:36.194]  Will troops guard food supplies in the U.S.
[00:32:36.194 --> 00:32:37.075]  this winter?
[00:32:37.075 --> 00:32:38.036]  Don't wait!

[00:33:42.012 --> 00:33:44.713]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:33:44.713 --> 00:33:46.054]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:46.054 --> 00:33:47.615]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:53.539]  Alex is around the corner, but he's really trying to set up some guests right now to talk about this situation.
[00:33:53.539 --> 00:33:55.280]  This is the real deal, folks.
[00:33:57.443 --> 00:34:03.367]  This is a serious geopolitical mess we are in right now.
[00:34:03.367 --> 00:34:04.728]  Right now.
[00:34:04.728 --> 00:34:05.269]  And you know what?
[00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:13.255]  I'm gonna try to pull up right now these tanks coming in and see what CNN actually has to say about it.
[00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:20.640]  But I guess there's a lot of dispute over whether or not South Ossetia is even a part of Russia.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.005]  Their secession was never ever ever ever ever recognized internationally, whatever that means.
[00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:33.273]  But it seems that more and more news agencies are picking up this story.
[00:34:33.273 --> 00:34:38.616]  And I'm going to read this one out of... Wow, this is just incredible, the video that they're showing.
[00:34:38.616 --> 00:34:40.397]  This one is out of the Times Online.
[00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:43.078]  Russia threatens military response to U.S.
[00:34:43.078 --> 00:34:44.079]  missile defense deal.
[00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:48.221]  Now, this was reported about a month ago, okay?
[00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:55.125]  So this was the run-up to what's happening today, is that they said, hey, you bring these missiles in, we're going to attack.
[00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:56.486]  And it looks like they have, Alex.
[00:34:58.377 --> 00:35:03.480]  This is only the report I could find during the three-minute break.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.841]  There were several other threats going back.
[00:35:05.841 --> 00:35:11.665]  This was July 9th in a separate area dealing with the Czech Republic.
[00:35:11.665 --> 00:35:14.106]  Again, Russia threatens military response to U.S.
[00:35:14.106 --> 00:35:15.367]  missile defense deal.
[00:35:15.367 --> 00:35:18.969]  Russia threatened to retaliate by military means after a deal with the Czech Republic.
[00:35:19.549 --> 00:35:19.989]  Let's be clear.
[00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:44.989]  This isn't a West versus Communism.
[00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:47.370]  The globalists are bringing in socialism here.
[00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.071]  They're destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:56.095]  They're funding radical Islamist Al-Qaeda groups worldwide to destabilize the West, to scare the population into submission.
[00:35:56.095 --> 00:36:03.179]  All over Russia they are encircling, funding Chechen rebels, you name it, to attack Russian forces to elicit a response.
[00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:09.623]  And this is literally the incredible bravado and arrogance of the New World Order crowd in Washington, London, and Tel Aviv
[00:36:10.203 --> 00:36:14.925]  Poking Russia, and there is no doubt this is a major hot escalation here.
[00:36:14.925 --> 00:36:21.768]  We will be forced to react, not with diplomatic, but with military technical methods, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
[00:36:21.768 --> 00:36:27.091]  Now I'm trying to pull the one up from a couple months before that, where they threatened the use, saying we have nuclear weapons.
[00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:29.112]  We're going to pull that and read that on air for you.
[00:36:29.112 --> 00:36:31.733]  The Ministry did not detail what its response might entail.
[00:36:32.393 --> 00:36:36.916]  Dr. Rice, the Secretary of State, hailed the agreement as a step forward for international security.
[00:36:36.916 --> 00:36:49.464]  But see, this article is boiling it down just over missile defense and radar, which missile defense is meant to be moved in so that Russia can't counter-strike with missiles if they're hit, so that their response missiles can be shot down.
[00:36:49.464 --> 00:36:55.088]  This is the equivalent of when the Russians moved weapons into Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.
[00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:55.288]  Burmese?
[00:36:57.208 --> 00:37:00.010]  Well, what I'm finding very, very interesting about this is the timing.
[00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:06.415]  I mean, this is literally happening on the day that the Olympics has kicked off, and the international community is pretty much preoccupied.
[00:37:06.415 --> 00:37:09.818]  And all the drones out there are pretty preoccupied as well.
[00:37:09.818 --> 00:37:11.519]  I've queued up this CNN clip.
[00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:12.800]  Should we throw it on, Alex?
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.845]  Yeah, let's do that in just a moment, and then after we do that, Russia mulls arms in Belarus to counter U.S.
[00:37:18.845 --> 00:37:19.645]  shield.
[00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:22.347]  This was Reuters two days ago, Wednesday, August 6.
[00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:25.790]  Russia may consider deploying strategic bombers or station tactical missiles.
[00:37:26.403 --> 00:37:31.604]  That's frogs, and it's close ally Belarus, a counter measure to planned U.S.
[00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:34.905]  missile shield in Europe, Moscow envoy in Minsk said on Wednesday.
[00:37:34.905 --> 00:37:45.908]  So they're threatening and have been threatening to invade a bunch of different countries that were basically through covert means that the globalists went in, had those governments overthrown, put in pro-U.S.
[00:37:45.908 --> 00:37:51.969]  governments who are setting up the same torture squads the whole nine yards, bringing another form of tyranny into the region.
[00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:54.631]  And this affects us all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:55.913]  We don't have fallout shelters.
[00:37:55.913 --> 00:37:57.634]  We don't have bunkers.
[00:37:57.634 --> 00:37:59.877]  The New World Order does, and it's order out of chaos.
[00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:03.841]  They want to bring in a global crisis to offer their solution.
[00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:04.682]  Jason, go ahead and play it.
[00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:05.042]  You got it.
[00:38:07.031 --> 00:38:18.281]  ...putting to Russian state television to be a major development in this crisis between Russia and Georgia over the breakaway Georgian territory of South Ossetia.
[00:38:18.281 --> 00:38:23.486]  Pictures that have been broadcast on Russian state television, Channel One television in fact in this country,
[00:38:24.126 --> 00:38:45.574]  Over the past several minutes or so, show a convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles moving, according to the commentary on the television station, into the breakaway territory of South Ossetia, so crossing the Russian frontier into the neighboring country of Georgia, to bolster, I expect,
[00:38:46.154 --> 00:38:59.667]  The Russian peacekeeping forces that are already on the ground in South Ossetia as a result of an international agreement to bring to an end the ethnic fighting that took place in that territory in the early 1990s.
[00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:09.176]  Now, according to state television, these tanks and armoured vehicles should be approaching the regional capital
[00:39:11.336 --> 00:39:21.378]  We're going to play more of this in a moment, but this is just an incredible whitewash.
[00:39:21.378 --> 00:39:23.099]  Oh, the tanks are coming to take over the Capitol.
[00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:26.099]  It's just a friendly, happy thing from back in the 90s.
[00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:28.180]  Meanwhile, Russia's threatening everybody.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:38.222]  And this is how they spin it to not divert the public from worshipping the globalist shindig known as the Olympics.
[00:39:38.222 --> 00:39:38.862]  Please continue.
[00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:43.716]  We're good to go.
[00:40:02.889 --> 00:40:07.170]  Skin Valley within the next hour or so.
[00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:17.833]  And that would obviously put them in direct confrontation with the Georgian forces that say that they have completely encircled that main city in South Ossetia.
[00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:23.435]  So a very dangerous, very dramatic development in this crisis that we're apparently now witnessing, Andrew.
[00:40:25.193 --> 00:40:28.438]  Why such a muscular response to this, Matthew?
[00:40:28.438 --> 00:40:33.367]  Because Russia does recognise Georgia's sovereign territory.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:42.923]  It does, and Russia repeatedly restates the fact that it respects Georgia's territorial integrity.
[00:40:42.923 --> 00:40:46.845]  But at the same time, it always says that it will protect Russian citizens.
[00:40:46.845 --> 00:40:59.331]  And over the course of the last decade or so, what's happened in South Ossetia is that many of the ethnic Ossetians that want independence from Georgian rule have taken the option of Russian citizenship.
[00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:01.632]  They've been fast-tracked towards Russian citizenship.
[00:41:01.952 --> 00:41:08.255]  And so now, perhaps as many as 90% of the population in South Ossetia hold Russian passports.
[00:41:08.255 --> 00:41:09.876]  It's really very much supported.
[00:41:09.876 --> 00:41:16.339]  The separatist movement, the separatist government, is very much supported by Moscow, by the Kremlin.
[00:41:16.339 --> 00:41:25.363]  And it's on that basis that the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian officials and the Kremlin say that they'll do everything they can to protect Russian citizens.
[00:41:25.363 --> 00:41:29.205]  In addition to that, as I mentioned, there are a force of Russian peacekeepers
[00:41:31.426 --> 00:41:37.969]  Okay, we've now got some audio and video of fierce fighting we're going to play for you here in a few minutes.
[00:41:37.969 --> 00:41:40.130]  While he's queuing that up, let me give you some of the background on this.
[00:42:00.004 --> 00:42:13.351]  Russia, because the population in Russia itself, in the heart of the cancer that was communism, that the European, US, and British banks funded, what, 90 plus years ago, that had run out of steam.
[00:42:13.351 --> 00:42:17.553]  Even the East German security apparatus wasn't oppressing people like they were supposed to anymore.
[00:42:17.553 --> 00:42:19.414]  They had to stage this collapse.
[00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:23.016]  They put all their hammers and sickles back on the vehicles.
[00:42:23.016 --> 00:42:27.138]  They have basically just brought in kind of a commie slash fascist
[00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:28.319]  We're good to go.
[00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:58.560]  The Anglo-American establishment, backed up by London and DC, has been moving in and aggressively pushing Russia, taking more and more of its satellites over, when it partially collapsed, that it had lost.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.103]  So there's a fight over these different sectors going on right now.
[00:43:02.103 --> 00:43:03.184]  This is an example of a
[00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:05.424]  Major flare-up!
[00:43:05.424 --> 00:43:25.696]  Let's go back to the late 90s, in the final days of the attack on Serbia, with the handover of more than one quarter, about, what, 27 percent, roughly, of Serbia to hardcore al-Qaeda groups, backed up, of course, according to government Senate reports, by the CIA and al-Qaeda.
[00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:35.063]  Going in and attacking the Serbs, it'd be like a foreign government attacking, it'd be like if Cuba attacked Texas and Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida.
[00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:41.848]  And then when federal forces came into the area, the United States and NATO, came in and bombed them, the Russians poured in en masse
[00:43:42.368 --> 00:43:43.049]  We're good to go.
[00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:13.980]  Special forces backed up by major columns of armor and aircraft, and there was a tent standoff there.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.104]  And so now we're seeing fierce fighting flare up.
[00:44:17.104 --> 00:44:20.588]  Jason, go ahead and play that newest clip for people.
[00:44:20.588 --> 00:44:20.929]  Here it is.
[00:44:33.584 --> 00:44:38.807]  We're seeing images of a car driving through a city as artillery detonates and explodes.
[00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:40.428]  Missile launchers, tanks.
[00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:43.629]  Just, oh my God, it looks like hundreds of tanks.
[00:44:43.629 --> 00:44:54.335]  The Russians always love their propelled, self-propelled missile platforms that have the scores of missiles in them.
[00:44:54.335 --> 00:44:55.595]  Just unbelievable.
[00:44:55.595 --> 00:44:57.396]  Massive Russian invasion.
[00:44:57.396 --> 00:45:02.439]  This looks like scenes of World War II that we're seeing here on the screen right now.
[00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:09.334]  We're posting all of this on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:24.981]  Just massive, massive columns of Russian armor, artillery, self-propelled anti-personnel and anti-armor missile platforms.
[00:45:24.981 --> 00:45:25.481]  Again, this is
[00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:41.969]  Not only is it hardcore, but I want to reiterate that this is not the Russian military invading another army.
[00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:43.450]  They're attacking civilians.
[00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:44.910]  There's no army to fight here.
[00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.892]  They're literally going there to take over a territory and they're attacking civilians.
[00:45:48.582 --> 00:45:49.542]  Civilian villages!
[00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:50.382]  This is unbelievable!
[00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:53.463]  Well, that was one blurb in the CNN piece.
[00:45:53.463 --> 00:46:03.364]  They're talking about civilians that have been in revolution against each other in a struggle by the pro-Russian forces in that province against the mainline Georgians.
[00:46:03.364 --> 00:46:04.665]  So it's similar.
[00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:12.126]  States always use minority groups in regions to export larger crises that can bring down a government.
[00:46:12.126 --> 00:46:18.007]  So what you have is, you have two different sides fighting, kind of like two dogs with a tug-of-war,
[00:46:18.927 --> 00:46:29.513]  And this is escalating, but they did report there are Georgian government forces that came in to surround the breakaway sector that borders Russia.
[00:46:29.513 --> 00:46:41.420]  And so basically you have Russian forces going in to back up rebels in the ethnic minority area that see themselves as Russian, as you heard, 90 plus percent holding Russian passports.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.242]  So it's very similar to what you saw with the Kosovo.
[00:46:44.893 --> 00:46:46.354]  Uh, situation where the U.S.
[00:46:46.354 --> 00:46:53.858]  went in and used Islamicist out of the Leninist state of Albania to attack.
[00:46:53.858 --> 00:46:54.498]  Again, the U.S.
[00:46:54.498 --> 00:46:59.640]  using communists to go after free marketeers who were setting up their own wonderland.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.922]  I mean, Serbia was becoming a first world nation.
[00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:03.082]  People were vacationing there.
[00:47:03.082 --> 00:47:04.583]  They were building up their own industries.
[00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:05.844]  That had to be destroyed.
[00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:07.564]  So don't think this is the U.S.
[00:47:07.564 --> 00:47:08.685]  and then they're fighting communists.
[00:47:09.185 --> 00:47:10.626]  This is the exact opposite of that.
[00:47:10.626 --> 00:47:12.066]  Both sides are evil.
[00:47:12.066 --> 00:47:12.887]  That's how it works.
[00:47:12.887 --> 00:47:14.887]  See, they train us that one side's good, one side's bad.
[00:47:14.887 --> 00:47:15.468]  No.
[00:47:15.468 --> 00:47:20.210]  Just like the Bible says, almost all governments are completely and totally wicked.
[00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.131]  Here's some of the other news we have coming in for those that don't know.
[00:47:24.131 --> 00:47:24.912]  Masses.
[00:47:24.912 --> 00:47:26.572]  I mean, Burmese, we're here watching this video.
[00:47:26.572 --> 00:47:34.596]  How many missile launchers, how many artillery, self-propelled artillery systems, how many tanks were we seeing just from those video clips?
[00:47:34.596 --> 00:47:35.516]  It looked like hundreds.
[00:47:35.516 --> 00:47:38.057]  Yeah, I mean, missile launchers alone in the
[00:47:38.658 --> 00:47:40.861]  Five seconds they were on the screen, you saw a couple dozen.
[00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:41.421]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:41.421 --> 00:47:43.344]  Well, just endless hills of them.
[00:47:43.344 --> 00:47:45.687]  It showed a field going away with just scores of them.
[00:47:45.687 --> 00:47:46.087]  Yeah, it did.
[00:47:46.087 --> 00:47:49.131]  And it cut to masses of armored columns of tanks going in.
[00:47:49.873 --> 00:47:52.294]  And it doesn't look like they're covering it right on the ground there either.
[00:47:52.294 --> 00:47:56.216]  Other than these tanks coming in, all you're seeing are these huge plumes of smoke when they launch.
[00:47:56.216 --> 00:47:57.016]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:47:57.016 --> 00:47:58.297]  You've got two different video feeds.
[00:47:58.297 --> 00:48:03.839]  They're showing one from inside Georgia, what looks like about four to five miles away.
[00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.260]  Huge plumes on the horizon.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:11.503]  I mean, these are gigantic plumes because they're many miles away and these things are filling half the screen.
[00:48:11.503 --> 00:48:16.925]  Then you have Western reporters that are on the Russian side watching the armored columns go in.
[00:48:17.225 --> 00:48:21.087]  Yeah, and the timing... So those Russian forces are just pouring into Georgia.
[00:48:21.087 --> 00:48:22.908]  This looks like a major invasion.
[00:48:22.908 --> 00:48:25.689]  Yeah, and the timing is very, very suspect to me.
[00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:37.535]  This is a time when we're talking about possibly invading Pakistan, or that Musharraf may be overthrown, and all of a sudden they're the enemy, and I've heard a lot of talk that Russia and Pakistan may form an alliance against us in this next World War III.
[00:48:37.535 --> 00:48:41.697]  I know there's a few people on the horizon that have been talking about that, and I didn't really think that was possible.
[00:48:41.697 --> 00:48:43.378]  Do you think that's going to be a possibility right now?
[00:48:44.409 --> 00:48:47.330]  This is all just completely amazing.
[00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.651]  Caucuses in crisis.
[00:48:48.651 --> 00:48:50.472]  Georgia invades rebel region.
[00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:51.672]  London Telegraph.
[00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:58.615]  The caucuses have descended into a crisis after Georgian troops launched a full-scale military assault against Moscow-backed rebels.
[00:48:58.615 --> 00:48:59.976]  I had a feeling I had to come in this morning.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:01.497]  I was like, you got all this work to do.
[00:49:01.497 --> 00:49:02.857]  Why are you going into that office?
[00:49:02.857 --> 00:49:06.339]  I'm like, listen, I just gotta go in there and make sure everything goes off good with Burmese.
[00:49:06.339 --> 00:49:07.439]  I had a feeling.
[00:49:07.439 --> 00:49:09.460]  I've never really come in here and taken over when you've been on before.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.081]  No.
[00:49:10.081 --> 00:49:11.621]  And here we are, 888.
[00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:13.202]  Man, the globalists love weird dates.
[00:49:14.392 --> 00:49:26.217]  The Caucasus have descended into crisis after Georgian troops launched a full-scale military assault against Moscow-backed rebels in an attempt to wrest control of the breakaway region of south.
[00:49:26.217 --> 00:49:35.121]  And it goes on, Georgian military commanders confirmed that invasion began in the early hours of Friday morning, raising fears of a serious diplomatic crisis.
[00:49:35.121 --> 00:49:35.661]  Diplomatic?
[00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:36.882]  This is military!
[00:49:36.882 --> 00:49:39.243]  Between the country's western allies and Moscow.
[00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:41.444]  The United States swiftly called for calm, but appeared
[00:49:42.219 --> 00:49:49.643]  To apportion more blame on Moscow and the separatist forces it supports for taking the volatile region of the brink of war.
[00:49:49.643 --> 00:50:09.755]  You got all these arrogant globalists up there, and all these chicken hawks, and all these know-it-alls, and all these old, you know, men who've had six heart attacks just bumbling around loving power and death, and now they're hurtling us toward, because all the experts, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, Bob Chapman, you've got on The Last Hour today, all of these people, Jason,
[00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:11.572]  Ray McGovern.
[00:50:11.572 --> 00:50:17.598]  They're all saying that the real plan, the PNAC plan says this, is the stirruple war with Russia.
[00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:21.041]  And now it's starting to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:23.904]  And we pray to God that this de-escalates quickly.
[00:50:23.904 --> 00:50:26.266]  But you notice this is all happening right on the eve.
[00:50:26.266 --> 00:50:28.488]  Jerusalem Post reported last night.
[00:50:28.488 --> 00:50:31.731]  I was on Coast to Coast AM covering some of this.
[00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.313]  Ladies and gentlemen, they reported
[00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:39.922]  That two more carrier groups are going into the Gulf, and that basically the attack is on on Iran.
[00:50:39.922 --> 00:50:54.430]  Folks, this is how World Wars start all of... I mean, this is like on a spring day when there's hurricane weather in Texas or Oklahoma or Kansas, and you start seeing the funnel clouds and the hot and cold air coming together.
[00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.291]  Perfect storm, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:56.291 --> 00:50:57.392]  We'll be here covering it.
[00:50:57.392 --> 00:50:58.873]  Remember, your liberties are the target.
[00:51:00.874 --> 00:51:02.156]  Why should we fire Congress?
[00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:05.781]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:08.084]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[00:51:08.084 --> 00:51:10.908]  That was their employment document.
[00:51:10.908 --> 00:51:11.969]  They haven't followed it.
[00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:13.872]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[00:51:13.872 --> 00:51:15.775]  Washington, you're fired!
[00:51:15.775 --> 00:51:17.277]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[00:51:17.757 --> 00:51:18.397]  We're good to go.
[00:51:32.585 --> 00:51:32.865]  I'm good.
[00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:07.846]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:52:07.846 --> 00:52:14.410]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:23.437]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.
[00:52:23.857 --> 00:52:31.043]  FPP or Fossilized Phytoplankton Powder is a 100% natural organic product with absolutely no additives.
[00:52:31.043 --> 00:52:36.327]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[00:52:36.327 --> 00:52:39.330]  Many believe it is the key to a healthy digestive tract.
[00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:49.478]  To find an FPP distributor near you or to buy it now, online, go to www.freshwaterorganics.com.
[00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:57.985]  You can also call toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:52:57.985 --> 00:53:00.607]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:53:00.607 --> 00:53:06.331]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:53:06.331 --> 00:53:07.652]  And we knew what to do.
[00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:09.654]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:53:09.654 --> 00:53:16.679]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:17.060]  Whitman.
[00:53:18.357 --> 00:53:25.580]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:32.662]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:53:32.662 --> 00:53:35.843]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:53:35.843 --> 00:53:41.625]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:53:41.625 --> 00:53:44.206]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:53:44.686 --> 00:53:50.751]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:53.653]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:53:53.653 --> 00:54:00.718]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:54:00.718 --> 00:54:03.840]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:54:12.728 --> 00:54:16.509]  Many a young maid Many a soldier But I'm still alive I was a sailor
[00:54:46.418 --> 00:54:47.559]  Caucus in crisis.
[00:54:47.559 --> 00:54:51.861]  Georgia invaded by Russians.
[00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:54.703]  Just incredible armored columns pouring in.
[00:54:54.703 --> 00:54:56.464]  Infantry pouring in.
[00:54:56.464 --> 00:54:57.764]  Infantry trucks pouring in.
[00:54:57.764 --> 00:54:59.485]  This is a major invasion.
[00:54:59.485 --> 00:55:00.946]  That's how it works.
[00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:08.377]  You've got major powers, the Army's lineup.
[00:55:08.377 --> 00:55:13.958]  This has every making of something that could easily descend into a major world war.
[00:55:13.958 --> 00:55:17.400]  That's not Alex Jones, that's every analyst we talk to.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:24.082]  Let's let this roll out to the end, then I'm gonna go over it all with you here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:24.082 --> 00:55:28.183]  Alex Jones, sitting in for Burmese, is sitting in for me.
[00:55:28.183 --> 00:55:29.284]  Stay with us.
[00:55:34.768 --> 00:55:40.572]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[00:55:40.572 --> 00:55:45.715]  They buried me in that grey tent that knows no sound.
[00:55:45.715 --> 00:55:48.496]  But I'm still around.
[00:55:48.496 --> 00:55:54.400]  I'll always be around, around, around, around, around.
[00:56:04.426 --> 00:56:25.087]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide And when I reach the other side I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
[00:56:38.502 --> 00:56:40.423]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:40.423 --> 00:56:44.585]  Georgia under attack as Russian tanks roll in.
[00:56:44.585 --> 00:56:45.765]  That's the new headline.
[00:56:45.765 --> 00:56:47.946]  Things are heating up fast.
[00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:50.428]  On the day the Olympics start, 8-8-8.
[00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:52.409]  This is hardcore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:54.049]  This has all the makings.
[00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:58.872]  I've got a bad feeling of what this is going to lead to in the next days, weeks, and months.
[00:56:58.872 --> 00:57:01.373]  Georgia under attack as Russian tanks roll in.
[00:57:01.373 --> 00:57:05.215]  We continue to tell you with all the top experts we bring you, the historians,
[00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:14.495]  That the plan is to escalate all sorts of different regional conflicts throughout Eurasia.
[00:57:14.495 --> 00:57:19.357]  As Zbigniew Brzezinski always said, this is where World War III will start.
[00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:21.358]  Now, this may de-escalate.
[00:57:21.358 --> 00:57:25.680]  Same thing happened in the late 90s with the Pristina situation in Kosovo.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.002]  The Russians let that be handed over to the Muslims.
[00:57:29.002 --> 00:57:30.642]  They did not let the U.S.
[00:57:30.642 --> 00:57:33.844]  with its Muslim backers take over Chechnya.
[00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:38.735]  No, they are not letting them take over Georgia and a bunch of other areas.
[00:57:38.735 --> 00:57:40.516]  And it is getting really serious.
[00:57:40.516 --> 00:57:43.377]  The Russian troops are just pouring in.
[00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:45.538]  Now it's being called Russian attack.
[00:57:45.538 --> 00:57:48.039]  Georgia under attack by Russia.
[00:57:48.039 --> 00:57:49.119]  Now that's your headlines.
[00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:52.160]  I mean, notice how this is changing fast.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.801]  I mean, it is getting wild here.
[00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:57.462]  Yeah, it's going to change fast because this looks like an all-out invasion.
[00:57:58.092 --> 00:58:01.535]  And meanwhile, on the other side of the world... There's no looks about it.
[00:58:01.535 --> 00:58:08.661]  They've got a major Russian army already clashing with the Georgian military and it looks like ballin' 11 daylights out of them.
[00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:12.885]  And this is all taking place when the international community is preoccupied with the Olympics.
[00:58:12.885 --> 00:58:24.415]  Meanwhile, Iraqi officials are saying that there's a deal that's close, that we're going to start getting out of Iraq by 2010, but then the supposition is, well, the last of the troops will be out three years later.
[00:58:24.975 --> 00:58:25.495]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:53.815 --> 00:58:55.595]  A New World Order!
[00:58:55.595 --> 00:59:00.677]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:59:00.677 --> 00:59:03.317]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:03.317 --> 00:59:06.098]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:06.098 --> 00:59:09.278]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:09.278 --> 00:59:16.600]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:25.075]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:25.075 --> 00:59:28.939]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:28.939 --> 00:59:31.501]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.682]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:32.682 --> 00:59:33.462]  They're not after money.
[00:59:33.462 --> 00:59:34.743]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:34.743 --> 00:59:35.724]  They're after power.
[00:59:35.724 --> 00:59:36.885]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:59:36.885 --> 00:59:41.629]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:59:41.629 --> 00:59:45.592]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:45.592 --> 00:59:46.373]  Endgame.
[00:59:46.373 --> 00:59:47.874]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:48.374 --> 00:59:53.459]  You have been warned.
[00:59:53.459 --> 00:59:55.861]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.861 --> 00:59:58.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:10.090]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.670]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.231]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:17.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:21.974]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.974 --> 01:00:29.177]  Jason, we're moving offices this week, but I am leaving this studio here while the other one's being completed.
[01:00:30.305 --> 01:00:32.628]  And so I had you sitting in today and Sunday.
[01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:42.157]  I'm going to have you ride shotgun with me now both days, but there's no rest for, I guess, those that love liberty or the wicked, because the wicked never rest in their devilish activities.
[01:00:42.157 --> 01:00:45.981]  So I'll be here now today and Sunday, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:52.288]  In fact, if the war intensifies, I will be doing InfoWars.com live shows tomorrow.
[01:00:52.995 --> 01:00:54.978]  That matter if I have family coming into town tomorrow?
[01:00:54.978 --> 01:01:00.324]  No, I'm not going to sit there and eat barbecue while World War III cranks up.
[01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:04.810]  I will be here live tomorrow with a special internet transmission all day long.
[01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:06.612]  You guys were finishing the film today.
[01:01:06.612 --> 01:01:08.355]  You had one more little file that you had to fix.
[01:01:09.356 --> 01:01:11.417]  In fact, I'm going to let you step out.
[01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:24.007]  Burmese is actually trying to beg off right now, so you can go in there and finish up with the DVD, Master, that's coming to double-check all our files and send it to be mass-produced so we get it in two weeks to start selling Fabled Enemies.
[01:01:24.007 --> 01:01:29.912]  For those that don't know, Georgia under attack as Russian tanks roll in.
[01:01:29.912 --> 01:01:33.295]  And you can say, well, that's just Russia fighting with one of its breakaway republics.
[01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:38.219]  The problem is, I just read to you at the Times of London, Reuters, and others, where the Russian foreign minister
[01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:58.955]  Three months ago, and then again on July 6th, threatened military action against the United States and Western Europe for moving troops in, funding rebel groups, funding destabilization, funding overthrows of governments, financing counter-revolutions, financing elections to overthrow governments.
[01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:10.039]  And meanwhile, you have the United States encircling Russia and China, moving into Central Asia, Afghanistan, sending in special forces troops for five years to stage terror attacks inside Iran.
[01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:14.641]  There are a hundred things going on right now on 888.
[01:02:14.641 --> 01:02:20.924]  As the Olympics launch today, I want to go ahead... Burmese, hand me that atomic clock, I can't see it.
[01:02:20.924 --> 01:02:22.324]  Thank you.
[01:02:22.324 --> 01:02:25.385]  I'm gonna go ahead and play the Georgian president.
[01:02:28.374 --> 01:02:29.955]  Shaka's Vazili.
[01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.017]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:02:32.017 --> 01:02:32.558]  Here we go.
[01:02:32.558 --> 01:02:33.819]  This is the U.S.
[01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:34.279]  puppet.
[01:02:34.279 --> 01:02:39.023]  When I say U.S., I mean occupied, globalist, occupied U.S.
[01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:40.664]  Here he is.
[01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:43.647]  Mikhail Shaka-Zhavil.
[01:02:43.647 --> 01:02:43.947]  Here we go.
[01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:48.556]  Georgia is under attack from its neighbor Russia.
[01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:58.260]  Russia has been putting us under artillery barrage and just moving its armored vehicles into Georgia.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.721]  Basically started to move them yesterday.
[01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.542]  That's why the whole thing in first place erupted.
[01:03:03.542 --> 01:03:09.364]  And the whole day today they've been bombing Georgia from numerous warplanes.
[01:03:09.904 --> 01:03:13.387]  To put it plainly, sir, is your tiny country at war now with Russia?
[01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:42.010]  Well, my country is in self-defense against Russian aggression.
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.910]  Russian troops invaded Georgia.
[01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:52.333]  Russian troops are fighting against Georgian self-defense troops and Russia is bombing Georgia.
[01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:56.274]  Now, this is the worst nightmare one can encounter.
[01:03:56.274 --> 01:04:00.455]  Are you in any communication with Russian authorities or with Vladimir Putin?
[01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:14.743]  No, they've been basically preferring to talk with us with menaces and black men since last few days, as well as for since last months and years.
[01:04:14.743 --> 01:04:21.867]  You know, these troops that are in Georgia now, they didn't come unexpectedly.
[01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:27.630]  Those troops were a massive by the border, have been a massive at the border for the last three or four months.
[01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.091]  They were claiming that they were staging
[01:04:29.671 --> 01:04:32.632]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is just incredible.
[01:04:32.632 --> 01:04:36.413]  We're looking at Fox News, ABC, everybody else.
[01:04:36.413 --> 01:04:40.274]  They'll have one little blurb at the bottom of the page and nothing about this.
[01:04:40.274 --> 01:04:45.856]  And I'm looking at video of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tanks pouring in.
[01:04:45.856 --> 01:04:48.137]  This is a massive invasion.
[01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:57.860]  This follows threats by Russia against the crime syndicate that runs our country to stop meddling in their affairs and encircling them.
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.060]  We'll be right back with the latest.
[01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:09.967]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[01:05:09.967 --> 01:05:14.009]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:18.052]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[01:05:18.052 --> 01:05:27.377]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[01:05:27.995 --> 01:05:32.518]  Get on the web at efoodsdirect.com and find a two-month grab-and-go kit.
[01:05:32.518 --> 01:05:37.381]  This easy fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day.
[01:05:37.381 --> 01:05:38.102]  The cost?
[01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:39.783]  About five dollars a day.
[01:05:39.783 --> 01:05:47.268]  efoodsdirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[01:05:47.268 --> 01:05:47.508]  Call 800-409-5633.

[01:05:55.513 --> 01:05:55.974]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:55.974 --> 01:06:01.777]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:05.540]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.841]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:09.402]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:06:09.402 --> 01:06:11.063]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:06:11.063 --> 01:06:13.965]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:06:13.965 --> 01:06:17.588]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:06:27.252 --> 01:06:32.068]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:06:39.989 --> 01:06:43.591]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:06:43.591 --> 01:06:46.313]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:06:46.313 --> 01:06:52.796]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:07:01.224 --> 01:07:05.725]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:10.847]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:10.847 --> 01:07:12.347]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:08.732]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.732 --> 01:08:11.714]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.982 --> 01:08:22.748]  I'm going to open the phones up here in about five, six minutes after I recap the top news that's developing minute by minute.
[01:08:22.748 --> 01:08:24.149]  We are learning more.
[01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:27.352]  Georgia under attack as Russian tanks roll in.
[01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:34.998]  That is what's being reported by CNN, the only major news network to even be giving any attention to this as of three minutes ago.
[01:08:34.998 --> 01:08:37.961]  There's a few links on some of the other news agencies.
[01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:39.222]  It's all the stupid Olympics.
[01:08:40.023 --> 01:08:50.500]  And showing us how great a police state is in China while Bush grandstands and speaks out against the police state while China learned about free speech zones from our criminal government.
[01:08:51.946 --> 01:09:10.150]  For those that don't know, Russia in the last three months has threatened nuclear weapons, has threatened the, quote, nuclear options, saying, quote, the foreign minister saying, we have nuclear weapons to protect ourselves and we will use them preemptively against Western buildup of weapons in our territories and on the borders of our territories.
[01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:13.411]  And we've been covering some of those reports for you today.
[01:09:13.411 --> 01:09:19.132]  What we have witnessed with our own eyes is hundreds of tanks, hundreds of missile
[01:09:22.088 --> 01:09:39.137]  Propel the platforms or self-propelled missile platforms with the proper term rolling in hundreds of trucks with just gigantic numbers, just huge numbers of what looks like regular Russian infantry.
[01:09:39.137 --> 01:09:48.022]  AP and CNN are both reporting that in the last few months, as you just heard the Georgian president say, there has been a buildup in quote drills
[01:09:49.526 --> 01:09:50.527]  Militaries do this.
[01:09:50.527 --> 01:09:52.989]  That's why they have urban warfare drills all over the United States.
[01:09:52.989 --> 01:09:53.849]  We've got the documents.
[01:09:53.849 --> 01:09:56.752]  We've got emergency managers and police chiefs on who were briefed about this.
[01:09:56.752 --> 01:10:01.555]  Now it's declassified, but I told you this ten years ago, or be technical, nine years ago.
[01:10:01.555 --> 01:10:08.921]  Our military has been doing long-term drills so that if they really have martial law and take over our cities, people will say, oh, well, we've seen troops do this many times.
[01:10:09.241 --> 01:10:11.543]  We're being acclimated for a takeover as well.
[01:10:11.543 --> 01:10:24.794]  Just as the Russians were building up and preparing to where the Georgian military didn't know when they actually, you know, finally were getting ready to strike because there had been months and months of massive military buildup and quote, war games and drills on their border.
[01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:30.588]  So, Russia is basically striking back.
[01:10:30.588 --> 01:10:31.970]  We're not choosing sides here.
[01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.011]  We're coldly reporting the facts.
[01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:37.574]  The crime syndicate that controls the U.S., we always have the psychology of we.
[01:10:37.574 --> 01:10:39.155]  You know, we're backing the Georgians.
[01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:45.761]  No, the criminal bankers have control of this nation, the most dominant faction, the Anglo-American faction.
[01:10:46.937 --> 01:10:55.247]  They have been overthrowing governments all over the place in the last decade, all around Russia, scores of nations.
[01:10:55.247 --> 01:10:57.329]  They've had military overthrows.
[01:10:57.329 --> 01:10:59.491]  They have had elected overthrows.
[01:10:59.491 --> 01:11:01.574]  They have had sabotage.
[01:11:01.574 --> 01:11:03.596]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:11:03.596 --> 01:11:04.737]  Russia has now been
[01:11:05.658 --> 01:11:07.620]  Pushed back into military stance.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.061]  They have built back up.
[01:11:09.061 --> 01:11:10.803]  Putin, of course, is the prime minister.
[01:11:10.803 --> 01:11:14.526]  He has his puppet as the new president over there.
[01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:23.273]  Now, the Russian military has been gearing up for the last decade, the last, well now, eight years since Putin got into 99.
[01:11:23.273 --> 01:11:25.435]  Massive military buildup.
[01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:29.886]  I want to finish up with what the Georgian president is saying.
[01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:38.074]  We just left off with him when he was talking about how this was preceded by drills and then a sneak attack.
[01:11:38.074 --> 01:11:44.561]  Kind of like Hitler doing drills on the border with Poland and Russia and then the sneak attack with Operation Baba Rosa.
[01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:44.942]  Here we go.
[01:11:48.143 --> 01:11:51.551]  Soon as a suitable pretext was found yesterday, they moved in.
[01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:58.267]  But, you know, it was meant to be this way as we found out all the way through and they didn't hide very much that.
[01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:11.478]  And let me just add, they did this on the Olympics day because they know the globalists are using the Olympics as this image of world government, this image of it being unity under the control of the globalists.
[01:12:23.727 --> 01:12:28.848]  This Hitlerian image, you know, he drew the rings, he designed the Olympics, he designed the torch, all of it.
[01:12:28.848 --> 01:12:30.608]  Look it up, it's in the encyclopedia.
[01:12:30.608 --> 01:12:33.409]  They know this is a high holy day for the globalists.
[01:12:33.409 --> 01:12:35.510]  Starting at 8, oh, 8 a.m.
[01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:38.530]  and 8 seconds, 888, on 888.
[01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:42.591]  Lighting the torch, doing all of this.
[01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:48.692]  And then meanwhile, we see this launched on this date, knowing that the media would basically cover it up.
[01:12:48.692 --> 01:12:51.913]  This is unprecedented and unparalleled
[01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:56.729]  I agree with the Georgian President on that.
[01:12:56.729 --> 01:13:08.298]  Russia invaded Afghanistan in the Soviet Union, invaded Afghanistan in 1979, or the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 with its tanks on Hungary in 1956.
[01:13:08.298 --> 01:13:15.084]  Nothing like that has happened in the post-Cold War world, and that's certainly very, very troubling.
[01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:20.389]  Your government has had very close relations, forgive me, your government has had very close relations with NATO,
[01:13:21.338 --> 01:13:23.059]  Are you in contact with NATO authorities?
[01:13:23.059 --> 01:13:28.763]  Are you making any appeal to outside nations to intervene?
[01:13:28.763 --> 01:13:38.610]  I spoke yesterday with Secretary General of NATO before Russians got involved because we already felt that heat was going up.
[01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:42.833]  You know, separatists that operate in Georgia that are not independence fighters.
[01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:44.454]  They claim to be part of Russia.
[01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:49.518]  This is a small enclave where population is less than 30,000 people in the middle of Georgia.
[01:13:49.718 --> 01:13:51.399]  They're going to use the Mexicans for this here.
[01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:52.620]  You better believe that's going to happen.
[01:14:19.758 --> 01:14:20.878]  To do this.
[01:14:20.878 --> 01:14:24.059]  And I feel so sorry for Mexican-Americans who are going to be in the middle of all of this.
[01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:27.379]  I just wanted to add that historical caveat.
[01:14:27.379 --> 01:14:29.860]  So, this whole situation was abnormal.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.141]  A small, tiny part of the country claiming to be part of another state.
[01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:43.142]  But the point was that when temperature went up, I phoned Secretary General of NATO to express my concern and ask for his mediation.
[01:14:43.142 --> 01:14:47.123]  Now, unfortunately, the whole thing has erupted before he had time to react.
[01:14:49.324 --> 01:15:06.211]  I spoke with him today again but it's not only about NATO you know certain Russians have been irritated by our contacts with NATO but President Putin in the past and now Prime Minister Putin has many times told me that he it's totally unacceptable for him and not only my close relations with the United States and the
[01:15:07.805 --> 01:15:09.287]  What should the West and the United States do now?
[01:15:27.558 --> 01:15:30.280]  It's about the basic values the West has.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.122]  The basic values the U.S.
[01:15:32.122 --> 01:15:33.483]  has always preached us.
[01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:41.169]  You know, we are a small country, but we are attacked because we wanted to be free.
[01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.730]  We are attacked because we wanted to build genuine democracy.
[01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:46.973]  We are attacked because we built a non-corrupt free enterprise.
[01:15:46.973 --> 01:15:48.914]  Okay, let's comment on that again.
[01:15:48.914 --> 01:15:50.055]  Both sides are corrupt.
[01:15:50.055 --> 01:15:51.136]  Both sides are criminal.
[01:15:51.136 --> 01:15:52.337]  That's the new world order system.
[01:15:52.337 --> 01:15:53.358]  But let's talk about the facts.
[01:15:54.244 --> 01:15:59.486]  Weapons systems by the United States and NATO have been moved into Georgia.
[01:15:59.486 --> 01:16:05.447]  They've been moved into Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic, into Ukraine and into several other nations.
[01:16:05.447 --> 01:16:10.509]  And the Russians have said, stop moving high-tech weapons systems into our nations.
[01:16:10.509 --> 01:16:13.230]  And it has come out... In fact, Aaron, I need your help.
[01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:14.490]  Aaron's doing five jobs.
[01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:15.911]  I don't have the personnel.
[01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:18.611]  He's in there finishing up DVD authoring.
[01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:22.633]  Will you... I know Ken's here, but will you... I'll Google it during the break.
[01:16:22.633 --> 01:16:23.213]  It doesn't matter.
[01:16:23.213 --> 01:16:23.793]  I have the proof.
[01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:25.675]  Go work on what you're doing, actually.
[01:16:25.675 --> 01:16:26.416]  You're too busy on that.
[01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:28.398]  We gotta finish this right now.
[01:16:28.398 --> 01:16:31.060]  Uh, I remember a report about four months ago.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.741]  I got Jason.
[01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:33.182]  Jason, Google this.
[01:16:33.182 --> 01:16:33.442]  U.S.
[01:16:33.442 --> 01:16:34.864]  Special Forces in Georgia.
[01:16:34.864 --> 01:16:35.424]  Google that.
[01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.266]  Okay?
[01:16:37.266 --> 01:16:39.328]  I trust my memory, but I always verify my memory.
[01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:45.830]  I know there are at least six breakaway republics around Russia, but you found it.
[01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:46.370]  You found it.
[01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:47.391]  Instantly.
[01:16:47.391 --> 01:16:47.611]  U.S.
[01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:52.393]  military advisors arrive in Georgia, BBC, February 27, 2002.
[01:16:52.393 --> 01:16:58.896]  Okay, the one I'm looking for is from about four months ago, where I believe the number was 8,000 U.S.
[01:16:58.896 --> 01:17:07.960]  Special Forces arrived, but just under that basic search of... What search did you do?
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.701]  What search did I tell you?
[01:17:10.655 --> 01:17:11.095]  Yeah, U.S.
[01:17:11.095 --> 01:17:13.416]  Special Forces in Georgia.
[01:17:13.416 --> 01:17:17.237]  Under that same search, just give me some of the other links.
[01:17:17.237 --> 01:17:18.638]  Because I want the build-up number.
[01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:19.318]  I want the number.
[01:17:19.318 --> 01:17:20.759]  I believe it was 10,000.
[01:17:20.759 --> 01:17:22.639]  And this was in the past six months?
[01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:23.139]  Yeah.
[01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:23.900]  Wait, hold on.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.240]  Hold on.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:25.560]  It was 9,000.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.702]  It was more than 9,000 crips was the amount.
[01:17:29.702 --> 01:17:30.442]  Get it?
[01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:31.042]  Okay, you know what?
[01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:33.623]  Let's just double check that for everybody out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:33.623 --> 01:17:35.824]  You're getting full-spectrum analysis of what's happening.
[01:17:36.773 --> 01:17:40.197]  Speaking of that, let me tell you right now that, again, U.S.
[01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:43.940]  forces are there probably battling Russians right now.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.421]  More U.S.
[01:17:44.421 --> 01:17:54.171]  Special Forces to aid fight against insurgents, Tuesday, November 20, 2007, and that is in Georgia, quote, fighting insurgents.
[01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:54.291]  Now,
[01:17:55.299 --> 01:17:56.821]  No, no, that's the long headline.
[01:17:56.821 --> 01:17:58.023]  That's out of Afghanistan.
[01:17:58.023 --> 01:17:58.563]  Okay.
[01:17:58.563 --> 01:18:00.486]  Okay, no, it's in Georgia.
[01:18:00.486 --> 01:18:01.267]  It's like the BBC.
[01:18:01.267 --> 01:18:01.707]  You know what?
[01:18:01.707 --> 01:18:03.390]  Read me the BBC right now.
[01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:05.152]  Read that for everybody out there listening.
[01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:06.754]  The 2002 BBC one we just had?
[01:18:06.754 --> 01:18:07.755]  Yeah, go ahead and read that one.
[01:18:07.755 --> 01:18:08.336]  That's the latest.
[01:18:08.336 --> 01:18:10.699]  I'll find the one I'm talking about during the break.
[01:18:10.699 --> 01:18:11.140]  You got it.
[01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:13.122]  All right, five U.S.
[01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:16.365]  military advisors have arrived in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia.
[01:18:16.365 --> 01:18:19.348]  See, five, that's how they tell you, but it's thousands of us.
[01:18:19.348 --> 01:18:22.251]  In what is being seen as a possible new front for the U.S.
[01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:26.876]  war on terror, and this is way, way back in the day when we were all still culled by fear.
[01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:28.818]  We're just like, oh, the war on terror!
[01:18:29.398 --> 01:18:30.539]  At least, uh, U.S.
[01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.901]  6 helicopters have also been sent, and the unconfirmed U.S.
[01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:38.265]  media reports say up to 200 special forces may be deployed.
[01:18:38.265 --> 01:18:39.946]  No, no, it's just 9,000 now.
[01:18:39.946 --> 01:18:41.007]  And this is way back then.
[01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:41.367]  The U.S.
[01:18:41.367 --> 01:18:46.611]  is stepping in because of reports that fighters allied with, of course, Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network.
[01:18:46.611 --> 01:18:53.656]  Meanwhile, they really used Al Qaeda to attack the Russians in Serbia, which is always, you know, they're brothers, and the Russians had to go in and fight Al Qaeda.
[01:18:53.656 --> 01:18:54.737]  Didn't that come out in 03?
[01:18:54.737 --> 01:18:55.397]  Yeah.
[01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.578]  No, no, that came out at the time.
[01:18:56.838 --> 01:18:58.619]  Oh, it was in 0-2, it came out like right after.
[01:18:58.619 --> 01:19:00.219]  No, no, no, I'm going back to Serbia.
[01:19:00.219 --> 01:19:00.800]  Oh, okay.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.221]  The point is how asinine this is that Russia is Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:05.702]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:19:05.702 --> 01:19:07.382]  President George W. Bush defended U.S.
[01:19:07.382 --> 01:19:14.625]  military plans after Russia, which has traditionally regarded Georgia as part of its sphere of influence, had criticized the U.S.
[01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:15.506]  involvement.
[01:19:15.506 --> 01:19:22.609]  As long as there is Al-Qaeda influence anywhere, we will help the host countries route them and bring them to justice, Mr. Bush said.
[01:19:22.609 --> 01:19:23.469]  This is a new front.
[01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:26.136]  That's how dumb they think the American people are.
[01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.756]  Nothing to do with Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:27.756 --> 01:19:28.336]  The U.S.
[01:19:28.336 --> 01:19:32.918]  clearly using Al-Qaeda against Russian territories and Russian satellites.
[01:19:32.918 --> 01:19:38.940]  And then they have the nerve, just like they say Iran is Al-Qaeda, when they're Shiite, the opposite group, the archenemy of Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.820]  Well, most people can't fight on a map.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:40.620]  Let me get this straight.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.940]  Exactly.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.201]  Let's get this straight.
[01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:43.981]  Al-Qaeda comes from Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:43.981 --> 01:19:44.682]  They're Sunni.
[01:19:44.682 --> 01:19:46.322]  The majority Muslim group, 80%.
[01:19:46.322 --> 01:19:46.922]  82.
[01:19:46.922 --> 01:19:48.763]  You want to get technical.
[01:19:48.763 --> 01:19:49.083]  Okay?
[01:19:49.989 --> 01:19:51.150]  This is ridiculous.
[01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:52.771]  Russia is not Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:58.536]  They've been fighting U.S.-backed Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and in Chechnya, and in Georgia.
[01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:05.427]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:05.427 --> 01:20:18.118]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:18.118 --> 01:20:18.578]  The U.S.
[01:20:18.578 --> 01:20:24.103]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:27.524]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:27.524 --> 01:20:29.745]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:29.745 --> 01:20:32.686]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:32.686 --> 01:20:39.128]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:39.128 --> 01:20:42.570]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:48.892]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:49.452 --> 01:20:53.598]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:53.798]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.798 --> 01:20:53.998]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.735 --> 01:21:05.376]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:05.376 --> 01:21:10.398]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:15.880]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:26.364]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:26.864 --> 01:21:31.268]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:31.268 --> 01:21:34.051]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:37.614]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:37.614 --> 01:21:50.126]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:24:05.848 --> 01:24:09.490]  Here is a boil down, a recap of exactly what we know right now.
[01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:15.812]  Approximately, I hurt myself
[01:24:16.878 --> 01:24:28.429]  An hour and a half ago, hundreds of Russian tanks, tens of thousands of troops poured into Georgia.
[01:24:28.429 --> 01:24:35.676]  There is a battle over one of the major cities there between Georgian forces and the Russian military.
[01:24:36.584 --> 01:24:37.505]  We're good to go.
[01:24:53.907 --> 01:24:54.508]  We're good.
[01:25:11.838 --> 01:25:22.286]  conventional armored columns of tanks, self-propelled missile platforms, anti-personnel missile platforms, anti-armor missile platforms.
[01:25:22.286 --> 01:25:25.789]  I'm now seeing some video of some helicopters.
[01:25:25.789 --> 01:25:31.713]  This is just amazing that this is going on and we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg.
[01:25:31.713 --> 01:25:32.694]  The
[01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:40.636]  Georgian president is begging for help and asking why this isn't getting any attention.
[01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:56.981]  Just geopolitically, if Russia is allowed to do this, and I'm not calling for military action against them, I'm just stating the facts, this will embolden them, this is a test, a major trial balloon, to invade areas of Czechoslovakia they have threatened to attack, areas of the Ukraine.
[01:25:56.981 --> 01:26:01.743]  I've got to pull up from memory and from online, all the other places, I know it's more than
[01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:03.697]  What is it?
[01:26:03.697 --> 01:26:07.380]  It's close to 10 different regions and countries and sectors.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:12.164]  There's a whole bunch of nations, there's scores of them all around Russia that they are threatening to invade.
[01:26:12.164 --> 01:26:14.426]  Some of the Stans they're threatening to invade.
[01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:20.431]  They've even been shooting their mouth off about going into areas just north of Afghanistan.
[01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:25.153]  Russian troops have been building up again around Afghanistan.
[01:26:25.153 --> 01:26:29.515]  They've been reportedly talking about alliances with Pakistan if the United States attacks.
[01:26:29.515 --> 01:26:32.196]  The United States has given nukes to Pakistan.
[01:26:32.196 --> 01:26:33.656]  This is the New World Order, folks.
[01:26:33.656 --> 01:26:43.680]  They hand out nukes to everybody, hand out weapons, fund every Muslim Al-Qaeda group you can imagine to attack Russia, and then they get on the news and say, oh, we've sent U.S.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:49.121]  Special Forces into Georgia in the last six years, seven years now.
[01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.502]  It's about six and a half to be technical.
[01:26:51.355 --> 01:26:52.757]  Uh, to quote, fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:52.757 --> 01:27:05.349]  This is such a sick joke when they used Al-Qaeda against the Serbs, when they used them against the Russians in Afghanistan, when they used them against the Russians, uh, in Chechnya, and I'm not choosing sides.
[01:27:05.349 --> 01:27:11.215]  I'm repor- See, most of you out there, especially neocons and liberals, you look at things through your political perspective.
[01:27:11.215 --> 01:27:13.196]  I'm just coldly reporting the facts here.
[01:27:13.196 --> 01:27:14.778]  Now, this is gonna make oil explode.
[01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:16.680]  We're going to watch and see.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.240]  This is going to make oil go up.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:26.325]  You are probably going to see other true separatist groups, terrorist groups, make moves now, today, or tomorrow, while this is happening.
[01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:27.466]  That's how World Wars start.
[01:27:27.466 --> 01:27:29.467]  Everybody starts making their moves.
[01:27:29.467 --> 01:27:32.649]  Everybody lines up, and then there's flashpoint, and a lot of things happen.
[01:27:32.649 --> 01:27:34.870]  I pray to God this de-escalates.
[01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:37.632]  The Georgian forces are now battling Russian troops.
[01:27:38.357 --> 01:27:41.358]  I mean, there is massive artillery barrages.
[01:27:41.358 --> 01:27:55.061]  They've got, the Russians always have loved these big mobile missile batteries that... firing these things with cluster bombs shooting out of them, you know, at a thousand feet off the ground.
[01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:58.241]  I mean, it is just massive bombardments.
[01:27:58.241 --> 01:27:59.862]  Cities on fire.
[01:27:59.862 --> 01:28:04.142]  Just all sorts of bedlam going on right now.
[01:28:04.142 --> 01:28:06.583]  And our media, and I'm still scanning during the breaks,
[01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:10.363]  Other major channels are acting like this isn't even happening.
[01:28:10.363 --> 01:28:13.404]  I can't believe that it's not even being covered.
[01:28:13.404 --> 01:28:16.806]  And that's why Russia obviously attacked.
[01:28:16.806 --> 01:28:18.767]  Because they're being attacked.
[01:28:18.767 --> 01:28:19.727]  They're being encircled.
[01:28:19.727 --> 01:28:20.548]  They're being prodded.
[01:28:20.548 --> 01:28:21.328]  They're being pushed.
[01:28:21.328 --> 01:28:22.248]  So let's get this straight.
[01:28:22.248 --> 01:28:24.749]  The New World Order is attacking the American people's liberties.
[01:28:24.749 --> 01:28:26.010]  They're encircling Russia.
[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.731]  Russia's enslaving its people.
[01:28:27.731 --> 01:28:28.931]  China's enslaving its people.
[01:28:28.931 --> 01:28:30.372]  It's just a bunch of criminal governments.
[01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:39.308]  Running around, fighting with their own people, and making moves against our dollar, against our currency, against our name.
[01:28:39.308 --> 01:28:43.270]  And now making moves, and Russia has said, we will nuke you.
[01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:47.173]  Russia has said, we may preemptively use even our nuclear arsenal.
[01:28:47.173 --> 01:28:49.715]  You can pull up the Russian Foreign Minister quote on that.
[01:28:49.715 --> 01:28:52.557]  They said, we will use military options, including our nuclear weapons.
[01:28:52.557 --> 01:28:53.938]  An incredible statement!
[01:28:53.938 --> 01:28:57.360]  The Russians do not shoot their mouths off, folks.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.282]  They do not play games.
[01:29:00.507 --> 01:29:06.252]  I've told you going into this fall is the most dangerous time in world history we have ever had.
[01:29:06.252 --> 01:29:08.334]  More dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:29:08.334 --> 01:29:10.016]  That's every historian we've had on.
[01:29:10.016 --> 01:29:11.777]  White House experts.
[01:29:11.777 --> 01:29:13.279]  Former White House historians.
[01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:14.019]  Analysts.
[01:29:14.019 --> 01:29:16.101]  Top CIA analysts.
[01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.504]  Economists.
[01:29:18.504 --> 01:29:22.007]  Former, you know, people like Bob Chapman in intelligence and economics.
[01:29:23.337 --> 01:29:25.337]  We are being hit from every angle.
[01:29:25.337 --> 01:29:26.618]  This is only the beginning.
[01:29:26.618 --> 01:29:28.958]  It does not look good going into the fall.
[01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:31.959]  Pray that detente and cooler heads prevail.
[01:29:31.959 --> 01:29:37.540]  But the neocons are a bunch of arrogant, wicked, child-molesting old men, and they think this is beautiful and wonderful.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:38.640]  And they want nuclear war.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.140]  They want death and destruction.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.041]  They just love evil.
[01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:47.422]  So all you smart-mouthed neocons out there who like war, well, you just might get something with Russia now.
[01:29:51.497 --> 01:29:55.423]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:58.106]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.252 --> 01:30:04.154]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:06.235]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.557]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[01:30:08.557 --> 01:30:12.119]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[01:30:12.119 --> 01:30:15.881]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[01:30:15.881 --> 01:30:19.824]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[01:30:19.824 --> 01:30:22.005]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[01:30:22.325 --> 01:30:28.067]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[01:30:28.067 --> 01:30:29.988]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[01:30:29.988 --> 01:30:31.969]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[01:30:31.969 --> 01:30:35.250]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.411]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[01:30:37.411 --> 01:30:39.752]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[01:30:39.752 --> 01:30:41.772]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[01:30:41.772 --> 01:30:48.435]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says.

[01:30:50.238 --> 01:30:50.699]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:50.980]  That's 888-211-1715.
[01:31:00.959 --> 01:31:04.381]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:06.702]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:31:06.702 --> 01:31:10.004]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:10.004 --> 01:31:16.888]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.989]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:19.489 --> 01:31:22.790]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:27.572]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:27.572 --> 01:31:31.514]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:31:31.514 --> 01:31:33.134]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:31:33.134 --> 01:31:35.795]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[01:31:41.698 --> 01:31:42.498]  Remember that code 500.
[01:31:42.978 --> 01:31:45.779]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:31:45.779 --> 01:31:46.660]  And we knew what to do.
[01:32:08.905 --> 01:32:10.187]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:32:10.187 --> 01:32:17.235]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:32:17.235 --> 01:32:22.400]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[01:32:23.362 --> 01:32:26.123]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:33.225]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:32:33.225 --> 01:32:36.386]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:32:36.386 --> 01:32:42.168]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:32:42.168 --> 01:32:44.749]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.890]  Federal Agents!
[01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:46.390]  We are armed!
[01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:07.890]  My father just came by the office
[01:33:29.557 --> 01:33:33.640]  He said that early this morning, he saw it on CNN at about 7.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:46.167]  He turned on the TV, laying in bed, and, uh, that they were just calmly reporting that, oh, Russian troops are rolling in to help with some peacekeeping.
[01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:48.408]  Then, meanwhile, the Georgian president's, we're under attack!
[01:33:48.408 --> 01:33:49.269]  Help us!
[01:33:49.269 --> 01:33:50.029]  We're under attack!
[01:33:50.029 --> 01:33:54.032]  And it's just massive bombardments of several major cities.
[01:33:54.993 --> 01:34:06.575]  Uh, just what appears to be, we've personally seen from different camera shots, different terrain, hundreds of tanks, hundreds of, uh, self-propelled missile batteries.
[01:34:06.575 --> 01:34:09.035]  There, finally I got the technical term from my memory.
[01:34:09.035 --> 01:34:13.396]  Self-propelled missile batteries.
[01:34:13.396 --> 01:34:17.497]  Anti-personnel, self-propelled missile batteries.
[01:34:17.497 --> 01:34:18.677]  Let's be clear, U.S.
[01:34:18.677 --> 01:34:23.978]  Special Forces are in Georgia, are deployed with the Georgian military.
[01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:26.532]  It is a foregone conclusion.
[01:34:26.532 --> 01:34:40.922]  I would say 99% chance that special forces are in forward areas deployed and directing Georgian forces against Spetsnaz, Russian special forces.
[01:34:40.922 --> 01:34:46.426]  And it is about a 60, I would say 70% dead reckoning right in there that U.S.
[01:34:46.426 --> 01:34:48.367]  troops have already probably been killed today.
[01:34:49.085 --> 01:34:50.645]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:50.645 --> 01:34:53.866]  There was a huge Cold War, as you know.
[01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:55.406]  More than 4,000 U.S.
[01:34:55.406 --> 01:35:06.689]  troops died from 1960 to 1964, when the official conflict with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was signed, after that staged false flag event, in Vietnam.
[01:35:06.689 --> 01:35:10.950]  Mainly Marine and Army, quote, advisors.
[01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:14.651]  4,000 died, and they kept it secret for four years.
[01:35:15.583 --> 01:35:18.485]  That's a thousand plus.
[01:35:18.485 --> 01:35:20.167]  I think 4,600 is the official number.
[01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:21.087]  You can go look it up.
[01:35:21.087 --> 01:35:21.888]  It's over 4,000.
[01:35:21.888 --> 01:35:28.052]  So around 1,100, 1,200 a year dying, and they just kept it secret.
[01:35:28.052 --> 01:35:33.296]  There have been thousands dying in the battle, the now eight-year battle in Colombia over cocaine fields.
[01:35:33.296 --> 01:35:39.041]  Not to eradicate cocaine, but to get control of that for the New York Stock Exchange, as reported by Reuters.
[01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:40.422]  This will cause oil to explode.
[01:35:40.422 --> 01:35:43.144]  In fact, let me just check oil prices right now.
[01:35:44.402 --> 01:35:47.763]  Uh, guys, I've... See, they're all final mastering a DVD.
[01:35:47.763 --> 01:35:48.763]  They're all doing that right now.
[01:35:48.763 --> 01:35:50.604]  Normally, I'd have people feeding me info.
[01:35:50.604 --> 01:35:52.904]  It's hard to surf while I do this.
[01:35:52.904 --> 01:35:56.565]  Hey, uh... Check oil prices for me.
[01:35:56.565 --> 01:35:57.466]  You got a terminal open?
[01:35:57.466 --> 01:35:59.946]  I got the... 4.0 producer out there.
[01:35:59.946 --> 01:36:01.627]  He just arrived.
[01:36:01.627 --> 01:36:04.448]  Uh... I want to check oil.
[01:36:04.448 --> 01:36:05.608]  I bet oil's up right now.
[01:36:07.757 --> 01:36:08.757]  Just amazing.
[01:36:08.757 --> 01:36:10.438]  I'm wondering what Gold's doing right now.
[01:36:10.438 --> 01:36:12.778]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls.
[01:36:12.778 --> 01:36:16.720]  For those that don't know, Georgia is under attack as Russian tanks roll in.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:24.982]  I was going to take off today and I had a lot of business to take care of at home and with accounting and with the move to the new office.
[01:36:24.982 --> 01:36:29.283]  My wife said, why are you going into the old office where Burmese is doing the show today?
[01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.484]  I said, I've got a bad feeling.
[01:36:33.972 --> 01:36:35.453]  I told her I need to go into the office.
[01:36:35.453 --> 01:36:36.113]  I got a bad feeling.
[01:36:36.113 --> 01:36:37.895]  And I came in and said, oh, Burmese is dropping by.
[01:36:37.895 --> 01:36:40.096]  Hey, did you hear the latest staged Al Qaeda news?
[01:36:40.096 --> 01:36:40.677]  And he's like, yeah.
[01:36:40.677 --> 01:36:43.979]  And all of a sudden, he goes, look at this on CNN.
[01:36:43.979 --> 01:36:46.902]  Russia invading Georgia.
[01:36:46.902 --> 01:36:49.984]  All right, I said I'd take phone calls.
[01:36:49.984 --> 01:36:51.505]  Bob Chapman's been moved 30 minutes earlier.
[01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:53.126]  He'll be on with us next hour.
[01:36:53.126 --> 01:37:00.792]  He fought in secret operations against the Russians in the 60s.
[01:37:03.749 --> 01:37:09.538]  Late 50s, early 60s, and he's been talking about how this was going to happen for months here on the show.
[01:37:09.538 --> 01:37:11.200]  Roberta and New York are on the air.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:11.561]  Go ahead.
[01:37:13.735 --> 01:37:14.295]  Hello?
[01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.336]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:37:15.336 --> 01:37:18.138]  Yeah, sorry Alex, it was Roberto.
[01:37:18.138 --> 01:37:20.479]  Yeah, first time caller, long time listener.
[01:37:20.479 --> 01:37:25.642]  I just wanted to get a question into you and maybe a comment if I have time afterwards.
[01:37:25.642 --> 01:37:26.042]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:36.528]  I'm wondering, I'm sure you've read 1984 where Goldstein depicts the perpetual war scenario where you can never really figure out who the enemy is.
[01:37:36.528 --> 01:37:37.709]  My question to you, Alex, is
[01:37:38.469 --> 01:37:46.032]  You know, and you made a reference to how they're trying to switch Al-Qaeda to Russia now, you know, or anybody who fits that description when it's convenient.
[01:37:46.032 --> 01:37:51.234]  Do you think that we are moving into that, like, 1984 type of scenario?
[01:37:51.234 --> 01:37:54.795]  Or maybe the, I'll just Huxley, brave new world scenario?
[01:37:54.795 --> 01:38:04.359]  Well, it's a mix of the 1984 slash Aldous Huxley, THX 1138, chemical lobotomy, shaved heads, slave drone, social worker society.
[01:38:04.959 --> 01:38:26.931]  It's an amalgamation of the two, and social planners, of course, wrote books about how both those books were just basically exposés on two different merging systems of total enslavement, the final revolution by the elite against free humanity, so we could never resist and never think again, destroying the language, destroying the family, tearing everything good apart.
[01:38:26.931 --> 01:38:30.853]  But we know there's two major globalist power blocks.
[01:38:30.853 --> 01:38:32.914]  We know that mafias do fight with each other.
[01:38:33.884 --> 01:38:37.326]  We do know that they normally have agents within each other's camps.
[01:38:37.326 --> 01:38:38.927]  In fact, always do.
[01:38:38.927 --> 01:38:41.729]  And so, God knows what's happening here, but we know this.
[01:38:41.729 --> 01:38:45.311]  It's bad for liberty, it's bad for freedom, it's bad for the dollar.
[01:38:45.311 --> 01:38:46.832]  It could lead into a wider war.
[01:38:46.832 --> 01:38:53.275]  In fact, probably will, at least in several other breakaway republics, their former satellites of the Soviet Union.
[01:38:53.275 --> 01:38:53.695]  And U.S.
[01:38:53.695 --> 01:39:01.580]  Special Forces are there, in the front lines, involved in all of this, and are no doubt engaging Russian forces right now.
[01:39:03.147 --> 01:39:03.727]  Thanks Alex.
[01:39:03.727 --> 01:39:08.770]  Now I just wanted to just go a little bit off topic if it's possible.
[01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:14.152]  I suffer from Crohn's disease and you know I don't know how I got it to be honest.
[01:39:14.152 --> 01:39:15.473]  There's no known cause.
[01:39:15.473 --> 01:39:23.596]  Well it's a cover story for an autoimmune just like muscular dystrophy is autoimmune and it's all tied in with poisons in the fertilizers.
[01:39:23.596 --> 01:39:25.437]  Let me give you the cocktail.
[01:39:25.437 --> 01:39:27.718]  The fertilizers are the byproduct of chemical
[01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:54.000]  Waste plants, the chemical waste of cracking oil with the fluoride and other chemicals breaking down the molecules, and it is then dumped into both yard fertilizer, it's even worse, but also in farm fertilizer, and so that basically attacks the nerves in the body to where the body just starts shutting down and then attacking itself after some of the nerves are damaged.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.021]  I think so.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.841]  We're good to go.
[01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:48.147]  And because they take up residence in the large and small intestine, which are a symbiosis area for viruses and bacteria in the
[01:40:49.717 --> 01:40:51.098]  I don't think so.
[01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:20.861]  But it's also then shown in correlation to heavy antibiotic dosages when children are small in relation that seems to accentuate killing the old viral colonies that are healthy.
[01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:28.788]  You have healthy viruses, you know, meant to, we have viruses in our gut that eat hundreds of different types of bacteria.
[01:41:28.788 --> 01:41:31.950]  That's why humans routinely in the past could eat rotten meat.
[01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:35.954]  You had your natural viruses there that would immediately kill those bacteria.
[01:41:36.854 --> 01:41:44.457]  But the antibiotics go in and kill the bacteria that the viruses are living in and on.
[01:41:44.457 --> 01:41:47.958]  The viruses tend to grow in the fecal matter of the bacteria.
[01:41:47.958 --> 01:41:50.620]  If you want to get into it, I read all the studies on this, it's incredible.
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.982]  And so basically, the gut has been assaulted by viruses through vaccines and antibiotics, and that's the major cause of that.
[01:41:57.302 --> 01:42:01.164]  I gotta let you go though, sir, because we've got a war brewing right now.
[01:42:01.164 --> 01:42:03.666]  Okay, not brewing, it started.
[01:42:03.666 --> 01:42:05.267]  The only question is how bad will it get?
[01:42:05.267 --> 01:42:09.630]  Mark, in Georgia, in the United States, not in Belarus.
[01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:10.370]  Go ahead.
[01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:11.070]  Thank God.
[01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:15.513]  I know it's coming here, but it's not here yet.
[01:42:15.513 --> 01:42:21.297]  You may remember some time ago, I mentioned the Reese Commission, for those that wish to Google it, R-W-E-C-E.
[01:42:22.317 --> 01:42:28.282]  And I found out later it was Norman Dodd, not Christopher Dodd, the presidential candidate.
[01:42:28.282 --> 01:42:30.244]  Listen, I found a source on that.
[01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:37.550]  I imagine you would see the current events as being consistent with the warnings of the Reese Commission and why they were stifled.
[01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:50.140]  That basically the ultimate goal of this mindless, bloody conflict that is obviously being contrived by an interventionist foreign policy is that ultimately we're going to reconcile and make peace and
[01:42:51.357 --> 01:42:59.604]  Yes, the Bilderberg Group has said this in leaked documents 35 years ago, Trilateral Commission in 1975, do the math on that, more than 30 years ago, 33 years ago, and they've stated that yes, they would then have the stage collapse of the Soviet Union,
[01:43:16.135 --> 01:43:23.761]  And that this was even in the State Department document 7277 and I have the New York Times and all these hundreds of mainstream articles and a binder around here somewhere.
[01:43:23.761 --> 01:43:26.083]  7277?
[01:43:26.083 --> 01:43:29.786]  Yes, yes, that Bernadine Smith put together with all the news articles.
[01:43:29.786 --> 01:43:31.528]  I've got to find that in storage.
[01:43:31.528 --> 01:43:34.630]  When you say 7277, the source of that again is?
[01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.893]  State Department document 7277.
[01:43:37.893 --> 01:43:39.374]  I'm going from memory on that.
[01:43:39.374 --> 01:43:39.975]  That's fine.
[01:43:39.975 --> 01:43:41.476]  But that's the State Department document
[01:43:42.461 --> 01:43:47.325]  On how they would merge NATO and Russia and then with the United States, yes.
[01:43:47.325 --> 01:43:48.786]  Okay, well, here's the thing.
[01:43:48.786 --> 01:44:09.943]  What I found is that Alan Stang has a tract called, basically, Foundations Paid Away, and I scanned it, made it into a PDF document, and uploaded it onto my site at doyoulovejesus.org, letter U, slash Foundations with a capital F, dot PDF, and
[01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:19.595]  Like I say, I just try to warn people that don't, as Jesus said in John 7, 24, don't stop judging by mirror appearances.
[01:44:19.595 --> 01:44:20.555]  Make a right judgment.
[01:44:20.555 --> 01:44:32.699]  Don't base your conclusions on the stated goals because, as Sir Arthur Kane and Doyle said through Sherlock Holmes, nothing is more misleading than an, quote, obvious fact.
[01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:33.539]  Yes, I gotta jump.
[01:44:33.539 --> 01:44:34.839]  I gotta jump, sir.
[01:44:34.839 --> 01:44:36.440]  Casey in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.060]  Go ahead.
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:38.421]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:59.677]  I was, uh, one of the, well, the fact that, uh, what I believe is that this is actually a provocateur, because, um, it supposedly started when, um, when, uh, Georgia shot down a couple of Russia's planes for, um, because they attacked a civilian hospital.
[01:44:59.677 --> 01:45:00.878]  And that just seems insane.
[01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:07.924]  I mean, why, why would they respond in such a, in such a manner when they could be easily crushed by Georgia?
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:09.400]  There's U.S.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.601]  troops in Georgia, and the mainstream media has reported that.
[01:45:14.601 --> 01:45:21.222]  So, um, I just think it would be absolutely insane for Georgia to shoot down two of Russia's planes.
[01:45:21.222 --> 01:45:26.363]  And then you've got Mikhail, the president... Well, I mean, Georgia admits they shot the planes down.
[01:45:26.363 --> 01:45:29.364]  Right, they admit they shot the planes down.
[01:45:29.364 --> 01:45:36.225]  But the thing is, is... Why would... Why would... Why would Russia... Alright, so Russia's gonna...
[01:45:37.045 --> 01:45:42.087]  They're going to shoot one of their hospitals.
[01:45:42.087 --> 01:45:43.708]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:46.149]  And then you've got McHale on CNN, right?
[01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:54.713]  He goes on CNN and he's talking about being a freedom-loving, democracy-loving... He even said he loved America.
[01:45:54.713 --> 01:45:59.935]  It seems like the U.S.
[01:45:59.935 --> 01:46:01.996]  is meant to get involved and intervene in this.
[01:46:03.658 --> 01:46:05.499]  Well, he's certainly begging for that right now.
[01:46:05.499 --> 01:46:08.580]  We're going to find out in short order what's going to develop.
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.261]  But think about it.
[01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:11.321]  Do you need some kind of clearance to get on CNN?
[01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:15.143]  I mean, how could they just have him on immediately like that?
[01:46:15.143 --> 01:46:17.164]  Well, it didn't happen immediately.
[01:46:17.164 --> 01:46:23.247]  The media started reporting on this about two hours ago, saying it was an armed conflict.
[01:46:23.247 --> 01:46:26.208]  My father saw CNN, he said, at about 7 a.m.
[01:46:26.208 --> 01:46:30.190]  this morning, reporting Russians are coming in to help.
[01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:32.511]  So a lot of deception, just very bizarre.
[01:46:35.403 --> 01:46:37.184]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:37.184 --> 01:46:41.327]  We're gonna go to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was out of the house, but we called.
[01:46:41.327 --> 01:46:44.109]  His wife basically got him on the phone, got him back to the house.
[01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:51.054]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy department of the Treasury, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:46:51.054 --> 01:46:52.715]  We've also got Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:46:52.715 --> 01:46:56.717]  I'll have them both on together, but he's in about 10 minutes, as long as Dr. Roberts can give us.
[01:46:56.717 --> 01:47:03.482]  The reason I thought of Dr. Roberts this morning, and Ray McGovern, but he couldn't come on today, he's in a business meeting.
[01:47:05.137 --> 01:47:14.439]  The reason I'm talking about Dr. Roberts and Bob Chapman and of course Ray McGovern and others is they've all been saying this is the real neocon target, this is about to erupt, this is very serious.
[01:47:14.439 --> 01:47:17.079]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you sir.
[01:47:17.079 --> 01:47:18.379]  Hey Alex.
[01:47:18.379 --> 01:47:19.199]  What do you think of this?
[01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.860]  You predicted it.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:27.201]  Well, I don't think we can do anything about it.
[01:47:27.201 --> 01:47:28.941]  It's all our fault anyhow.
[01:47:28.941 --> 01:47:32.062]  We've tried to turn Georgia
[01:47:34.933 --> 01:47:38.095]  Uh, which sits there on the Black Sea.
[01:47:38.095 --> 01:47:41.538]  Uh, you know, warm water ports for Russia.
[01:47:41.538 --> 01:47:45.500]  We've tried to turn them into, uh, you know, another American puppet state.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:50.104]  We've interfered in the elections, we've financed, you know, we buy them, basically.
[01:47:50.104 --> 01:47:55.127]  I think the guy running the country now is just another one of our paid puppets.
[01:47:55.127 --> 01:48:03.733]  And we play like it's all about freedom and democracy, and what it's really about is trying to, uh, cause trouble for the Russians.
[01:48:05.584 --> 01:48:13.749]  And, um, they put up with us for a good while because they didn't want any trouble.
[01:48:13.749 --> 01:48:23.175]  And I think they decided they put up with us too long because we now, you know, have a puppet state on their border.
[01:48:23.175 --> 01:48:29.038]  And there are parts of Georgia that don't want to be part of an American puppet state.
[01:48:29.038 --> 01:48:31.620]  They want to be with their separatists.
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.561]  They want to have their own countries.
[01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:34.321]  They're not very big.
[01:48:35.686 --> 01:48:46.696]  I think where the violence or alleged violence is at the moment is sort of in the middle of Georgia or on the top, right next to Russia.
[01:48:46.696 --> 01:48:49.898]  The other part is far more strategic.
[01:48:49.898 --> 01:48:57.685]  It is on the western end of Georgia and it borders the Black Sea.
[01:48:57.685 --> 01:49:02.129]  And these are two different separatists.
[01:49:03.774 --> 01:49:04.915]  Parts of Georgia.
[01:49:04.915 --> 01:49:06.156]  And it's a key crossroads.
[01:49:06.156 --> 01:49:08.178]  What about the thousands of U.S.
[01:49:08.178 --> 01:49:15.744]  Special Forces confirmed to be there, and the reports are that they are clearly advising Georgian forces.
[01:49:15.744 --> 01:49:17.685]  Dr. Roberts, it looks like we may have U.S.
[01:49:17.685 --> 01:49:24.050]  troops in the middle of battles right now with Russian armored brigades.
[01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:30.815]  Well, the Bush administration is criminally insane, and it wouldn't surprise me if the utter morons
[01:49:31.459 --> 01:49:34.281]  I don't have a situation like that.
[01:49:34.281 --> 01:49:36.523]  It's irresponsible in the extreme.
[01:49:36.523 --> 01:49:41.927]  It's another reason to impeach the moron.
[01:49:41.927 --> 01:49:48.732]  We're not about to be able to... Hell, we can't even occupy Baghdad and they're going to get into a war with Russians.
[01:49:48.732 --> 01:49:52.434]  The Russians have got 20,000 nukes!
[01:49:52.434 --> 01:49:56.818]  Well, that's why I say this is irresponsible in the extreme.
[01:49:56.818 --> 01:49:59.820]  It's the insane neoconservatives
[01:50:00.672 --> 01:50:06.275]  Totally control the Bush administration and totally control the Republican Party.
[01:50:06.275 --> 01:50:08.516]  They're insane people.
[01:50:08.516 --> 01:50:14.099]  You know, they hated Reagan because he wouldn't go to war with the Soviet Union.
[01:50:14.099 --> 01:50:18.661]  Reagan used to say, no, I don't want to win the Cold War, I want to end it.
[01:50:18.661 --> 01:50:22.223]  And they hated Reagan and they were always up to something.
[01:50:22.223 --> 01:50:28.486]  They write all these aggressive papers about how we need to take over everything.
[01:50:30.271 --> 01:50:39.875]  And they were using money and the pretext of democracy to buy Georgia.
[01:50:39.875 --> 01:50:43.357]  So, you know, it's not in Georgia's interest.
[01:50:47.794 --> 01:50:48.354]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:48.354 --> 01:50:50.677]  Let's talk about how you see this breaking down.
[01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:57.726]  The Russian foreign minister three months ago threatened to use nuclear weapons on the West if they continue to move in military forces and encircle them.
[01:50:57.726 --> 01:50:59.168]  We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[01:51:01.278 --> 01:51:04.242]  Every week, thousands of violent crimes are committed.
[01:51:04.242 --> 01:51:06.365]  Don't let yourself become a statistic.
[01:51:06.365 --> 01:51:07.246]  Be smart.
[01:51:07.246 --> 01:51:08.027]  Be safe.

[01:53:41.866 --> 01:53:44.769]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the
[01:53:45.009 --> 01:53:45.410]  I think so.
[01:54:19.646 --> 01:54:28.710]  It happens more often than not in history that mad dog emperors, corrupt regimes go crazy with their military power and start attacking everyone in sight.
[01:54:28.710 --> 01:54:34.092]  They always run into an enemy they can't beat.
[01:54:34.092 --> 01:54:37.793]  And this is a big development.
[01:54:37.793 --> 01:54:44.396]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, why do you think we see the images of Bush and Putin on stage together in Beijing, both looking very uncomfortable?
[01:54:45.502 --> 01:54:49.725]  Why do you think the Russians chose this date, 8-8-8, to go in?
[01:54:49.725 --> 01:54:57.031]  Because it would be an international distraction and the media wouldn't want to mess up their little Olympic Games?
[01:54:57.031 --> 01:55:00.433]  The Russians didn't choose this day to go in.
[01:55:00.433 --> 01:55:13.663]  The Russians have peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway regions, and have had for a long time, and also the UN has people there.
[01:55:14.477 --> 01:55:21.180]  Now, the attack, as I understand it, as I say, I've been out all morning, but the attack came from Georgia.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.901]  Yes, they admit that, quote, Georgian forces were trying to push separatists out.
[01:55:24.901 --> 01:55:25.601]  Yep.
[01:55:25.601 --> 01:55:33.624]  And Georgia attacked the two provinces in which there are Russian peacekeeping troops.
[01:55:33.624 --> 01:55:40.887]  So the origin of the conflict came from the American puppet state of Georgia.
[01:55:40.887 --> 01:55:43.808]  And I'm absolutely certain Dick Cheney is behind it.
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:49.122]  And why did Dick Cheney choose this time?
[01:55:49.122 --> 01:55:54.305]  Well, conveniently, Bush is out of the country, and Putin is out of the country.
[01:55:56.184 --> 01:55:58.706]  You know, you just saw that so clearly.
[01:55:58.706 --> 01:56:16.043]  Absolutely, we're here reporting what they're reporting, and if you really look into it, they admit quietly in the background that the Georgian forces were, quote, intensifying attacks and going after Russian forces, and the media spins it when Russia pours in troops to support its troops that it's Russia attacking.
[01:56:16.043 --> 01:56:17.084]  Yeah, right.
[01:56:17.084 --> 01:56:20.247]  The American media just lies.
[01:56:21.815 --> 01:56:24.857]  The neocons and it lies for the Bush administration.
[01:56:24.857 --> 01:56:26.018]  It's totally unreliable.
[01:56:26.018 --> 01:56:28.520]  You can't believe a word the American media says.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.922]  If they say anything correct, it's just an accident.
[01:56:31.922 --> 01:56:45.913]  But the rest of the world's media has made it clear that this attack originated from the Georgians and it attacked an area in which there have been Russian peacekeeping troops for a number of years.
[01:56:45.913 --> 01:56:46.333]  Since 99, yeah.
[01:56:50.018 --> 01:56:52.961]  Also, well that's almost a decade.
[01:56:52.961 --> 01:56:56.925]  And also, UN people are there.
[01:56:56.925 --> 01:57:00.349]  I don't know what is the extent of the UN presence.
[01:57:00.349 --> 01:57:08.437]  Well, the big wild card here that I want your analysis on, sir, and that's why we've got you here, just a key point you just brought up, hiding in plain view, that Georgia really started this.
[01:57:09.552 --> 01:57:10.133]  Look, U.S.
[01:57:10.133 --> 01:57:11.754]  Special Forces rely on heavy firepower.
[01:57:11.754 --> 01:57:14.896]  They can't fight any better than the rest of our troops.
[01:57:14.896 --> 01:57:15.777]  They just have all this
[01:57:37.407 --> 01:57:39.108]  Airpower and firepower.
[01:57:39.108 --> 01:57:40.868]  And that's how we prevail.
[01:57:40.868 --> 01:57:42.189]  There's not enough U.S.
[01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:47.790]  Special Forces to take on the Russian Army.
[01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:50.511]  Well, I'm looking at these spitsnats.
[01:57:50.511 --> 01:57:53.912]  This is their territory.
[01:57:53.912 --> 01:57:55.593]  They border this country.
[01:57:55.593 --> 01:57:59.734]  Well, I'm looking at the spitsnats here, and I have to say they look a lot tougher than our troops.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.563]  Well, whether they're tougher or not, they border Georgia.
[01:58:06.563 --> 01:58:08.664]  They've occupied Georgia for two centuries.
[01:58:08.664 --> 01:58:10.825]  It was part of the Soviet Union.
[01:58:10.825 --> 01:58:14.427]  It's the homeland of Joseph Stalin.
[01:58:14.427 --> 01:58:20.511]  And they're not likely to accept Georgia as an American puppet state.
[01:58:20.511 --> 01:58:22.812]  And it's just not going to happen.
[01:58:22.812 --> 01:58:29.876]  And the Russians are economically stronger than we are because they have massive trade surpluses, energy.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:33.441]  And they've got just as many nukes.
[01:58:33.441 --> 01:58:36.924]  And they're not going to put up with that moron in the White House.
[01:58:36.924 --> 01:58:37.304]  One minute.
[01:58:37.304 --> 01:58:43.409]  We'll be back in one minute, Dr. Roberts.
[01:58:43.409 --> 01:58:46.050]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:49.193]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.445 --> 01:59:00.026]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:59:00.026 --> 01:59:01.727]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:59:01.727 --> 01:59:04.609]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:09.652]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:59:09.652 --> 01:59:17.897]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:59:17.897 --> 01:59:22.720]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:26.578 --> 01:59:29.000]  How dare you?
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.243]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:34.243 --> 01:59:36.965]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:36.965 --> 01:59:43.450]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[01:59:48.553 --> 01:59:51.015]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:59:54.059 --> 01:59:56.461]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.461 --> 02:00:05.707]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.707 --> 02:00:07.028]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.028 --> 02:00:08.809]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.809 --> 02:00:10.570]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:12.131]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:13.072]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:17.875]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.875 --> 02:00:21.978]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.046 --> 02:00:35.170]  We are going to have clips coming up a little bit later of the Georgian ambassador to the UK, the Russian ambassador, the U.S.
[02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:36.711]  statements.
[02:00:36.711 --> 02:00:39.553]  Georgia in conflict with breakaway province, many dead.
[02:00:39.553 --> 02:00:42.755]  McCain calls for Russia to withdraw from Georgia.
[02:00:43.544 --> 02:00:58.905]  Bottom line, it is admitted, but quietly, just mentioned by CNN and in the AP, that Russian military were attacked in the early morning hours by armored columns of the Georgian military, backed up and advised by U.S.
[02:00:58.905 --> 02:01:00.488]  Special Forces and advisors.
[02:01:01.367 --> 02:01:03.788]  Just an incredible provocation.
[02:01:03.788 --> 02:01:14.051]  The media is basically smokescreening it, mainly reporting on the Russians pouring across the border, out of Russia proper, from the north to support their forces inside.
[02:01:14.051 --> 02:01:15.792]  It is huge.
[02:01:15.792 --> 02:01:20.353]  It appears to be hundreds and hundreds of tanks, if not more.
[02:01:20.353 --> 02:01:22.374]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.
[02:01:23.315 --> 02:01:25.096]  What do you think is most important in all of this?
[02:01:25.096 --> 02:01:27.298]  I see it as how does this tie into Iran?
[02:01:27.298 --> 02:01:31.261]  Jerusalem Post reporting two more carrier groups going into the Gulf right now.
[02:01:31.261 --> 02:01:33.022]  The Iran attack is on.
[02:01:33.022 --> 02:01:38.187]  Ray McGovern said yesterday and Ron Paul has said that it's probably on for October.
[02:01:38.187 --> 02:01:43.211]  The Russians are threatening Czechoslovakia, Ukraine and others where U.S.
[02:01:43.211 --> 02:01:45.933]  weapons systems are being built up right now.
[02:01:45.933 --> 02:01:47.995]  Dr. Roberts?
[02:01:47.995 --> 02:01:50.617]  Yes, I think we agree totally that
[02:01:52.890 --> 02:02:04.833]  Ever since President Reagan reached agreements with Gorbachev, these were good agreements, and the Russians banked on them.
[02:02:04.833 --> 02:02:10.015]  And they've been betrayed by every subsequent American administration.
[02:02:10.015 --> 02:02:12.435]  We did everything we said we wouldn't do.
[02:02:12.435 --> 02:02:14.036]  We brought NATO to their borders.
[02:02:14.036 --> 02:02:21.298]  We're putting missile systems in former parts of the Soviet Empire.
[02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:35.572]  We are interfering with money in the elections of former Soviet republics, such as Georgia, where we've managed to install a puppet.
[02:02:35.572 --> 02:02:40.933]  And this kind of provocation is extreme.
[02:02:40.933 --> 02:02:45.974]  Initially, the Russians weren't much able to do anything about it because they were in disarray from the
[02:02:46.613 --> 02:02:53.557]  Destruction of communism from the few oligarchs that grabbed all their resources.
[02:02:53.557 --> 02:02:56.019]  And the army was demoralized.
[02:02:56.019 --> 02:02:59.941]  But now they're back in some much better shape.
[02:02:59.941 --> 02:03:03.183]  And they have a lot of economic strength.
[02:03:03.183 --> 02:03:06.004]  They have the largest trade surplus in the world.
[02:03:06.004 --> 02:03:08.406]  They have massive energy supplies.
[02:03:08.406 --> 02:03:12.788]  They have Europe under their thumb because all of Europe is dependent on the natural gas.
[02:03:14.771 --> 02:03:23.115]  And they have managed to beat the Americans out of the gas pipeline in Central Asia.
[02:03:23.115 --> 02:03:24.656]  Why is Dick Cheney doing this?
[02:03:24.656 --> 02:03:25.456]  Who's behind this?
[02:03:25.456 --> 02:03:26.737]  What do they want?
[02:03:26.737 --> 02:03:27.717]  I don't know that.
[02:03:27.717 --> 02:03:29.878]  I don't know that.
[02:03:29.878 --> 02:03:37.702]  It may just be years of frustrations of not being able to use power.
[02:03:37.702 --> 02:03:38.582]  And now they got it.
[02:03:38.582 --> 02:03:41.643]  They don't know how much longer they'll have it.
[02:03:41.643 --> 02:03:42.684]  Maybe just a few months.
[02:03:43.536 --> 02:03:44.356]  And maybe that's it.
[02:03:44.356 --> 02:03:47.157]  They just want to use this power.
[02:03:47.157 --> 02:03:49.838]  People get carried away.
[02:03:49.838 --> 02:03:55.179]  They get overwhelmed with hubris, and they think they're invincible.
[02:03:55.179 --> 02:04:03.481]  They read all these papers that they write themselves about the superpower, the invincible army, and they get carried away.
[02:04:03.481 --> 02:04:07.322]  I mean, why in the world did Hitler march off into Russia, or Napoleon march off?
[02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:09.872]  Why did you predict this?
[02:04:09.872 --> 02:04:10.652]  Why did you predict?
[02:04:10.652 --> 02:04:16.639]  You've been saying this every time you're on the show for the last two years that something was probably going to happen with Russia.
[02:04:16.639 --> 02:04:30.654]  Well, I was part of the Reagan team that came to a sensible agreement with him to end this rivalry and quit wasting all these hundreds of billions of dollars every year in military expenditures.
[02:04:31.716 --> 02:04:33.117]  And we had a good program.
[02:04:33.117 --> 02:04:33.677]  It would have worked.
[02:04:33.677 --> 02:04:34.998]  The Russians were committed to it.
[02:04:34.998 --> 02:04:40.841]  And now we've watched people, the Americans, systematically destroy everything.
[02:04:40.841 --> 02:04:45.223]  So it's been obvious to me once it started.
[02:04:45.223 --> 02:04:49.565]  So, you're watching evil, Alex.
[02:04:49.565 --> 02:04:53.987]  It's evil in the United States government.
[02:04:53.987 --> 02:04:54.948]  It's evil.
[02:04:54.948 --> 02:04:58.189]  No doubt the Georgian forces attacked the Russians first.
[02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.970]  You can Google that.
[02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:59.490]  It's admitted.
[02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:03.130]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:05:03.130 --> 02:05:06.752]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:05:06.752 --> 02:05:09.213]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:05:09.213 --> 02:05:12.254]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:12.254 --> 02:05:17.977]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:17.977 --> 02:05:21.899]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:22.219 --> 02:05:27.420]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:07:01.335 --> 02:07:07.039]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned.
[02:07:07.039 --> 02:07:09.861]  He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[02:07:09.861 --> 02:07:11.022]  I said, oh, of course.
[02:07:11.022 --> 02:07:12.242]  Woo, they're high.
[02:07:12.242 --> 02:07:12.763]  He says, yeah.
[02:07:12.763 --> 02:07:13.843]  He says, what am I going to do?
[02:07:13.843 --> 02:07:14.424]  I've got a truck.
[02:07:14.424 --> 02:07:17.346]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[02:07:17.346 --> 02:07:19.247]  I really need the truck for my job.
[02:07:19.247 --> 02:07:21.248]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[02:07:21.248 --> 02:07:23.230]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[02:07:23.230 --> 02:07:25.171]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[02:07:25.171 --> 02:07:26.272]  I don't know what to do.
[02:07:26.272 --> 02:07:27.332]  I said, Bob, relax.
[02:07:27.332 --> 02:07:27.993]  I know what to do.
[02:07:28.573 --> 02:07:32.875]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:07:52.443 --> 02:07:54.044]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[02:07:54.044 --> 02:07:54.504]  I said, yep.

[02:07:57.804 --> 02:08:01.485]  Do it now.
[02:08:01.485 --> 02:08:08.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.706 --> 02:08:12.507]  We found BBC reports and others listing U.S.
[02:08:12.507 --> 02:08:16.208]  military forces backing the Georgian government.
[02:08:16.208 --> 02:08:18.108]  Now, here is a Wahhabist
[02:08:19.404 --> 02:08:21.365]  News report out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:08:21.365 --> 02:08:24.627]  This is the type of stuff they're reporting out of Caucasus News.
[02:08:24.627 --> 02:08:25.368]  Caucasus News.
[02:08:25.368 --> 02:08:27.469]  Russian military ready to invade Georgia.
[02:08:27.469 --> 02:08:27.689]  U.S.
[02:08:27.689 --> 02:08:30.111]  sends thousands of Marines in response.
[02:08:30.111 --> 02:08:34.393]  And it footnotes that Marines are there by the thousands, not just Army Special Forces.
[02:08:34.393 --> 02:08:37.115]  And I've double-checked this and pulled up another report.
[02:08:37.936 --> 02:08:39.837]  And they've got photos and video of it.
[02:08:39.837 --> 02:08:40.838]  This is unbelievable.
[02:08:40.838 --> 02:08:42.519]  So we have no idea how many U.S.
[02:08:42.519 --> 02:08:43.379]  troops are there.
[02:08:43.379 --> 02:08:46.021]  The BBC says it's undisclosed.
[02:08:46.021 --> 02:08:47.982]  That really is a $64 million question.
[02:08:47.982 --> 02:08:50.783]  Dr. Roberts will be with us till the end of this segment.
[02:08:50.783 --> 02:08:55.326]  I do want to try to set Dr. Roberts up for my Sunday show after this is fleshed out.
[02:08:55.326 --> 02:08:59.028]  So I'll talk to you during the break coming up in about 12 minutes, sir.
[02:08:59.028 --> 02:09:01.910]  I want to bring in Bob Chapman, who was in Army Intelligence and worked with
[02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:03.651]  Some other agencies we can't get into.
[02:09:03.651 --> 02:09:07.515]  He's had one of the largest newsletters out there for decades.
[02:09:07.515 --> 02:09:10.918]  And of course he helped put out Gary Allen's book and was partners with him.
[02:09:10.918 --> 02:09:12.259]  None Dare Call Conspiracies.
[02:09:12.259 --> 02:09:13.880]  He's been fighting the globals for a long time.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.483]  He has really been predicting this every week with us.
[02:09:16.483 --> 02:09:20.726]  We're going to go back to Dr. Roberts here in just a moment for any other key info he wants to cover.
[02:09:20.726 --> 02:09:22.268]  But briefly, Bob, because I want
[02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:29.815]  Paul Craig Roberts to be able to comment on what you have to say, bringing in some of the research you've been doing.
[02:09:29.815 --> 02:09:33.459]  Give us your take on this situation.
[02:09:33.459 --> 02:09:35.581]  Okay, who's behind it?
[02:09:35.581 --> 02:09:37.623]  Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:09:37.623 --> 02:09:39.044]  Read his recent stuff.
[02:09:39.044 --> 02:09:43.509]  He talks about it and they want to have brush fire wars.
[02:09:44.082 --> 02:09:53.404]  They want to get Russia into this thing to keep people's minds off the economic and financial carnage that's going on not only in the United States but throughout the world.
[02:09:55.029 --> 02:09:57.211]  You saw what they did in Kosovo.
[02:09:57.211 --> 02:10:00.193]  That's another war waiting to happen.
[02:10:00.193 --> 02:10:10.861]  The Russians said today they're going to use missiles all along the frontier with Europe if Poland cedes to include missiles in their country.
[02:10:10.861 --> 02:10:13.363]  Incidentally, that Congress has already rejected it once.
[02:10:13.363 --> 02:10:16.386]  Same thing on Czechoslovakia.
[02:10:16.386 --> 02:10:16.726]  Yes.
[02:10:16.726 --> 02:10:17.306]  Czech Republic.
[02:10:20.166 --> 02:10:24.107]  Uh, the training, uh, in Georgia has been going on for a long time.
[02:10:24.107 --> 02:10:25.688]  We talked about it before in the show.
[02:10:25.688 --> 02:10:33.330]  Uh, there's a thousand, uh, private contractor, uh, Israeli trainers in there, and they've been in there for a long time.
[02:10:33.330 --> 02:10:35.251]  I did see that.
[02:10:35.251 --> 02:10:40.933]  Yeah, that came up this morning, um, on the Deepka.
[02:10:40.933 --> 02:10:45.935]  Uh, 426 PM GMT at, uh, 2 o'clock.
[02:10:45.935 --> 02:10:46.455]  And, um,
[02:10:47.376 --> 02:11:00.743]  And at issue here, really, is the re-roading of the pipeline, Caspian Oil and Gas, to reach the Turkish terminal port of Ceylon.
[02:11:00.743 --> 02:11:05.065]  Incidentally, I wrote about this in 1982.
[02:11:05.065 --> 02:11:07.626]  I saw them setting this thing up.
[02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:11.128]  And rather than using the Russian network that's available,
[02:11:12.856 --> 02:11:25.350]  Why did Rick Cheney, as Dr. Roberts just said, trigger doing this on 888 and having a Georgian mainline army backed up by U.S.
[02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:28.173]  Special Forces attack Russian forces?
[02:11:28.173 --> 02:11:30.896]  Why did they decide to do this today?
[02:11:30.896 --> 02:11:31.617]  That I don't know.
[02:11:33.222 --> 02:11:34.323]  I just can't answer.
[02:11:34.323 --> 02:11:37.404]  You know, timing can't be that finite.
[02:11:37.404 --> 02:11:39.365]  I mean, we know something's going to happen.
[02:11:39.365 --> 02:11:40.726]  We know how it's going to happen.
[02:11:40.726 --> 02:11:45.188]  Okay, let's bring Dr. Roberts in, because we're going to have Bob with us for the rest of the show.
[02:11:45.188 --> 02:11:47.188]  Go ahead, Dr. Roberts, you've got the floor.
[02:11:47.188 --> 02:11:54.072]  Well, the reason they did it today is they've got to push out of the country and put Putin out of the country.
[02:11:54.072 --> 02:11:59.214]  So, this pretty much tells you that this is not a push.
[02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:02.352]  Operation or Putin operations.
[02:12:02.352 --> 02:12:03.573]  Cheney operation.
[02:12:03.573 --> 02:12:08.638]  I agree with everything that's been said except the reference to Brzezinski.
[02:12:08.638 --> 02:12:09.819]  He's not a neocon.
[02:12:09.819 --> 02:12:12.182]  He despises them.
[02:12:12.182 --> 02:12:21.371]  And he would be warning against this type of thing and has warned against taking NATO to their frontiers and so on.
[02:12:21.371 --> 02:12:23.493]  This is a neocon operation.
[02:12:23.493 --> 02:12:24.074]  They may be
[02:12:25.527 --> 02:12:34.211]  It probably also has something to do with trying to control the oil pipelines, which I think they've already lost that battle.
[02:12:34.211 --> 02:12:37.852]  What do you think of the news that Israelis are there?
[02:12:37.852 --> 02:12:38.292]  I don't know.
[02:12:38.292 --> 02:12:44.895]  I just don't know why, what they would be able to contribute.
[02:12:44.895 --> 02:12:51.278]  They can't even beat a small militia, Hezbollah.
[02:12:51.278 --> 02:12:52.038]  And I don't know why
[02:12:52.947 --> 02:13:04.009]  American Marines would be there because they haven't got enough numbers to stand against any actual attempt by a Russian Army.
[02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:07.970]  Bob, it looks to me like insanity, Alex.
[02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:11.690]  You know, everything this regime has done is insane.
[02:13:11.690 --> 02:13:16.511]  None of it makes any logical sense.
[02:13:16.511 --> 02:13:19.552]  So you're saying megalomania is what we're dealing with?
[02:13:19.552 --> 02:13:20.972]  I think Cheney's insane, yeah.
[02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:28.692]  Bob, I don't want Dr. Roberts to comment on this, but during the break you were saying you think this is, quote, a good thing.
[02:13:28.692 --> 02:13:31.654]  I mean, how is this a good thing?
[02:13:31.654 --> 02:13:34.995]  You think the neocons have finally gone too far?
[02:13:34.995 --> 02:13:36.356]  Yes, I do.
[02:13:36.356 --> 02:13:45.600]  And they've met Russian forces that have been just waiting for this because they don't want it, but they're certainly prepared.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:51.063]  And it's a battle they can't win, the United States and their allies, so to speak.
[02:13:52.043 --> 02:14:02.393]  And he said that what they're doing is another, in essence, a piecemeal operation that can't be successful.
[02:14:02.393 --> 02:14:04.435]  And he's absolutely right.
[02:14:04.435 --> 02:14:10.461]  But again, the psywar in this is keep the people's mind off
[02:14:11.408 --> 02:14:15.550]  What is going on in the United States economically and financially?
[02:14:15.550 --> 02:14:15.810]  I agree.
[02:14:15.810 --> 02:14:18.191]  Let's go back to Dr. Roberts and we'll get your full take after the break.
[02:14:18.191 --> 02:14:21.672]  Dr. Roberts, how does this play into iBrand?
[02:14:21.672 --> 02:14:25.274]  Does this make the escalation there more sure or does it lessen that?
[02:14:25.274 --> 02:14:28.815]  I mean, how do you see that developing?
[02:14:28.815 --> 02:14:32.136]  Well, Alex, it depends on how far this goes.
[02:14:32.136 --> 02:14:38.839]  And if American troops come into conflict and pitch battles with Russian troops,
[02:14:40.193 --> 02:14:42.914]  It's probably going to put the Iran thing on ice.
[02:14:42.914 --> 02:14:46.995]  I don't think they would be able to do that.
[02:14:46.995 --> 02:14:54.838]  I don't understand why they would risk an armed combat encounter with the Soviets on Soviet territory.
[02:14:54.838 --> 02:14:57.999]  I mean, this is their border.
[02:14:57.999 --> 02:15:05.121]  All the supply lines and everything you need to have that kind of a conflict.
[02:15:05.121 --> 02:15:06.842]  I mean, Russia is not a militia.
[02:15:06.842 --> 02:15:07.862]  It's an army.
[02:15:09.359 --> 02:15:16.398]  They've got jets and missiles and tanks, too, and armor-piercing weapons, so all kinds of
[02:15:17.265 --> 02:15:21.226]  Of advantages that we have when we go up against third world countries like Iraq.
[02:15:21.226 --> 02:15:22.146]  We start there.
[02:15:22.146 --> 02:15:27.847]  Yeah, this isn't the poor, starving, basically unarmed Muslims who've got courage but aren't trained in fighting.
[02:15:27.847 --> 02:15:41.729]  I mean, I'm looking at our broken down, torn up, overused military that the basic ranks fill with farm boys and poor inner city people who most of them didn't get proper nutrition when they were kids and frankly look like they're pushovers.
[02:15:41.729 --> 02:15:45.010]  Compared to these Russians, these guys look completely vicious.
[02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:46.070]  Well, I think that
[02:15:47.325 --> 02:16:01.589]  This is either being overplayed in the news, or Cheney's insane and he's trying to pull some big conflict off before Bush or Putin can get back home and stop it.
[02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:03.509]  Could this be the October surprise?
[02:16:03.509 --> 02:16:04.890]  A lightning conflict?
[02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:09.011]  Brush fires all over former Soviet satellites?
[02:16:09.011 --> 02:16:10.931]  Could this be the October surprise?
[02:16:10.931 --> 02:16:13.252]  A kind of curveball?
[02:16:13.252 --> 02:16:14.332]  No, we can't.
[02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:16.373]  We don't have the resources to have
[02:16:17.217 --> 02:16:18.478]  I don't know.
[02:16:38.093 --> 02:16:41.115]  This may be being overplayed in the news.
[02:16:41.115 --> 02:16:41.976]  Why are you saying that?
[02:16:41.976 --> 02:16:53.865]  We're seeing hundreds and hundreds of tanks, huge artillery barrages, the President of Georgia begging for help on TV, pathetically, you know, playing it up.
[02:16:53.865 --> 02:16:57.287]  Why are you, I mean, I respect your opinion, why are you saying it could be overplayed?
[02:16:57.287 --> 02:17:05.133]  Well, the Georgian President is an American puppet, and so it's some play going, it could be just a play going on.
[02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:09.752]  If Russia wants to invade Georgia, they will do it.
[02:17:09.752 --> 02:17:11.153]  I mean, there's nothing we could do about it.
[02:17:11.153 --> 02:17:13.134]  Well, they've definitely invaded that area.
[02:17:13.134 --> 02:17:28.380]  Well, I don't know if they've invaded... I think what they did, they may have sent in forces into the small breakaway area, where they already had peacekeepers, and where the UN had peacekeepers.
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:33.342]  Just like they did in Pristina at the end of the last Kosovo takeover.
[02:17:35.416 --> 02:17:41.180]  Well, I don't think they've sent their troops into the non-breakaway parts of Georgia.
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:49.467]  If they do that, then they will have made a decision that they're going to just get rid of the Georgian government, which is an American puppet.
[02:17:50.439 --> 02:17:54.360]  If they make that decision, we're not going to be able to do anything about it.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.322]  We don't have any troops to send there to fight the Russian army.
[02:17:58.322 --> 02:18:00.182]  So that's the big question.
[02:18:00.182 --> 02:18:07.384]  Is it localized only to these two small breakaway areas, or are they going to go to the capital?
[02:18:07.384 --> 02:18:15.187]  I don't think they'll go to the capital unless the Georgians and the Americans start a war.
[02:18:15.187 --> 02:18:15.607]  If we do,
[02:18:16.562 --> 02:18:23.506]  Start a war, the Russians probably will prevail, given that it's their backyard and ours.
[02:18:23.506 --> 02:18:30.110]  And we're certainly not going to be able to send any occupying army there.
[02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:31.771]  We haven't got one.
[02:18:31.771 --> 02:18:35.453]  Well, we're going to find out in the next days, the next hours and days that follow.
[02:18:35.453 --> 02:18:37.814]  So I guess, are you saying that's the key?
[02:18:37.814 --> 02:18:41.917]  Then, in your opinion, is how wide this is going to really be?
[02:18:41.917 --> 02:18:42.377]  That's right.
[02:18:42.377 --> 02:18:44.878]  How wide is this going to be?
[02:18:46.654 --> 02:18:50.455]  Uh, what can... What can Cheney get away with?
[02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:51.535]  Uh, he's in charge.
[02:18:51.535 --> 02:18:52.695]  Bush is out of the country.
[02:18:52.695 --> 02:18:55.556]  Uh, the neocons are insane.
[02:18:55.556 --> 02:18:58.477]  I've never... I don't know of a sane one.
[02:18:58.477 --> 02:19:04.818]  And, uh... So, it may be they're trying to initiate some kind of a nuclear thing.
[02:19:04.818 --> 02:19:06.118]  Oh my God.
[02:19:06.118 --> 02:19:13.660]  You know, the idiot neocons, like that Billy Crystal, they write things like, what's the good of having nuclear weapons if you can't use them?
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:14.740]  They all think that way.
[02:19:16.235 --> 02:19:25.585]  Uh, see, back in the Reagan years, sort of the problem we had with them, they wanted to nuke Russia, the Soviet Union.
[02:19:25.585 --> 02:19:26.626]  They're crazy.
[02:19:26.626 --> 02:19:33.313]  They're insane people, and I don't understand why anybody would let anybody that crazy get into the government, at any level.
[02:19:35.262 --> 02:19:37.743]  They may be creating a crisis to try to stay in power.
[02:19:37.743 --> 02:19:40.603]  This could really turn into something bad quickly.
[02:19:40.603 --> 02:19:42.124]  Dr. Roberts, let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:19:42.124 --> 02:19:44.844]  We'll come back with Bob Chapman on the other side of your phone calls.
[02:19:44.844 --> 02:19:54.046]  But I want to see if you can look at your book and tell us if you can come on the Sunday show after we've had more time to flesh all this out and give us your great analysis then.
[02:19:54.046 --> 02:19:56.127]  He's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:19:56.127 --> 02:19:59.288]  His new book is out, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[02:19:59.288 --> 02:19:59.948]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.724 --> 02:20:07.448]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:20:07.448 --> 02:20:08.769]  And we knew what to do.
[02:20:08.769 --> 02:20:10.790]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:17.815]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:20:17.815 --> 02:20:22.979]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[02:20:23.959 --> 02:20:26.701]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[02:20:26.701 --> 02:20:33.805]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:20:33.805 --> 02:20:36.987]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:20:36.987 --> 02:20:42.750]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:45.332]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:20:45.832 --> 02:20:51.896]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:20:51.896 --> 02:20:54.797]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:20:54.797 --> 02:20:59.700]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:21:01.542 --> 02:21:05.604]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:21:05.604 --> 02:21:11.486]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:21:11.486 --> 02:21:12.606]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:21:12.606 --> 02:21:16.648]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:21:17.308 --> 02:21:30.612]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:21:30.612 --> 02:21:36.713]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:21:36.713 --> 02:21:42.535]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:21:43.355 --> 02:21:44.636]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:44.636 --> 02:21:46.337]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:21:46.337 --> 02:21:46.777]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.777 --> 02:21:48.718]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:21:48.718 --> 02:21:48.778]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.970]  Hey, Clyde!
[02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:02.950]  What's up, Bonnie?
[02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:07.411]  Well, I got a question about those shielded, secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[02:22:07.411 --> 02:22:12.152]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[02:22:12.152 --> 02:22:12.953]  What about them?
[02:22:12.953 --> 02:22:17.394]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends, and they want info on purchasing the secure sleeves.
[02:22:17.394 --> 02:22:18.414]  Oh, Bonnie!
[02:22:18.414 --> 02:22:24.915]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[02:22:24.915 --> 02:22:26.656]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[02:22:26.656 --> 02:22:28.216]  They promised not to tell anyone else.
[02:22:28.616 --> 02:22:29.577]  I guess you're right.
[02:22:29.577 --> 02:22:31.378]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[02:22:31.378 --> 02:22:37.163]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for $19.95.
[02:22:37.163 --> 02:22:42.548]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[02:22:42.548 --> 02:22:43.909]  And where do they buy them?
[02:22:43.909 --> 02:22:48.073]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at IDStronghold.com.
[02:22:48.073 --> 02:22:50.254]  IDStronghold.com.
[02:22:50.254 --> 02:22:51.696]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the Internet?
[02:22:52.176 --> 02:22:52.777]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[02:22:52.777 --> 02:22:53.017]  That's 800-610-2770.
[02:22:53.017 --> 02:22:53.418]  Thanks, Clyde.
[02:22:53.418 --> 02:22:54.880]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:00.949]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:09.761]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:23:09.761 --> 02:23:18.168]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:18.168 --> 02:23:23.893]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:23:24.053 --> 02:23:25.895]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:23:25.895 --> 02:23:28.097]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:23:28.097 --> 02:23:32.622]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:23:32.622 --> 02:23:34.845]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:23:34.845 --> 02:23:42.733]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:24:03.849 --> 02:24:18.137]  I'm going to open the phones up later in the shower, but folks, I want it to be about what's happening with the Olympics, what's happening with terrorism, Iran, what's going on in Georgia right now with this conflict with U.S.-backed Georgians against the Russian military.
[02:24:18.137 --> 02:24:23.980]  You call in trying to plug your website for products or whatever, I'm just going to hang up on you.
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:30.343]  Because I want to hear from callers about what they're watching on the news, what they're seeing, little tidbits of information that we may miss or not bring up.
[02:24:32.821 --> 02:24:35.122]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:35.122 --> 02:24:59.493]  Bob Chapman, what's amazing here is if you read deeply into the news, and scan the press releases, you will see that Georgian forces came in and clashed with Russians in the early morning hours, and Russians that were massed on the border seeing this build-up spilled in this morning, about six hours ago, and the media is spinning it like Russia did it without saying that.
[02:25:00.845 --> 02:25:03.607]  McCain calls on Russia to withdraw from Georgia.
[02:25:03.607 --> 02:25:04.448]  Republican U.S.
[02:25:04.448 --> 02:25:11.493]  Presidential Candidate John McCain today urged Russia to immediately withdraw from Georgia and said the United States should call for an emergency United Nations session.
[02:25:11.493 --> 02:25:17.917]  Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations, withdraw all forces from the sovereign territory of Georgia.
[02:25:17.917 --> 02:25:20.159]  See, they're making it a big split.
[02:25:20.159 --> 02:25:21.960]  The Russians have always been there.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:23.561]  McCain told reporters in Iowa the U.S.
[02:25:23.561 --> 02:25:25.683]  should immediately convene an emergency session of the U.N.
[02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:28.625]  Security Council to call Russia to reverse course.
[02:25:29.432 --> 02:25:31.933]  I mean, this is escalating.
[02:25:31.933 --> 02:25:35.555]  I hope it settles down, but you're watching the same images I'm seeing.
[02:25:35.555 --> 02:25:44.079]  I mean, the media at first, when they first started finally reporting on this three hours ago, was like, oh, Russia sent in a few people to just bolster its peacekeeping.
[02:25:44.079 --> 02:25:49.322]  It's having some trouble with, you know, rebels fighting with each other on both sides, pro-Russian, pro-Georgian.
[02:25:49.322 --> 02:25:56.866]  And then now it comes out, no, Georgian forces came in, well, what would be yesterday now, and hit Russian forces.
[02:25:56.866 --> 02:25:58.967]  And this is just incredible, Bob Chapman.
[02:26:00.836 --> 02:26:08.160]  Well, first of all, the Russians have already, long previous to the United States, asked the U.N.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.341]  Security Council for an emergency meeting.
[02:26:11.341 --> 02:26:14.062]  So the Russians were the ones who asked first.
[02:26:14.062 --> 02:26:27.789]  Yes, the Georgians attacked Russian peacekeeping troops en masse, and the Russians did bring in backup troops in order to protect their peacekeeping troops.
[02:26:29.537 --> 02:26:32.419]  This is an incredible provocation!
[02:26:32.419 --> 02:26:41.743]  Well, you know, we talked about it before, and we knew it was coming, for listeners at least, of this program, and a handful of others.
[02:26:41.743 --> 02:26:44.344]  The American public certainly didn't know.
[02:26:44.344 --> 02:26:56.650]  And Russia is legitimately there, and the petitioning has been going on for over ten years, and it's been accepted by the UN.
[02:26:59.395 --> 02:27:07.539]  Georgia has created an act of war, and how far they intend to go with it remains to be seen.
[02:27:07.539 --> 02:27:11.041]  It's a battle they cannot win, Georgia.
[02:27:11.041 --> 02:27:12.622]  I mean... Why did they do it then?
[02:27:12.622 --> 02:27:13.363]  We know U.S.
[02:27:13.363 --> 02:27:15.124]  forces totally run it.
[02:27:15.124 --> 02:27:19.006]  The third largest contingent of troops after U.S.-British is Georgian.
[02:27:19.006 --> 02:27:24.629]  In Iraq, this is a little military enclave of the globalists.
[02:27:24.629 --> 02:27:28.171]  I mean, they did this on purpose, which they admit they did.
[02:27:28.171 --> 02:27:28.871]  This is incredible.
[02:27:30.239 --> 02:27:43.465]  Yeah, and they just want another conflict, and as I said earlier, to divert people's thinking, because they can't do Iran, to divert people's thinking about the economic and financial chaos that's going on.
[02:27:43.465 --> 02:27:50.609]  And if you look at what preceded this, you know, one day this week we're up 325 points, the next day we're down 225.
[02:27:53.942 --> 02:27:55.323]  Today, we're up 225.
[02:27:55.323 --> 02:27:59.105]  The market is getting bombed.
[02:27:59.105 --> 02:27:59.545]  The U.S.
[02:27:59.545 --> 02:28:02.867]  government is in there holding the market up.
[02:28:02.867 --> 02:28:08.110]  And they knew this was coming, and that's why they're in the market en masse.
[02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:17.015]  Two weeks ago, they attacked the commodity market, the precious metals market, and they started to take the U.S.
[02:28:17.015 --> 02:28:19.857]  dollar and the USDX index from 72 up to over 75.
[02:28:23.079 --> 02:28:36.824]  All of this is market rigging by the United States government in anticipation of this latest entry into limited or perhaps major warfare.
[02:28:36.824 --> 02:28:39.985]  I think it's going to turn into major warfare.
[02:28:39.985 --> 02:28:42.806]  And the pipeline's at stake.
[02:28:42.806 --> 02:28:45.847]  Israel wants that oil coming to a lot.
[02:28:45.847 --> 02:28:50.188]  And Turkey wants it transversing its property.
[02:28:50.188 --> 02:28:52.209]  And the Russians don't want that to happen.
[02:28:53.272 --> 02:29:19.320]  And as Mr. Roberts said, the regime in Georgia is a puppet regime, and what'll probably happen here is if the Georgian troops don't withdraw, then war will begin in earnest, and Georgia will be taken over by the Russians.
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:22.801]  And as Mr. Roberts says, America doesn't have
[02:29:23.567 --> 02:29:32.431]  Well, stay there.
[02:29:32.431 --> 02:29:39.694]  I want to get your analysis on why, if the cards are stacked against the neocons, why they keep doing this.
[02:29:39.694 --> 02:29:42.835]  I mean, like you said, the Israelis couldn't even beat Hezbollah.
[02:29:42.835 --> 02:29:44.456]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:44.456 --> 02:29:47.437]  The world is heating up, and I think this is only the beginning.
[02:29:47.437 --> 02:29:48.778]  Unfortunately, stay with us.
[02:29:51.764 --> 02:29:53.165]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.165 --> 02:29:55.686]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.686 --> 02:30:01.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.890 --> 02:30:03.311]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:03.311 --> 02:30:06.133]  A new world order.
[02:30:06.133 --> 02:30:11.036]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:11.036 --> 02:30:13.858]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:13.858 --> 02:30:16.639]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:30:16.639 --> 02:30:19.061]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:30:19.817 --> 02:30:27.156]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:30:30.169 --> 02:30:35.692]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:30:35.692 --> 02:30:39.494]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:30:39.494 --> 02:30:42.055]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:30:42.055 --> 02:30:43.215]  Most people have no idea.
[02:30:43.215 --> 02:30:43.996]  They're not after money.
[02:30:43.996 --> 02:30:45.276]  They have all the money they need.
[02:30:45.276 --> 02:30:46.257]  They're after power.
[02:30:46.257 --> 02:30:47.418]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:30:56.902 --> 02:30:58.403]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:30:59.003 --> 02:31:00.764]  You have been warned.
[02:31:00.764 --> 02:31:04.206]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:31:04.206 --> 02:31:06.508]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:31:06.508 --> 02:31:09.810]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:31:09.810 --> 02:31:16.694]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:31:16.694 --> 02:31:18.815]  Online, from my desk, with WebEx.
[02:31:19.315 --> 02:31:22.598]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:31:22.598 --> 02:31:27.382]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:31:27.382 --> 02:31:31.325]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:31:31.325 --> 02:31:32.947]  Travel less, meet online.
[02:31:32.947 --> 02:31:35.609]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[02:31:43.015 --> 02:31:43.595]  We're good.
[02:32:00.826 --> 02:32:06.769]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:32:06.769 --> 02:32:11.571]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:32:11.571 --> 02:32:16.973]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:32:16.973 --> 02:32:20.415]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:32:20.895 --> 02:32:21.176]  I think so.
[02:32:41.578 --> 02:32:42.099]  I think so.
[02:33:13.863 --> 02:33:17.405]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:33:17.405 --> 02:33:23.188]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:33:23.188 --> 02:33:26.009]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:33:26.009 --> 02:33:32.532]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:33:32.532 --> 02:33:35.754]  I sat down with Big Brother.
[02:33:35.754 --> 02:33:37.095]  Don't like those RFIDs.
[02:33:41.542 --> 02:33:45.143]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:33:45.143 --> 02:33:51.004]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:51.004 --> 02:33:53.625]  I'm on CNN, I'm on ABC News, I'm on Fox.
[02:33:53.625 --> 02:33:55.385]  It's just hard to leave in a headline.
[02:33:55.385 --> 02:33:58.566]  It's, oh, Georgia says country is under attack by Russia.
[02:33:58.566 --> 02:34:00.007]  See, that's a deceptive way to lie.
[02:34:00.007 --> 02:34:02.627]  Because they're not actually lying by the letter of the law.
[02:34:02.627 --> 02:34:09.789]  Georgia says... You know, they say they're under attack by Russia.
[02:34:10.518 --> 02:34:12.660]  Meanwhile, it was Georgia that attacked Russian forces.
[02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:16.683]  That's buried in all the stories.
[02:34:16.683 --> 02:34:18.624]  Then McCain comes out and says, how dare you, Russia?
[02:34:18.624 --> 02:34:19.045]  Pull out.
[02:34:19.045 --> 02:34:20.086]  It's terrible what you did.
[02:34:20.086 --> 02:34:22.848]  So they start a fight with him and then say, look, Russia, you attacked.
[02:34:22.848 --> 02:34:24.149]  You have to leave.
[02:34:24.149 --> 02:34:26.971]  And the simple-minded American people will probably say, yeah!
[02:34:26.971 --> 02:34:32.556]  I don't like Russia being in Georgia inside the U.S.
[02:34:32.556 --> 02:34:36.899]  How dare Russia invade the South?
[02:34:36.899 --> 02:34:38.080]  That's worse than what
[02:34:39.844 --> 02:34:41.405]  Lincoln did!
[02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:43.446]  Didn't we already have one civil war?
[02:34:43.446 --> 02:34:46.588]  My God, the Russians have attacked Georgia!
[02:34:46.588 --> 02:34:47.328]  Literally, folks.
[02:34:47.328 --> 02:34:48.689]  You're gonna see that, and you're gonna hear that.
[02:34:48.689 --> 02:34:51.691]  I'm not joking.
[02:34:51.691 --> 02:34:53.052]  That's how dumb the public is.
[02:34:53.052 --> 02:34:54.993]  They'll probably think that it's Georgia.
[02:34:54.993 --> 02:34:57.614]  Russians attacked Georgia!
[02:34:57.614 --> 02:34:58.354]  I'm not even joking.
[02:34:58.354 --> 02:34:59.075]  You think I'm joking?
[02:34:59.075 --> 02:35:00.876]  I'm serious.
[02:35:00.876 --> 02:35:08.040]  And, uh, I just hope this de-escalates, and... Last time what happened is the Russians poured into Pristina,
[02:35:11.278 --> 02:35:14.741]  At the end of the attack of the U.S.
[02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:33.293]  finance with the communist Muslims, what a weird combination, out of Albania into Kosovo and then they, when the Russians came in and with the big armored columns and had big, had serious standoffs with the U.S.
[02:35:33.293 --> 02:35:39.638]  troops, then Wesley Clark gave the order to Sir Peter Jackson
[02:35:41.087 --> 02:35:55.137]  The head of the NATO forces to bomb the tarmac, to bomb the Pristina Airport where the Russians were landing with their big cargo jets and discouraging tanks and special forces.
[02:35:55.137 --> 02:35:58.299]  And Jackson said no.
[02:35:58.299 --> 02:35:58.999]  So the U.S.
[02:35:58.999 --> 02:36:03.883]  did give the order to attack Russians once before.
[02:36:03.883 --> 02:36:06.344]  And that's been going back into ancient times.
[02:36:06.344 --> 02:36:07.225]  That was part of Russia.
[02:36:07.225 --> 02:36:08.025]  Serbia was.
[02:36:08.025 --> 02:36:10.087]  And then they held back, of course, the
[02:36:11.337 --> 02:36:14.239]  During the Crusades, one of the invasions by the Muslims.
[02:36:14.239 --> 02:36:19.601]  So it's a big part of their history there.
[02:36:19.601 --> 02:36:22.142]  And then the Russians were in a stalemate.
[02:36:22.142 --> 02:36:24.023]  They didn't shoot.
[02:36:24.023 --> 02:36:25.924]  They didn't fire.
[02:36:25.924 --> 02:36:28.065]  The British refused to attack.
[02:36:28.065 --> 02:36:31.807]  Under orders by Wesley Clark, who's supposedly a liberal.
[02:36:31.807 --> 02:36:34.169]  I mean, it's both parties.
[02:36:34.169 --> 02:36:36.009]  Who was the general in charge on the ground.
[02:36:36.009 --> 02:36:40.172]  But again, the higher-ups, Jackson said no out of England.
[02:36:40.172 --> 02:36:40.972]  NATO head at the time.
[02:36:43.898 --> 02:36:46.119]  And then a deal was made to the Russians.
[02:36:46.119 --> 02:36:48.961]  Okay, we promise we'll never break away, Kosovo.
[02:36:48.961 --> 02:36:53.423]  We just want autonomy for both sides.
[02:36:53.423 --> 02:36:58.406]  Let UN peacekeepers come in and NATO peacekeepers, I-4.
[02:36:58.406 --> 02:37:06.870]  Let them come in and fully encircle you from Macedonia into northern Albania, into Kosovo, and up to the central areas of Serbia proper.
[02:37:07.555 --> 02:37:16.797]  And then of course they lied and cheated and years later had it break away and handed it over and then ethnically cleansed the Serbs, the Serb minority.
[02:37:16.797 --> 02:37:18.378]  It's a large minority.
[02:37:18.378 --> 02:37:19.778]  It was like 37 percent.
[02:37:19.778 --> 02:37:22.319]  You can go look it up.
[02:37:22.319 --> 02:37:33.561]  And it just keeps happening as a domino and Russia sees them moving and all these weapons around them and then they have the Georgians.
[02:37:33.561 --> 02:37:34.642]  That's on the Black Sea, folks.
[02:37:34.642 --> 02:37:35.462]  That's not in the U.S.
[02:37:36.685 --> 02:37:40.847]  That's for neocons and liberals out there that have been drinking fluoride, had a lot of vaccines, and their brain damaged.
[02:37:40.847 --> 02:37:42.627]  I'm serious.
[02:37:42.627 --> 02:37:48.169]  That's over Eastern Europe, bordering Central Asia.
[02:37:48.169 --> 02:37:49.089]  And they attacked him.
[02:37:49.089 --> 02:37:52.850]  They attacked him yesterday, last night.
[02:37:52.850 --> 02:37:56.712]  And you notice the media's real careful not to say Russia attacked.
[02:37:56.712 --> 02:37:56.972]  They say,
[02:37:57.961 --> 02:38:02.925]  The Georgia says, and every headline's the same, Georgian President says they're under attack.
[02:38:02.925 --> 02:38:05.326]  Georgian President says Russia attacking.
[02:38:05.326 --> 02:38:13.032]  You know, they won't come out and say because the fact is U.S.-backed Georgia with Marines and Army and others attack them.
[02:38:13.032 --> 02:38:14.793]  Again, any other key points you want to make, Bob Chapman?
[02:38:14.793 --> 02:38:15.454]  The more I go, calls.
[02:38:18.152 --> 02:38:41.761]  I just think the geopolitical aspects, and that's the Balkanization of those states surrounding Russia, anything to cause disruption has been going on, as Mr. Roberts pointed out earlier, for a long time, not only in Georgia with the rigged elections, but also in the Ukraine and other countries in that region.
[02:38:42.581 --> 02:38:54.026]  And, you know, the administration for the past eight years has been fast at trying to create problems, and particularly political problems.
[02:38:54.026 --> 02:38:59.248]  And now they're ready to go at it, and it's going to be as a series of
[02:38:59.950 --> 02:39:04.054]  Brushwire fire wars and this will be one of them.
[02:39:04.054 --> 02:39:09.760]  Kosovo will ignite soon and they'll have Russia fighting on two fronts.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.424]  The missiles will be pointed at installations from Russia into Europe.
[02:39:14.108 --> 02:39:16.089]  As well as major European cities.
[02:39:16.089 --> 02:39:17.010]  Yeah, let's stop there.
[02:39:17.010 --> 02:39:27.157]  What does it mean to you when the Russian foreign ministry and the head foreign minister repeatedly in the last six months over and over again, the latest was in July, say we'll use military action.
[02:39:27.157 --> 02:39:30.860]  You keep moving weapons and troops and training onto our borders.
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:33.121]  We may use military option including nuclear.
[02:39:33.121 --> 02:39:34.642]  That's a quote.
[02:39:34.642 --> 02:39:36.363]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:39:36.363 --> 02:39:38.605]  And the missiles that they intend to put in
[02:39:39.911 --> 02:39:50.514]  Along the border, in regard to the Polish missile situation, are non-nuclear, at least at this point.
[02:39:50.514 --> 02:39:59.957]  But the whole thing is escalating, and it's part of a plan to keep the world in turmoil, because we're headed into trouble.
[02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:02.778]  And as I pointed out earlier, in the markets themselves,
[02:40:03.570 --> 02:40:21.260]  This was all prearranged because, you know, they were trying to drive the stock markets up, the bond market up, commodities and precious metals down, drive the dollar up, because in anticipation of this, this is not going to get better in South Ascensia.
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:24.462]  It's going to get worse.
[02:40:24.462 --> 02:40:28.645]  And our troops are in there, and they're going to be in a mangle machine.
[02:40:29.426 --> 02:40:34.311]  They shouldn't be there, and I wouldn't want the duty, I'll tell you that.
[02:40:34.311 --> 02:40:36.453]  I'm very, very disappointed that U.S.
[02:40:36.453 --> 02:40:38.254]  troops are in there.
[02:40:38.254 --> 02:40:47.263]  The Israelis are contractors, they're ex-military people, and, you know, when you're a mercenary, you take your money and take your chances.
[02:40:48.146 --> 02:41:15.292]  But, um, a very disappointed American Marines have been sent in there, uh, because... And notice, we're not getting into tales about the maneuvers, it's just that two of the major cities are under bombardment, uh, that there's forces clashing, uh, and the Georgian President's acting like he's been attacked when he started it, and, um, I mean, again, getting your... The Georgians are no match for the Russians.
[02:41:16.297 --> 02:41:17.557]  They'll have them for breakfast.
[02:41:17.557 --> 02:41:23.339]  Whether they get Israeli or American advisors or not is irrelevant.
[02:41:23.339 --> 02:41:25.920]  The Russians are far better trained.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:27.681]  And then we were talking about Kosovo.
[02:41:27.681 --> 02:41:36.404]  Tracey, who's the president of Kosovo, which was stolen, a state that's been with Serbia for thousands of years, has been stolen.
[02:41:36.404 --> 02:41:41.325]  This guy is one of the worst criminals in the region.
[02:41:41.325 --> 02:41:42.746]  He's a known narcotics trafficker.
[02:41:43.698 --> 02:41:55.581]  Well, that's where all the opium from Afghanistan, which is being cultivated by the CIA and MI6, is being sent there for distribution to Europe and the United States.
[02:41:55.581 --> 02:41:57.742]  And by the way, that's really what that's all about.
[02:42:03.411 --> 02:42:06.574]  That's what our troops are there for, is to guard the heroin for your kids.
[02:42:06.574 --> 02:42:07.995]  And it's right out in the open!
[02:42:07.995 --> 02:42:09.516]  They don't even hide it anymore!
[02:42:09.516 --> 02:42:13.559]  They openly send down special forces to take control of the cocaine in Columbia.
[02:42:13.559 --> 02:42:15.501]  I mean, it's just right out in the open!
[02:42:15.501 --> 02:42:19.184]  Meanwhile, SWAT teams will SWAT team you all day long.
[02:42:19.184 --> 02:42:21.986]  They'll mail marijuana to a mayor's house they want to get.
[02:42:21.986 --> 02:42:23.988]  Thank God the mayor didn't open the box.
[02:42:23.988 --> 02:42:26.410]  They go and kill both his dogs as the dogs run away.
[02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:29.412]  I mean, it's just a joke!
[02:42:29.412 --> 02:42:31.213]  Yeah, we're in for real trouble.
[02:42:31.213 --> 02:42:31.734]  Everywhere.
[02:42:32.626 --> 02:42:37.508]  And so, uh, keep your powder dry, and, uh, keep everything well-oiled.
[02:42:37.508 --> 02:42:43.830]  Bob, what do you think's gonna- I mean, if you had to dead reckon- estimate how this is gonna unfold, what do you think's gonna happen?
[02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:45.890]  Well, I think it's gonna get worse.
[02:42:45.890 --> 02:42:51.752]  I think the Russians, uh, are gonna be forced to move, and they're gonna go- move into Georgia.
[02:42:51.752 --> 02:42:53.733]  It's as simple as that.
[02:42:53.733 --> 02:42:55.434]  And I don't- I don't think they'll stop.
[02:42:55.434 --> 02:42:56.634]  I mean, they've been attacked.
[02:42:57.599 --> 02:43:02.003]  They'll probably hold back to see if the Georgian forces will pull back.
[02:43:02.003 --> 02:43:03.845]  I don't think they will.
[02:43:03.845 --> 02:43:07.468]  And if they move forward, they'll be decimated.
[02:43:07.468 --> 02:43:09.009]  They will be decimated.
[02:43:09.009 --> 02:43:14.374]  The Russian air power alone will just take out the entire entourage.
[02:43:14.374 --> 02:43:16.876]  I mean, their bases are just hundreds of miles away.
[02:43:16.876 --> 02:43:22.461]  The whole thing, like Dr. Roberts said, is insanity.
[02:43:22.461 --> 02:43:23.582]  These people are nuts.
[02:43:28.149 --> 02:43:34.231]  Well, it's just like the crazy police now, tasering people to death, beating women up on video, not getting in trouble.
[02:43:34.231 --> 02:43:36.412]  Just all of this.
[02:43:36.412 --> 02:43:45.055]  We have become insane as a nation, and all these petty bullies are just on psychopathic power trips.
[02:43:45.055 --> 02:43:49.837]  Well, if they continue to do what they're doing, they're going to have problems.
[02:43:52.791 --> 02:43:56.674]  Well, why would the Russian Foreign Minister threaten to use nuclear weapons against us?
[02:43:56.674 --> 02:44:00.798]  I mean, that's unprecedented, and the media just doesn't even hardly report on it.
[02:44:00.798 --> 02:44:04.861]  Well, look, Russian counterintelligence is every bit as good as the U.S.
[02:44:04.861 --> 02:44:06.343]  and European.
[02:44:06.343 --> 02:44:09.566]  And they know things that they're not going to tell us that they know.
[02:44:09.566 --> 02:44:14.830]  And they know exactly what the United States, Great Britain, and Europe are up to.
[02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:16.632]  They know all about the Illuminati.
[02:44:16.632 --> 02:44:18.273]  They know who runs Europe.
[02:44:18.273 --> 02:44:20.335]  I mean, who do you think they just kicked out of there?
[02:44:21.411 --> 02:44:24.233]  All of those oligarchs, they were all financed from Europe.
[02:44:24.233 --> 02:44:26.155]  They were all Rothschild friends that came out.
[02:44:26.155 --> 02:44:28.757]  That's right, exactly.
[02:44:28.757 --> 02:44:31.819]  And so it's the same group doing the same thing.
[02:44:31.819 --> 02:44:33.801]  They want to control Russia.
[02:44:33.801 --> 02:44:40.366]  And Russia is in a position to cause them grievous harm not only physically, they now have
[02:44:42.005 --> 02:44:56.492]  600 billion dollars in gold in foreign exchange and all they have to do is start selling dollars and the whole bottom will come out of the US market.
[02:44:56.492 --> 02:45:01.254]  Maybe, maybe that's what the neocons, the Illuminati want.
[02:45:01.254 --> 02:45:02.195]  We're gonna find out.
[02:45:03.388 --> 02:45:06.133]  It's very, very bullish for gold and silver, I'll tell you that.
[02:45:15.683 --> 02:45:20.105]  She calls it the death's head group, which translates to skull and bones.
[02:45:20.105 --> 02:45:27.388]  And imagine a top advisor to one of our presidents saying, there's a satanic group that runs Europe and the U.S.
[02:45:27.388 --> 02:45:29.148]  and they're going to stage World War III.
[02:45:29.148 --> 02:45:31.549]  She said that seven years ago.
[02:45:31.549 --> 02:45:35.351]  And she said they stage 9-11 too, I forgot.
[02:45:35.351 --> 02:45:37.131]  She's absolutely correct.
[02:45:37.131 --> 02:45:41.593]  And we're on the right track and we're putting the truth out there on these programs.
[02:45:41.593 --> 02:45:44.354]  And we are injuring them grievously.
[02:45:45.325 --> 02:45:52.289]  Because your program and programs like you are picking up more and more listeners every day because people want the truth.
[02:45:52.289 --> 02:45:54.410]  And they're not getting it in the news.
[02:45:54.410 --> 02:45:57.292]  It's as simple as that, and we know that, and they know that.
[02:45:57.292 --> 02:46:02.135]  And so, we're making some great headway here.
[02:46:02.135 --> 02:46:07.678]  Well, I hope the psychopathic sadists that run our society
[02:46:09.924 --> 02:46:10.964]  Uh, they're not gonna stop.
[02:46:10.964 --> 02:46:12.545]  It's just all gotta fall apart.
[02:46:12.545 --> 02:46:20.106]  Everybody's gotta be bankrupt and live in the streets before all the smart-mouthed cops and all the punk government people and all the yuppies and all the know-it-alls.
[02:46:20.106 --> 02:46:25.187]  You know, they've just gotta have it fall completely apart before they grow up, I think.
[02:46:25.187 --> 02:46:27.888]  Yeah, and half of them won't be around to see it.
[02:46:27.888 --> 02:46:30.708]  Because that's the way these kind of things end up.
[02:46:30.708 --> 02:46:33.409]  You talk about population control, well, you've got it coming.
[02:46:36.221 --> 02:46:37.704]  Well, things are certainly escalating.
[02:46:37.704 --> 02:46:40.349]  Do you think they're going to hit Iran?
[02:46:40.349 --> 02:46:40.970]  Not a chance.
[02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:43.335]  No, I do not.
[02:46:43.335 --> 02:46:46.280]  And if you listen to the European alumnus,
[02:46:47.494 --> 02:46:55.517]  Which is headed up by Brzezinski, at least in the front of the rank.
[02:46:55.517 --> 02:46:59.078]  And I disagree with Mr. Roberts on this.
[02:46:59.078 --> 02:47:00.379]  These are his ideas.
[02:47:00.379 --> 02:47:02.679]  I've been reading this guy for years.
[02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:11.042]  I started subscribing to Foreign Affairs in 1960, which is the organ of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:47:11.042 --> 02:47:12.022]  And these people are brash.
[02:47:12.022 --> 02:47:15.023]  They come right out and tell you what they're going to do.
[02:47:15.023 --> 02:47:16.364]  In fairness to you, Ann Roberts,
[02:47:17.088 --> 02:47:19.550]  He's talking about Brzezinski's public statements, but you're right.
[02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:25.134]  In policy reports, he's been calling since the mid-70s for this encirclement, for the brush fires.
[02:47:25.134 --> 02:47:26.875]  He's been saying, don't attack Iran.
[02:47:26.875 --> 02:47:28.896]  He said this a few months ago.
[02:47:28.896 --> 02:47:30.197]  Russia's the enemy.
[02:47:30.197 --> 02:47:31.158]  And so you're right.
[02:47:31.158 --> 02:47:34.841]  Roberts is going off his public statements.
[02:47:34.841 --> 02:47:38.843]  Well, that's where psycho-political warfare comes in.
[02:47:38.843 --> 02:47:44.668]  And you've got to be trained to look for these things, and I was.
[02:47:44.668 --> 02:47:46.449]  But not that I'm going to be right all the time.
[02:47:47.168 --> 02:47:50.230]  Unfortunately, I'm right too often.
[02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:53.151]  And this is where this is headed.
[02:47:53.151 --> 02:47:56.272]  You know, it's just not good.
[02:47:56.272 --> 02:48:01.655]  And everything that you've said here on the program, and the doctor and myself, is from right on.
[02:48:01.655 --> 02:48:03.916]  I mean, it is the way it is.
[02:48:03.916 --> 02:48:06.117]  I don't think the listeners even understand.
[02:48:08.411 --> 02:48:13.895]  How big this is to have the Georgian military backed by the U.S.
[02:48:13.895 --> 02:48:16.256]  attack Russian forces.
[02:48:16.256 --> 02:48:17.617]  This is huge.
[02:48:17.617 --> 02:48:19.859]  This is unprecedented.
[02:48:19.859 --> 02:48:21.620]  And it's some type of a test balloon.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:30.445]  I mean, obviously, this is a probe by Cheney and the New World Order neocons, the Anglo-American arm, to test and see what Russia will do.
[02:48:30.445 --> 02:48:35.268]  And then Russia knows that if they do pull back out, that any deals reached with the U.S.
[02:48:35.268 --> 02:48:35.889]  will be broken.
[02:48:36.596 --> 02:48:39.919]  So I don't think... Yeah.
[02:48:39.919 --> 02:48:48.065]  Yeah, this is like, you know, akin to Ireland attacking Great Britain, uh, England.
[02:48:48.065 --> 02:48:53.149]  It's very similar.
[02:48:53.149 --> 02:49:05.378]  You might even, you know, compare this to Hitler's march into Sudetenland, which was a German enclave in Czechoslovakia.
[02:49:05.378 --> 02:49:05.578]  Well...
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:11.041]  For those that know history, this is horrifying.
[02:49:11.041 --> 02:49:29.005]  I don't think most of the thumbsuckers out there, the establishment people who listen to the show and laugh at it... You know, it's just we've been too far along, removed from pain and suffering and hardship, or the real world, and I just see these giggling, smirking, laughing people that laugh at everything we talk about, and it's not funny.
[02:49:29.005 --> 02:49:32.026]  And I really feel sorry for them, Bob.
[02:49:32.026 --> 02:49:34.987]  Yeah, because a lot of them aren't going to be with us five years from now.
[02:49:35.914 --> 02:49:38.275]  And they'll say, well, why did this happen?
[02:49:38.275 --> 02:49:41.536]  And the answer is, you refuse to listen.
[02:49:41.536 --> 02:49:43.897]  You won't think.
[02:49:43.897 --> 02:49:51.661]  You don't care anything about anything except what's going to make you happy.
[02:49:51.661 --> 02:49:55.262]  You don't have any responsibility.
[02:49:55.262 --> 02:49:58.824]  Everything is situation ethics.
[02:49:58.824 --> 02:50:01.185]  You do what you feel like doing, what makes you feel good.
[02:50:02.111 --> 02:50:06.856]  And that's not how you're supposed to deport your life.
[02:50:06.856 --> 02:50:14.103]  A good example is, up until perhaps 20 years ago, everybody saved.
[02:50:14.103 --> 02:50:19.729]  For the last 10 years, we have a deficit in saving, but yet people are spending more than they have.
[02:50:21.148 --> 02:50:22.089]  And what does that mean?
[02:50:22.089 --> 02:50:27.875]  It means that people are borrowing money to continue this extravagant lifestyle that they have.
[02:50:27.875 --> 02:50:30.598]  And it's not only in America, it's in a number of other countries as well.
[02:50:30.598 --> 02:50:34.943]  And if you tell them it's going to destroy our country, they laugh at you and call you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:50:34.943 --> 02:50:35.403]  Really?
[02:50:35.403 --> 02:50:38.426]  I mean, this is about denial.
[02:50:38.426 --> 02:50:41.049]  They want to believe the pipe dreams, don't they, Bob?
[02:50:41.049 --> 02:50:41.950]  That's right.
[02:50:41.950 --> 02:50:42.951]  Scott, Aaron, Mike.
[02:50:44.029 --> 02:50:46.231]  Mick, Jim, Mark, we're going to get to all of you.
[02:50:46.231 --> 02:50:50.354]  Wide open phones in the next segment and in the next hour with Bob Chapman.
[02:50:50.354 --> 02:50:54.357]  Whatever you want to bring up, whatever issue, but predominantly what's happening in Georgia.
[02:50:54.357 --> 02:50:56.179]  Some of you may not think it's a big deal.
[02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:58.620]  Believe me, it is a big deal.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.262]  U.S.-backed forces attack Russia.
[02:51:01.673 --> 02:51:05.036]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:51:05.036 --> 02:51:08.758]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:12.841]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:51:12.841 --> 02:51:17.545]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:51:17.545 --> 02:51:20.347]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:51:20.347 --> 02:51:25.491]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:51:25.971 --> 02:51:32.618]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:51:38.664 --> 02:51:41.607]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected.

[02:51:49.395 --> 02:51:51.378]  Or go to SprayYourPlate.com.
[02:51:51.378 --> 02:51:53.160]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.
[02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:55.182]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:51:55.182 --> 02:51:55.823]  Spray your plate!
[02:52:01.534 --> 02:52:03.675]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:52:03.675 --> 02:52:06.115]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:52:06.115 --> 02:52:08.376]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:52:08.376 --> 02:52:09.936]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:52:09.936 --> 02:52:11.617]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:52:11.617 --> 02:52:14.478]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[02:52:14.478 --> 02:52:18.139]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR.
[02:52:27.814 --> 02:52:33.958]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:52:33.958 --> 02:52:36.499]  An inside job?
[02:52:36.499 --> 02:52:37.420]  How dare you?
[02:52:40.566 --> 02:52:44.148]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:52:44.148 --> 02:52:46.649]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:52:46.649 --> 02:52:53.372]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:52:58.454 --> 02:53:00.935]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:53:01.525 --> 02:53:04.387]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[02:53:04.387 --> 02:53:06.009]  American Free Press.
[02:53:06.009 --> 02:53:10.532]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[02:53:10.532 --> 02:53:12.254]  American Free Press.
[02:53:12.254 --> 02:53:15.256]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[02:53:15.256 --> 02:53:18.019]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[02:53:18.019 --> 02:53:21.021]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[02:53:21.021 --> 02:53:23.303]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[02:53:23.303 --> 02:53:25.585]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[02:53:26.383 --> 02:53:27.004]  We're good to go.
[02:53:47.751 --> 02:53:49.434]  It's just like it sounds.
[02:53:49.434 --> 02:53:52.900]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:56.246]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:53:56.246 --> 02:54:00.634]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[02:54:19.583 --> 02:54:20.643]  Undoubtedly, U.S.
[02:54:20.643 --> 02:54:26.524]  advisors have been killed in massive military actions against the Russian military, the Russian bear.
[02:54:26.524 --> 02:54:37.067]  And will the American people ever be told, no?
[02:54:37.067 --> 02:54:39.367]  We're to be lied to, abused.
[02:54:39.367 --> 02:54:40.127]  But we like it.
[02:54:40.127 --> 02:54:44.088]  We smile in a self-satisfied way and giggle and delude ourselves.
[02:54:45.114 --> 02:54:46.015]  Yeah, I definitely believe, uh...
[02:55:02.216 --> 02:55:07.280]  That this is going to escalate into a big confrontation and possibly World War III.
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:10.063]  I do have a question for Bob Chapman.
[02:55:10.063 --> 02:55:14.806]  How soon do you think this is going to raise our oil prices?
[02:55:14.806 --> 02:55:16.428]  Because I know they've been dropping recently.
[02:55:16.428 --> 02:55:18.169]  Do you think it's going to go the other way?
[02:55:18.169 --> 02:55:22.633]  And do you think the Feds are going to stop if it escalates into a bigger thing and we get involved?
[02:55:22.633 --> 02:55:26.336]  Do you think the Feds are going to stop dumping money into the economy to try to save at that point?
[02:55:26.336 --> 02:55:27.477]  Well I would say the opposite.
[02:55:27.837 --> 02:55:27.917]  Well...
[02:55:50.454 --> 02:55:58.758]  You pretty well covered it, and that's why oil and precious metals have been down in anticipation of this event.
[02:55:58.758 --> 02:56:04.481]  This has been planned for a long time, and they wanted to make sure everything was going their way.
[02:56:04.481 --> 02:56:17.467]  It'll be detrimental to the dollar, so the gains of the dollar was up a penny and a half today on the USDX index, and at one time, I don't know what it's up now, but I would assume it would be negatively affecting the dollar as well.
[02:56:17.467 --> 02:56:18.267]  What about interest rates?
[02:56:19.822 --> 02:56:23.743]  Interest rates will remain unchanged officially.
[02:56:23.743 --> 02:56:28.204]  You saw what England and the European Central Bank did yesterday.
[02:56:28.204 --> 02:56:30.545]  But real interest rates are going up.
[02:56:30.545 --> 02:56:32.545]  Real interest rates are going up.
[02:56:32.545 --> 02:56:34.846]  They've become wavering in here.
[02:56:34.846 --> 02:56:35.566]  You look at the U.S.
[02:56:35.566 --> 02:56:37.206]  10-year Treasury note.
[02:56:37.206 --> 02:56:38.707]  It's been trading from about 390 to 416.
[02:56:45.927 --> 02:56:55.369]  I would think that the yield might go down here because there might be a small flight to quality.
[02:56:55.369 --> 02:57:01.131]  And if you notice, they had the stock market up over a couple of hundred points this morning, all in anticipation of this.
[02:57:01.131 --> 02:57:05.832]  Did they launch this attack on Russia on the launch of the Olympic Games as a smokescreen?
[02:57:07.365 --> 02:57:11.348]  I think it was an effort to keep it out of the news.
[02:57:11.348 --> 02:57:14.590]  They'll bring it back into the news when they need it.
[02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:18.573]  And they'll say, well, we can't do this, we can't do that.
[02:57:18.573 --> 02:57:24.637]  The economy stalled because we got this war going on, and we have to work toward the war effort now.
[02:57:24.637 --> 02:57:27.459]  And it's the same crap that I saw in the 1940s when I was a kid.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:36.221]  You know, Roosevelt set up and allowed the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor so we could get into the war.
[02:57:36.221 --> 02:57:39.042]  And here I'm watching all my neighbors come home in boxes.
[02:57:39.042 --> 02:57:40.302]  For what?
[02:57:40.302 --> 02:57:46.123]  Well, the same thing with the 1,000 Marines who are in a ringer over there now.
[02:57:46.123 --> 02:57:47.884]  And it shouldn't be there.
[02:57:47.884 --> 02:57:50.684]  And they shouldn't be in harm's way.
[02:57:50.684 --> 02:57:55.745]  You know, our troops who defend our country not go off into foreign wars.
[02:57:55.745 --> 02:57:58.466]  We don't have Alexander the Great in Washington today.
[02:58:01.423 --> 02:58:06.887]  No, we have a co-kid who likes gay prostitutes.
[02:58:06.887 --> 02:58:08.428]  Among other things.
[02:58:08.428 --> 02:58:15.473]  No wonder his wife's going to get rid of him after the game is over here in November, January.
[02:58:17.435 --> 02:58:18.715]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:58:18.715 --> 02:58:19.895]  Thank you for the call, Scott.

[02:58:58.368 --> 02:59:00.269]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.

[02:59:51.011 --> 02:59:53.993]  I will be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:59:53.993 --> 02:59:59.098]  with Dr. Roberts, who's agreed to come on, and I've yet to ask Bob Chapman if he can do that.
[02:59:59.098 --> 03:00:01.820]  But we'll continue to cover this Sunday for you.
[03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:08.545]  If things heat up really bad, you will know I will be in here live, Marathon Saturday.
[03:00:08.545 --> 03:00:14.611]  USA Today has now put out an article saying, questions answered on Russian-Georgia conflict.
[03:00:15.859 --> 03:00:17.460]  It is somewhat accurate.
[03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:19.421]  It's exactly what we told you.
[03:00:19.421 --> 03:00:22.062]  Fighting broke out Friday between Russia and a strong U.S.
[03:00:22.062 --> 03:00:24.803]  ally in the region, the Democratic Republic of Georgia.
[03:00:24.803 --> 03:00:31.185]  The violence could significantly destabilize Russia's ties with the West, and even influence the actions of U.S.
[03:00:31.185 --> 03:00:31.926]  troops in Iraq.
[03:00:31.926 --> 03:00:32.346]  U.S.
[03:00:32.346 --> 03:00:38.108]  editorial today's London correspondent Jeffrey Stinson answered some questions about the conflict.
[03:00:38.108 --> 03:00:40.029]  What are Georgia and Russia fighting over?
[03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:41.190]  Georgia launched.
[03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.650]  You hear that?
[03:00:41.650 --> 03:00:42.810]  Georgia launched.
[03:00:42.810 --> 03:00:43.871]  I mean, people are...
[03:00:44.972 --> 03:00:48.035]  In the message board saying we made that up with Dr. Roberts last hour.
[03:00:48.035 --> 03:00:51.958]  You people just never seems to amaze me, you little neocon cowards.
[03:00:51.958 --> 03:00:53.960]  Georgia launched a military strike.
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:54.801]  Let me say that again.
[03:00:54.801 --> 03:01:08.093]  Georgia launched, Georgia launched, Georgia launched, Georgia launched a military strike on the province of South Oseasia, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, aimed to reclaim it after 16 years of semi-independence.
[03:01:08.877 --> 03:01:12.940]  Okay, now that was an international agreement set up, agreed to by the parties by the UN.
[03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:16.222]  They engaged in an act of war, as Bob Chapman said, but what does he know?
[03:01:16.222 --> 03:01:18.824]  He was in counterintelligence against the Russians.
[03:01:18.824 --> 03:01:28.270]  In response, Russia sent tanks into Moscow, says Georgian forces, had killed Russian peacekeepers there, and were committing acts of ethnic cleansing of native Russians living there.
[03:01:28.850 --> 03:01:31.793]  Why does Moscow care what Georgia does in its own provinces?
[03:01:31.793 --> 03:01:33.074]  Its own provinces.
[03:01:33.074 --> 03:01:36.276]  See that spin, Georgia, which borders Russia as a former Soviet Republic.
[03:01:36.276 --> 03:01:38.898]  It declared its independence in 1991 after the collapse of communism.
[03:01:38.898 --> 03:01:43.702]  More than 70,000 people in South areas speak Russian and carry Russian passports.
[03:01:44.082 --> 03:01:50.468]  Relations between the two have been tense, and Moscow tries to reassert influence over nations that border it.
[03:01:50.468 --> 03:01:57.274]  Georgia has aligned itself with the West and wants to join NATO, a desire Bush administration supports, and has, of course, a bunch of U.S.
[03:01:57.274 --> 03:02:00.077]  forces, Marines, and Army there backing it up right now.
[03:02:00.077 --> 03:02:02.259]  Bob, is there any doubt right now that U.S.
[03:02:02.259 --> 03:02:03.821]  forces are fighting the Russians?
[03:02:05.026 --> 03:02:17.033]  No doubt whatsoever, and there's no doubt whatsoever that this whole episode is the work of the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[03:02:17.033 --> 03:02:19.134]  And they're the ones at fault.
[03:02:19.134 --> 03:02:20.775]  They are trying to start a war.
[03:02:20.775 --> 03:02:29.360]  It has nothing to do with the freedom of the Federal Republic of Georgia.
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:31.141]  That's laughable.
[03:02:31.141 --> 03:02:34.143]  Because the election was rigged there, and that's how that
[03:02:35.215 --> 03:02:37.076]  It's just incredible, Bob, to be seeing this unfold.
[03:02:37.076 --> 03:02:40.318]  Let's talk to Aaron in California here on the air, Aaron.
[03:02:59.295 --> 03:03:00.776]  Alex and Bob Chapman, this is Aaron.
[03:03:00.776 --> 03:03:04.620]  I wanted to talk to you about... I mean, this sounds like the perfect storm.
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:07.442]  You've got George Bush, who we all know runs nothing.
[03:03:07.442 --> 03:03:08.603]  You know, he's over in the Olympics.
[03:03:08.603 --> 03:03:11.626]  You've got a gigantic distraction going on.
[03:03:11.626 --> 03:03:17.751]  And at the same time, like you said, U.S.-backed forces are attacking Russia.
[03:03:17.751 --> 03:03:19.913]  I mean, are we that crazy?
[03:03:19.913 --> 03:03:24.216]  I mean, I know that 30% of America is going to think that that's Georgia in the South.
[03:03:27.742 --> 03:03:28.863]  We're not joking.
[03:03:28.863 --> 03:03:31.768]  Drive 50.
[03:03:31.768 --> 03:03:37.999]  They expect that the Russian Army, being led by a guy named Sherman, is going to attack Atlanta.
[03:03:40.536 --> 03:03:41.797]  Well, Alex, I wanted to thank you.
[03:03:41.797 --> 03:03:44.578]  Your film, Road to Tyranny, back in 2004 woke me up.
[03:03:44.578 --> 03:03:48.760]  I had the honor of meeting you in 2006 at the Scholars Symposium.
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:56.223]  Bob Chapman, I work here in California, one of the largest precious metals dealers, and all of these savvy customers know who you are.
[03:03:56.223 --> 03:04:00.845]  And I direct them to your website, and it's actually helped me do well in this industry.
[03:04:00.845 --> 03:04:07.448]  The information that you provide, and I know that you're quite the veteran in this industry, and I just respect you both very much.
[03:04:07.448 --> 03:04:07.728]  Thank you.
[03:04:09.557 --> 03:04:10.619]  Well, thanks for calling in.
[03:04:10.619 --> 03:04:11.660]  We appreciate it.
[03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:14.044]  Yeah, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:04:14.044 --> 03:04:17.209]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, here on the InfoWar.
[03:04:17.209 --> 03:04:19.292]  InfoWars.com.
[03:04:19.292 --> 03:04:22.277]  Tons of phone calls, more key analysis you won't get anywhere else.
[03:04:22.277 --> 03:04:23.980]  Right here, on the one and only GCN.
[03:04:29.617 --> 03:04:32.700]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:38.225]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:04:38.225 --> 03:04:43.950]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:45.432]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:04:45.432 --> 03:04:54.340]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:54.740]  Yes!
[03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:56.582]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:04:56.582 --> 03:05:00.787]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[03:05:24.602 --> 03:05:24.822]  Hi there.
[03:05:24.822 --> 03:05:26.743]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[03:05:33.477 --> 03:05:34.597]  I know, I know.
[03:05:34.597 --> 03:05:38.158]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[03:05:38.158 --> 03:05:41.399]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[03:05:41.399 --> 03:05:49.301]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[03:05:49.301 --> 03:05:50.201]  These days?
[03:05:50.201 --> 03:05:56.622]  Well, sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[03:05:56.622 --> 03:05:58.943]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[03:05:58.943 --> 03:06:00.343]  Well, call it what you want, but now
[03:06:03.507 --> 03:06:04.328]  You can I.M.
[03:06:04.328 --> 03:06:04.708]  me in dollars.
[03:06:29.654 --> 03:06:35.379]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:06:35.379 --> 03:06:36.700]  And we knew what to do.
[03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:41.524]  Or at least we... Yeah, you getting those callers?
[03:06:41.524 --> 03:06:42.185]  Yes.
[03:06:42.185 --> 03:06:43.086]  Okay.
[03:06:43.086 --> 03:06:45.748]  ...is a platform to tell their story.
[03:06:45.748 --> 03:06:51.673]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:06:53.129 --> 03:06:54.631]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:06:54.631 --> 03:07:01.718]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:07:01.718 --> 03:07:04.901]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:07:04.901 --> 03:07:09.967]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:07:10.647 --> 03:07:13.750]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:19.794]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:07:19.794 --> 03:07:22.716]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:22.716 --> 03:07:29.221]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:07:29.221 --> 03:07:34.645]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:34.645 --> 03:07:36.887]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:49.286 --> 03:08:06.560]  There is massive continual coverage at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of what's happening in Georgia, there in the central northern area bordering Russia, on the Black Sea.
[03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:11.184]  Look, bottom line, we need big articles up on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com done by our people.
[03:08:12.793 --> 03:08:14.354]  We have stories like evidence of U.S.
[03:08:14.354 --> 03:08:16.436]  military presence in Georgia, things like that.
[03:08:16.436 --> 03:08:18.137]  Well, that's all admitted.
[03:08:18.137 --> 03:08:24.142]  What we need to do is break down the fact that Russia has been attacked by U.S.-backed Georgia.
[03:08:24.142 --> 03:08:29.866]  Or, U.S.
[03:08:29.866 --> 03:08:31.387]  Georgia backed by U.S.
[03:08:31.387 --> 03:08:33.909]  attacks and kills Russian forces.
[03:08:33.909 --> 03:08:35.650]  I mean, that is unprecedented.
[03:08:35.650 --> 03:08:38.773]  In a ten-year
[03:08:41.172 --> 03:08:47.993]  agreement with Russian forces in that area for peacekeeping.
[03:08:47.993 --> 03:08:50.674]  In an ethnic Russian area.
[03:08:50.674 --> 03:08:53.314]  This is part of Russia, has been part of Russia in the past.
[03:08:53.314 --> 03:08:56.035]  Just unbelievable.
[03:08:56.035 --> 03:09:02.596]  Look, the military-industrial complex owns and runs our society and they just want more wars.
[03:09:02.596 --> 03:09:09.237]  And before all the good old boys weigh in on this and think it's a great thing, this is bad for our future, bad for our economy, bad for everything.
[03:09:11.874 --> 03:09:12.854]  Just amazing.
[03:09:12.854 --> 03:09:14.235]  Let's go back to your calls.
[03:09:14.235 --> 03:09:16.116]  Let's talk to Mick and P.A.
[03:09:16.116 --> 03:09:18.837]  Mick, you're on the air.
[03:09:18.837 --> 03:09:22.139]  Thank you so much for taking my call, Alex.
[03:09:22.139 --> 03:09:32.043]  It might sound a little bit out there, but 40, 50 years of obsessive compulsive disorder concerning what is truth, what's going on in this world.
[03:09:32.043 --> 03:09:40.267]  I believe we are, they are setting up a force, the powers that be are setting up this war to start World War IV.
[03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:51.946]  So we do go in, and we lose World War 4, and the USA is handed over to Communist China and other powers in the world.
[03:09:51.946 --> 03:09:58.189]  Well, they've said that China and Russia will be the center of it, and that the globalists have engineered all this to bankrupt the U.S.
[03:09:58.189 --> 03:10:01.952]  so they can buy it up, destroy our name, so we won't be the superpower.
[03:10:01.952 --> 03:10:04.673]  That is exactly what's going on here.
[03:10:04.673 --> 03:10:07.415]  Let's get Bob Chapman's take on that.
[03:10:07.415 --> 03:10:08.655]  I can't add much to that.
[03:10:08.655 --> 03:10:10.136]  Boy, that's perfect, Alex.
[03:10:10.136 --> 03:10:11.137]  You're absolutely right.
[03:10:12.472 --> 03:10:15.674]  This program's been going on for a long time.
[03:10:15.674 --> 03:10:31.045]  I think they decided in the late 50s, early 60s, when you saw the first GAAT and free trade and globalization get underway, and then we jumped off the gold standard in August the 15th of 71, and you put the two of them together and it's been downhill ever since.
[03:10:31.045 --> 03:10:33.067]  And that was deliberately taking us downhill.
[03:10:35.896 --> 03:10:36.476]  Absolutely.
[03:10:36.476 --> 03:10:40.337]  I think it may shake some people to their senses.
[03:10:40.337 --> 03:10:43.658]  Hopefully, maybe our military will save us.
[03:10:43.658 --> 03:10:52.701]  But if you look, the only thing forced in the way of these forces of evil in the world was Christianity and what used to be the USA.
[03:10:52.701 --> 03:11:05.065]  And people who study that said they didn't simply take over Russia and China and slaughter off 40 to 60 million innocent little peasants, they slaughtered off 40 to 60 million Christians.
[03:11:05.879 --> 03:11:09.101]  And I think that's what's in line for the U.S.A.
[03:11:09.101 --> 03:11:12.923]  They'll get the U.S.A., they'll get the Christians, they'll get the Utopo, the U.S.A.
[03:11:12.923 --> 03:11:14.323]  at once.
[03:11:14.323 --> 03:11:19.766]  And the world enters a thousand years of dark ages, and I don't know, do you think there's any prayer or military?
[03:11:21.254 --> 03:11:24.695]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:24.695 --> 03:11:32.377]  I think you've already seen Admiral Fallon and others say no to attacking Iran, and so that might be why that may not happen.
[03:11:32.377 --> 03:11:34.158]  Most experts we have won't say it is going to happen.
[03:11:34.158 --> 03:11:39.799]  Ron Paul, of course Dr. Roberts, Ray McGovern think it's on currently.
[03:11:39.799 --> 03:11:41.420]  Bob says he doesn't think it's on.
[03:11:41.420 --> 03:11:42.840]  I hope Bob's right.
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:48.582]  Bob, that's one of the few areas that you differ with on our other gallery of experts.
[03:11:50.069 --> 03:11:53.594]  Well, I think it's because I watch The Enemy.
[03:11:53.594 --> 03:11:59.243]  You know, if you're going to understand the criminal mind, you have to be able to think like them.
[03:11:59.243 --> 03:12:05.151]  And there are very few normal people who can think like criminals because it's alien to them.
[03:12:06.031 --> 03:12:08.793]  And I think I have that ability.
[03:12:08.793 --> 03:12:10.654]  They are criminals.
[03:12:10.654 --> 03:12:25.962]  And I listen to everything that they say, because they always tell you what they want to do, because if they have this egotistical bravado about them, that, you know, part of them being what they are, they have to let you know how superior they are.
[03:12:25.962 --> 03:12:34.367]  And when they're in that process, they also let you know that something's going on, and sometimes, specifically what's going on.
[03:12:35.107 --> 03:12:46.175]  And so, my take very often is different than others, and again, unfortunately, I usually am right, and that's not good for the world.
[03:12:46.175 --> 03:12:47.756]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[03:12:47.756 --> 03:12:49.937]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[03:12:49.937 --> 03:12:50.638]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:12:52.225 --> 03:12:56.249]  Hey Alex, enjoyed listening to your show for all these years.
[03:12:56.249 --> 03:13:02.276]  I was listening to an interview on, I guess, right-wing neocon radio the other day with Nancy Pelosi.
[03:13:02.276 --> 03:13:06.800]  Yeah, but let's not associate it with right-wing, pro-Second Amendment, pro-America.
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:08.022]  This is the fake right-wing.
[03:13:09.108 --> 03:13:16.030]  Okay, you're making me laugh like that guy going down in that movie that I saw when I was a kid called Dr. Strangelove.
[03:13:16.030 --> 03:13:18.431]  You know, there's nothing that guy can do about it.
[03:13:18.431 --> 03:13:32.336]  But, uh, I just think that, you know, if they could get somebody in the Congress, you know, more people like Kucinich and Ron Paul, it would put a lot more light on what's going on.
[03:13:32.336 --> 03:13:34.217]  You know, I've been listening and I just...
[03:13:35.367 --> 03:13:43.549]  I turned a lot of my friends on to what's going on, and we're all sitting around here at a break at work right now, listening to your show.
[03:13:43.549 --> 03:13:45.330]  And they're just like, their mouths are open.
[03:13:45.330 --> 03:13:46.870]  They can't believe what they're hearing.
[03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:48.590]  Well, let's be clear here.
[03:13:48.590 --> 03:13:52.411]  It isn't like we just jumped on this today and said, see, we told you so.
[03:13:52.411 --> 03:13:57.933]  Who would have thought you'd have U.S.-backed Georgian forces with Marines and Army attacking
[03:13:58.633 --> 03:13:59.194]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:14:21.856 --> 03:14:35.984]  And I just wish we could reach more people, and I wish there were more people like Alex on the radio, like a thousand more every day, so that the public would finally get the truth and wake up.
[03:14:35.984 --> 03:14:39.406]  Well, they just haven't been thinking in a complex way about the way the world really works.
[03:14:39.406 --> 03:14:41.427]  They haven't studied history.
[03:14:41.427 --> 03:14:46.170]  And most Americans, again, can't find Georgia on a map in the U.S., much less Georgia
[03:14:47.898 --> 03:14:53.583]  In Europe, in Eastern Europe on the border of Central Asia.
[03:14:53.583 --> 03:15:01.669]  They just can't do it, and all they're hearing on the news is, Russia attacks Georgia?
[03:15:01.669 --> 03:15:08.855]  But then you read into all the deep headlines and they go, no, Georgia attacked and killed the Russians, and the Russians fought back.
[03:15:08.855 --> 03:15:11.277]  Now, the Russians have generally been showing restraint.
[03:15:11.957 --> 03:15:13.778]  And we'll probably be restrained.
[03:15:13.778 --> 03:15:15.820]  I hope they are, but Bob, you're saying you don't think that.
[03:15:15.820 --> 03:15:38.795]  You think they're going to go ahead and... Because if it's a provocation by the globalists controlling the U.S., it's not us doing it, but using our name and our military, and through us, another sub-puppet of Georgia, if they started the fight to try to escalate it, I guess they'll try to order the Georgian military to keep attacking the Russians to try to elicit an escalation.
[03:15:38.795 --> 03:15:41.577]  So we'll just see what happens in the next hours and days.
[03:15:45.925 --> 03:15:47.388]  Time will tell.
[03:15:47.388 --> 03:15:49.612]  Okay, thank you so much, Jim.
[03:15:49.612 --> 03:15:51.055]  Mark in Seattle.
[03:15:51.055 --> 03:15:52.497]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:15:53.504 --> 03:15:56.467]  Hi Alex, I really enjoy your show.
[03:15:56.467 --> 03:16:04.874]  You know, what amazes me is that I heard Lindsey Williams say on your show exactly what's been occurring.
[03:16:04.874 --> 03:16:06.535]  Oh, I forgot that!
[03:16:06.535 --> 03:16:11.019]  Two weeks ago he said oil would drop a bunch and that there'd be a conflict with Russia.
[03:16:11.019 --> 03:16:11.799]  He did say that.
[03:16:11.799 --> 03:16:12.780]  Yes, he did.
[03:16:12.780 --> 03:16:14.502]  And it's just blowing me away.
[03:16:14.502 --> 03:16:16.723]  Oil's down again today.
[03:16:16.723 --> 03:16:21.588]  You know, even with this conflict, gold has kind of broke an important
[03:16:23.118 --> 03:16:23.498]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:16:45.851 --> 03:16:58.529]  Well, earlier in the conversation I said that they have, in the last two to three weeks, taken commodities, precious metals, down in price.
[03:16:59.812 --> 03:17:13.082]  Although the commodities were overpriced, I believe, and the precious metals just kind of got thrown out with the bathwater, the markets... They always go down late in the summer.
[03:17:13.082 --> 03:17:15.724]  I mean, if this follows all the trends, it'll be way up in the fall.
[03:17:17.386 --> 03:17:18.187]  That's correct.
[03:17:18.187 --> 03:17:27.913]  By the end of September, probably, if history is correct, will be a tremendous reversal.
[03:17:27.913 --> 03:17:30.435]  But you don't know until you get there.
[03:17:30.435 --> 03:17:41.882]  But, you know, this is the fourth time that this 850-5560 level has been tested on the interday 845.
[03:17:41.882 --> 03:17:46.405]  And that happened to be the old high area previously in 1980.
[03:17:48.047 --> 03:17:53.932]  And so we're just going to have to relaunch.
[03:17:53.932 --> 03:17:55.713]  And I think that will happen.
[03:17:55.713 --> 03:18:06.883]  But the most disturbing factor, and more, I will say this is more disturbing, is the performance of the stock market.
[03:18:06.883 --> 03:18:11.127]  It is so obvious what the United States government is doing.
[03:18:11.127 --> 03:18:13.449]  I mean, markets don't act that way.
[03:18:14.511 --> 03:18:16.272]  I mean, I've been at this for 50 years.
[03:18:16.272 --> 03:18:18.213]  I was a stockbroker for 28 years.
[03:18:18.213 --> 03:18:19.754]  I own my own firm.
[03:18:19.754 --> 03:18:22.036]  I mean, I know that business.
[03:18:22.036 --> 03:18:27.679]  I know what propels markets and what should propel markets.
[03:18:27.679 --> 03:18:33.763]  And I believe that the whole thing is rigged on the stock market.
[03:18:33.763 --> 03:18:35.584]  And today is a wonderful example.
[03:18:35.584 --> 03:18:42.749]  I mean, how could you have what could be a new world war with the market going up 300 points with other
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:46.762]  Dreadful news at the same time.
[03:18:46.762 --> 03:18:49.825]  And massive layoffs everywhere.
[03:18:49.825 --> 03:18:56.951]  But the fundamentals are industry shutting down, dollar going down, debt going up, and the market's doing wonderful.
[03:18:56.951 --> 03:18:58.272]  That's the Plunge Protection Team.
[03:18:58.272 --> 03:18:58.852]  Thank you.
[03:18:58.852 --> 03:19:00.113]  Anything else?
[03:19:00.113 --> 03:19:01.855]  Anything else, Mark in Seattle?
[03:19:01.855 --> 03:19:02.355]  That's it.
[03:19:02.355 --> 03:19:05.057]  Just keep up the good work and God bless you, Alex.
[03:19:05.057 --> 03:19:05.758]  God bless you.
[03:19:05.758 --> 03:19:06.618]  Okay.
[03:19:06.618 --> 03:19:09.361]  Scott Drew, laser in the UK and others.

[03:19:15.513 --> 03:19:19.200]  Georgia, backed by the U.S., attacks Russian forces.
[03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:19.922]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:31.351 --> 03:19:36.993]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:19:36.993 --> 03:19:39.633]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.

[03:21:29.711 --> 03:21:42.865]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:21:42.865 --> 03:21:46.689]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.

[03:23:04.613 --> 03:23:09.377]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future
[03:23:09.718 --> 03:23:10.058]  I think so.
[03:23:34.085 --> 03:23:39.987]  It is confirmed, it's up on InfoWars.com, Israeli military advisors aid Georgia.
[03:23:39.987 --> 03:23:45.490]  They put this out last night out of the Israeli publication Debka file, very proud of themselves.
[03:23:45.490 --> 03:23:52.813]  Georgian tanks and infantry, aided by Israeli military advisors, captured the capital of Bregoie.
[03:23:52.813 --> 03:23:58.295]  Early Friday, August 8, bringing the Georgian-Russian conflict over the province to a military climax.
[03:23:58.295 --> 03:24:00.636]  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin threatened a military response.
[03:24:01.650 --> 03:24:07.474]  Former Soviet Georgia called up its military reserves after Russian warplanes bombed its new positions in the renegade province.
[03:24:07.474 --> 03:24:08.554]  Wow!
[03:24:08.554 --> 03:24:09.735]  I mean, renegade province?
[03:24:09.735 --> 03:24:13.998]  The Russians have always been there in that province.
[03:24:13.998 --> 03:24:15.199]  This is just incredible!
[03:24:16.044 --> 03:24:32.996]  We are here watching U.S., Israel-backed, NATO-backed forces attack and kill Russian troops, and then if you read the major headlines in the U.S., it's Georgia says Russia attacking, because they don't want to lie outright, so that's a semantical deception.
[03:24:34.042 --> 03:24:42.126]  That's like if you walk over and punch me in the face two or three times and then I start fighting back and you say, Alex Jones is attacking me!
[03:24:42.126 --> 03:24:46.188]  But no, everybody saw that you hit me first, or vice versa.
[03:24:46.188 --> 03:24:54.633]  They just treat us like such morons, but then in the Israeli publications and foreign publications, the truth is all being reported, but here,
[03:24:56.121 --> 03:24:58.702]  Man, we are just, I mean, we really are pathetic, Bob Chapman.
[03:24:58.702 --> 03:25:03.064]  I want to go to more calls, but I just really get sick by the ignorance.
[03:25:03.064 --> 03:25:10.447]  They know the public's ignorant, so they just abuse us in ways that are so amazing, and now bring us to the brink of war with Russia.
[03:25:10.447 --> 03:25:17.070]  Again, Russia is now engaging U.S., Israeli, and Georgian forces.
[03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:20.211]  This is incredible.
[03:25:20.211 --> 03:25:22.472]  And the stock markets have 300 points.
[03:25:22.472 --> 03:25:23.793]  That's even more incredible.
[03:25:27.011 --> 03:25:28.333]  A little manipulation?
[03:25:28.333 --> 03:25:35.485]  When's Wall Street gonna smarten up?
[03:25:35.485 --> 03:25:38.751]  I mean, you know, they're messing on their own work.
[03:25:40.839 --> 03:25:44.122]  I mean, you know, once this thing goes down, it's not coming back.
[03:25:44.122 --> 03:25:49.846]  They're all going to be at a job in selling apples for ten cents a piece or whatever.
[03:25:49.846 --> 03:25:53.409]  Well, I mean, all over Austin, media companies, K.I.
[03:25:53.409 --> 03:25:54.830]  laid off 14 people this morning.
[03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:56.211]  Is that even in the news?
[03:25:56.211 --> 03:25:57.752]  We have inside people inside K.I.
[03:25:57.752 --> 03:25:58.372]  that did.
[03:25:58.372 --> 03:26:00.274]  Is that news that 14 people got laid off this morning?
[03:26:01.067 --> 03:26:03.648]  Well, it's just a little TV station.
[03:26:03.648 --> 03:26:08.689]  The point is, layoffs everywhere, everything's falling apart, yuppies dancing around, everything's fine!
[03:26:08.689 --> 03:26:11.070]  Oh, Russia's evil, they attacked us, kill them!
[03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:14.731]  Meanwhile, if you read in the bottom of all the papers, they admit that we attacked them.
[03:26:14.731 --> 03:26:19.792]  Folks, our government is attacking Russian troops and killing them now!
[03:26:19.792 --> 03:26:21.552]  This is unprecedented!
[03:26:21.552 --> 03:26:23.893]  And the average yuppie probably thinks it's funny!
[03:26:23.893 --> 03:26:27.694]  There's people on the comment sections on InfoWars saying we're making this up, Bob!
[03:26:29.281 --> 03:26:39.545]  Well, wait till they step on one of those dead bodies and they get that fluid all over their boots and have it stinking for the next two weeks.
[03:26:39.545 --> 03:26:40.525]  They don't get it.
[03:26:40.525 --> 03:26:42.806]  They've never seen people die.
[03:26:42.806 --> 03:26:45.967]  And it isn't nice.
[03:26:45.967 --> 03:26:50.628]  Well, you know, it's sick what's happening, but I have to say it.
[03:26:50.628 --> 03:26:51.789]  This country's gonna fall.
[03:26:51.789 --> 03:26:57.711]  This country is rotten and mentally ill, and I just hope it doesn't end in nuclear war, Bob.
[03:26:59.634 --> 03:27:04.399]  I hope it doesn't either because you and I are going to end up crispy critters.
[03:27:04.399 --> 03:27:05.520]  Yeah, I'm in Austin, Texas.
[03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:07.662]  That's a major target.
[03:27:07.662 --> 03:27:11.286]  Uh, with all these military bases around it being a capital.
[03:27:11.286 --> 03:27:11.726]  Ah, whatever.
[03:27:11.726 --> 03:27:14.409]  Well, you can always move over the border, you know.
[03:27:14.409 --> 03:27:18.553]  Well, if nukes ever start going out, the yuppies will probably come out and say, oh no, it's a suntan.
[03:27:18.553 --> 03:27:19.194]  It's not a nuke.
[03:27:20.580 --> 03:27:21.201]  I'm not joking.
[03:27:21.201 --> 03:27:22.061]  They'll probably run into it.
[03:27:22.061 --> 03:27:24.984]  They'll probably drive in the mushroom clouds going, No, it's good!
[03:27:24.984 --> 03:27:26.205]  It's Al Qaeda!
[03:27:26.205 --> 03:27:26.845]  Oh, I love it!
[03:27:26.845 --> 03:27:27.846]  Oh, Bill Clinton!
[03:27:27.846 --> 03:27:28.947]  Save me!
[03:27:28.947 --> 03:27:30.028]  You know.
[03:27:30.028 --> 03:27:31.529]  Let's talk to Drew in California.
[03:27:31.529 --> 03:27:32.270]  Drew, you're on the air.
[03:27:32.270 --> 03:27:34.332]  Then Scott in Texas and others.
[03:27:34.332 --> 03:27:34.992]  Hey, Alex.
[03:27:34.992 --> 03:27:35.213]  Hi.
[03:27:35.213 --> 03:27:37.775]  I think I have an 888 connection for you.
[03:27:38.556 --> 03:27:40.758]  Like Bob Chapman said, you need to know your enemy.
[03:27:40.758 --> 03:27:45.161]  So I look at numerology and astrology, like 9-11 and the way that Washington D.C.
[03:27:45.161 --> 03:27:46.862]  is set up.
[03:27:46.862 --> 03:27:53.727]  Or 7-7, or the Bali bombing, or the Madrid bombing was on another date.
[03:27:53.727 --> 03:27:55.829]  They always do it on weird dates.
[03:27:55.829 --> 03:27:57.250]  Okay, I got this for you.
[03:27:57.250 --> 03:28:01.673]  The astrology symbol for Jupiter, which looks like a 24, is the 8 plus 8 plus 8.
[03:28:03.660 --> 03:28:09.243]  If you look at the mythology for Jupiter, it held the same role as Zeus in Greece.
[03:28:09.243 --> 03:28:10.904]  And America is Greek.
[03:28:10.904 --> 03:28:14.446]  Well, no, Jupiter's the Roman, yeah.
[03:28:14.446 --> 03:28:16.267]  And he is the Roman name for Zeus.
[03:28:16.267 --> 03:28:16.907]  Correct.
[03:28:16.907 --> 03:28:24.131]  And if you look at Tex Mars' book, Mysterious Monuments, page 97, you'll see America is Greece reincarnated.
[03:28:24.131 --> 03:28:29.153]  And you've got that other weapon, Rod the God, the lightning bolts of Zeus.
[03:28:29.153 --> 03:28:30.014]  You heard of that one?
[03:28:30.014 --> 03:28:30.234]  Yes.
[03:28:31.141 --> 03:28:33.890]  So that's my point with the 888 connection.
[03:28:33.890 --> 03:28:35.054]  That's the best I can give you.
[03:28:36.377 --> 03:28:39.498]  Yeah, they always do their bombings on weird dates.
[03:28:39.498 --> 03:28:40.658]  They're completely insane.
[03:28:40.658 --> 03:28:47.119]  Yeah, because they're up to this numerology-astrology, and if you study what they study, you can see this is how they connect things.
[03:28:47.119 --> 03:28:50.940]  And they think if they attack Russia on 8-8-8, it'll give them magic powers?
[03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:51.980]  Oh, most definitely.
[03:28:51.980 --> 03:28:54.580]  Completely insane.
[03:28:54.580 --> 03:28:57.481]  Hey, we got Richard Nixon saying they have homosexual orgies, folks.
[03:28:57.481 --> 03:28:58.741]  You can't make this up.
[03:28:58.741 --> 03:29:02.902]  Homosexual orgies, pot-bellied old Republicans running around going, Lucifer!
[03:29:04.642 --> 03:29:07.265]  I mean, you know, who can make this up?
[03:29:07.265 --> 03:29:09.247]  Pretty funny, huh, Bob?
[03:29:09.247 --> 03:29:11.209]  It is disgusting.
[03:29:11.209 --> 03:29:16.194]  I mean, these people are just little pot-bellied Nellies going, uh, uh.
[03:29:16.194 --> 03:29:19.557]  Just, we'll be right back.
[03:29:19.557 --> 03:29:20.958]  We're on the march.
[03:29:20.958 --> 03:29:23.481]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:23.481 --> 03:29:26.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:30.009 --> 03:29:38.935]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:29:38.935 --> 03:29:44.078]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:29:44.078 --> 03:29:55.206]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:29:55.606 --> 03:30:01.372]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:30:01.372 --> 03:30:07.638]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:30:07.638 --> 03:30:08.679]  What about you?
[03:30:08.679 --> 03:30:15.125]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:30:31.464 --> 03:30:34.046]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:30:34.046 --> 03:30:36.627]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:30:36.627 --> 03:30:37.728]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:30:37.728 --> 03:30:39.429]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:42.331]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:30:42.331 --> 03:30:45.953]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:30:55.612 --> 03:30:59.113]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th.

[03:31:01.434 --> 03:31:03.635]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:31:03.635 --> 03:31:06.916]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:31:06.916 --> 03:31:08.296]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:31:08.296 --> 03:31:09.837]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:31:09.837 --> 03:31:11.538]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:31:11.538 --> 03:31:14.439]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:31:14.439 --> 03:31:18.060]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:31:27.729 --> 03:31:32.555]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:31:36.384 --> 03:31:40.465]  How dare you?
[03:31:40.465 --> 03:31:44.066]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:31:44.066 --> 03:31:46.786]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:31:46.786 --> 03:31:53.267]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:31:58.368 --> 03:32:00.849]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:32:01.425 --> 03:32:04.847]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:32:04.847 --> 03:32:07.169]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:32:07.169 --> 03:32:10.471]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:32:10.471 --> 03:32:13.273]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[03:32:13.273 --> 03:32:17.335]  Finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:32:17.335 --> 03:32:19.977]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:32:19.977 --> 03:32:23.259]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:32:23.259 --> 03:32:28.903]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my- All right, Ted's gonna be ready.
[03:32:28.903 --> 03:32:30.204]  Did he- Did he email it?
[03:32:31.681 --> 03:32:33.582]  Who, me?
[03:32:33.582 --> 03:32:36.243]  Go to WebEx.com and try WebEx free.

[03:32:41.925 --> 03:32:45.647]  Yeah, I gotcha.
[03:32:45.647 --> 03:32:47.488]  Let's rapid fire through your calls.
[03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:50.549]  Scott in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:32:50.549 --> 03:32:52.690]  Go ahead.
[03:32:52.690 --> 03:32:53.810]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:32:53.810 --> 03:32:55.571]  I'll try and make this as brief as possible.
[03:32:56.358 --> 03:32:58.219]  It seems they're ramping up world events.
[03:32:58.219 --> 03:33:03.121]  It seems that they're ramping up restriction of the Internet.
[03:33:03.121 --> 03:33:08.643]  Lately I've been trying to think of ways, non-violent ways, that we can back these guys off.
[03:33:08.643 --> 03:33:17.006]  And ways that we could possibly use the Internet while we still have it to have some sort of advantage.
[03:33:17.006 --> 03:33:22.188]  I wanted to toss an idea at you guys and see what you thought.
[03:33:22.188 --> 03:33:24.749]  They seem to be making a list of us
[03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:34.197]  About a million or so plus of people that don't see eye to eye with the current administration or what have you.
[03:33:34.197 --> 03:33:34.558]  Why not?
[03:33:35.186 --> 03:33:41.167]  Well, I mean, you can make lists of criminal people, or people involved in the New World Order if you want, and put those out.
[03:33:59.071 --> 03:34:03.013]  But understand, most of the million people on a list, and I appreciate your call, are totally innocent.
[03:34:03.013 --> 03:34:07.314]  It's housewives, school teachers, somebody that took a picture at an airport.
[03:34:07.314 --> 03:34:09.935]  That's just about setting the precedent for a list.
[03:34:09.935 --> 03:34:13.897]  And then they say, oh, if you want off the list, just come file with us as a trusted traveler.
[03:34:14.537 --> 03:34:16.218]  So that's really another program.
[03:34:16.218 --> 03:34:17.938]  I mean, they can't do anything to a million of us.
[03:34:17.938 --> 03:34:18.959]  It's all bravado.
[03:34:18.959 --> 03:34:25.261]  It's all just willy-roll over to them as they nelly around guys in pink outfits commanding their men in black uniforms.
[03:34:25.261 --> 03:34:28.882]  A bunch of chicken-necked pedophiles that run the men in black uniforms.
[03:34:28.882 --> 03:34:30.783]  I mean, really, that's what's such a big joke about this.
[03:34:30.783 --> 03:34:40.047]  It's a bunch of fruitcake, luciferian pedophiles with a bunch of dumbass, tough-guy cops running a police state who have no idea what they're a part of.
[03:34:40.047 --> 03:34:40.587]  Bob Chapman?
[03:34:42.250 --> 03:34:45.852]  Well, I think that's pretty much a mouthful of it.
[03:34:45.852 --> 03:34:50.013]  Those lists have been around for a long time.
[03:34:50.013 --> 03:34:56.556]  You can go to some of the CFR sites and they'll list them for you.
[03:34:56.556 --> 03:35:06.200]  And then, of course, you have the list of the Bilderbergers that are going, you know, when they have their meetings.
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:08.201]  So you can pick up those names.
[03:35:09.192 --> 03:35:12.113]  But understand, they have evil systems built around them.
[03:35:12.113 --> 03:35:13.573]  You have to tear out the systems.
[03:35:13.573 --> 03:35:15.914]  It's like shark teeth.
[03:35:15.914 --> 03:35:20.275]  If a 10,000 top globalist all fell off a cliff tomorrow, the evil might even get worse.
[03:35:20.275 --> 03:35:24.856]  A lot of times they have even more wicked little supine goblins that serve them.
[03:35:24.856 --> 03:35:31.038]  We need to bring down their system of tyranny and fully discredit them where no one believes a word they say, so they grind to a halt.
[03:35:31.038 --> 03:35:31.898]  I appreciate your call.
[03:35:31.898 --> 03:35:33.759]  Listen, this isn't just about America.
[03:35:34.119 --> 03:35:42.425]  They're willing to go attack and kill Russian troops out of a clear blue sky, you know, in a sneak attack in the middle of the night for no reason.
[03:35:42.425 --> 03:35:42.665]  Okay?
[03:35:42.665 --> 03:35:46.528]  And then think the public's so dumb, tell the public, oh look, Russia's attacking.
[03:35:46.528 --> 03:35:49.850]  You know, I mean, that's how dumb they think you are.
[03:35:49.850 --> 03:35:53.493]  And again, for people that serve the system, you think you're part of the system?
[03:35:53.493 --> 03:36:02.159]  A system this corrupt that'll attack Russia out of the clear blue is a group that'll steal your pension funds, like they're announcing with Ford and Chevy and the government and
[03:36:03.348 --> 03:36:11.550]  I mean, you know, the thing is, there's all these people that think, as Mark Kornke says, they're pet puppies, and they're not pet puppies, are they, Bob?
[03:36:11.550 --> 03:36:13.311]  No, they're not.
[03:36:13.311 --> 03:36:14.471]  Let's take another call here.
[03:36:14.471 --> 03:36:16.052]  I guess who's up next in line?
[03:36:16.052 --> 03:36:17.732]  Laser, in the UK.
[03:36:17.732 --> 03:36:19.313]  You're on the air.
[03:36:19.313 --> 03:36:20.333]  Hi, Alex.
[03:36:20.333 --> 03:36:21.053]  Wicked show.
[03:36:21.053 --> 03:36:21.854]  Wonderful show.
[03:36:21.854 --> 03:36:25.435]  We need to get you guys, we need to get you guys on the air in the UK over here.
[03:36:25.435 --> 03:36:27.495]  We need to wake up the people in the UK.
[03:36:27.495 --> 03:36:29.116]  They are fast asleep.
[03:36:29.116 --> 03:36:30.276]  Believe me.
[03:36:30.276 --> 03:36:32.897]  This is a total totalitarian state over here.
[03:36:33.707 --> 03:36:40.631]  I just wanted to talk a bit about the concert going on in between Russia and Georgia.
[03:36:40.631 --> 03:36:41.611]  You're absolutely right.
[03:36:41.611 --> 03:36:45.833]  I was watching it from early this morning and they were provoked.
[03:36:47.666 --> 03:36:57.013]  Georgia did attack the Russians first, and then the news, the media changed the story around when, you know, the official story or whatever they would like to call it.
[03:36:57.013 --> 03:36:59.115]  You know, you're absolutely right on that.
[03:36:59.115 --> 03:37:02.137]  Laser, I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you in five minutes.
[03:37:02.137 --> 03:37:06.300]  Your Skype phone or whatever it is, your Vonage phone is totally breaking up.
[03:37:06.300 --> 03:37:08.282]  We'll go back to Laser in five minutes.
[03:37:08.282 --> 03:37:09.903]  Adam in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:37:09.903 --> 03:37:12.425]  Hello?
[03:37:12.425 --> 03:37:13.205]  Yes.
[03:37:13.205 --> 03:37:14.346]  Hey, how's it going, fellas?
[03:37:14.346 --> 03:37:14.987]  Good to talk to you.
[03:37:15.782 --> 03:37:17.522]  Love the show.
[03:37:17.522 --> 03:37:20.143]  Just got several things, couple questions I wanted to ask.
[03:37:20.143 --> 03:37:24.564]  I don't know, I tend to ramble, so you tell me when you've heard enough.
[03:37:24.564 --> 03:37:30.025]  One thing I was wondering, I heard you talking about some contests the other day, and one was for writing a new Declaration of Independence.
[03:37:30.025 --> 03:37:34.086]  Yeah, you gotta go to InfoWars.com, big giant banner for the contest.
[03:37:34.086 --> 03:37:38.127]  Okay, and then I had a question for Bob Chapman.
[03:37:38.127 --> 03:37:44.849]  I have a USA Today from July 25th with an ad about these new presidential coins issued
[03:37:45.376 --> 03:37:49.479]  This is by the World Monetary Exchange Fund, something I'd never heard of.
[03:37:49.479 --> 03:37:52.901]  I was wondering if you knew anything about that.
[03:37:52.901 --> 03:37:54.162]  It seemed kind of interesting to me.
[03:37:54.162 --> 03:38:00.607]  It had never circulated in the public, straight from the private vault of this World Monetary Exchange.
[03:38:00.607 --> 03:38:02.968]  I thought that was kind of interesting.
[03:38:02.968 --> 03:38:09.073]  And also, I was at the Ron Paul Revolution Rally in Washington, D.C.
[03:38:09.073 --> 03:38:09.593]  a little bit ago.
[03:38:10.572 --> 03:38:12.714]  I was talking to this guy that I met there.
[03:38:12.714 --> 03:38:14.995]  I believe he said, we are changed Cincinnati.
[03:38:14.995 --> 03:38:21.359]  And we were talking about, like, how you had Tex Marz on, and he was talking about how they signal each other through architecture and whatnot.
[03:38:21.359 --> 03:38:25.542]  And he said, have you noticed that they haven't changed or updated the $1 bill?
[03:38:25.542 --> 03:38:27.003]  That has the Olsen guy on it.
[03:38:27.003 --> 03:38:34.308]  Right, and perhaps, you know, maybe that was a more subtle form of architecture, and, you know, they've changed every other bill but that one.
[03:38:35.051 --> 03:38:38.396]  So that was kind of interesting and I know that's a lot.
[03:38:38.396 --> 03:38:42.282]  I'm going to let you go because we've got to move on to other callers.
[03:38:42.282 --> 03:38:46.929]  There was a lot of questions there and I end up forgetting what they all were.
[03:38:46.929 --> 03:38:50.734]  Well, there's one of them that Ted should answer and that is on that.
[03:38:51.575 --> 03:38:52.436]  We're good to go.
[03:39:12.388 --> 03:39:21.472]  You should look at those kinds of coins after they've been issued to see where they settle at, and I wouldn't go in and purchase them right off the bat.
[03:39:21.472 --> 03:39:25.893]  I think he was asking, yeah, some will go up, some will go down, some will stay the same.
[03:39:25.893 --> 03:39:32.676]  You never know which coin will become the really famous ones or incredibly collectible, kind of like baseball cards.
[03:39:32.676 --> 03:39:35.577]  But I think his question was, who is this particular mint?
[03:39:35.577 --> 03:39:36.737]  Who is this group, this world?
[03:39:36.737 --> 03:39:40.559]  I've never heard of them, and they pop up from time to time.
[03:39:41.259 --> 03:39:43.761]  And they last for a while and then they disappear.
[03:40:11.921 --> 03:40:14.225]  Now, that's in USA Today, but at the bottom of the story.
[03:40:14.225 --> 03:40:17.050]  Oh, by the way, we attack the Russians.
[03:40:17.050 --> 03:40:18.973]  I mean, attacking Russians?
[03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:24.042]  And then saying because they're with Al-Qaeda?
[03:40:24.042 --> 03:40:28.124]  Yes, I pulled up mainstream articles saying our troops were there to fight Al-Qaeda.
[03:40:28.124 --> 03:40:39.770]  I mean, how dumb do they... I guess now... Well, I mean, they've put out news reports saying that I am secretly... Another 9-11 troopers were secretly raised in Afghanistan and are Al-Qaeda.
[03:40:39.770 --> 03:40:45.253]  Not to mention that I was born before all that started and that they were our allies until 1990.
[03:40:45.253 --> 03:40:49.976]  I mean, it's just made up, but people say, oh my God, Alex Jones is secretly Al-Qaeda?
[03:40:52.980 --> 03:41:08.014]  I hope that, Alex, that Mr. Putin sees or meets Mr. Bush again at those Olympics and goes up and whispers in his ear, you just began your worst nightmare.
[03:41:10.677 --> 03:41:13.198]  God only knows what's really going on.
[03:41:13.198 --> 03:41:27.043]  I'm not joking when I say Americans are going to think Russians attacked Georgia and the U.S., and I'm not joking when I say they go on the message boards on InfoWars.com on the comment area and say that the European Union doesn't exist.
[03:41:27.603 --> 03:41:28.864]  No, you're right, they don't.
[03:41:28.864 --> 03:41:29.505]  And they fight you.
[03:41:54.016 --> 03:42:02.221]  When you do try to tell them, when you're just trying to help them, and you know, you only can do what you can do.
[03:42:02.221 --> 03:42:14.989]  And I've always told people, because I've been at this since 1960, if you can make one person out of a hundred listen and understand and act, then you've really accomplished something.
[03:42:14.989 --> 03:42:15.609]  Absolutely.
[03:42:15.609 --> 03:42:17.210]  Let's go to Adam in Ohio.
[03:42:17.210 --> 03:42:17.931]  You're on the air, Adam.
[03:42:20.742 --> 03:42:22.283]  I guess you're coming right back to me.
[03:42:22.283 --> 03:42:23.804]  I was just listening here.
[03:42:23.804 --> 03:42:24.464]  He was just on.
[03:42:24.464 --> 03:42:25.885]  Okay, then we're going to let you go.
[03:42:25.885 --> 03:42:27.586]  I've got my call list messed up.
[03:42:27.586 --> 03:42:28.587]  Greg in Canada.
[03:42:28.587 --> 03:42:30.348]  Well, why on earth would he still be there, then?
[03:42:30.348 --> 03:42:31.168]  Greg in Canada.
[03:42:31.168 --> 03:42:31.748]  You're on the air.
[03:42:31.748 --> 03:42:32.869]  Go ahead.
[03:42:32.869 --> 03:42:33.429]  Hey, Alex.
[03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:34.670]  Excellent show.
[03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:44.216]  I'm just watching this all unfold, this conflict, and I've come across a few articles showing war games in Georgia, U.S.
[03:42:44.216 --> 03:42:45.576]  war games in Georgia.
[03:42:45.576 --> 03:42:49.318]  This MSNBC article dated July 15th.
[03:42:50.928 --> 03:43:02.012]  It starts off with 1,000 US troops began military training exercises in Georgia on Tuesday against a backdrop of growing friction between Georgia and the neighboring Russia.
[03:43:02.012 --> 03:43:06.354]  That kind of shows how they're using war games to escalate this conflict.
[03:43:06.354 --> 03:43:08.095]  Yeah, both sides were doing that.
[03:43:08.095 --> 03:43:10.095]  In fact, I remember seeing that.
[03:43:10.095 --> 03:43:10.956]  Let me go to Google.
[03:43:12.108 --> 03:43:16.111]  Because I want all this posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:43:16.111 --> 03:43:18.152]  Aaron, shoot every article to Watson.
[03:43:18.152 --> 03:43:20.273]  I want total coverage of this.
[03:43:20.273 --> 03:43:21.314]  Listen for this headline.
[03:43:21.314 --> 03:43:22.595]  Give me the headline.
[03:43:22.595 --> 03:43:30.020]  The headline is, U.S.-Georgia training begins amidst Russia strain.
[03:43:30.020 --> 03:43:33.602]  Officials exercise unrelated friction between Moscow and ex-Soviet states.
[03:43:33.602 --> 03:43:35.264]  It's MSNBC, dated July 15th.
[03:43:37.782 --> 03:43:47.350]  Yep, U.S.-Georgia training begins, MSNBC, I have it, I remember that, and just thousands and thousands of U.S.
[03:43:47.350 --> 03:43:48.732]  troops in there.
[03:43:49.625 --> 03:43:55.428]  This is a quote from a South Ossetian envoy to Russia, Dmitry Medvedev.
[03:43:55.428 --> 03:43:58.570]  It's in a Global Research dossier article.
[03:43:58.570 --> 03:44:10.116]  It says, Georgia troops that took part in a NATO exercise in the region launched artillery fire on the South Ossetian capital on August 1st, killing six people.
[03:44:10.116 --> 03:44:14.538]  There is a direct connection between the exercises of NATO troops and the latest attacks on us.
[03:44:17.120 --> 03:44:20.462]  Well, that's what all these drills are for, here in the U.S.
[03:44:20.462 --> 03:44:26.888]  and overseas, is to prepare us to be attacked by our leaders, the mob criminals that are going to loot everything we've got.
[03:44:26.888 --> 03:44:29.951]  Send all those to the message boards on Prison Planet, everywhere.
[03:44:29.951 --> 03:44:31.472]  I want to be the place to be.
[03:44:31.472 --> 03:44:35.356]  I want all the key info for people to see this for themselves.
[03:44:35.356 --> 03:44:37.378]  The headlines should read, with all this data in it,
[03:44:38.564 --> 03:44:39.004]  U.S.
[03:44:39.004 --> 03:44:45.407]  military launches sneak attack on Russian troops, you know, under cover of Georgian Army.
[03:44:45.407 --> 03:44:49.608]  I mean, that's basically what we're dealing with, and this is just outrageous.
[03:44:49.608 --> 03:44:50.369]  Thank you for the call.
[03:44:50.369 --> 03:44:52.990]  Yes, I've got those articles.
[03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:54.710]  Oh, jeez.
[03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:56.011]  This is so criminal, Bob.
[03:44:56.011 --> 03:44:58.392]  This is so criminal.
[03:44:58.392 --> 03:44:59.392]  It certainly is.
[03:44:59.392 --> 03:45:02.853]  And, you know, again, our troops are in harm's way.
[03:45:02.853 --> 03:45:04.714]  They shouldn't be there.
[03:45:04.714 --> 03:45:06.375]  And it's wrong, wrong, wrong.
[03:45:07.572 --> 03:45:15.559]  And some of these guys have already served three tours, and now they're putting them in another war.
[03:45:15.559 --> 03:45:19.302]  It's just disgusting.
[03:45:19.302 --> 03:45:24.987]  And reportedly, according to Israel papers, Israel's kind of the boss over there.
[03:45:24.987 --> 03:45:26.388]  Israel's done what?
[03:45:26.388 --> 03:45:30.772]  According to some Israeli publications, you mentioned one of them, that Israel's... Hadebka.
[03:45:30.772 --> 03:45:34.315]  Yeah, Israeli forces are kind of running the whole shindig.
[03:45:35.612 --> 03:45:36.453]  That's correct.
[03:45:36.453 --> 03:45:40.616]  They've been in there for a long time, leading up to this invasion.
[03:45:40.616 --> 03:45:42.997]  And actually, it's an invasion.
[03:45:42.997 --> 03:45:55.526]  So if I was Russia, I'd just, you know, bring my best troops down, and when you get them in position, just open up with all your missiles, the whole works, and just obliterate them.
[03:45:55.526 --> 03:45:58.688]  That's what I'd do.
[03:45:58.688 --> 03:46:00.129]  Well, that's what's happening right now.
[03:46:00.805 --> 03:46:07.347]  I mean, you've got to remember, I spent years working against the Russians when they were the Soviets.
[03:46:07.347 --> 03:46:11.748]  And so, you know, I don't have any love for them, but unfortunately, they're in the right here.
[03:46:11.748 --> 03:46:14.249]  I mean, they're being goaded and pushed into war.
[03:46:14.249 --> 03:46:17.710]  They're being attacked by foreign governments.
[03:46:17.710 --> 03:46:19.671]  It's wrong.
[03:46:19.671 --> 03:46:25.833]  Do you agree with Dr. Roberts that the neocons are now completely insane?
[03:46:25.833 --> 03:46:26.293]  I think so.
[03:46:27.593 --> 03:46:31.756]  They're insane with their own power, at least the American version they're of.
[03:46:31.756 --> 03:46:36.019]  I mean, there's a method to the madness here, but the point is, they're delusional.
[03:46:36.019 --> 03:46:40.141]  You know, they think they're sane, but they're crazy.
[03:46:40.141 --> 03:46:43.563]  Well, that's a given.
[03:46:43.563 --> 03:46:46.665]  Incidentally, they're not all sane over in Europe, either.
[03:46:46.665 --> 03:46:53.790]  I wrote a piece that's in Wednesday's issue on the Europe about Sarkozy and his background.
[03:46:54.552 --> 03:47:01.399]  And then I've gotten some letters at the end of it which will be going on tomorrow's issue pertaining to that.
[03:47:01.399 --> 03:47:04.643]  And it's another dog's breakfast.
[03:47:04.643 --> 03:47:07.626]  These people that are running France are out of their minds as well.
[03:47:08.581 --> 03:47:13.864]  And they just created the Mediterranean Union, which is all over the news, but people say it doesn't exist when we talk about it.
[03:47:13.864 --> 03:47:17.526]  It's an unbelievable military tactic of denying everything as they attack.
[03:47:17.526 --> 03:47:21.648]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up, and I just want to leave this short and sweet for people.
[03:47:21.648 --> 03:47:23.829]  I like to buy gold when it appears it's at a low.
[03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:33.591]  Whether it was $265, or $340, or $500, or $600, or $700, or $900.
[03:47:33.591 --> 03:47:35.752]  I've bought it at all those levels.
[03:47:35.752 --> 03:47:37.212]  A coin here, a coin there.
[03:47:37.212 --> 03:47:40.473]  I think now is a great time to buy, because things are so unstable.
[03:47:40.473 --> 03:47:42.693]  Who knows what's coming in the future?
[03:47:42.693 --> 03:47:46.154]  They've been artificially trying to depress gold, which is a buying opportunity.
[03:47:46.154 --> 03:47:48.655]  With all of this out there, the dollar
[03:47:49.295 --> 03:47:54.898]  Well, you know, you buy them when nobody wants them.
[03:47:54.898 --> 03:47:57.799]  This is a tremendous opportunity to buy.
[03:47:57.799 --> 03:48:02.101]  Nobody knows where the bottom is.
[03:48:02.101 --> 03:48:03.362]  It could be right here, and in all probability is.
[03:48:13.064 --> 03:48:14.205]  So take advantage of it.
[03:48:14.205 --> 03:48:19.531]  You know, if you've got enough to buy 10 units, well, maybe buy 5 here and see what happens.
[03:48:19.531 --> 03:48:24.357]  And if you've got to pay $8.80 for it, well, that's okay.
[03:48:24.357 --> 03:48:27.200]  If you pay $8.20 for the second 5, that's okay, too.
[03:48:28.211 --> 03:48:29.252]  That's a way to look at it.
[03:48:49.232 --> 03:49:10.563]  In the bank, and then the bank will say, even though they've had bank accounts for years, the bank will say, oh, you can only have a third of that money out, or you can't pay your bills for six, seven days, two weeks, we're just holding your money, and now I'm seeing other banks go under all this craziness, but the government's saying, oh no, everything's fine, don't buy gold, while they pack on trying to drive it down.
[03:49:10.563 --> 03:49:11.063]  Ted Anderson?
[03:49:11.403 --> 03:49:12.503]  Yeah, I'm right here Alex.
[03:49:12.503 --> 03:49:19.266]  I can tell you right now this market, little market dip that we had here recently is what gold behaves like normally in the summer.
[03:49:19.266 --> 03:49:25.388]  And right now we're sitting in a price range where gold was, it jumped up over $100 here last time.
[03:49:25.388 --> 03:49:26.428]  What did it take Bob?
[03:49:26.428 --> 03:49:32.730]  Maybe about 4 or 5 days for gold to go from $880 roughly in that range to $950.
[03:49:32.730 --> 03:49:39.973]  I mean right now is a very good buying opportunity and I'd really suggest that if you get the, if you have the opportunity and you have some cash,
[03:49:40.553 --> 03:49:41.274]  Put it into gold.
[03:49:41.274 --> 03:49:44.156]  I mean, this Russian thing is just one of the problems we have.
[03:49:44.156 --> 03:49:46.858]  We've got way too many problems in the market right now.
[03:49:46.858 --> 03:49:48.679]  Chad, tell them about the coin offers you've got.
[03:49:48.679 --> 03:49:49.199]  Yeah, I do.
[03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:50.740]  I've got the British Sovereign right now.
[03:49:50.740 --> 03:49:51.621]  It's a great coin.
[03:49:51.621 --> 03:49:53.222]  It's at $236.
[03:49:53.222 --> 03:49:55.164]  I have the French Franc right now.
[03:49:55.164 --> 03:49:56.284]  That coin is at $190.
[03:49:56.284 --> 03:50:01.868]  I am completely out of those walkers we've been talking about because the supply is just that tight.
[03:50:01.868 --> 03:50:03.289]  I've got dimes right now.
[03:50:03.289 --> 03:50:05.431]  The Mercury dimes, they're at $1,676 per $100 face.
[03:50:10.314 --> 03:50:12.416]  I mean, that silver is getting very scarce.
[03:50:12.416 --> 03:50:14.778]  I know, Bob, you've probably been out of touch with silver.
[03:50:14.778 --> 03:50:15.198]  Stay there.
[03:50:15.198 --> 03:50:19.241]  Let's come back here for another minute from Ted, and then take maybe a call or two.
[03:50:19.241 --> 03:50:22.584]  Final segment straight ahead as we track the U.S.
[03:50:22.584 --> 03:50:24.546]  basically attacking Russia out of the clear blue.
[03:50:30.475 --> 03:50:35.357]  Have you ever suffered from... Because the supply is just that tight, I've got dimes right now.
[03:50:35.357 --> 03:50:42.401]  The mercury dimes, they're at $1,676 per $100 face.
[03:50:42.401 --> 03:50:44.522]  I mean, that silver is getting very scarce.
[03:50:44.522 --> 03:50:46.923]  I know, Bob, you probably have been out of touch with silver.
[03:50:46.923 --> 03:50:47.363]  Stay there.
[03:50:47.363 --> 03:50:51.425]  Let's come back here from another minute from Ted, and then take maybe a call or two.
[03:50:51.425 --> 03:50:54.747]  Final segment straight ahead as we track the U.S.
[03:50:54.747 --> 03:50:56.708]  basically attacking Russia out of the clear blue.
[03:51:02.623 --> 03:51:08.768]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[03:51:08.768 --> 03:51:15.332]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.

[03:52:27.194 --> 03:52:27.936]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:52:29.182 --> 03:52:39.027]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[03:52:39.027 --> 03:52:43.189]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:48.192]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[03:52:48.192 --> 03:52:54.155]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[03:52:54.335 --> 03:52:54.775]  The U.S.
[03:52:54.775 --> 03:52:57.657]  dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[03:52:57.657 --> 03:53:03.981]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running, and stores close their doors, Survival Enterprises can help you prepare.
[03:53:03.981 --> 03:53:07.043]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food.

[03:53:19.872 --> 03:53:20.873]  Rumors spreadin' round
[03:53:44.097 --> 03:54:00.849]  If you go to Yahoo News, the top stories of the Olympics and celebrity hairdos, the John Edwards affair, the love child, is what's the big news.
[03:54:00.849 --> 03:54:03.550]  We are the thumb-sucking cowards.
[03:54:03.550 --> 03:54:06.933]  Not all of us, but the mainstream media caters to that.
[03:54:06.933 --> 03:54:08.754]  It's kind of a feedback loop.
[03:54:08.754 --> 03:54:10.175]  What comes first, the chicken or the egg?
[03:54:11.176 --> 03:54:14.821]  You know, the shorter our attention spans become, the shorter they make the news reports.
[03:54:14.821 --> 03:54:16.444]  It's just all a dumbing down.
[03:54:18.112 --> 03:54:23.437]  I'm sorry, U.S.-backed military forces attack and kill Russians in a premeditated murder.
[03:54:23.437 --> 03:54:33.025]  The Russians stream in with what looks like thousands of tanks and tens of thousands of troops, blowing the living daylights out of forces with our military mixed in with them, with Israelis.
[03:54:33.025 --> 03:54:34.987]  That is big news!
[03:54:34.987 --> 03:54:37.789]  I'm looking for people to say this doesn't even exist.
[03:54:37.789 --> 03:54:41.633]  I mean, that's basically what the denial mechanism has gotten so bad.
[03:54:43.416 --> 03:54:44.957]  Ted, again, give people those deals.
[03:54:44.957 --> 03:54:45.938]  Give them the toll-free number.
[03:54:45.938 --> 03:54:51.844]  Brokers are going to be there all weekend to take your calls if people want to finally get out of their dollars into gold and silver.
[03:54:51.844 --> 03:54:53.785]  Gold more than doubled in the last five years.
[03:54:53.785 --> 03:54:54.166]  Go ahead, Ted.
[03:54:54.166 --> 03:54:54.506]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:54:54.506 --> 03:54:54.967]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:55:02.192 --> 03:55:02.232]  2237.
[03:55:02.232 --> 03:55:07.334]  We have the dimes, they're at $1.67 face.
[03:55:07.334 --> 03:55:10.174]  That $16 is just a little bit over spot.
[03:55:10.174 --> 03:55:11.735]  That's a great buy.
[03:55:11.735 --> 03:55:17.916]  The franks... To be clear, as you're out of silver dollars... Oh, we were talking about those silver dollars and the walking liberties.
[03:55:17.916 --> 03:55:21.137]  I mean, Alex, I can't get them right now.
[03:55:21.137 --> 03:55:23.998]  Just that little thing, that bank, that indie bank, that thing that went on?
[03:55:24.618 --> 03:55:28.061]  I was inspired enough buying that I couldn't even get supply on them.
[03:55:28.061 --> 03:55:29.562]  It'll probably take me another three quarters.
[03:55:29.562 --> 03:55:39.730]  Folks, when they're done propping things up, when the bottom finally completely falls out, which you can see the terrain, it just gets worse from here economically, you're not going to be able to get gold and silver.
[03:55:39.730 --> 03:55:40.550]  There is no doubt.
[03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:43.973]  I mean, the premiums, if you can get it, are going to be insane.
[03:55:43.973 --> 03:55:47.455]  If common sense reigns and we live in reality, I mean, who knows?
[03:55:48.476 --> 03:55:52.540]  Casper the Friendly Ghost may start flying around any minute as weird as things have gotten here with the U.S.
[03:55:52.540 --> 03:55:55.062]  attacking Russia, and it's not even news.
[03:55:55.062 --> 03:55:59.466]  But this is big news, folks.
[03:55:59.466 --> 03:56:00.487]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:56:00.487 --> 03:56:02.128]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:02.128 --> 03:56:03.289]  You can't beat those deals.
[03:56:03.289 --> 03:56:06.071]  We have links up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[03:56:06.071 --> 03:56:06.432]  Go ahead, Ted.
[03:56:06.852 --> 03:56:11.916]  Yeah, I was just about to say that maybe 3% of the people own physical gold and physical silver.
[03:56:11.916 --> 03:56:17.540]  You move 5, 10, 15% of the people from the United States into gold and silver, there's not going to be anything to buy.
[03:56:17.540 --> 03:56:19.061]  I mean, that's just the reality.
[03:56:19.061 --> 03:56:19.702]  Absolutely.
[03:56:19.702 --> 03:56:20.582]  Ted, we're out of time.
[03:56:20.582 --> 03:56:20.823]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:20.823 --> 03:56:24.966]  Are there going to be brokers there this weekend to answer the phones?
[03:56:24.966 --> 03:56:25.726]  Oh yeah, they'll be here.
[03:56:25.726 --> 03:56:26.267]  You know they will.
[03:56:26.667 --> 03:56:28.088]  And what's a later night at night?
[03:56:28.088 --> 03:56:28.648]  Oh yeah.
[03:56:28.648 --> 03:56:29.969]  Alright, thank you, Ted.
[03:56:29.969 --> 03:56:35.172]  And folks, if you call them and they're not there, tell them it's a Ted Anderson, Alex Jones special, or you might pay more for those coins.
[03:56:35.172 --> 03:56:38.734]  Those are right at what Ted's getting them for.
[03:56:38.734 --> 03:56:39.375]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:39.375 --> 03:56:42.036]  Our guest website is theinternationalforecaster.com.
[03:56:43.377 --> 03:56:46.319]  Heavily hated by the Feds, the New World Order, persecuted.
[03:56:46.319 --> 03:56:49.620]  He's one of the icons fighting the New World Order for close to 50 years.
[03:56:49.620 --> 03:56:52.222]  I guess it's like 48 years now.
[03:56:52.222 --> 03:56:56.504]  And we've been really honored to have Bob Chapman on with us today at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:56:56.504 --> 03:57:01.246]  You're going to pop in with me for 30 minutes on Sunday, so is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:57:01.246 --> 03:57:02.287]  He'll be on in the first hour.
[03:57:02.847 --> 03:57:05.529]  You're welcome, and I'll see you on Sunday.
[03:57:05.529 --> 03:57:05.909]  Okay, bye-bye.
[03:57:34.733 --> 03:57:36.694]  Alright, we covered this whole Georgia thing.
[03:57:36.694 --> 03:57:38.114]  Burma's did the first 20 minutes.
[03:57:38.114 --> 03:57:38.895]  I had a bad feeling.
[03:57:38.895 --> 03:57:42.696]  I came into work today from the other work I was doing.
[03:57:42.696 --> 03:57:44.757]  Literally, I told my wife, I said, I can't work here at home.
[03:57:44.757 --> 03:57:45.637]  I gotta go into the office.
[03:57:45.637 --> 03:57:46.117]  Something's going on.
[03:57:46.117 --> 03:57:47.618]  I have a bad feeling.
[03:57:47.618 --> 03:57:48.818]  And it's 8-8-8, baby.
[03:57:48.818 --> 03:57:50.539]  We're like, hey, it's 8-8-8.
[03:57:50.539 --> 03:57:52.320]  Nothing big has happened yet.
[03:57:52.320 --> 03:57:52.780]  Wait a minute.
[03:57:54.901 --> 03:57:58.346]  Russia just went into Georgia, but then it turned out the U.S.
[03:57:58.346 --> 03:58:00.108]  attacked Georgia.
[03:58:00.108 --> 03:58:02.131]  Look at InfoWars.com for continual coverage.
[03:58:02.131 --> 03:58:08.078]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com with Jason Bermas.
[03:58:08.078 --> 03:58:08.980]  The Restream starts now.
