[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:29.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  Man, I tell you, this North Korea situation is off the charts.
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  And I thought back to Lindsay Williams, who two years ago on the show,
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  well, really three years ago, he, from his source, I know who his source is,
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  has been a Bilderberg attendee before, former head of one of the big three oil companies.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  You can say what you want about Lindsay Williams.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I think he's a good guy.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  A little repetitive sometimes, but aren't we all?
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  But I know who his sources are, one of them's dead now.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  And it's just an interesting window into things.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  Because this was before they even shifted one of the big fleets to the Pacific.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  He was saying three years ago, which I had the staff to dig all this up,
[01:13.000 --> 01:23.000]  but you heard him, that Alex do not worry about the destabilization in the Middle East, bad imitation.
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  But when they move into Asia and North Korea, that is the big one, he said.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  And maybe it's not going to happen now, but I'm telling you, it is wild what's going on.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  And then about a year after he started saying that, they shifted the main fleets over to the Pacific.
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  And now it turns out the West has secretly met the United States back in March with the North Korean leadership.
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  Dr. Steve Pacenek, who I think is back in the U.S. today, we need to get him to pop in to talk about this.
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.000]  But Paul Watson has the article up at infowarch.com today, who gave North Korea nukes in the first place.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  And it gets into ABB and Donald Rumsfeld, obviously being the ones that did that.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  The U.S. government and the CIA.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  But again, the U.S. government has been taken over by the New World Order.
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  So the New World Order, it's like the U.S. government's coming after our guns, the captured collaborator U.S. government,
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  which isn't the U.S. government anymore.
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  I mean, I keep trying to explain this just because a hijacker conks the pilot on the head and puts on his uniform
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  and walks out and says, I am now the pilot. I am taking you to Iran.
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  I mean, everybody knows that's not really the pilot.
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  But when you have one of these soft coos, foreign corporate espionage, infiltrations, corporate takeover,
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  I mean, that's really what the New World Order is.
[02:55.000 --> 03:04.000]  It's a corporate takeover of the planet of anti-free market monopoly combines who happen to have a belief system in eugenics
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  and who want to live forever, duh, who wouldn't, especially when you're worth billions of dollars, control trillions.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  You've got everything. What are they obsessed with?
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Living longer and they don't like seeing crowds of people.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  They disdain the dumbed-down public who they've helped dumb down.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  And I mean, always the public is simple-minded on average compared to good, very smart people and bad smart people.
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  I mean, good smart people want to build up the dumb people, want to help their brethren.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Bad smart people want to kill you. And let me explain something to the public.
[03:42.000 --> 03:53.000]  You're begging for it. You're begging for it. You're begging for it. You are begging for it.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  I go down to Barton Springs sometimes and swim and the last month they haven't changed the big clock for swimmers.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  The time's wrong and the hour's wrong and I keep telling them and they can't understand me what that means.
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.000]  And I'm seeing signs of this everywhere. I call it mass-zombiosis or people going into a trance and it's intensifying.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  And let me tell you something. Nothing against Californians.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  They're some of the most awake people I know are in California because they're around a bunch of zombies.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  But I see videos and I've been out in California and you talk to the general public, they don't even hardly know how to talk.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  And I predict, in fact, this is already happening, the language is shrunk.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  In fact, Chris, print me something about language shrinking, amount of words being used, shrinking.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  There's a bunch of articles on that that people will even stop talking soon.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  And then they'll stop going out and then they'll stop eating and then they're going to die.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  The second it's already happening in South Korea, the most connected country in the world.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  People just watch TV or play video games. Every week you see it in the news, till they die.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  And this is the big secret. We're going to talk about it today.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[05:29.000 --> 05:36.000]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit or shed.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Get simply safe dot com.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  You aren't always at home, but simply safe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  Again, that's get simply safe dot com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  Be prepared before you need it.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  With nutrient dense food, you can store for up to 25 years.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:28.000 --> 08:39.000]  Hey, you white house, I'm not sure what you are.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  Monday through Friday.
[08:48.000 --> 08:59.000]  From 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time, we are here live and we're not turning away.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  We're not watching humanity go down the tubes, collapse under mind control into mass zombie state without a fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:08.000 --> 09:20.000]  I stand for truth, justice and liberty worldwide. I stand for the spirit of 1776 worldwide that trumps 1984 all day and all night.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  But you must first become animated with the animating contest of liberty.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  You know what I love in life? I love real people.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  I love people that aren't fake and I love people that are animated with the spirit of liberty.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  And you talk to somebody who's animated, who has energy, who is bubbly, you just want to be around them, they're amazing.
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  And then you get around the general public more and more act like lethargic sloths that have had electrochemical lobotomies.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  And I mean, it's getting worse and worse and worse and every generation talks about young people.
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  And we've got one of the most awake, focused, dynamic, amazing groups of young people that I've ever seen in my life.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  Seeing my generation and looking at older generations and experiencing several younger generations before me.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  We have some of the most awake, dynamic young people ever, but that's a minority.
[10:18.000 --> 10:31.000]  The majority of them love being sloths, love being pathetic, wear their ignorance like a sheet of armor and basically don't even know how to wipe their noses.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  And the New World Order is not going to just let you sit around and draw welfare and lay around all day.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  Okay, they're going to get you on the government dole for a while.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  They're going to give you government jobs to run our lives.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  And then once they've got everything fully collectivized, they're going to shut everything off incrementally.
[10:49.000 --> 10:58.000]  And they're going to start giant wars and they're going to release bio weapons and say their natural plagues and the vaccines they give you are going to further brain damage you
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  and engage in real electrochemical lobotomies with the nano tech anti stress vaccines.
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  They're coming out with that's what they're called, which some evidence it's not just television and flicker rate putting people into a trance state.
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  I've talked to a lot of people I know that have taken the especially the H1N1 and they're different people.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  They're not just had their IQs lowered.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  They they aren't real anymore.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  And I've recognized this enemy operation for at least a decade, reading different MIT papers and things.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  But it's already happened.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  So and Bill Gates is coming out with food, clothing, chemtrail sprays.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  He's he's funding geoengineering and has vaccines in it. It's on their website.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  They're putting hundreds of millions into that how to manipulate your gut flora without you knowing.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  I mean, they're very public about programming us and it's an incredible war crime against humanity.
[11:53.000 --> 12:06.000]  But their propaganda is in ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, the cover of Costco magazine, just Time Magazine Newsweek, just everywhere I look.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  Bill Gates loves you. He's an angel.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  So people say, what do you mean he's an angel?
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  I mean, thank God for Bill Gates.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  Okay, go take his shots then.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  I mean, never mind that they had 60 something thousand kids get paralyzed off the shots in India last year alone.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  And it's a minor footnote.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  Oh, we're not calling it polio, though.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  We call it a type of paralysis.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Truth is they didn't get rid of polio.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  Medical disorders and paralysis is at record highs.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  They just don't hype it up.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  You see, there's the difference.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  You can have 200, 300,000 deaths from infections.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  It varies every year in hospitals.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  You can have 200 and something thousand from drug overdoses in hospitals.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  You can have a couple hundred thousand from doctor error every year.
[12:55.000 --> 13:06.000]  I mean, it's well over 800,000 people a year dying one way or another for medical neglect or abuse or, you know, different variants of that.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Malpractice.
[13:08.000 --> 13:20.000]  And just going into these hospitals and facilities that just have the most powerful drug resistant, radiation resistant, chemical resistant bugs you can imagine.
[13:20.000 --> 13:32.000]  I mean, insects that have been pesticided within three or four generations almost always become somewhat immune or resistant or completely resistant to poisons.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  Or you could put poison right on them and they don't die.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  What do you think happens with bacteria and viruses?
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  By the way, though, in that is the key to our salvation because I want to explain something.
[13:45.000 --> 13:55.000]  Humans are the most dynamic, powerful, intelligent, incredible, enlightened, beautiful, transcendent creatures this planet has.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  That's why they tell you you're ugly, you're bad, you're no good all day, so you don't figure that out.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  So that you just imagine you're this ball of scum who embraces your weakness because you were told you were weak.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  You see, that's even your own adaptation manipulating you.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  The New World Order is not going to be able to shut all of us down.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  Their viral cocktails aren't going to work on all of us.
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  And believe me, the subconscious drives the conscious and the brain is connected through the spinal cord to the rest of your body.
[14:27.000 --> 14:39.000]  And the mere fact that I'm talking about how you're under attack right now, even if you're a jellyfish consciously, I am commanding jellyfish right now, spineless people.
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.000]  I am commanding you. I am commanding you through your instincts, through your ancestors, through your common sense.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  And of course, God is commanding you through your spirit to activate right now and launch defenses.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  And believe me, the defenses are launched.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  So the globalists have got a big problem on their hands, okay?
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  Because there is autopilot, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  They know about the autopilot. They're trying to program it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  That's not going to work. That's not going to work. You've already failed.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  And by the way, most of the globalists have already figured that out.
[15:21.000 --> 15:31.000]  I'm seeing major signs of the power structure of internal civil war and people trying to reverse it and children of elite families understanding now.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  You're not going to screw up humanity and get out of this.
[15:35.000 --> 15:49.000]  The only way you're going to be able to attain the true gifts of the Creator, which is all this technology, genetic engineering, all of it, we are creators, little creators, little C creators to the big C creator.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  We're made in the image and likeness of God.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  Okay, I mean, take a look at what we can do.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  Just got chills right there. Just got chills right there.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  And what we do sends out ripples.
[16:03.000 --> 16:17.000]  You know, I shouldn't get mad that within three days of us breaking major news every single day, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, you name it, Sean Hannity are covering it.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  And more and more, they can't even spin it because their audiences demand the truth.
[16:22.000 --> 16:30.000]  And plus deep down, they don't want to sell people out deep down. They have a survival instinct for their families, their children, their wives, the people they love.
[16:30.000 --> 16:42.000]  You see, that's why they want to make you automatons and have quote zero tolerance and everything where cops are robots or teachers are robots where you don't have any discretion.
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  Because they want you to be a robot.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  You see, that's where all this is going. That's what they're trying to replace us with robots.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  I mean, I should always feel like I should do more.
[16:53.000 --> 17:02.000]  I always feel like I should work harder and stay up late and shoot videos when I'm exhausted that aren't as effective as when I'm actually, you know, energized doing it.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  And it just really came to me this morning.
[17:05.000 --> 17:17.000]  And one of the most azure blue skies I've ever seen with spring breaking with manifest beauty.
[17:17.000 --> 17:26.000]  To be on this planet staring out into the heavens. I mean, just incredible that I have already succeeded and you have already succeeded.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  Because the greatest victory is not even getting personal attention.
[17:31.000 --> 17:38.000]  The greatest victory is not yourself being famous. That's actually a cross to bear.
[17:38.000 --> 17:57.000]  But true real power to do good is when you can do something and have everyone come think they're stealing it and take it and actually put it out to everyone and to be able to change human destiny for good.
[17:57.000 --> 18:05.000]  And to be involved, being able to blow the whistle every single day on things that I think are important and that my crew thinks is important.
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  And then others who resonate with it who think it is important.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  And it's like the fire of Prometheus.
[18:13.000 --> 18:27.000]  I revel in giving, not from the Greek occultic perspective, but it's still a good analogy, the fire of liberty, the fire of awakening, the fire of truth, the fire of building people up and seeing them soar.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  That is such an amazing thing.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  And it's why it's so alien to me that other people don't want to build others up and see them soar because they're threatened by it.
[18:37.000 --> 18:53.000]  That's why the only person in mainstream dominant media who I've seen that doesn't try to dominate and shut down other people is Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report.
[18:53.000 --> 19:03.000]  Who has given info wars the fire of Prometheus. We had already given many the fire of Prometheus on a smaller level and it set brush fires across the planet.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  But Drudge and others have given us a greater fire.
[19:09.000 --> 19:27.000]  And so now info wars.com, prisonplanet.com, this syndicated show, even when it's not on drudgereport.com is one of our stories is today. It is now picked up by conservative circles, libertarian circles, and it's read word for word with no credit.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  And I don't even really mind that when Limbaugh and Hannity do it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:42.000]  The message gives us credit now. When Beck does it, it's irritating only in that he's tried to hurt us and shut us down and block us while streaming what we're doing.
[19:42.000 --> 19:56.000]  I mean, listen, this show is the Glen Beck show now. I mean, you understand, I'm his teleprompter writer, but I'm writing directly out of history and research and the force of liberty that flows through me.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  It's amazing. All right, I'll get into the North Korea situation straight at it.
[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think.
[20:09.000 --> 20:17.000]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story of 2012.
[20:17.000 --> 20:24.000]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[20:30.000 --> 20:41.000]  But here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[20:41.000 --> 20:59.000]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.

[24:26.000 --> 24:44.000]  We've already dropped. We're already in the pike. This is it.
[24:44.000 --> 24:52.000]  That's right. Even while we sleep, we sleep, they live. Alex Jones here, Back Live. Thanks for tuning in today.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  Be sure and spread the word about the local AM and FM stations you're listening to and support their local sponsors.
[24:58.000 --> 25:08.000]  We are fighting an uphill battle, but we have the people on our side, and so the agenda of liberty is moving forward faster than ever.
[25:08.000 --> 25:25.000]  All right. Coming up, I'm going to get into the police state news, the economic news, the incredible Second Amendment news where they are trying to ram through anti-gun legislation without anyone being able to read the bill.
[25:25.000 --> 25:35.000]  Of course, they're saying, Harry, read promise to let us have amendments, but he lied. It's like saying, Satan promised not to lie to me, but he did.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  People go, I can't believe Biden doesn't understand why we want guns to protect ourselves from criminals.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  And the government, Biden says he doesn't understand why we want guns. Why doesn't he understand? Of course, Biden understands.
[25:46.000 --> 25:58.000]  He owns a bunch of guns on record and has bodyguards. He's a gangster. He's got a criminal instinct, an animating contest of evil.
[25:58.000 --> 26:10.000]  He doesn't like you. He wants to dominate you. It's from the dark side. Big time. Big time. Big time. Big time enemy. Big time bad.
[26:10.000 --> 26:22.000]  Big time eat your lunch. Big time you serve everything you've got, but it's virtuous to roll over to tyranny. No, it's not.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  I mean, look at this right here. Paul Watson did the article today. You need to make this go viral. It's up on infowars.com.
[26:29.000 --> 26:41.000]  Bill Clinton, the UN, and Donald Rumsfeld. If anybody's like the devil and appears in a poof of smoke, I would imagine it'd be Donald Rumsfeld.
[26:41.000 --> 26:52.000]  I mean, that guy commences. That guy emcees over, like, all the key evil. He's just as important as Henry Kissinger as Obigna Brzezinski.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  I mean, that guy's been around since right after L. L. Lemnitzer got kicked out by Kennedy. He came in right after that.
[26:58.000 --> 27:14.000]  Mr. Falls Flag. Who gave North Korea the nukes in the first place? U.S. government CIA on record. Just like in a few years when Al Qaeda's
[27:14.000 --> 27:24.000]  attacking us, and so they're doing proctology exams on you and your family on the highway, not just the airport. It'll be because of Al Qaeda and, you know, other groups.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  You'll be like, oh, you know, our government put Al Qaeda in charge in all these countries. Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorists.
[27:29.000 --> 27:38.000]  Now, remember, everybody knows that now, but by then it won't be politically correct to admit that. But the whole article goes over the admission.
[27:38.000 --> 27:52.000]  Now, they have revealed in a leaked intelligence report, which means they did it on purpose, that North Korea states that it has nuclear war as unavoidable as it declares
[27:52.000 --> 28:03.000]  its first target will be Japan. So they're saying that the intelligence report says that, yes, indeed, ladies and gentlemen, they do have nuclear weapons and can hit Japan and
[28:03.000 --> 28:19.000]  South Korea. Okay, so that is what has now come out and China has been massing trips for weeks on the border there, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:19.000 --> 28:30.000]  So that's the facts. And North Korea is now saying that they will hit Japan first. And they're saying nuclear war is unavoidable.
[28:30.000 --> 28:39.000]  If somebody says I'm going to come over to your house and shoot you, it's unavoidable and I'm coming over to shoot you. I have every right to have you arrested.
[28:39.000 --> 28:52.000]  I'm going to come to my house to kill you in self defense. But notice that's not happening. And notice the Pentagon has been secretly meeting with North Korea.
[28:52.000 --> 29:02.000]  In the last month, this guy was raised in Switzerland. And remember, the global crime syndicate manipulates the communist Chinese put them in power in 49, moved all our industry there.
[29:02.000 --> 29:12.000]  They manipulate the EU, they manipulate our Pentagon, they run our country. And so, understand, they clearly more and more I realize, I'm going to get machinic on about this,
[29:12.000 --> 29:21.000]  to get his take, are actually running this whole thing. It doesn't mean they control them. It means that they have made some deal behind the scenes.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  I believe you give them oil and a bunch of other food and stuff if they do this.
[29:26.000 --> 29:36.000]  So Bauer break, Kerry on the scene, congressman, they have nukes, Kerry contradicts Intel report, Pentagon deploys C radar.
[29:36.000 --> 29:43.000]  We're going to be breaking all this down. We've got excellent coverage at infowars.com, also excellent coverage over at drudgereport.com.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  But why is this happening now? I'm going to get into this and then into the globalist master plan and a lot more.
[29:50.000 --> 29:57.000]  We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  We are like a natural resource to them. To clean the planet, move on to another.
[33:32.000 --> 33:43.000]  They want benign indifference. They want us drugging. We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are is livestock.
[33:43.000 --> 33:55.000]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[33:55.000 --> 34:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[34:15.000 --> 34:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host. It is Friday. I'll be back this Sunday live, 4-6pm Central Standard Time.
[34:26.000 --> 34:39.000]  Ben Swan, the very popular Fox News reporter from a Fox affiliate here in the U.S., has left his job and you're going to discover why in the next hour.
[34:39.000 --> 34:49.000]  Very popular online. A listener of this radio show took the reports, took the ideas, did his own ideas and really had an effect.
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  He's leaving there. I know behind the scenes, well, I'm going to let him tell the story.
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.000]  I know a few months ago, I wanted to have him on and they told him, you're not allowed to go on that show.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  Which is funny. They're putting ads on those videos online that we're getting to see millions of times in some cases.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  But you don't like local Fox affiliate being on infowars.com? You don't like being on dredgerport.com?
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  You don't like a million people coming to your website when your other videos had like a thousand people coming to them?
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  No, you don't like somebody exposing the private Federal Reserve or the New World Order.
[35:30.000 --> 35:39.000]  I went through the same stuff on access TV they tried to kick me off and then they tried to kick me off local radio.
[35:39.000 --> 35:47.000]  I was like, well, I have ratings. I'm bringing in money and they're like, well, you know what, you're going to shut up or you're fired.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  I was like, I thought as long as I was successful and we're not getting sued and I can prove what I'm saying, I'm allowed to be on the air.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  They said no New World Order, Federal Reserve or Bill Clinton.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  In fact, you do that, maybe we'll give you a raise.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  Now come out to a company party with us.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  I went to the company party, but I didn't shut up.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  So they said, you're fired and you'll never be on the air.
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  I was already on the air out of my house on a little patriot network jacked into a satellite on more than 10 stations.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  And those delusional people couldn't believe it.
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  You see, that's why I hate monopolies and I hate the folks that engineer of the system think they're going to control things.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  They don't control things. The White House doesn't control the narrative anymore.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  And they bemoan that they attack the alternative media chief among it.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  The drudge report.
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  Because we can show you videos of where they say, yeah, once we register, we're going to confiscate the guns.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  And what did the White House say? We hate it when our people speak out of turn and let out the plan.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  So that's why no one in the media is allowed to talk to any of our people in government.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  That's why the president doesn't really have press conferences anymore.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  And it's why we don't talk anymore.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  It's because of drudge.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  The enemy can't even effectively have their propagandist out there talking.
[37:09.000 --> 37:17.000]  Because when one of the mayors against gun violence, as they call it, Mayor Bloomberg's anti-American seditious group,
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  gets up in Austin, he says, we're going to register now and take the guns next.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  That video goes viral and they're in trouble.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  Because you guys love to brag, we're here and we're going to show it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  And listen, they can't get us all.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  I want other people to duplicate what we've done.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  I want other people to start their own local radio shows and then put them on the Internet.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  And then do what we've done nationally and internationally locally.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  And then when she becomes successful locally, I suggest you do it locally first,
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  because that's where there's a real audience for fighting corruption.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  Because see, we're covering national, international, and there's almost a glut of that now at certain levels.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  You need to cover what's happening locally, then that will become national.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  I'm consulting for you out there, America.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  What did the head of the Veritas project a few days ago, O'Keefe say?
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  He said he's writing a book coming out.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  We're going to sell it about how to do what he's done as a real citizen journalist
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  that brings down federal operations.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  Akron was getting something like six to ten billion a year.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  He blew that operation into a thousand political pieces.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  Low-tech for a couple thousand dollars.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  Folks, I literally pioneered what they do by necessity.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  Reinventing old-fashioned muckraking with the Internet.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  I'm giving you solutions.
[38:42.000 --> 38:53.000]  The next issue of the magazine is going to be about solutions and basic ways to fight these tyrants.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  If you'll just go to globalist meetings that are public, anti-gun, land grabbing stuff,
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  they'll sit around if you just sit there and act like you're with them going,
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  yeah, we're criminals, we're going to steal everything.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  I mean, that's who they are.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  You can walk into one of these so-called liberal offices and go,
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  hey, let's kidnap kids, and they'll be like, yeah, let's murder them, too.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  It's like the Akron stuff.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Yeah, I'm bringing in little kidnap girls to sell them a sex place.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Oh, great, yeah, we love that.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  That's a wonderful thing.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  I'm telling you, these people are so evil.
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  See, most people who figured out the general public are zombies and don't even know what's going on,
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  most people figure that out and go, well, I'm going to rob them.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  I'm going to steal from them.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  And once they get a corrupt police force in charge,
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  you can't touch anybody within the city corruption or the corporate corruption
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  because, well, that'll bring down the whole system.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  They're like made men.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  Those of us that stand down to corruption make all these low-level criminals like made men.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  And why would you be made an Italian mafia?
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Because if you went after that person, a whole organization would come after you.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  It's like Scientology, where people are scared to go after them because they'll come after you.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  Even if they went after the federal government, the FBI, CIA, they went after them,
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  broke into their offices, reportedly, did dirty tricks.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  People are scared of Scientology.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  And it's something L. Ron Hubbard set up as a joke for tax exemption
[40:23.000 --> 40:30.000]  just because they had what Tony Montana calls wavos.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  And I don't break them from nobody.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Well, what if good people didn't back down?
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  What if good people got aggressive?
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  I'm not talking about breaking into the FBI, but just said, come and take it.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  But more than come and take it, we go out and we take over.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  We get aggressive. Those two guys in Austin that went to that anti-gun rally,
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  they came over and a woman slapped one of them in the back.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  Another guy poked him in the leg, got cussed at him.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  They stood their ground.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  The police tried to act like the Patriots had done something wrong,
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  led by Ace Veto, who's going to be in here next Friday, he says.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  We'll see.
[41:04.000 --> 41:12.000]  And just because they did that, just because they went out there and held up signs saying,
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.000]  no gunman, the enemy said, you bet you'll need that sign soon.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  Because after we register, after we do what we're doing now,
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  we're going to make that sign a reality.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  So you keep that sign, you're going to need it.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  And they got smiled, a little Hispanic version of Dr. Evil.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  I guess the Hispanic mini-me sits there and points at him and says,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  I'm going to get your guns.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  What an outrageous King George III statement.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  I mean, what a just Santa Anna.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I'm going to get your guns.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Just outrageous.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Like I'm going to get them.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  If you don't engage the enemy, you don't show their strength.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  You don't show their fire.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  The cattle won't even know there's a war going on.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  Engaging the enemy, showing up, getting on the field.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  You may not be a great fencer the first time you go fencing.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  You may not be a great wrestler the first time you go and wrestle.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  You may not be a good boxer the first time you go boxing.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  But I'll assure you, you get in the arena, you're going to get better and better and better and better.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  And folks, I'm just telling you, I'm in the arena.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  And I may be stumbling around and bleeding and falling over sometimes.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  And it may even be a spectacle, but you know what?
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  I'm in the arena.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  I'm in the arena all the way.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Get in the arena.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  This is a fight with the Thoritarians and all their slime.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  They make me sick.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  You had a neighbor you'd caught stealing potted plants out of your backyard.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  You came over to their house and said, Bill, that looks like my potted plant right there.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  In fact, that's a planter we bought in Mexico.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  I doubt you, because he said, oh, that's mine.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  Oh, I've had that for years.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  No, that looks like a plant we bought five years ago in Mexico.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  I mean, that's a pretty small town.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  I think that's an original little deal.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  We bought it from a shop where they were there making them by hand.
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  No, it's not. No, it's not.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  Well, I don't appreciate you.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  You're saying that to me that I stole that.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  You would love that person because they were such a despicable liar.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  And you'd say, okay, you go ahead and you keep.
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  You go ahead and you keep that.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  Of course, all you do is when you finally move out a few years later,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  you just go over and take the potted plant back.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  That's actually a true story.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  I guess one thing I said, I stole beer out of golf carts.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  I guess I have stolen my own stuff back before.
[43:32.000 --> 43:39.000]  Anyways, getting back to what I'm saying here, ladies and gentlemen,
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  is that there are people who just want to steal for no reason.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  My dad is telling us a kid.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  There's people rather steal a quarter from you than make $100.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  And I go, why dad?
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  And he goes, because they're losers, because that's the way they are.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  They think they win by stealing something from you.
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.000]  I've seen people I've worked with, built up, put on the radar so many times
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  just to do the Oedipus complex and make stuff up about me and attack me
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  and go after me or take my faults and exaggerate them
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  because they imagine that that's how they build themselves up.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  That's how you become a big man.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  No, you build a community and you work with people and you get a name that's trusted
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  and then everyone who's a winner wants to work with you.
[44:27.000 --> 44:35.000]  You attack people and lie about them, then only losers want to work with you.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  And my God, that's a bad fraternity to be in.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  And it's the same thing with government and bureaucracy.
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  I mean, Homeland Security is saying gun owners, veterans are the number one terror threat.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  And that wasn't enough.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  They doubled down.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  They quadrupled down.
[44:51.000 --> 44:59.000]  Infinity down and said gun owners, veterans, you're not just the ultimate terrorist.
[44:59.000 --> 45:10.000]  No, it's all Catholics and all evangelicals and put them next to Al Qaeda
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  and the army has taught that.
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  And then that freaked everybody out when that was seen as I reported this a decade ago.
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.000]  Now it's in Fox News, so now it's safe for the state police in Colorado
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  Yeah, we're in meetings saying we need to confiscate guns from the Christians.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  And will we do it?
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  This is kind of creepy, kind of creepy.
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  I mean, you're in a room with enemy foreign operatives who've taken over.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  I mean, it's like aliens landing or something or Nazis taking over France.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  You're in a room.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  I mean, right there, that's the bad guy.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  Obviously.
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  Oh, and by the way, we're taking a survey that this came out yesterday.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  Will you confiscate guns from Christians?
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  We see them as a problem during gun confiscation.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  And the state police, this is your moment, folks, when the evil is just,
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  the devil takes off the nice guy's suit and it's the devil in a red pajamas with a forked tail
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.000]  going, hi, I'm the devil.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  Hello.
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  And you're going to work for me, aren't you?
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  Everybody's sitting there going, this is pretty crazy.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  I mean, it wasn't enough to badmouth George Washington.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  It wasn't bad enough to badmouth Thomas Jefferson.
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  It wasn't bad enough to say returning veterans will attack every police department in America with IEDs.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  Remember that five years ago?
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  And I'm like, here's this secret document.
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  I was sent by a federal marshal.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  They're teaching them that every department will be attacked.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  Let me, let me check this document.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  I've confirmed it's real.
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  The feds were hopping mad when I called them that I had it and quite threatening police.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  Are you being trained that veterans will attack your department?
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  Will with IEDs in the near future.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  Open the phones up.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  Every cop calls in.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  Yeah, they trained us on that last year.
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  We thought it was crazy.
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  That's why cops listen to the show are just immediately listeners because they hear it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  They go, yeah, I was told that.
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  How's he know that?
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  Be ladies and gentlemen, there isn't long to turn this around.
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  Okay.
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  If you give into these bullies, it's over.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  And they are completely out of control.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  You know, I said, I'd get to all these reports.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  I said, I'd get to the true nature of the new world order.
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  And I don't do this on purpose.
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  Guys, you've got to make me do it at the start of the third hour.
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  And because I want to talk about their master plan, where they're going, what they're going
[47:19.000 --> 47:25.000]  to do, what's going to happen, how they've done people down.
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  Because because that's the key.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  That's the heart.
[47:32.000 --> 47:45.000]  That's the central area to all of this is that we are entering a period in society.
[47:45.000 --> 47:52.000]  We are entering a period in our culture where everything is going to accelerate downhill.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  And the establishment has done the actuaries.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  They believe they've got a big enough group of people that are so dumb down.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  I mean, I saw a Mark Dice video, we're going to play it coming up in the next segment where
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  he goes out and says, will you confiscate?
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  You know, are you for people being arrested?
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  If they own guns, are you for banning guns?
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  And and the people, most of them signed the petition to do it.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  And so I'm going to go out and see if Austinites are that dumb down.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  But but I mean that and then he went on and said, because you're about the U.S.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Nuking China blowing up their two biggest cities last week.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  And people are like, no, I didn't hear about it.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  And I don't care.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  I mean, that is that is how dangerously selfish and disconnected
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  and lazy the public's gotten.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  But globalist, just because you have dumbed down the general public,
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.000]  just because you've been so successful in turning them into zombies
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  and even lowering their brain waves and reducing the amount of words they use.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  I've got all the studies I'm going to cover in the third hour on this front.
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.000]  Just because you've been able to do that doesn't mean there aren't 70 million guns
[49:00.000 --> 49:07.000]  sold in just the last couple of years over 150 million gun owners.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  I see statistics like 35 million gun owners.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  I saw that like in the New York Times last week.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  What a lie.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  Like, oh, it's a minority.
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  It's 35 million gunners.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are estimated 400 million guns of new manufacture
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  since the 1930s. That's considered modern error.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  I mean, you can pull up these numbers.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  It varies.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  Some are 400, 500 million.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  But let's just be conservative.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  Okay, 400 million guns.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  And most people, when they get a phone survey, do you own a gun?
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  They say, none of your business or no, because they don't trust the system.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  They know it's bad.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  They know it's crooked.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Our numbers are much greater.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  So also understand that.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  So I want to tell the power structure something once you're fully aware of.
[49:48.000 --> 49:55.000]  Just because you think you can get a bunch of sheep to vote to take our guns
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  and vote to take our bank accounts and vote to take our private property
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  because they think they're going to get a piece of it.
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.000]  And A, will collapse the society faster than you even think.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  And B, there will be what you call collateral damage.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  There will be a civil war, the likes of which you've never seen.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  And I know you believe you're going to have it and control it.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  And this will be your decisive war.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  And you've billed Obama as Lincoln too.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  But this is not going to work the way you think it is.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns,
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  especially young people.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  and then only do it every Monday.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  We need to do this every day of the week
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  I mean, is it a free society to turn on sitcoms, dramas, news,
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  and all they do is demonize the family, fathers, guns, liberty?
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  This is an authoritarian group.
[50:57.000 --> 51:23.000]  This is a scientific takeover.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  This is an authoritarian group.
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  More than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago the murder capital of America.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  Proof that gun control doesn't work.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  Disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals have guns.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  And Rom Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  But there's hope.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg,
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  Rom Emanuel and his Chicago Machine a crystal clear message
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  that we have a natural right to defend ourselves,
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  our homes, and our families, and that they need to keep their hands off our guns.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Illinois Republican Paul McKinley is sending that message in a bitterly false special election
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  to replace disgraced ex-rep Jesse Jackson Jr.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  Every vote, every voice in support of Paul McKinley is a stand against the gun-grabbing Chicago Machine.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  Will you stand up and defend your gun rights?
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  Call 800-979-1555.

[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  He finally got back from the DMZ.
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  He's got, now I can speak more, he was kind of off record.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  He was being cased and saying stuff like,
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  I've already put my life on the line in combat eight times and, you know,
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  another spy operation.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  So if something happens to me, that's fine.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  I'm willing for something to happen to me.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  So he's probably listening right now.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  I'm not making fun of his voice.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  He's doing an imitation.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  I can do an imitation of me too if you want.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  But he's going to be popping in for about 15 minutes at the end of the third hour today
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  because he was saying it's a false flag.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  It's a false flag.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  I can't say more than that.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  I've talked to Special Forces, Delta Forces.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  I can't say much more than that.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  There's three CIA when I was just getting breakfast,
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  sitting around me at the restaurant.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  I got to watch it, Alex.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  They're listening right now, Alex.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  They're breaking into my email, Alex.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  So when he comes on, he's really a famous black ops guy.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  Camp David, founding Delta forces.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  He writes Tom Clancy books.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  I mean, he's a very interesting character.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  And he's going to be popping in because here's Paul Watson's article.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  Look at this.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  Lawmakers drop bombshell.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  North Korea may have nuclear missiles.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Well, no, the intelligence report doesn't say that.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  It says they've got a bombs.
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.000]  Everybody knows that.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  But they can only hit Japan and South Korea.
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  That's a public assessment by the British.
[58:01.000 --> 58:02.000]  Everybody else.
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  I've been saying it for months because I do my research.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  I'm not bragging.
[58:07.000 --> 58:08.000]  They've got atomic weapons.
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  Let me say it again.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  They've got atomic weapons.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  The private groups, when they do tests in Japan,
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  private universities are able to pick up,
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  even though they're underground tests that comes out the tunnels,
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  they're able to pick up the isotopes of an atomic bomb.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  The fingerprint, the signature, the biometric reading,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  if you want to call it that, even though they've got the spectrometers.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  Here it is.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  And now North Korea says nuclear war is unavoidable.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  They work for the globalists.
[58:40.000 --> 59:08.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  Here are some of the most important preparedness items
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  at InfowarsShop.com.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  You've got the Lifestraw, so you can turn fetted water
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  into safe water anywhere you go.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  The K-Tour Hand Crank Generator
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  Strategic Relocation Third Edition by Joel Scowsen.
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  Shortwave AMFM radios.
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  is available at InfowarsShop.com
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  and your purchase makes our Infowars possible.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  We're getting prepared.
[59:48.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  We'll see you next time.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are two devastatingly important articles
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  up at Infowars.com right now.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Trees in alert.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Dems trying to move gun bill forward
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  without allowing senators to read it.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Obamacare repeat.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Senators not allowed to rebuild prior to cloture.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  This is all treason, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  If you don't know Robert's Rules, Parliamentary Procedure,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  the laws in this country as well,
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  some of the Federal Reserve was passed by three senators
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  the night before Christmas, went all through the house.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Now the creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Three of them passed the Federal Reserve Act.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Notice they got rid of our senators in 1913.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  17th Amendment.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Before that, the state legislature that you elected,
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  think how powerful legislatures were,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  they voted then to create more separation of powers,
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  more emergency checks and balances,
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  more ties on the government.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  They, your legislature, your state rep would vote for the senator.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And so they were a creature of the state.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  The states haven't existed.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  They say it's a civil war.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  The states after reconstruction was so abusive,
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  actually came back.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  But that 17th Amendment, I mean, that's put a fork in it.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  But it's not like a person you can just kill.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Liberty like phoenixes can rise.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  If you realize, look, a contract that's fraudulent is null and void.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  All this stuff has been done through fraud.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  It's a fraud.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  And any courts that say this, any of that are frauds and are relying.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And so that's the bottom line.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  And that's what Marbury versus Madison says.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  I mean, I studied common law.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  I studied law.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I studied history.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I studied it all.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  But law comes out of the organic common sense.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I mean, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution Declaration of Independence
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  only points out what is self-evident, self-evident truths.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, self-evident,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  with certain unalienable rights, inalienable rights,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  life, liberty, life and liberty.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  You got your life.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  You got your liberty.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Not everybody's as smart as the other person.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Everybody's just good-looking.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  We all have different gifts.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  All of you have gifts.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Even people that are handicapped, even mentally,
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  they are giving the gift of a burden to someone to grow.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Everything's a gift.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  If God allows me to live another 50 years,
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  that's a gift I certainly asked for and the one I want,
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  but if God allows the enemy to strike me down,
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  that is a gift, because it's going to be done for a greater cause.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And that's why I'm at total peace.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Total peace with my creator, not at peace with the New World Order,
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  because I just watching them run over our people,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  watching them hurt the innocent,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  watching them just persecute and persecute and persecute
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  and trample the innocent and trample the honest
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  and trample the virtuous and engage in fraud and lies
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  and abuse and inventing new evil makes me want to throw up.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  The Republican leadership likes to act like the Democrats trick them.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  16 Republicans voted because to take your guns,
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  because they are bought and paid for by foreign banks
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  and big corporations, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  all these guys give money to the globalist.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  To the globalist minions, the globalist operatives.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And they're there financing this, so that's why this happens.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  The same things done in every country.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  They've got a blueprint, they've got a program,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  they've got sociologists and anthropologists and psychologists
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  and pitch men and psych warfare experts and advertising execs
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  that all get together in roundtables,
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  a lot of these are public,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and talk about how to con you, how to hammer you,
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  how to take you over, because that's what they build, is fraud.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  You understand, they steal the world,
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  that way they get the woman, they get the power.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  You understand that?
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  But it's worse than that.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  They want to tie you down because they know you're better than them,
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  so they spike your water with poison to retard you
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  so they can rule a world of dimwits.

[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  All right, my friends, we're now into hour number two.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Dr. Steve Pacenek's going to pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  He just got back from South Korea on the DMZ.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Former head of the Pentagon Operations and Psych Warfare,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  one of the founders of Delta Forest with General Boykin.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  By the way, I got General Boykin's number,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  and he wants to come on.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Remind me to call him today.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  I was supposed to call him like a month ago.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  That should be interesting to get his take on all this.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  So much going on, lawmaker drops bombshell.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  North Korea may have nuclear missiles.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  That's not what the report says.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  It says they have atomic bombs that they can deliver to Japan and South Korea.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  That's been declassified for a long time.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  This newest intelligence report, they're saying is classified,
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  but a watered down, unclassified briefing was given to the congressman.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  The intelligence committee can get the highest level security stuff
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  unless the executive tries to deny it,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  and that itself is unconstitutional,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  but now it's got out of hand because congress has advocated
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  their responsibility handed it over,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  which is another seditious treasonous activity.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Those aren't just words I use.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  That's what's happening.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  But if you read the report, they have atomic weapons.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  They've done tests before.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  They've picked up the isotopes that they've had successful.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Detonations, it's real.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  They know it's a fingerprint.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  They can vaporize South Korea's major city.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  She old of how many millions of people?
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Oh, it's more than 20 million.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  They can vaporize Tokyo.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  How many is Tokyo?
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  One of the biggest cities in the world.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  And why is our government, yeah, the largest city in the world,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  why are we putting up?
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Because I'm not a warmonger.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I never called for that.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  You know that.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  But when you've got North Korea run by a third generation dictator,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  they're saying, I have missiles, I'm going to attack,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  I'm going to blow up your cities.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And now they've come out today in official release
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  and are saying our first target is Japan.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Our first target is Japan.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And they're saying, quote, nuclear war is unavoidable.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  That's in the Associated Press.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  North Korea says Tokyo is target number one.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I mean, that's like somebody coming to your house with a gun
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and saying, I'm outside.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  I'm going to shoot you in the head.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  But people are like, why isn't our government hitting them?
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Why is no one hitting them?
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  And I'll tell you why, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And again, as usual, truth is stranger than fiction.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  If you go up to infowars.com, you can read this article linked to mainstream news.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  I've been covering this since I was on the air in 1996 when this started.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Donald Rumsfeld, the head of ABB along with Clinton authorizing it and the UN,
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  it was a scandal at the time, signed off on transferring multiple nuclear reactors
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  that allow them to create A-bombs when they could have been given types
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  that you cannot create fissile material, purified, enriched uranium for the atomic weapons.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And sure, this is 1945 technology, but you solidly to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Will Japan already hit twice, have to take another hit?
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  I guess to get them out of their depression.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Then we're going to our guest is the U.S. government and the CIA.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  We're going to cover this next hour and get into the globalist master plan.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And by the way, that's not my opinion.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  That's AP Reuters London Guardian BBC 15 years ago.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  This was big news from 96 to 2000.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And who met secretly with Kim Jong-un last month, the Pentagon in North Korea.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  The Chinese are massing troops saying, don't you do this, North Korea.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  China is, again, it's globalist above China, above America, playing us all off against each other.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  But who's putting al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria publicly?
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Pentagon, NATO.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Then say, we've got to take your rights because of al-Qaeda.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  They got 10,000 heat-seeking missiles.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Who gave them the 10,000 heat-seeking missiles?
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Our government put them in Libya and let them have it.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Got rid of the ambassador.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  They were at that house getting the missiles at that warehouse facility.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  I mean, man, being informed is incredible.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  The general public can't even tell what time it is anymore.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Find their rumps with both hands.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And we're sitting here just watching crazy land.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  And what did the former CEO, I want to say, it's Lindsay Williams source.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  I know the guy, doctor, well, one of the doctors here on this network,
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Dr. Stan Monteev, actually, years ago, wanted to check it, so called the sources.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And he confirmed it.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Boydham's dead now.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  The head of Atlantic Richfield died.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  We can say his name.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Ken Fromm.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  But remember three years ago, Lindsay Williams said, it's going to start in North Korea.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  It's not the Middle East.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  When our fleet moves over there, get ready.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  And the fleet moved a year ago over there.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  All right.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Enough of that.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  That's all coming up.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  We're going to play this clip after Mr. Swan leaves us.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Trees in alert.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Dems try to move gun bill forward without allowing senators to read it.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Red linked on info wars.com and prison plenida.com.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Former Black Panther government preparing invasion against the American people.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Father sickened by anti-constitutional note from son school.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Yeah, they're making the kids do anti-gun, anti-liberative stuff.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  DHS to meet with congressman on ammo purchases.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Soda ban highlights the hidden hazards, proposed gun control restrictions.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Harry Reid's 100 clip magazine faux pas.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Nuclear bombshell.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  North Korea has news capable of striking neighboring nations in Pentagon.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  That's just some of the news up on info wars.com.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And there's a Facebook report where they now take control of your phone and control it.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  That's a good idea with a guy that pump and dump his people that bought his stock.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And who calls you dumb effers if you trust him.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Hey, dumb effers.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  Are you idiots morons trusting me?
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  We're like, oh, we'll give you all our data.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I mean, it's just, they just think you're so stupid.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm a big fan of him.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And he's what I say the best local TV reporter in the country became a big star on the internet
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  with millions of views to his videos.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Drudge report linking to it.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Drudge report.com, info wars.com.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  And I remember about a month or two ago, I wanted to get him on.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  And he said, well, I'm not allowed to do interviews anymore.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  And I'll be talking to you shortly.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  And I thought, well, that might mean he's going to be leaving.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And sure enough, he's put out a video.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  We'll play a clip of it later.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  But why not just go right to him?
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  He's won both a Edward R. Murrow award.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  So he's that's that's that's about as good as it gets and two Lone Star Emmy awards.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  He's from Hailing from Texas.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  We're proud of that.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  He has specialized in the covering of 2012 GOP presidential primaries, the Ron Paul newsletter
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  controversy in Mexico's drug wars on the Texas border.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  He's a graduate of Brigham Young University with a master's in humanities at California State University
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  for moving to Cincinnati and working for reality checks.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Swan spent 11 years of broadcast career in El Paso, Texas and KTSM TV.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  It goes on from there.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And he looks like a cross between James Dean and Audie Murphy.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  And I tell you, get your butt back down here to Texas and maybe come to work for info wars.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  But no, I know you're probably going to go independent.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Got a lot of offers.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  We're very excited to have you on with us, Ben.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  But first off, before we get into that, what do you think of the crazy North Korea stuff?
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Listen, I think you're making some really good points about it.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  I mean, this it's very strange when you have all the rhetoric.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Just consider all the rhetoric that our government has put out regarding Iran and the potential
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  of nuclear weapons in Iran and the possibility that Iran could get their hands on one.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  The fact that we had an Iraq war over the idea that Saddam Hussein might be looking for enriched uranium.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  And yet you have for a fact, nuclear weapons in North Korea and everybody saying,
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  ah, don't worry about those guys and they're not going to do anything.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  He's blowing smoke.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  It's a very strange kind of discussion back and forth between when you compare again,
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  the talking points and the rhetoric on one side and then with North Korea is a totally different situation.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  You're right.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  I've talked to a lot of experts.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  They've never seen the rhetoric this hot.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  I mean, North Korea is saying, we will nuke you.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  We're loading missiles.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  We're going to kill you.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  We're going to blow up Tokyo.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  I mean, right there, they should have already been hit.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  And I mean, China better just stand back, but it's not happening.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And then our government allowed the transfer of the reactors over a decade ago.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Well, and you have to keep in mind too that what does North Korea really have to lose here?
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  I mean, at this point, because of economic sanctions against them, we know the people in North Korea are starving.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  Economic sanctions, as you know, don't really do anything to harm a country's dictator.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  It just harms the people within that country and it makes people desperate.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  So why wouldn't North Korea now take some kind of monumental step and use a nuclear weapon?
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  What would actually prevent them from doing that?
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  And when people say things like, oh, this won't happen because consider the Cold War and the Cold War, the Soviets,
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  they didn't want to get blown up.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  They didn't want to get killed.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  You know, folks in the West, they didn't want to get killed.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  And so there was this standoff between them.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  It's not really the same situation when you consider where North Korea is.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  They don't really have a whole lot to lose at this point.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  We want to come back and talk about why you're leaving or what you can tell us about where you're at.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  I know you're a nice guy, but it's certainly, it's pretty obvious that you were getting a little, you know, big for people out there that don't want liberty promoted.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  But I'm guessing there will find out more.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  But what else after we talk about that, do you want to get into?
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  There's so much happening.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  Now, what's your take on all the dishonesty from the Democrats about, oh, we just want to register your guns.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  We don't want to confiscate them when we all know they really want to take them.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  Yeah.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  And that's going to be a huge issue.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  You know, this whole issue of Second Amendment and the Second Amendment rights is something we've really been talking a lot about as of late.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  And by the way, I haven't been on your show since you were on Pierce Morgan's program.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  We were supposed to talk shortly after that and wasn't able to.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  And it was one of the best, you know, five minutes in television I've ever seen.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  But, you know, when you look at the Second Amendment and what's happening right now around the country, it's truly remarkable because the rhetoric is such that folks in Washington are saying, we're not going to take your guns.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  We're not interested in your guns.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  Listen, if they're being honest, then they should say, forget about all the so-called assault weapons that are out there.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  And again, I think you brought up this point.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  What else?
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  What is an assault weapon?
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Every weapon is an assault weapon, but we don't want the assault weapons.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  If they really meant that, they leave the assault weapons alone and they go and take away handguns because statistically that's where the majority of gun crimes are committed.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  But they're not being honest because they're clearly moving through a process of disarmament and it's taking place slowly.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  You've pointed it out many, many times.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  They want the guns that can fight back against the tyrannical government.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Bottom line.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  But you made the point, and we had actually made this point a couple of weeks prior too, and I was really glad that you used that moment on Pierce Morgan's program to say this to the nation.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  But the bottom line is when we talk about the Second Amendment, the Second Amendment is not about having rifles to hunt with.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  It's not.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  It's about matching equal force to government force and to military force.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  That's what it's there for.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  You know it.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  I know it.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  People across this nation know it.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  It's a check and a balance.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Absolutely.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Ben Swan is our guest.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  We're going to give you his Facebook, Twitter, all his websites and everything.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  And I can't wait to see what he ends up doing.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  He's told me a little bit behind the scenes, but we'll see how much he can tell us on air straight ahead.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  I want you to know some very important information.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Protect your immune system.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  It's the only one you've got.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  The fact is, you are. We all are.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Be prepared before you need it.

[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  Of course, that's what they always do.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  The senators all know this.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Republicans need an excuse to take your guns and go, the Democrats fooled us.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  They're bought and paid for.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  That's coming up in the next segment with Ben Swine and a bunch of other news.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Really an amazing newsman, won the Edward R. Murr Award.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  He was very, very young.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  I guess he's been a newsman for 15 years now or so.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  He's getting ready to leave the station that he's currently at up in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Why are you leaving? Where are you going?
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  What are you planning right now?
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  I know you're in some deep discussions with other folks right now.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  What's the plan, Ben?
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  The plan right now is what we're really looking for is the strongest platform possible.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  When we started doing reality check about two years ago,
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  really had no idea how big it was going to get.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  Had intended for it to become anything other than just a local news segment,
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  but we were given freedom with it.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  What a rare thing that is in media today.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Given the freedom to talk about issues that we thought were important issues
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  and issues that are affecting people all over the country.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  When we're talking about things like the political race in 2012,
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  the stripping of credentials of delegates,
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  of delegates being disenfranchised, the Ron Paul blackout,
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  all of a sudden we start blowing up across the internet.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  I come to find out there are millions of people in this country,
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  tens of millions who have this liberty view that I thought was really just my own personal view.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  I wasn't trying to force it on anyone,
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  just trying to get people to look at things from a different perspective.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Certainly as a journalist, you're not trying to impose your view on people,
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  but trying to get them to see things just from the paradigm.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  But the power structure knows liberty is popular.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  That's why they never want to give it a chance to get its roots going,
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  and that's why they always try to suppress people.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  So bottom line, did you get told to back off?
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  You know, it wasn't so much about being told to back off,
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  so much as the station has, you know, they're moving in a certain direction.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  You just said not so much, they're moving in another direction.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  But that's how they do it.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  We don't like this direction.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Let us nudge you.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Be honest.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Be honest, they told you to knock it off.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  It really wasn't.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  It really wasn't.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  These guys really want Cincinnati centric, and we want bigger issues.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  And so kind of my view of where it was headed was different.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  It's not, they were always very supportive of what we were doing.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  So I want to make that clear.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  But it really was an issue of me saying, look, we're coming to an end of a contract,
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  and now it's time to decide what to do.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  And I think the best thing to do is rather than trying to stay this path in Cincinnati,
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  is to say, what else is out there?
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  What's the bigger platform?
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Because I believe this, Alex.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  I believe the majority of Americans who don't know what the Liberty movement is,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  or the Liberty messages, if you articulate it to them, they'll say, yeah, that's me.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And so what we're trying to do is just open up people's minds and say, listen,
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  maybe you are of this mindset.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  You just don't know it yet.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Well, sure, Ben.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  I mean, America is asleep right now by and large.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Big sections have been woken up.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  You're on a big alarm clock going off.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  And I saw in the news you were highly rated, probably one of their most popular shows.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And I think there's some professional jealousy.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  One thing I've noticed is, especially when you're in, you know, a just a local area,
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  you'd think the best horse in the race would be popular.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  The truth is, there's a lot of professional jealousy that goes on.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  And I'm not trying to get you to throw your colleagues under the bus.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  But I mean, come on, all they really care about is ratings.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  You were delivering ratings.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  So I think that's a bunch of bull that, oh, just do local stuff.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  Yeah, I can't, I can't argue with you about that because our ratings were fantastic and moving up like crazy.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  So we were doing extremely well.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  And I hope they continue to do well.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  But again, I think it's just an, it's an issue now with platform and where's the next best thing.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  In fact, I want to, I want to take a minute.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  I think you have a video there and I don't know if you guys plan to play any of that.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  But one of the things I'm trying to do is get input from people who have supported me over this time to give me input on what the next step is.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  And so we actually created a survey.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  I started a new website.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  It's Ben Swan.com folks can go there and take a survey.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  And I know there are people who are concerned about data mining.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  We're not data mining you.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  We're not trying to get your information.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  No, you want to get their feedback on what direction they want to see you go.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  That's smart, smart move.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Yeah, that's what we want.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  We want to know what people think and whether or not they're willing to continue to support.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Listen, you are a guy who has pioneered in many ways, independent media in this country.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I mean, you've, you've done things that nobody else had done before you and you've really blazed a trail.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  What we want to do is find out if there's support for kind of the direction we want to go in.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  And really one of the things we're focused on is how do we kind of translate streaming sites because they're popping up everywhere.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  How do we translate that to make that kind of the forefront of the Liberty movement battle for media?
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Absolutely.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  We're going to come back and play a little bit of that video and then I'm going to get into the gun issue with you.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  But I mean, you were telling me off air.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  You're looking at going totally independent even though you've got offers.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  Right.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  And we're talking to some different folks and we may do a kind of a combination where we work some with some, some bigger media,
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  but also have the freedom to go independent.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Yeah.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Well, I mean, I knew about this, you know, a week or so ago that this was happening and had him really called you.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  But I told you during the break, absolutely.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  I mean, you're a Texan as well.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  I would, I'm not afraid of popular people.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  I'm not afraid of good looking people.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  I'm not afraid of people being bigger than Alex Jones.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  This platform is to take on the globalist.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  This platform is to defeat the New World Order.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  So, I mean, I'll tell you, I'm too busy to chase you around, but you want to come work with us?
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Come down and check out the operation.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  I had tried everything.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  Now, that's results.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.

[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  We've got Ben Swann's video we're going to play.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Some up here in just a moment or you can watch it at benswann.com.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  We're going to link it up at infowars.com and prismplanet.com as well.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Speaking of alternative real media, the establishment media has already lost all credibility
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  because it's owned and controlled by big offshore and foreign banks who steal $85 billion a month.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  And the mainstream media makes about a trillion dollars a year in North America.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  A trillion dollars, but it's paid and made to be profitable, but it doesn't have the audience.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  It's like a tithe by the big mega corporations to keep people brainwashed, dumbed down.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  They're like, how do we make them stand down?
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Well, have cash, you know, teach 14-year-olds how to commit suicide, make it cool.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  I wonder why the little girls are committing suicide.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  Gee, it's this video, teach us somehow.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  I mean, just the most savage, screwed up stuff.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  They can weaponize it you, but the general public, more and more is tuning out of it.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  So MSNBC, top show million viewers, CNN, top show half a million viewers.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are over one million listeners.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  That's a conservative number, an hour.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  I mean, a million people are tuned in right now.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Three million over three hours, 15 million one way or another.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  That's very conservative in one week.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  It's more like 20 million now, but I'll just say 15.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  It's like my brain automatically lowers numbers.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  The point is, it's the opposite.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  If I catch a 10-pound fish, I say it's seven pounds.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  It's 15 million.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  How are they going to deal with that?
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  How are they going to...
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  The answer is they want to bring an internet too that shuts down the old web, as you know.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Internet ID, internet taxes.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  I mean, they're calling it extremism to criticize the government.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  I mean, that's not going to work saying we're all terrorists.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Because the people that know how to tie their shoelaces, that go to work every day,
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  that are informed, know that America's been taken over.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Now, you may have all the dumb down TV heads out there that are getting dumber by the day.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  Those people don't count.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  I mean, that's like telling my dogs to clean the house or cook dinner.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  I mean, they're not even really people.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  You know, the globalists call us general public animals.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  It's really true.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  The general public...
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  It's not just the programming and the bad food and the toxins in the water and the dumbing down.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  People, once they get liberty, want to be lazy.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I'm going to go back to our guest here.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  My point is spread the word about infowars.com.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Spread the word about prisonplanet.com.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Because we are a launchpad, a fulcrum.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  That's all I do is try to get other media people on, other folks, and promote what they're doing.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Because I understand that I'm not trying to be King Daddy here.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And I don't say this to talk about myself.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  It's a philosophy for you as well, because I know it's the real philosophy that will free us.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  I'm trying to raise everybody up.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  I need more people, more X-wings going in against the Death Star.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  So the 20 X-wings, we need a thousand, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  We might be able to do it with 20 X-wings.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  But the point is, a thousand X-wings, we're taking this thing down.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  You've got to decide you're getting in the X-wing.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  You've got to decide you're going after the enemy.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  And to do that, you've got to support and speak out and promote people that tell the truth.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  And buy from us, because we're self-funded.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  It takes me up to six, seven million dollars a year to fund this operation.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Selling books, t-shirts, sponsors, you name it.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  And we're very picky what we promote.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  We have the seed center now.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  We're going to add every great seed we're testing and working with people on non-hybrid, non-GMO, like the Survival Seed Vault.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  We have the best deal on this at the InfoWars Seed Center at infowarsstore.com.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  And everything we promote is when, when, when.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Plant a spring, a summer, a fall garden.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  Eat that food, can it, give it to friends and family.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Get outside.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  Don't watch as much television.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Kids are outside half as much as they were 20 years ago.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  They are killing our society.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  Get back to the earth.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Get outside.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  Go exercise.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  That's how you defeat the New World Order.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Turn off the iPad.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Turn off the iPhone.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  Get away from the mainstream television and support local AM and FM stations that carry this show.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  The high quality water filters, the storeable foods, the books, the videos.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  It's a war and you buy your war bonds at infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Now, Ben, we've got this video.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Ben Swan is leaving his hit TV show in Fox in Cincinnati that's become a national sensation.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  I know we carry all the stuff at infowars.com.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  And Ben, I'm ranting here about supporting the alternative media.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Talk a little bit about that, what you see happening in the media, replacing the mainstream media,
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  and then talk about the video we're about to play.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Well, I think you're making some really good points there because the bottom line is that you're watching this,
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  the steady erosion of viewership and listenership to typical mainstream media.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  And yet the average person is still very much under the impression that this is all there is out there.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  The internet, as you pointed out, you have all these internet protection bills for intellectual property
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  like SOPA and PIPA and SISPA and international treaties like ACTA.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  And those bills are really not designed, as you know, to do anything to actually protect intellectual property.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  They're designed to control information on the internet so that it creates less competition.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And what we're really seeing now is that there is a phenomenon happening that mainstream media never could have seen coming even 20 years ago.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  And through the internet, through streaming services and all these different platforms that are now available,
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  I mean, information is flowing to people in ways that like never before and people are turning away from traditional media,
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  even entertainment media, simply because they want to be able to pick and choose.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And so if you're an American under the age of 40, many of them don't even have cable anymore.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  You have a Netflix and you have Hulu and you're going straight to those sources even for entertainment.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  So what we're seeing is there's an opportunity now to say, listen, there's never been a time like this
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  where you have opportunity and you have technology that have kind of come together at this moment,
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  a growing liberty movement that does not have a voice in mainstream media and is growing like crazy.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And we didn't really choose to be here. This has kind of been thrust upon us, but we want to do something with it.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  We want to be responsible with the opportunity that we have and do something that's going to change the way people view things here in America.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  You're right. And again, there's a window because even CNET has to admit and Google that all these bills and all these treaties
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  are meant to quote, bring in Chinese style net censorship, Russian style censorship, taxes, Internet IDs.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  It's extra judicial where they just ban you from the web in three strikes.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  True authoritarianism with the Pentagon running it. I mean, it's nightmare.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  So now is the time, folks, to appreciate things like DrudgeReport.com or Ben Swan.com or Infowars.com
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  or PrisonPlanet.tv, like we're on Roku, we're on Boxy.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  There's hundreds of thousands of people a week just watching us on that now.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  Hundreds of thousands a week just watching us on the news.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  The radios millions using the old media format.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  But see, talk radio is the only old media that's still doing OK compared to the other dinosaur media
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  because it's outside the old box of censored teleprompter control, it's real open free form.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  So that's why talk radio is something the system also wants to censor.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  So it's kind of that wild card. Go ahead.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  That's right. Because remember, it was in the late 80s though, talk radio was all but gone.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  And it was when talk radio kind of was reinvented.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  It was the new advent of talk radio with creating conservative voices and Liberty voices that suddenly began to emerge
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  that talk radio made a comeback and has remained, as you said, very strong over the past number of years.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  But it was almost gone as a media simply because it had become really irrelevant to the national conversation
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  and it became relevant again. And that's what's happened with mainstream media is despite their best efforts,
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  they're just irrelevant to where most people are.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  They spend way too much time talking about things like Lindsay Lohan and not talking about issues, as you said,
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  about internet control or taxation or Second Amendment rights or drone strikes on American citizens.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  They won't talk about those issues and therefore made themselves irrelevant.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  Well, you're right. A few years ago, I was given the Talkers Trailblazer Award,
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  like their first place award. I forget the exact name of it. It was on the cover of their magazine.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And that's the big insider publication for talk radio.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  And I got there and spoke to the main executives of talk radio.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  And all I said to them was your children have no future if we don't beat the New World Order.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  I'm not going to get up here and tell you how I've been so successful.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  How have I been successful using every venue I could to warn people about attacks on our liberty
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  because I take it personal and sure, okay, well, you already know the answer.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Passion, focus, research, telling the truth, not caring what people think about me, being real.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  Okay, that's what'll make you successful in talk radio.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  You guys already all knew that. There I am in a room full of the top executives, only a couple hundred of them.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  And I said, you already know the answer. Now I'm going to tell you the rest of the answer.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  If you don't get on the ball and stand against the New World Order, they're going to take everything.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  They're not going to just take our guns and then not take your bank account or your pension.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  They're not just going to take our liberties when it comes to travel and not make you take inoculations.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Okay, I said, bottom line, bottom line, you better understand what's happening.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Go ahead, Ben.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  No, you're absolutely right. I mean, at the end of the day, media, you have to remember that this fourth estate that is the press,
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  obviously at the time of the founding, but is now media in America, really has a responsibility.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  We have a job and our job is to hold power in check and media gave that roll up a long time ago because they really became controlled by those powers.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  And so they've become an entertainment function or in some cases a propaganda function of political parties and powers that be.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  And so you have this situation today where there's almost, as you're talking about, this new advent of the fourth estate where,
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  but it's because of the internet, because information is able to be passed.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  The mainstream media created a vacuum by becoming total repeater mouthpieces to the point of the White House saying,
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  we're not going to even have press conferences anymore, we'll just give you a press release because we've got our own system.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  I mean, the mainstream media is making itself obsolete.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  Well, they absolutely are.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  But I'm sure you saw that, I believe it was Vice President Biden telling CNN, or Snow, excuse me, he thanked MSNBC,
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  but a senator who thanked CNN for helping them to push this gun bill through the Senate.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  And thanking them for spending, I guess, two days of covering this and trying to really make this case on behalf of the White House,
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  when instead it should be CNN that's standing up in the White House and saying, you know, why is it that senators aren't reading bills?
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  I know we're going to get into this in a minute, but, you know, how do you have someone like Senator Mike Lee,
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  who's standing up and saying that not one single senator has read the amendment that was issued by Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey?
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Not one single senator had bothered to read it. How are you all passing laws in this country that you haven't read?
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  We're going to play that in a moment. They're not even letting them see it now. That video's up on infowords.com.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  But I mean, take Amber Lyon, she's won all these Emmys, she's won all the World of War zones,
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  and then she can't go to these different Middle Eastern countries where the West is in charge,
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  running death squads, shooting men, women, and children.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  And then she learns, well, you didn't know, they've bought out your TV show.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  It's now funded by the, you know, government of Qatar or the government of...
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  And she found out that it turned out CNN and CNN International isn't just advertisers.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  The shows aren't just owned by the U.S. government. They're owned by foreign governments.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  And now the Communist Chinese say, you can't release Red Dawn, you know, remake with us in it.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  And by the way, you've got to re-edit World War Z. You can't show outbreaks in China when it's about outbreaks everywhere.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  So it's not just the globalist now, it's even foreign countries. We're wide open.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  I mean, America is like a giant whorehouse, and they've already sold us out.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Like, we've got to, you know, go into a bedroom with the New World Order.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  And I got news for you. You know, you're not selling me out, okay? Go ahead.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  No, you're absolutely right. And that's the issue that I think people have awakened to that they're not interested in anymore.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  I think anyone who's awake at all was saying, listen, we understand that none of this is legitimate.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  That what media is telling us, they're just propaganda wings of either political parties or governments.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  When you have Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton talking about the fact that the CCTV out of China
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  and that Al Jazeera TV and that Russia Today RT were really, as she was describing them, like effective propaganda tools
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  on behalf of their governments, saying our media here isn't effective enough as a propaganda tool.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  And so we need to actually be investing in state media in the United States.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  And you're thinking, I thought they were pretty effective.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  I mean, I thought CNN was pretty good at putting out this message on their behalf, but apparently not good enough in her mind.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  So what I think they're really saying is that we can't have the alternative voice to it.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  And that's why right now is a time like no other. And I know you know this, Alex, but it's a time like no other in American history
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  where information is here and the technology is here to get messages out to the masses.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  But the only way that happens is that people get behind it and support it and make it happen, just like folks have supported you for a long, long time.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Absolutely. What we're saying here to the listeners, I know most of our listeners get this, but there's people that kind of passively listen by the millions.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  You either get active or become slaves. And we've got a chance to win this because the globalists know because a large portion of the public are like zombies
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  that that allows them to take over. But it's almost an attribute that so many are zombies because there's a ton of liberty levers.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  More than there are globalists, we can take back over as well and build a new media to actually free the zombies.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  And I mean, the general public is becoming zombie-like. We're going to go to break and come back and play your video piece. But first, since you mentioned it,
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  here is the video of Senator Mike Lee saying nobody has read the bill. Trees in alert. Dems try to move Gun Bill 4 without allowing senators to read it.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Obamacare repeat. Senators not allowed to read the bill prior to closure. Here it is.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  The bills do not address. You see, Mr. President, these are the rights that we're trying to protect by requiring a 60-vote threshold on any new gun control legislation.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And in so doing, we're trying to prevent the ability of members to push through legislation before anyone has had time to read and evaluate the language
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  and then tell the American people what that language means for them, what that language would mean for their rights.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are faced with today. Yesterday, Senators Toomey and Manchin announced a proposal, a new proposal,
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  that's widely expected to replace the current language on the background checks in this bill.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And yet, as of this morning, as of this very moment, not a single senator has been provided the legislative text of that very provision.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Because the background check measure is the centerpiece of this legislation, it's critical that we all know what's in the bill before we vote on it.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  Ben, I mean, more importantly than even talking about reading the bills, that's obviously central, they're disingenuous. The Democrats are all on record saying they want to register to confiscate.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  It's not like that's a secret.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  That's right. Well, and it's the dims are very clear on what they're doing, but the Republicans are too. Listen, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, all three senators,
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  had originally said that they were going to do what they were going to filibuster this issue the same way they did with the nomination of John Brennan in order to bring this information to the American public.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  That 13 hour filibuster, by the way, on drones, we get a piece on this, there was a 50 point swing in American opinion on the right of the president to kill U.S. citizens overseas with drones,
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  who were suspected of terrorism, a 50 point swing within two weeks after that filibuster.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And so they were threatening to do the same thing again here. And it was Republicans, 16 Republicans, who actually prevented that filibuster from taking place.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Absolutely. All of them. Again, that's why they're so afraid of it. If one senator stands up, if one good man, every good person to come to the aid of liberty in our country right now,
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  because it shows we have power, we have the right on our sides, but we're in a sea of deception where nobody will stand up. And that's why I commend you, leaving your lucrative job at Fox,
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  to go start your own operation or go somewhere else to have freedom been, because that's what's going to happen.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It's like Bongino, that, you know, top of the secret service leading to tales, a star in it, leaves because of the collectivism,
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  when Obama was sitting there brainwashing children about how great communism is, he just couldn't do it anymore and quit.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And it's that decision saying, no, we're not going to be part of this lie with you that will lead the sheep out of bondage.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Well, I think that's where we're at. We really want to be able to be a voice, as I mentioned, that's speaking truth to people and speaking truth to power.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  And that's where, it's not just us, as you mentioned, you need people all over the nation.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Absolutely. Ben Swann, stay there, go on the bright, coming back.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  The EatPod is a unique, roll-away food bunker that creates the perfect conditions, can be buried up to 30 feet,

[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Burglars call it smash and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable.

[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm-monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.

[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Hey guys, Vince Vaughn here. Okay, so by now, no doubt you've heard either through Facebook or on the web someplace or from a friend,
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  but yes, in fact, I am leaving Fox 19 here in Cincinnati. The question is, where am I headed? And a lot of you have been asking, tell me, where are you going?
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Are you going to a network or are you headed off to the blaze? A lot of people are asking me that. Are you going to go independent?
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  A lot of questions about it. Look, be honest with you. Right now, I'm talking to a few different folks,
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  but I really want your input on this because when I came to Cincinnati two years ago, I'll be honest with you.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  I had absolutely no idea what was going to take place and we started this thing called reality check and thought this would be a great way of putting out some news content that other people weren't doing.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  I had no clue that reality check would explode the way that it has. The best thing about it though, to be honest with you, is that it connected me to you by far the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in my career.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  So as I take this next step, I'll be honest with you, I want your input. I want to know how you feel about the message that's been put out and what the next step should be.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  It's going to weigh heavily into that decision. And the best way for me to get that input is not through somebody going on Facebook and giving me their ideas.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  It's actually for you to do me a huge favor and go over to my brand new website, binswan.com. It's super easy to find.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  And when you get there, take the survey. We have a few questions on there to get your input, find out a little bit about you and about where you think this next step should lead.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Look, I've said it before, I am a huge fan of the people who would say they were my fans. I appreciate the content you guys send me, the things that you've said in the past, the support you've given, the story ideas that you've given me, the education you've helped me to get.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  I think we're a pretty good team so far. So go over to my website, binswan.com, take that survey. It'll take just a few minutes of your time and we'll get back together very soon. I'll see you then.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  All right, there you go. And people always ask me, why do I promote other liberty-oriented media? I do it because we don't have a future if we don't.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  And it's funny you mentioned Beck in there. I think I told you like six months ago off air, I said I wouldn't be surprised if Beck doesn't offer you a job because I know he's building a whole network off basically ideas I put on there, which is fine.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  I think that's great. And just my only painful thing is hearing something him reading word for word info wars articles, then telling his listeners don't trust info wars.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  I mean, I see it all the time. Every time I tune in, it's insane. But it's funny you mentioned Beck there. I don't want to go off into that whole discussion, but you were telling me off air, you're probably going to go independent.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  And I think that's probably the best move and then just have your stuff out there everywhere. But you know, you could go into Dallas. It's just that I don't think you're you're quite effeminate enough to join his sidekicks.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  I don't even know what to say.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  It's a joke. It makes them mad. They hate me. They're listening right now. Hi, Glenn. Cover my stuff tomorrow on the air. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  No, you know.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  No, Glenn Beck show is my show. I mean, the truth is it's my show. So I mean, I like it actually.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  It's interesting, though, because a lot of people have assumed that that's the place and I'm not sure why. In fact, to be honest with you, I mean, I've never, never had a conversation with Glenn Beck.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  No, no, no. He would be intimidated by that. I actually told you that off air two, six months ago, but if he was smart, he would. But let's go back here. I mean, come on.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  You see, you're probably going to move to San Antonio, I'm guessing. I guess you got family and then you'll be down here in a few months doing your own thing.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Well, and the question will be what it looks like ultimately. I mean, we're working. One of the things you're going to find on the survey. If you go over there and you take that survey is we're considering, you know, trying to launch something
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  possibly through Kickstarter to do some crowdsourcing and you get together, you know, a plan to put something together, put out some content that we think was going to be really important for people.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  That'll be informational, be educational and then taking that content. And like I said, getting into streaming services, getting it out there where people can see it.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  Because, you know, one thing that we're really about is really trying to open up people's minds.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  I almost see us as the bridge between mainstream and alternative media and saying there's a lot of good information over here, guys, that you're missing because you're watching the wrong things.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  Hey, you know what? We're going to break for one minute. Come back and do five more minutes with me. I want to show you a few articles, Ben, that you'll never see in the mainstream that I'd like you to cover when you launch your own operation.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  There goes my voice going completely out, folks. All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  These all natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth friendly and safe.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  See them on the web at 5starsope.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs. This is an amazing deal.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  See them on the web at 5starsope.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  All right, here's stories you'll never see in establishment megaphone, prostitute media known as mainstream media.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  Really dying carcass, state run, new world order run, vending machine media.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  I mean, really vending machine media. Because foreign governments just China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  Hey, we'll give you half a million dollars. Don't let your reporter criticize or line up people up and shoot them.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  Amber Lyon, get rid of her. We'll put a few coins in.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  Ben Swan is here. The answer is move in an exodus away from these people.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Here's an article you'll never see. Italian Supreme Court President blames Bilderberg for terrorist attacks,
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  strategy of tension. Their head of their CIA has gone public saying they're staging terror attacks
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  as a pretext to destroy liberty worldwide that they have the documents.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  You think you'd see that mainstream news. Also, who gave North Korea nukes in the first place?
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  We have links to 10-year-old mainstream news articles, but you won't see this now.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  But you will see somebody like Ben Swan cover it, so then Fox tells him, oh no, just do local stuff.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  Ben, would you cover stuff like this once you launch your own operation or is that the ravings of a fascist?
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  No, no, absolutely. Listen, I'm especially intrigued, by the way, by this article you guys have up about
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  who gave these nukes to North Korea in the first place. And listen, part of what we do, too, is because
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  what we really try to do is stay away from editorializing, obviously. We have a little bit different brand
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  than what we do, but one of the things that we're really about, and I love what you guys have done with this,
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  is we try to go back and find sources and find facts from the past, because one thing that media does not do a very good job of
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  is ever going back and saying, hey, what did we say about this five years ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago?
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  It's the same concept with al-Qaeda. You mentioned this before, al-Qaeda in Syria. Well, go all the way back to al-Qaeda
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  being created with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the late 1970s, early 1980s, and yet media forgets that conveniently today.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  They never talk about those issues today, never discuss the fact that our government funded this and created it,
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  and today we're repeating history all over again.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  You're right, and at a certain point it's got to stop, because we see cultures throughout history go crazy,
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  and I talked to a lot of mainstream media people, they don't like what's happening either. They don't like being on a short leash.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  Yeah. Well, no, they don't, and there's a lot of really good reporters out there and smart reporters,
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  and they understand that at the end of the day they have to do what they're ultimately told to do,
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  and I think that there's more and more people kind of pushing back against that and moving away from it,
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  and again, it's things like access through the internet, and there's just a lot of platforms out there.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  So, one of the most important things we do, groups like Campaign for Liberty have talked a lot about the absolute necessity
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  of keeping the internet free of government control, and it's vitally important that that happens,
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  and I think your listeners absolutely know that, but again, where we play a service here is to go out and find folks who don't know it yet.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Exactly. Everybody's got to promote liberty and go out and wake other people up.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Obama's got to rally people to try to take our guns. He needs that grassroots.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  Look at how the White House senior advisor to Obama came out and said, we hate Drudge Report.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  We can't even talk because of him picking up what we say.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  Well, you're the one saying it. That shows how pathetically weak the little man behind the curtain is,
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  but getting back to this North Korea thing, before you leave in a few weeks, your station there,
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  come to them and say, well, I can't cover North Korea threatening to nuke America.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  Doesn't that affect Cincinnatians locally?
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  And then, you know, do a reality check on the fact that our government and others help give the fiscal material to North Korea.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  How could they say no to you on that?
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  You know what? I'll absolutely do that. I'll absolutely do that story. We'll do it this next week.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  We do them Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and so absolutely we'll do that story.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Because again, you know, the station for us, as we're going out, you know, obviously they have their direction that they're going in,
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  and they've never really suppressed anything we've done. I don't see them suppressing this, so I think we'll be okay with it.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  But I'll definitely do the story because, as you guys are pointing out, you've got great information here and sources,
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  and these aren't wild conspiratorial sources.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  Well, wait a minute. Somebody else has something to say. Somebody else's playing. They have something to say to us.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  You know, Alex Jones, you piece of garbage. I don't know what your deal is.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  Hey, Ben Swann, you're awesome. We need to talk off here. Have a meeting soon. Thanks for coming on, bro.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  I wish y'all the luck.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  Get SimplySafe.com
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  The fact is, you are. We all are.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based products are best for you.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  I call them vending machine because whoever puts money into them, they'll say whatever their buyers tell them to say.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  The PR media, the propaganda media, we're going to be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  North Korea saying they've loaded A-bombs on top missiles and are preparing to blow up.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  I've got the quotes right here. They're going to blow up Tokyo, the most populous city in the world.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  How many people live in Tokyo? Like 30 million or something?
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  I mean, I would be pretty angry, but you know what? I've heard pundits on Fox News say the Japanese ought to be thankful for Fukushima
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  because radiation is good for them. Ann Coulter said that and she said she wasn't joking.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  So I would suggest Ann Coulter go get on top the highest skyscraper in Tokyo and say,
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Kim Jong-il, fire the missile. I'm about to really get some health here.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  These people are so out of control, man.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  But I've got to tell you, I've kind of gone over the mountain just where I'm at peace.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  Because the last few weeks I've been so upset about everything and just so worried about everything.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  And you know what? God's in control. And whatever's going to happen is in God's plan.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  And God's plan is for all of us, though, to speak out and be involved.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Because physically what happens to us, you know, we probably can't control all that, but spiritually we can.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  And you know, I'm not telling you what to subscribe to, you know, religiously or anything.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  I'm just saying, if you don't feel God's presence, something's wrong with you.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  Let me tell you, there's like a lot of zombies out there in the population.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  And that's what I want to talk about now is consciousness.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  You can just type into a search engine. Brain waves of the average Westerner are dropping.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  TV Alzheimer's connections. Neurological disorders. The English language is growing in words and popularity.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  But the amount of words used is shrinking. People aren't communicating.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  You go to a restaurant. Every kid in the place is on an iPad or iPod.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  The parents aren't talking. They're on an iPad or iPod.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  And they're not even researching news or info. They're like, you know, looking at entertainment stuff.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  IQs are dropping. That's physical. In fact, guys, print me an article on that right now.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  IQs dropping in the West. Sodium fluoride in the waters. Harvard study on average.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  A 15 to 20% IQ reduction. If you live in a city that's fluoridated and drink it as a child.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  I mean, these are facts, stubborn things they are, that we are under this mass mind control system
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  where they turn up the social engineers in their own words, the ambient level of distractions,
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  diversions, infighting, cultural poison. I mean, I was watching this morning.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  There's a story up on info wars.com about Kesha. And I hadn't really ever followed her.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  And I watched a couple of her videos and it's teaching 14 year old girls how to commit suicide
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  and songs about committing suicide and having her fans send in, you know, their teeth to wear around her neck
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  and how she loves Satan and the devil and, you know, all of this.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  And they're not just doing this to be cool. This is the spirit of the age.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  This is how do we hurt the youth? How do we screw them up so bad?
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  They roll over to us to bring in the control grid.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  And I'm going to break down what the control grid is after we play this video.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Now, you know, I've been doing Man on the Street for a long time, 16 years.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  And I've had my reporters doing it and we're going to be doing more of it.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  And I think all of you should be going out doing Man on the Street for your own YouTube channel or online.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  I mean, it's really to create a cultural engagement with people about how dumb down folks have gotten.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  Leanne McAdoo, the story's up on prisonplanet.tv. She went out and could find no one that knew that
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  the hydrogen monoxide was water. Redoing a pen and teller skit from like nine years ago.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  And we heard that yesterday that they picked up from a high school student who had done it a few years before that,
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  showing his whole class, including his so-called biology teacher, did not know what the hydrogen monoxide was.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  And so we went out and did it and found no one in Austin in a wealthiest part of town right on the pedestrian bridge
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  with, you know, all these university professors and people, none of them knew what the hydrogen monoxide was.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  And they did call for banning it because it has a scary sounding name like carbon dioxide or sodium chloride
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  or potassium chloride, table salt, sodium chloride is, potassium chloride, a variant of it.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  And that's why I want to air this Mark Dice piece because just Mark, when he's on, just does a tremendous job.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  And it's good to see him, you know, out there really showing how dumb down people are.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  He did another video where he's like, did you hear we nuked China and blew up two other cities last week
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  over the trade deficit and people are like, oh, that's, that's, you know, that's a good idea.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Or, oh, I don't care. Or, okay, well, whatever. You know, we might have wanted to talk to him.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  I mean, just totally discont... Oh, millions are dead. Okay, I got to go.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  Look, if you don't care about millions dying, which didn't die and don't even know about something like that,
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  do you think you've got any future? These are people in a zombie state raised in their diapers in front of a television
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  where they don't interact. It's a mental illness. And the globalists brag about this.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  Their brainwaves are very close to a sleep state. You see them walk around.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  You say it's like they're in a daze. They're in one.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  And when you go, hey, wake up, they're like your five-year-old don't want to get out of bed.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  They'll be waking my seven-year-old up or, you know, 10-year-old and, hey, get up.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  You know, we got to go to church or whatever. Oh, let me sleep 10 more minutes.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Just saying, oh, leave me alone. Leave me alone.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  We've got to wake these zombies up. Plus, it's more invigorating to be awake.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And that is what's happened. I mean, it is a mass-zombiosis.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  So when they laugh at you, that's a pre-programmed response,
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  because they've seen millions of simulated murders on TV, death-killing, video games.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  So you tell them about, hey, you know, two million dead Chinese in a nuclear attack,
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  and they just go, oh, I don't care, because they can't differentiate what's real.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  And this has been done scientifically. The globalists brag about this.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  Bernays bragged about it 60, 70 years ago.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  And now they've got a giant horde of people who don't care if millions are dying in Iraq or whatever for real,
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  but then when the media shakes them out of it to go, the dead children, here's their names,
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  then they cry and call for our guns over 20 dead kids.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  You know, they're taken out of the trance occasionally, but only by the programmers.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  So there's a split. There's people waking up, and there's people that are getting deeper into the trance.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  And I'm going to have my crew go out in Austin.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  In fact, I was already planning on it. I guess great minds think alike.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  And I was already, because I just love the good work people do.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  I just love the work of Ben Swan. I love the good work of people like Mark Dice.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  You know, even if I individually, you know, particularly I'm sad for people in there and their own personal stuff,
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  I still have to admire important work, because that's what matters.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  That's what matters in this universe.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  And I just have, I was just reading the Bible passages this morning, you know, about turn the other cheek.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  But that's with your brethren, not with the new order. Christ beat the money changers.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  But when your brethren are having issues, you need to love them, especially to guide them and build them up
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  to do the great work that needs to be done fighting tyranny.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  We are builders, and that's our job. And we need to shake these zombies out of their mind control.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Mark Dice's excellent report.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  We're going to just repeal the Second Amendment and take the guns away from the crazy right-wing white extremists
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  and just make sure that only the illegal unsigned guns stay on the streets.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  By repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  against the white people, the right-wing extremists, take away their guns, well, birthday.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  Oh, my birthday, it's gonna be your birthday.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  We're repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door gun confiscations,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  then that way only the unregistered guns will be out, and it'll be much safer that way.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  Thank you for supporting us.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  Just a name and a signature.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  We're trying to just repeal the Second Amendment to make sure that only the criminals have the guns
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  and get them out of the hands of the law-abiding citizens to repeal the Second Amendment.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  It's such an old fashion.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  They're signing a petition to repeal the Second Amendment.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  We're just making sure that the law-abiding gun owners have that right taken away.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  All right.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  We're gonna repeal the Second Amendment.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  Only the police and the military need to have guns.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  This is the best guy.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  They've never done anything wrong, and we're just gonna get the legal-registered guns off the street.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  You don't have to convince us, my friend.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  This will remove all the law-abiding registered gun owners and then the criminals sign.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  The criminals won't turn their guns in, so they'll still have their guns after we repeal the Second Amendment.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  Thank you for supporting them.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  Come on, bro. You don't want the kids to die in another massacre like Sandy Hook, do you?
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  No, but you're just...
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  Come on, bro.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  We're gonna repeal the Second Amendment.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  No, I don't want to.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  Well, come on. We want to help keep people safe.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  We can trust, but you can't be trusted on this, guys.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  The police can be trusted.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  Only two young women.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  The doctor about 17 said no.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  No, thank you.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  A chance to win a free Xbox to repeal the Second Amendment?
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  I can't do this with a straight face.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  What we're doing is we're supporting the Lord repealing the Second Amendment to get the guns off the streets.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  The police, if you have any problems, you can call the police.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  You don't need to defend your family yourself, so we're just repealing the Second Amendment.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  California is the deepest under-mind control.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  We're just supported repealing the Second Amendment. Thank you so much.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  We're trying to just print.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  Even if you have a permit?
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  Birthday, please.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  We're just repealing the Second Amendment for all and a signature.
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  We're just repealing the Second Amendment for all law-abiding citizens.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  We don't need that.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  If you have a problem or if you have a threat to your family, you just call the police.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  You can wait on them.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  That's true.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Thank you so much for that.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  We don't need these Tea Partiers and these law-abiding citizens to own guns.
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  And they all sign.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  That's for the police and the militia.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  The key is he talks like a zombie.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  In today's society, we can trust the government enough to...
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  That's the NPR voice.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000] ...have the weapons.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  I don't know if he's doing this on purpose, but these people are hypnotized.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  He's speaking to them in the proper voice.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000] ...and take them away from everybody.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  Alright.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Thanks for supporting that.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  Thanks for turning them in.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Okay, just checking.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  What we'll do after the Second Amendment is repeal this.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  We'll have some door-to-door searches to confiscate the registered weapons.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  Women's science databases of all...
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  The rest of the video is up at infowars.com.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  We're going to post it right there along with this Nuke China.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  People think China's been nuked and don't care and don't even know.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  These people are in a zombie state.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  Good job, Mark.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:52.000] ...and check out their spring specials.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  Again, that number is 800-OR-09-5633.

[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  Vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the bokashi.

[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  But my dreams.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  But my dreams.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  They are on us.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  As Paul Bogala's conscience seems to be.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  As my conscience seems to be.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  I was just out there. They have CNN on the TV.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Can you guys pump that in here for TV viewers, radio listeners?
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  Paul Bogala. I mentioned that weeks ago.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  He has his own TV show.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  His own TV show.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  And notice all over CNN, ABC, you name it.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  It's nothing but former government people.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  Because it's state run media.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  And he's the guy that said executive orders.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  Stroke of the pen.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Law of the land.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  Kind of cool.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  An incredibly nasty person deeply involved in the black ops of the clenched administration.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Anderson Cooper's admittedly CIA.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  And we've got to sit up there with classical brainwashing media.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  And you know I said I'd get into the heart of the new world order.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  I've gotten to a lot of it.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  But you've got to understand this is like medical triage.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  When people get totally lazy, totally decadent, totally stupid,
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  totally disconnected from reality.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  They're like lambs of the slaughter. We have become domesticated.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  It's like a dog you put in a box its whole life and just throw food in the jail cell window.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  It doesn't know anything about the outside world.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  It is a victim.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  And people set in front of televisions their whole life.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  They see their neighbors shot and killed.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  They don't even care.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  They saw that on the movies a thousand times.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  And the fact that we went out in Austin with a petition.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  And everyone signed it to ban water.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  Everyone.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  One guy came up and we were leaving.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  People said why didn't you get him?
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  Because we were leaving.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  And said wait that was dihydrogen monoxide.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  That's water, isn't it?
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  A guy we talked to.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  I mean that is crazy.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  Number one you'd say what is it?
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  And she kept saying well it's water basically.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  It's what you wash your stuff with.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  I mean they didn't get it.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  She's like laughing at them.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  They're on the bridge with the Colorado River under them.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  And they even call the Colorado River Lady Bird Lake.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  See it's this false reality.
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  Let's just name a stretch of the river off of the former first lady
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  and call it a lake.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  They're like oh what's the big thing there?
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  It's that everything is a stinking lie now.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  It is an ocean of lies.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  It is an overthrow of reality.
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  That's what the new March magazine that everybody should subscribe to.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  Big color magazine to wake people up.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  Buy them in bulk, 10 up to 100.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  It's probably going to sell out again.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  So get them, give them to people.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  And it shows all the government lies and hoaxes.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  And people that are even awake go well that's just what they do.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  They lie.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Yeah and they're licking their chops now to take your pension funds.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  They're going to take everything.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  America had all this wealth because people would kill you
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  if you tried to push them around.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  America's had all its problems and boy do they get advertised.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  But compared to any other country we made more science, more inventions,
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  more patents, more wealth.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  You got in a war with us.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  Everybody feared us before we even had high-tech weapons.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  Because we were real.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  We came here through adversity.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  You came here through adversity.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  And now the globalists, the social engineers know what Victor Hugo said is true.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Adversity makes men.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  And I go look at the young people.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  They are monsters.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  Unhealthy monsters.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  I mean I have a stack of articles here.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  And I'm going to do a whole special report on what the New World Order master plan is.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  Where people can't talk now.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  The IQs are dropping.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  The language is shrinking.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  People are getting early onset of Alzheimer's.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  It's all happening.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  You know I've been behind the scenes on Mancals TV show.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  That's now number one in Chicago.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  Symbol Cast with his radio show.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  And he's even saying to his crew.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  He's like get off the smart phones.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Everybody wake up.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Wake up.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Wake up.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  And I've been in other companies and businesses.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  We're going to end lunch.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Let's keep those smart phones off.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Let's everybody wake up.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  That's what they say about all the top companies that are left.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  The person running it knows everybody is in a trance.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  It's like hey.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Wake up.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  Wake up.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  Because the television is at a flicker rate.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Training you to go into a mesmerized state.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  Reading make sure IQ go up.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  Make sure brain connections go up.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  Because you have to visualize.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  If I say Marilyn Monroe standing on top of that grate
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  with that wind blowing up in her dress.
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  You just had to go find that connection.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  Data retrieve it.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  And then fire it up.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  Now it hits other areas of your brain.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  The image of an attractive woman.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Let's see.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  With TV you don't.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  It's just there.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  And it gets rid.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  They say most fish.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  Have an attention span of a couple minutes.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  See you're supposed to have an attention span
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  of hours as a hunter.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  You're supposed to have long term memory.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  Everything.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  You don't have a memory because you never accessed it.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  Radio.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  You've got to listen and image it. Same as reading.
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Boost IQ.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  TV.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  Especially mainstream TV kills it.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  We're on the march.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  We're on the march.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  Calling 888-253-3139.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  3% off your entire order.
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  We're on the march.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  Red mutual help.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  Mhm.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  Mm.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  Mm.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  Yeah.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  Mm hm.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  Yeah.

[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  And check out their spring specials. Again, that number is 800-409-5633
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  Well, thank the good Lord above that Dr. Steve Pachennick got safely back from the DMZ.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  We have unprecedented fear mongering going on.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  With North Korea saying, well, Nuke, Tokyo, we're loading the warheads.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  And I don't have a theory. I have facts.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  But the best evidence points towards criminal elements in the Anglo-American Dutch
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  Imperium in the great game actually telling Kim Jong-un to do this
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  as a promise for oil and food so they can sell weapons.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  And Pachennick hinted at this, but when he was in the country,
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  he seemed a little concerned about it until he got back.
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  We'll find out what he thinks in a moment and I'll recap that.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  But first off, I wanted to get to this before we forgot.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  How the Pentagon used video games to spy on users worldwide, Democracy Now,
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  they brag that they're watching you over Connect and Xbox and all this.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  It's like the last Starfighter that actually recruited people to fly drones off of their scores.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  But this was to then track people and to have it designed for Muslims to pick it up
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  and track everything they're doing.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  Pretty amazing that they did this with native Echo.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  And so just be aware of that. Here's another one.
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  Hackers use Android remotely attack and hijack an airplane.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  And that's out of a computer world.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  And again, this is just two articles today.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  Here's another one. Zero Hedge.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  Carmen Reinhardt. No doubt our pensions are screwed.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  It's being announced everywhere here and in Europe.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  The pensions are already gone.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  That's why they want your bullets and your guns, folks.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  They know you're going to be mad.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  They're going to take the vets' pensions, too.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  And they've done actuaries knowing a lot of them are going to go haywire over it.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  A lot of cops in the military are going to get killed and they're going to have a civil war.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Instead, let's just all come together, take the states back,
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  triage and ride off the derivatives, arrest the globalists, restore the Republic.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  But we're going to talk to Dr. Pachinick here in a moment.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  This is a little three-minute report that Alain McAdoo put together with Facebook's new home system
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  that ties into all the internet spying I was just talking about, where he calls you dumb efforts.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  He goes, my customers think that they can trust me.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  You're a bunch of dumb efforts and laughs at you.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  And then goes to Bilderberg and then does a pump and dump, total scam with the Facebook stock.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  And he doesn't go to jail because he's in the untouchable club,
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  the white shoe boys to use the East Coast parlance.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  And we'll see how untouchable they are.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  I mean, they think Homeland Security, this new fifth branch, the military is going to protect them.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  This fifth branch of tyranny. That isn't rhetoric, by the way, that's what it is.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  So let's go to this report and then to Dr. Pachinick to give us his take,
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  what he can really tell us now that he got back being cased by the CIA and others.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  But here is Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo and this is an Infowars News Bulletin.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  Facebook will launch its latest data mining device with the release of Facebook Home on April 12th.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  The company's new move into the lucrative mobile advertising market
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  comes on the heels of last year's pump and dump scandal, which cost investors billions.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  The mobile app will first be available to Android users and according to the site,
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  from the moment you wake your phone, you'll be immersed in cover feed.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  Before, if you wanted to be inundated with the vacuous status updates of your friends
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  and pictures of their half-eaten breakfast, you had to manually launch the Facebook app.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  Well, no more.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  Behold the future.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  By replacing the unlock and home screen of your phone,
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  the company that's determined to creep into every area of your life
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  can now flood your phone with pictures, chat requests and suggestions
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  without even needing to be unlocked.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  With Facebook Home, you're basically authorizing the complete surrender of your privacy,
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  much like its web-based counterpart that is no stranger to privacy encroachment.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  Home will collect information like your location, how you connect with friends,
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  what sort of apps you interact with and your internet searches
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  in order to personalize the advertising that will be seized your handheld device while it's awake.
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  As we've reported before, Facebook is regularly used by the IRS to scan your account
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  and Twitter feed while conducting audits.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Now, if you launch an app via Facebook Home,
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  information about your purchases could be stored and subject to subpoena,
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  much like all the other information Facebook collects on you.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  Law enforcement officials also scour social networks using facial recognition software
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  and have arrested people like this 20-year-old
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  for posting a picture of graffiti to her Facebook-owned Instagram account.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Even something as innocent as liking a religious or political page
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  or attending a rally is collected and can be used against you.
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  Why then would anyone want to be smartphone shackled to a social network
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  that's known for mining and collecting data
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  and then providing that information to advertisers and other nefarious systems?
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Basically, the app signals Facebook's ideal to have you chronically connected
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  to the Facebook interface so it can be the sole data house of citizen intelligence.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that home is built around people, not apps,
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  which means that users can spend more time interacting with their friends
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  and families on their smartphones.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  Well, if by family he means keeping you perpetually connected to big brother,
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  big sis, and DARPA, well, kudos to you, Zuckerberg.
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  Maybe you were right about your Facebook users.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and this has been an InfoWars News Bulletin.
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  And for radio listeners, during the pause, we show the headline
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  where he publicly said, you're a bunch of dumb aphors.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  I mean, and that's the thing. They're laughing at you.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  They pump and dump you. Facebook and the CIA was a book of enemies' faces.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  I mean, even the name, it's just all a giant, sick joke.
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  You say, well, why do you want Facebook?
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  Well, I mean, a lot of special forces parachute behind enemy lines.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  I mean, we're there to engage us. We're the fighters.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  Why are we on YouTube, the big DARPA run system?
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Because we're here to bring war against tyranny.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  Okay, they're waging war on us. We're waging Info War on them.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  And just open up in all directions. Don't overthink your attacks.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  Just attack in all directions. We will bring them down by force of mass.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  I mean, their own minions are zombies, folks. Brainwaves are lowered.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  IQ's dropping under chemical binary attack.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  All we've got to do is energize, plug into our hardwired instinctive drives
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  that we have enemies running things, and we'll take everything over.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  They need you focused on them feeling guilty about yourself for...
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  I'm not going to get into the psychology of it. Let's go to Dr. Steve Pacinic joining us back in the U.S.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  He bravely flew over there unannounced and went up to the DMZ,
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  former top hostage negotiator and crisis manager for the State Department
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  and combat veteran in classified operations before that.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  He helped found the Delta Force with General Boykin.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  Most of you know who he is. Very interesting guys.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Helped overthrow governments with psiops. You name it.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  And he joins us. Here's what I wanted to cover with you.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  Just out of the gate, sir. Just a quick answer on this.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  You said it's all a false flag between China, the U.S., North Korea, and others,
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  but, you know, to sell weapons and that North Korea wants oil and food,
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  and it's not a black box, obviously.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Since you talked to us, it turns out there were secret meetings.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  Put that up on screen, guys, Reuters.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  With the Pentagon, Kim Jong-un a month ago, before all this started,
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  and I have Rumsfeld, a mainstream news article from 15 years ago, up on infowars.com,
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  who gave North Korea the nukes in the first place, U.S. government and the CIA,
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  China's massing troops on the border with North Korea, threatening them like they never had before.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  Is North Korea almost out of China's control?
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  Have they done a flip-flop, you know, like stalling away from Hitler?
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Or has Hitler cheated him first with their deal in Poland?
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Is Kim Jong-un actually being manipulated, or will he be double-crossed,
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  now threatening to nuke Tokyo? I mean, am I wrong, sir, in saying this is unprecedented?
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  Dr. Steve Pochenik joining us.
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  No, not at Alex. First of all, let me congratulate you.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  I came here to San Francisco, and believe it or not, I was at Berkeley last night,
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  and you are a hero in a left-wing organization called Berkeley University.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  So you have really reached out across the spectrum.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  Alex, I'm very proud of you. Let me get right out to the point.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Number one, Kim Jong-un is not relevant.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  The entire issue here has to do with dynamics.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  It has to do with dynamics of the United States, Japan, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  Kim Jong-un is not out of control, not at all.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  All he is doing is expressing the dynamic of trying to get more food, more oil,
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  and more subsistence from the United States, Japan, and other countries,
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  because this is a weak nation. It's a nation that's falling apart.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  It's what we call a failed state.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  For the most part, we have kept that nation alive so that we wouldn't implode
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  nor the South Korea, because it was too poor.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  But in reality, we're keeping it there to justify the use of our naval fleet in South China Sea,
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  and an excuse to use a lot of our military equipment as a test ground
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  for the Navy, the Marine, and the Air Force.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  The reality is that Kim Jong-un is not even relevant.
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  He's really just following directions according to his aunt, his uncle,
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  and the China handler from China, as well as the understanding that he has had
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  with the CIA, the DIA, the DNI, because he's lived 13 years in Switzerland.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  All of our intelligence operatives know him very, very well.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  All he's done now is to really just bluster a lot of words.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  There is no nuclear missiles that can do anything whatsoever.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  The South Koreans, when I left, were mocking America.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  They thought we were absolutely...
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  So was that report leaked on purpose?
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  Because I understand they do have some atomic devices and some smaller missiles
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  that might be able to deliver them to Seoul or Japan.
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  But you're saying that's even baloney.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  That's baloney.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Basically, every country has atomic devices.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  Let me put it this way.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  When I put it this way, Pakistan has 107 tactical nuclear weapons that we developed
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  between the CIA, the ISI, and Mr. Khan in order to create a strategic tension force.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  And you've never seen Pakistan use it.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  Instead, we talk about Iran.
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  Sure.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  And then our media acts like it was an accident.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  There's no capacity to hit anything whatsoever.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  But we make it...
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  You use it as an excuse to deploy our troops into South China Sea,
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  to deploy them into Australia.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  But you remember the meeting between Obama and Hillary in Myanmar during the time that
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  we were in Syria?
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  And I said to myself, this was very unusual.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  So this was all preplanned as a way of not necessarily having a false flag,
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  but having a point of strategic tension so that the president, once again,
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  could incompetently handle or not handle a situation that would put him in the history books.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  Remember, a president in the United States can do nothing domestically.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  He has already damaged our economy and Obamacare.
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  But now, internationally, he has created another situation.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  So it's more narcissism where all I see...
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  But there will be no nuclear missiles in this one.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  It will not be effective.
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  So, I mean, I turn on CNN.
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  All it is is former Clinton and Obama people, now with their own TV shows.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  This is just mad narcissism.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  Well, it's beyond mad narcissism.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  What it is is that's out of control.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  What it is is really criminal behavior.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  And really, this is where the American public, your public, the entire public,
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  the Berkeley public has to say, cease and desist.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  Because what are we, in fact, doing is I came back here in San Francisco.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  I see more homeless people.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  I see more beggars.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  I see poorer infrastructure that mirrors more like North Korea than it does South Korea.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  In some ways, I feel when I come to San Francisco and downtown,
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  when I see all these bombs were supported and under...
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  Oh, it's rotting.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  America is rotting.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  It's one of the great liberals.
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  I feel I'm more in North Korea than I am in South Korea, where there's wealth,
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  there's control, and there's prosperity.
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  So we've become very much like North Korea.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  We're mimicking the North Korean reaction and we're mimicking a North Korean economy,
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  which is going down militarily controlled and no financial capacity to grow
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  for manufacturing the way South Korea can.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  So the irony is we're becoming more and more like North Korea and less like South Korea.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  All right, let me stop you.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  You've said Rumsfeld's really bad news.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  He seems to commence...
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  Rumsfeld's a criminal.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  Rumsfeld's not just bad news.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  I've known Rumsfeld since he was a secretary of defense under Nixon.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  No one liked him.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  He was a dangerous man then.
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  He had a very little understanding of strategic and tactical war.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  He was a very...
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  Well, look at what he did with Iraq.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  But let's just stop right there.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  Let me just bring this up to you here.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  I want to ask you what's changed because neocons were still defending Iraq just a few years ago.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  Now they admit it was a disaster.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  But let me raise this.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  We have the article at infowars.com who gave North Korea the nukes in the first place
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  and it links to BBC AP Reuters from 15 years ago and 10 years ago when Clinton and others
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  and the UN transferred reactors in North Korea that are perfect for making atomic...
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  the enriched uranium for atomic bombs.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  Why would the West want to give that hermit empire the ability to make atomic bombs?
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  And then here we are being told we got to have TSA do proctology exams on our wife
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  because bin Laden might be up there.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  But at the same time, the globalists have given atomic weapons to these morons.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  Well, it's a very good question, Alex.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  I was part indirectly of a beating on that and I was against it.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  But the reason that was done because Clinton again, Bill Clinton and Hillary are not very competent,
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  most of our leaders aren't, it was an attempt to appease the North Korean by giving them
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  a concessionary point where we would control some form of nuclear reactor which was under our control
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  and it was in a sequestered package.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  So honestly, we did give them a controlled, quasi-private, public, underwritten,
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  a nuclear capacity to keep them quiet.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  But truthfully, it was incompetent writ large.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  We are completely incompetent in the way we handle foreign affairs and domestic affairs.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  What's happening is, again, we've gone in towards an Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria,
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  and now we are basically incompetently handling...
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  Why are they putting out reports? I mean, it looks like they did it on purpose.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  Oh, we didn't mean to leak that. Oh, it's quasi-secret to say that they've got weapons and can deliver them.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  They know. They have no weapons to deliver it. Let me give you the following.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Why did they leak that then?
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  A man who's totally incompetent next Air Force General, James Clapper,
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  who had no idea what he does, was put in there by Feinstein and a whole group after 9-11,
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  who is head of the Director of National Intelligence, which means absolutely nothing.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  Another confusing aspect.
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  Then you have the head of the CIA, John Brennan, who we know is totally incompetent
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  and created a lot of the false flag.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Then we have on top of that the head of the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, Mike Flynn,
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  the General, who really doesn't know anything.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  Then above that, you have the National Geostation Agency,
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  another intelligence organization that know nothing.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Now, you put together five different military intelligence organizations with one civilian
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  to put together a White House with incompetent little neophytes and children,
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  and you get groupthink of ignorance.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Then they come out with an analysis that has no relevance to the real world.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  Then you go to Seoul, Korea, and everybody's laughing at you.
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  You go to Japan, everybody's laughing.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  Exactly. Let me expand on this then, because we've seen this with Hitler going east.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  We see this with Nero. We see this happen where they go crazy in their own echo chambers.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  Now they're admittedly getting caught in lies everywhere.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  Correct.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  They're plans to try a domestic takeover.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  That's not going to work.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  I mean, I agree with you, because not normally it's an incompetence deal.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  It's a tyranny deal.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  They think they're in control.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  They're not, which even makes them more dangerous.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  That's correct.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  What's happening is the more and more you think you're in control
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  and the greater the complexity of the system in the United States as we add more and more intelligent services,
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  which have no idea of what they're doing, and it's costing us a fortune
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  when you have 800,000 contractors with top secret circles.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  And I see CIA operatives in the Ritz Carlton Hotel and special forces in ranges
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  who have no idea what this strategy is, no idea of the rules of engagement.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  They're just wandering around acting powerful because they've all been programmed by the TV
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  designed to neutralize the public.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  Instead, it's neutralize them.
