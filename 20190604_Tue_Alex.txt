[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  It's Tuesday, June 4th, 2019.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see that beautiful headline at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Bust the trust.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Congress probes big tech.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Regulatory scrutiny.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  Department of Justice is confirmed.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  When I told you a month ago, when I returned from Washington, D.C.,
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Trump is preparing major antitrust investigations from monopolistic practices
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  and other criminal cartel activity of the big four tech giants.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  I also told you that Trump is seeking criminal prosecution
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  of the Clinton and Obama crime network.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  The gloves are off.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  Now, the House judiciary, as soon as Trump announced he was going after big tech,
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  they launched in the Judiciary Committee with Nadler and the rest of the Nerdy Wells
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  their own investigation that will be a whitewash of this.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  And if they don't give them the censorship they want,
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  Nadler will threaten all this regulatory hell.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  The EU's already done that.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  The Democrats have already done that. That's why this happened.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  In fact, it's in the Associated Press today,
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  as well as Bloomberg, that the EU has, quote,
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  ordered Facebook to control content globally
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  according to the Unelected EU Human Rights Commission,
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  which, by the way, has radical Islamists on it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  Remember when the UN had Saudi Arabia sharing the Human Rights Commission?
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  Same thing. Incredible.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  That's dangerous because we promote freedom, want us banned,
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  but then the real tyrants run it.
[02:24.000 --> 02:32.000]  Facebook is being ordered by the EU, the European Union,
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  to control us here in America.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  Yes, that's what Zuckerberg is saying.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  He's saying it's a threat to free speech.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  Well, once you caved in, my little darling,
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  the levee broke. Dumbo.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  And so America not prohibiting all this censorship
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  allows the European Union and the Chai comms
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  to enter into the vacuum and take control.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  If we won't defend our rights and say,
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  oh, there's no regulations on big tech,
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  then we just give in to the regulations of the Chai comms
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  and the EU and others. See how that works?
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  Think about that.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  They're saying global governance, you're under our control.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  And finally, in memos I wrote to the President and others,
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  and I don't want to toot my horn,
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  it scares the living daylights out of me
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  that we have been prime movers here,
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  on air, the audience lobbying Congress and the White House,
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  and myself and law firms that I paid to follow my own research
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  and my own ideas about this to create the talking points
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  that reflected the reality.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  I didn't just make it up the last three years
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  that by Congress not acting,
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  the President not acting the last two and a half,
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  that we were going under EU control.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  That's what they're doing.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  I watch the debuts meetings.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  I read what's coming out of the EU.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  And no one has covered it until now.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  And today, it's CNN, it's AP, it's Reuters,
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  it's U.S. News and World Report,
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  it's USA Today that we can't let the EU regulate us.
[04:34.000 --> 04:43.000]  Yes, yes, yes, savor that victory, savor this rule.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  We are changing the world together.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  We are completing the next phase of the mission.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  The countdown continues to the stars and beyond.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Humanity is fighting back and coming back from the dead.
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.000]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  in free speech in the Western world's history.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  Not to say the name Alex Jones.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Our M4Wars.com.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  This is racketeering.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  This is cartels.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  We need it now.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  You can take on Big Tech.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  They saw M4Wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war,
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  populist organization.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones,
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  then when people say, okay, take him off the air,
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  The way to fight back is to support M4Wars now more than ever
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[05:58.000 --> 06:27.000]  They'll take everybody else down.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  For which direction humanity would go,
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  at this current fork in the road,
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  was so hyped up, so powerful,
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  that I have been physically sick.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  I have been crazed.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  I have been very, very freaked out
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  because we were so close to not making the right turn
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  that we just made in the last 48 hours.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  And to say that I'm satisfied
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  and that a major weight is off my shoulders
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  is an understatement.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  We just basically won this round.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  We're bleeding, show us the enemy,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  and there's a bunch more rounds to come,
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  but we just stomped the guts out of the globalist hydra.
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  Look at those delicioso headlines.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  Bust the trust.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon,
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Twitter needs to be thrown in there.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  Congress probes big tech regulatory scrutiny
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  and specifically looks at their monopoly actions,
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  the combining, the cartelling.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  The monopolies working together
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  to block out any new companies,
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  any new formation of capital,
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  to buy up thousands of companies
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  that could compete with them in the last decade.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  This isn't just a monopoly.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  This isn't just an oligopoly.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  This is a cartel, these are technical terms,
[08:06.000 --> 08:15.000]  cartel combine establishing world government.
[08:15.000 --> 08:24.000]  Think about that.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  So we're going to be laying it all out today,
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  but I'll tell you the really good news.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  My argument front and center has been
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  stop being distracted with their first amendment claims
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  that they're private companies
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  and they've got private property
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  and so they can censor whoever they want.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  There's the argument, so they're false advertising.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  They're false enforcement.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  The way they defame people when they ban you
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  in PR campaigns.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  There's many ways to skin a jackrabbit,
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  a cat, a deer.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  There's many ways to skin them.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  More ways than you could count on two hands.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  And obviously they're under section 230
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  and big tech can't have liability protection
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  from what's published on it by third parties,
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  but then also be a publisher and control what you say.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  We have laws, they're violating them.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  But I said, let us not debate that with our little friends.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  They always go and talk about that
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  because they think that's their most defensible area
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  and they use our openness against us.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  The way to go at them is that they are monopolies
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  that have bought up thousands of companies
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  and are controlling the market that way
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  to shut down their competition
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  and then colluding with subsidiaries and banks
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  to then block the NRA and Alex Jones
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  and every other conservative I know that's prominent
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  or nationalist or libertarian gets harassed
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  and their bank accounts shut down
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  and can't use Uber and can't use all these other services.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  They're using your name in a database
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  to go in and say, we don't like Laura Loomer.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  So she can't get Uber. She can't get Uber Eats.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  She can't get Airbnb.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  And then now she's being thrown out of all these places
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  because they're using a digital blacklist.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  That's criminal.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  That's them working in concert.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  That's them violating your privacy
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  and sharing that data with other groups
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.000]  to gang up on you in biblical level bully.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  And it's all designed for the global Chinese social score
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  to control human behavior.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  That's what it's been set up to do.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  It's what the Bible 2,000 years ago told us was coming.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  And guess what? It's happening.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  Anyway, you slice it.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  But we don't even go there.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Where you'll get the U.S. Government Act,
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  the areas of it that aren't suicidal,
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  is that China is helping build the architecture of this
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  and that Apple and Google have moved over there
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and are tax exempt and have given the infrastructure codes
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  to everyone's device on record.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  This was in Reuters a year ago. One year ago.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  It was in June that that came out.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  And boy, when I came out and said,
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  look, Apple says all your code keys are in China.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  They've merged with the Chinese government.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  They said, oh, that's just the way it is.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  Tim Cook gave speeches and said, oh, I agree with censorship.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  We should have more of it in America.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  And then the Chinese dictator praised big tech
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  and quote America for stopping fake news like Alex Jones.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  The guy runs a country that, again,
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  has killed 115 million of its own people,
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  has giant slave camps, and he's lecturing us
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  about the dangers of those uppity populist Texans.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  You know those types.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  You can't trust those evil Texans,
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  those evil red-blooded Christians
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  that changed little old ladies' tires
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  and fight tyranny and fight communists.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Oh, no, but big tech knows who's good.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  Dictator of China, good Alex Jones, bad.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  Nambla, UN says good, Donald Trump, bad.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  So how do you skin the globalist cat?
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Well, you point out that big tech has merged
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  with foreign enemies and it's treason, which it is.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  Elephant in the room, Obama allowed it, cover blown,
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  you're done there.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  Oh, but then you go further.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  That's only getting started when you got the rabbit
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  hanging upside down in the legs.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  You don't know what to do with it.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  You're just kind of pulling down and getting the skin down.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Now you got the skin down to the guts.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  You want to go ahead and get those guts out of there
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  so they'd spoil the meat.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  So you get the guts, you got them hanging out,
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  turn the rabbit up like this and cut the guts,
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  the stomach, the intestines drop to the ground.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  This is the part where we do that.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  So we got the rabbit right here and the skin's up to here.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  We've got the guts now.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  And what we do is we take that knife politically
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  and we go.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  The EU and the Chinese are setting regulations for big tech
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  and by extension controlling our regulations
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  when we built the damn internet.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  And so we're taking the internet back under our control.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  Remember, Obama began the handing it over to the tyrants.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  And we're just going to cut the guts out of your whole plan
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  right there because we're not going to let China
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  and the EU and others control the internet
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  and what Americans do.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And now it's all over the news today.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's never been said till now anywhere except here
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  that we're allowing the EU and the Chinese to control regulation
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  and the architecture of the internet.
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  And it hadn't even been an issue,
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  but now it's the big front and center issue everywhere.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  So the guts just hit the ground and all you got to do now,
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  the last part's easy to do with one hand and with a rabbit.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  One hand.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  Just grab it by the ears and by the flesh you peel back.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  And the whole thing comes off.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  You got to skin rabbit.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  Cut it up in pieces, marinate it, throw it on the grill,
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  throw it in a pan and have you some wall rabbit.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  In this case, big tech tyranny.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  So we've already got its guts out on the table right now
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  and we've almost skinned this rabbit.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  Waskily Wabbit is almost skinned if you want to use that analogy.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  And so, yeah, you want to celebrate, folks?
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Good job, listeners.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Amazing job.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  You did it.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Because I can tell you, the dam's broke,
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  the war's on, it's 21st century economic war,
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  the trade war, the war to get the internet back,
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  the war to secure our borders,
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  the war to get our industry back.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  We finally got leadership back in that said,
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  you know, why sell out America?
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  Why do this?
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Now, we haven't won the war yet, but let me tell you,
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  we have turned the tide.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  And if you want to use a World War II analogy,
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  I'd say it'd be the Nazis and there's big stand in Stalingrad.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  And then now they've basically fallen
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  and they're turning back and being pushed back into Germany.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  I mean, if you want to know, I would see what's happening now
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  as America woke up, Europe's waking up,
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  populace are getting elected, the EU's falling apart,
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  socialism's in trouble.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And yeah, they're hitting us with every weapon they've got,
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  they're activating every operative,
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Beto and AOC and all these people,
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  and it's going to get even rougher.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  But let me tell you, they're done.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  Doesn't mean some utopia is coming either.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Doesn't mean things will be perfect,
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  but this current system of world government,
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  remnants of it will be around a long time,
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  but the whole system is in retreat.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  So I salute you all, I thank you all and I say,
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  good job and thank God, thank Jesus Christ.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  Thank you, God.

[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  and we know the new challenges are here.

[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  The Deep State began with World War I.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:30.000 --> 20:40.000]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I want to air another amazing John Ballon report.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  You know, John knocks these things out of the park year after year.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  He's worked here probably eight, nine years.
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.000]  He had family with health problems, and he started working at home about four years ago.
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  He's also taken care of sick family while working another job on top of it.
[20:59.000 --> 21:07.000]  He just did such an incredible report that we're going to air here just in a moment.
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  And it gets into antitrust laws and big tech.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  And there's also another report that Doug tells with that that Greg Reese has put together.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  So we've got two of these reports from both of these gentlemen
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  that I'm going to be getting to at the start of the next segment.
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  And those videos, again, are up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  and need to get spread to the forewinds.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  We've got two reports that both gentlemen have put out that are both equally important
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  and equally powerful and equally historical that need to be seen.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  They're up on newswars.com.
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  And let me just say this, the enemy has spent tens of millions of dollars
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  terminally trying to shut us down in the last two and a half years.
[21:59.000 --> 22:06.000]  And by the grace of God, we have discovered court documents that I'm not at liberty to get to yet
[22:06.000 --> 22:17.000]  dealing with national charity organizations and money that has been raised for children
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  and others that has been siphoned off by the Democratic Party to try to shut us down.
[22:23.000 --> 22:32.000]  And I'm not going to announce it yet, but it's undoubtedly criminal.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  And so that's the thing about fighting evil.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  They think they've got total control and they think they're invincible,
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  but everything they do turns to crap in the end.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  They have the opposite of a minus touch.
[22:47.000 --> 22:55.000]  And as long as you persevere and fight and don't back down, 90% of the time we have victory.
[22:55.000 --> 23:02.000]  Now, sometimes the individual fighting back doesn't win in their lifetime and they get killed or destroyed,
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  but we end up winning 100% of the time long term.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  So for me, a lot of folks ask why I do what I do.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  And it's important to talk about why we do what we do.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I believe in you.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  I believe in myself.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  I believe in God.
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  And I believe that if we have a private corporate world government being shut up, in secret back then, 20 years ago,
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  that people wouldn't want to live under multinational corporations that are tax-exempt and anti-God and anti-family
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  and who have all these horrible plans for us and believe we should have a post-human world
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  and who want to suppress all the technologies and not let us have them.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  And I believe that if we talked about that, I believed that if we laid out who they were,
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  that you would get upset, you would get concerned, you would get informed, and then you would get involved.
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  But I always thought it would be the grassroots that turned it all around, and it has been.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  But the way governments have responded from Eastern Europe to Japan to the UK to here,
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  and the way this broadcast and the articles we write and the videos we put out are picked up by the establishment.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  And so many people in the establishment really weren't evil.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  They just didn't believe the people were with them to try to build a better world.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  They just gave up or were isolated and felt scared.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  And so it's that old allegory you see in novels and movies where you've got the townspeople
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  and the bad guys are coming in to try to steal from them and suppress them and enslave them.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  And one or two people stand up and say, listen, we all got to do the right thing,
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  step across this line if you're going to fight back. It really happened at the Alamo, for real.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  There have been many cases where they say, lie in the sand.
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  And it was a famous case. They've got a plaque at the Alamo from a famous group of samurai's in Japan at a castle
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  where a very small number held off about ten times their number, and they all got killed.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  But in delaying that invading army, it gave time for the rest of the area to mobilize,
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  and then they ended up winning the war.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  I forget the specific historical name of it, but there's a plaque sent from Japan at the Alamo.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  So there's many cases of this. Maybe you guys can search Japanese plaque at the Alamo,
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  and I bet there's an article and photos of it.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  But talking to the crew.
[25:34.000 --> 25:42.000]  So that's what leadership is, is that doing the right thing, knowing you've got to go through the fire
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  so there's real change on the other side for the betterment of everybody.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  There it is. Japanese monument Alamo.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  Once scorned is now embraced. That's the Houston Chronicle.
[25:59.000 --> 26:06.000]  Once scorned. I guess that means that after World War II or something, folks were still mad at the Japanese.
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  Who knows if that's even true? Everything media does is create division.
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  One of the Alamo's oldest markers is a 103-year-old Japanese monument,
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  paying tribute to the fallen Alamo defenders and comparing the 1836 siege and battle
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  with a conflict in Japan in 1575.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  The monument was the object of scorn during World War II. I see I guessed it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  But the marker, single-handedly conceived, produced and delivered by a Japanese scholar
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  to honor the defenders and values of loyalty and self-sacrifice, has often gone unnoticed.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  Alamo has been in custodianship of the daughters of Republic of Texas for nine years
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  and was in its infancy at the Texas Shrine when a world traveler and geography professor,
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  the Japanese man, brought the monument from Japan in 1914.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  Hender wrote the cost of the granite marker, which stands about four feet tall,
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  in the courtyard of the Alamo.
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  The marker bears a poem originally written in S-H-I-G-A in classical Chinese,
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  as was customary for scholars in Japan, comparing the siege and battle of the Alamo
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  with a 16th-century siege of Nagashio Castle, I'll pronounce that right,
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  fought under similar circumstances. Young military leaders make shift fortifications
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  in badly outnumbered forces of hundreds against thousands.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  The poem also alludes to the 8th-century battle in China, in which a small, loyalist force
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  of the Tang dynasty fought bravely, but was also defeated.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  And then it goes through a poem.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  But the point is, is that my memory did serve on that, but it was ten to one.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  But that's what leadership is, and that's how nations are born,
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  and that's how evil is turned back.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  And so I want the listeners to understand something, and the viewers to understand something.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  You are not spectators. You've been in the arena, standing with us against the propaganda,
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  against the lies, financially keeping us afloat, so we can continue to fight on.
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  And I would have done this even if we were failing to get big tech cut down to size.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  I would do this if we were failing to be turning the tide against so many other evils.
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  But you know what? In our lifetimes, we're seeing the tide in some areas turn.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  And we're seeing the enemy use the vomit of their evil, their weapon,
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  intensifying their evil, thinking that it will intimidate us, only waking folks up faster.
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  So the death throes of this parent satanic permutation are very nasty and can look dark.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  But I can tell you, in my spirit and also intellectually, and just looking at things geopolitically,

[33:03.000 --> 33:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.000 --> 33:43.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:43.000 --> 34:06.000]  Okay, I want to finish up with big tech and the latest developments there, the congressional investigations, the fact that, as we told you a month ago, it's not just going to be Google, it's going to be Apple, it's going to be Facebook, it's going to be a lot of these big groups.
[34:06.000 --> 34:18.000]  They're going to look at trying to block nationalists and conservatives from banking. They're going to look at how the NRA's been harassed by MasterCard and Visa.
[34:18.000 --> 34:33.000]  This is going to be really, really serious and this is a big deal because our government now realizes that they've been double-crossed completely by the left and that China and the EU were given control over the internet
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  and that by not acting they're allowing China and the EU to control us.
[34:38.000 --> 34:47.000]  And if our government's got problems, and it certainly does, it's full of some bad people, also full of some good people, they're all territorial.
[34:47.000 --> 34:57.000]  And I don't like the chai comms and the EU actually exercising power over the internet that we built. It's outrageous and now it's all over the news.
[34:57.000 --> 35:10.000]  But that's only part of it. The monopolies and the Republicans who are in the House and Senate seeing how their stuff gets buried, they're engaged in all sorts of manipulation through modern telecommunications.
[35:10.000 --> 35:21.000]  That's all Facebook or Twitter is. The WhatsApp owned by Facebook is saying they're not going to let conservatives and others communicate over it person to person.
[35:21.000 --> 35:28.000]  They've got AI watching what you say and type. That's unbelievable.
[35:28.000 --> 35:36.000]  And again, Facebook bought those apps that hundreds of millions were already using.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And then they tell you, oh, by the way, watch what you say.
[35:40.000 --> 35:52.000]  We're not going to let you send a Taiwanese emoji or say the Chinese president's Winnie the Pooh. That's actually happened with Apple and Instagram and others.
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  And again, Instagram is owned by Facebook. Think about that.
[35:59.000 --> 36:10.000]  You think you're so stupid and so weak that they can tell you, you don't say Alex Jones's name or info wars.com unless it's negative or we'll ban your ass.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  So you watch your mouth Americans. Do you understand?
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  That's like something out of a movie where you're in a cult, but they're doing it.
[36:24.000 --> 36:35.000]  You didn't care when they wouldn't let people share the time on his flag or say the Chinese dictators Winnie the Pooh. That really happened.
[36:35.000 --> 36:47.000]  And until Congress noticed, you couldn't over Apple or over a bunch of other platforms send Winnie the Pooh, period, because they put a block on it under China's orders.
[36:47.000 --> 36:57.000]  They can block Winnie the Pooh in real time. They can block anything, folks. They can block anything.
[36:57.000 --> 37:03.000]  So America is awakening and here's the paradox.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  When you're faced with incredible tyranny, you tend to not be able to admit it to yourself so you don't respond in a way that is equal to or greater to defeat it.
[37:12.000 --> 37:23.000]  You wake up in a tyranny and you can't believe what's happening so you don't take action. It's our job to get people to realize how serious things are so we don't go into a catatonic state.
[37:23.000 --> 37:33.000]  And here's a very powerful report by Greg Reese on big tech. It's posted on news wars.com, antitrust laws and big tech.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  It needs a better headline because it's a very, very powerful report. I hope you'll go to news wars.com.
[37:41.000 --> 37:49.000]  News wars.com and antitrust laws and big tech. This is how we save the First Amendment is the headline.
[37:49.000 --> 38:03.000]  Very important report. It is absolutely imperative that via your email and via your text message and via any way you have to communicate with people outside of big tech that you get that article out.
[38:03.000 --> 38:14.000]  But on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, they don't censor news wars as bad as info wars so you got a shot there of getting it out. Whatever you do, take action now because it's reports like these that wake people up.
[38:14.000 --> 38:25.000]  It's why they want info wars out of the game. Well, guess what? Globalists, you failed. You did everything you could to ignore us over the years and then we got in your face and relaunched populism worldwide.
[38:25.000 --> 38:35.000]  Our audience did. Our supporters did. Drudge did. Others did. And now it's all blowing up in your dirty face and now you think you'll destroy us and punish us for what we did.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  We're proud of what we did and we do it all over again.
[38:41.000 --> 38:54.000]  U.S. antitrust law regulates the business activity of corporations to help maintain healthy competition so that quality and excellence will drive the marketplace.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  This idea is also known as competition law.
[39:00.000 --> 39:14.000]  These laws were born in the industrial revolution when large corporations were setting up trusts wherein several companies would transfer shares to a single body in exchange for a share of consolidated earnings.
[39:14.000 --> 39:29.000]  The trusts created large monopolies that absorbed competing enterprises. The Sherman Act of 1890 passed the Senate by a vote of 51 to 1 and won a unanimous vote in the House.
[39:29.000 --> 39:39.000]  But the Sherman Act was arguably not specific enough and was often used against the workers unions, not the big corporations.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  In 1911, President Taft used the act against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company.
[39:47.000 --> 40:07.000]  And in 1914, the Clayton Act, along with the Federal Trade Commission Act, made antitrust laws more specific, allowing the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to regulate all corporate mergers so that monopolies can not only be dissolved but prevented.
[40:07.000 --> 40:16.000]  Computer technology, most notably the Internet, was perhaps the most innovative technology ever known in recorded human history.
[40:16.000 --> 40:29.000]  People all over the world were able to connect one-on-one and share information. Everyone was on the same level playing field. It was unfiltered and it was real. But this did not last long.
[40:29.000 --> 40:49.000]  The federal government used these antitrust laws against Microsoft. In 1999, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson stated that Microsoft had taken actions to destroy their competition and that Microsoft had violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  The court's remedy was to break Microsoft into two separate entities.
[40:55.000 --> 41:07.000]  SEO, search engine optimization, is how people can find what they are looking for on the Internet. This allowed anyone to get their information to those seeking it.
[41:07.000 --> 41:19.000]  But this changed in 2012 when Google added the Panda algorithm, which elevated the big corporations in the search results and diminished their successful competitors.
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  Today, Google has grown into Alphabet Incorporated, which is the epitome of a monopoly.
[41:26.000 --> 41:36.000]  They have changed the game so much that competing enterprises no longer compete against Google but are now vying for the opportunity to be bought by Google.
[41:36.000 --> 41:49.000]  One of the options being put forth is to deny Alphabet Incorporated the option of buying other companies, forcing them to compete with other innovative technologies rather than absorbing them.
[41:49.000 --> 42:01.000]  The idea behind antitrust law is that monopolies and cartels stifle the competition, which in turn hurts the free flow of innovation.
[42:01.000 --> 42:11.000]  And as a result, all of society suffers. And Google, along with other big tech companies, certainly seem to fit this model.
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.000]  They are not only destroying the competition, but they have become political. They have made themselves the gatekeepers of ideas.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  And they are even helping authoritarian regimes suppress their own people.
[42:23.000 --> 42:30.000]  These monopolies are not only destroying the innovation of products, they are destroying the innovation of ideas.
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  The Internet has been the most disruptive technology to the status quo.
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  And these tech companies are trying to control it for themselves and whomever they serve.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reist.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  Very important report at NewsWars.com. Please get it out.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  We come back. AOC just called for Trump's impeachment.
[42:52.000 --> 42:59.000]  We're going to play this clip and more straight ahead. Please stay with us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:11.000]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.000]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  Then you have the chaga mushroom. Then you have the turmeric. Then you have the bee pollen.
[43:35.000 --> 43:42.000]  Then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.

[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling, Mike.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  It tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like, good.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.000]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  Yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.

[45:59.000 --> 46:05.000]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats.
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[46:18.000 --> 46:25.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest-quality supplements for the 4WarsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high-quality,
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest-quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.

[46:52.000 --> 47:11.000]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[47:22.000 --> 47:34.000]  On an ominous and highway east of Omaha, you can listen to the engine moaning out as one note song.
[47:34.000 --> 47:42.000]  You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before.
[47:42.000 --> 47:52.000]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do.
[47:52.000 --> 48:01.000]  When you're riding 16 hours and there's nothing much to do, and you don't feel much like riding,
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  you just wish the trip was through.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  Alright folks, we're back live here.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  On the road again.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  Here I am up on the stage.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  Here I am.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  I've only scratched the surface in the last 45 minutes,
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  but I'll tell you the fact that Trump's going after big tech
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  when they are just sitting ducks if somebody moves against them,
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  and the fact that the EU and the Chai comms are taking the bait
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  and getting more demanding and saying we control the internet
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  and are now going to get in a fight with Trump over it is perfect.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  They're doing exactly what I hope they do.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  This is, as I have foreseen it, to quote Emperor Palpatine.
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  So, and by the way, my vision of things,
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  it's the opposite of getting on a megalomaniacal power trip.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  I just believe in humanity.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  And I think it's outrageous that we've got big trillion dollar companies
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  that are spying on everybody and working with dictatorships.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  And I'm just a dreamer.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  I think, well, our government isn't pure evil.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  I bet there's some good people in there that don't want to just sell our power out for nothing
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  and sell our kids into slavery and set up something worse than 1984.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  Why are we doing this?
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  And you know what, large swaths of America and the government are like,
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  you know, you're right.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  That really sucks.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  Let's not destroy ourselves for no reason.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  I have stacks of news here and I've wondered why I don't cover a lot of this
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  because, you know, I get ready for hours at home and I get ready for, you know,
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  like an hour or so here and then I study all day long off and on.
[49:59.000 --> 50:11.000]  But I, the left is so evil and so crazed and just so into doing bad that it's painful
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  to even talk about it.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  I get why people don't want to deal with this.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  I just want to run away from it because I want to too.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  But you know what?
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  You can't run away from it.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  In fact, when you run away, it comes looking for you.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  You can't run away anymore, ladies and gentlemen because they're going after the innocence.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  They're going after the children.
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  Here's an example.
[50:33.000 --> 50:43.000]  I've talked a lot about how the left gets into poison and rats and feces and degradation
[50:43.000 --> 50:53.000]  as a form of pervertedness, as a form of degeneracy, a form of self-destructiveness,
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  a form of evil, the intergalactic wavelength, the interdimensional wavelength that Lucifer's
[51:00.000 --> 51:08.000]  transmitting to Earth saying, destroy yourselves, kill yourselves.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Typhoid, bubonic plague, leprosy, drug-resistant TB.
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  No one's being tested.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  It's in public schools.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  It's spreading into children everywhere.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  I get health department reports from Texas, from California to Mexico.
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  We cover them where you'll see the number of leprosy cases, the number of typhoid cases.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  None of it ever hits the news.
[51:27.000 --> 51:32.000]  But as I told you, San Francisco and places like that celebrate it.
[51:32.000 --> 51:41.000]  Coming up next hour, San Francisco's launching restaurants where you dine with rats that
[51:41.000 --> 51:48.000]  eat with you at your table so you can enjoy the ambiance of the rats and celebrate the
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  city infestation.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  Oh, but don't worry.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  These are rescue rats.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  San Francisco dungeon launching rat bar.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Why would you want to be in a dungeon?
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  We'll see.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  You're evil.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  I'd rather be on a deck with a sunset or, you know, with incredible plants and art and
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  music.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  But oh, no, let's eat in a dark, dirty dungeon with rats that eat with us at the table so
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  that we learn how to lower ourselves to their level because a certain entity likes that
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  because you're made in the image of God.
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  And well, this force doesn't like that.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  It's called jealousy.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  You know, there are a lot of good looking women who get in clicks in college or high
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  school or business and then they're cool and they're nice.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  But you ever seen a really good looking girl that transfers to your high school and everybody's
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  being real mean to her because she's so pretty and she wonders why folks are mean.
[52:41.000 --> 52:47.000]  You know, I wasn't a rocket scientist, but I knew, well, I'm going to be nice to her
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  and believe me, I was.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  So I just don't get the psychology.
[52:51.000 --> 52:57.000]  But you learn early on, wow, people are messing with me.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  Not today, but back then I looked like a Calvin Klein model.
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  People are pissed at me because I'm so good looking and I'm so smart and I'm so strong.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  And it's the same thing with those good looking women.
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  I knew, wait, she's getting messed with because she's super sexy.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  Everybody's afraid of her.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  They're freaked out by her.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  And so instead they're going to be mean to her because that's the only way they feel like
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  they have power.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  Well, I'm not going to be mean to her.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  No, I'm going to be real sweet to her.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  Oh, guys, don't pull up pictures of me.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  But the point, yeah, that's in high school.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  The media is like, that's Jones when he's 20 something.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  No, that's me at 18.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  But the kind of goofy photos.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  I mean, somebody had those and put them on the internet years ago.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  What do you mean?
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.000]  But going back here, you learn about human psychology and you learn how these globalists
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  operate and it's insane.
[53:42.000 --> 53:49.000]  And then you see AOC who says cauliflower is racist even though it comes from Africa and
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  the Middle East.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  And you've got AOC who's got this multi-million dollar apartment with a pool on the roof.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  And then she's like, oh, I don't apologize for my million dollar apartment because everyone
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  deserves one.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  Well, yeah, but only capitalism could bring you something like that.
[54:08.000 --> 54:13.000]  So she's always running the country down that her parents fought to get into.
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  And then she's going around creating division everywhere she can so she can control people
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  quote racially.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  She's a joke.
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.000]  Well, here she is just minutes ago talking about impeachment of President Trump because
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  we have a rule of law.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Here it is.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.720]  The tide is turning with the public and seeing exactly what is going on with the president
[54:33.720 --> 54:36.760]  advising witnesses to ignore legally binding subpoenas.
[54:36.760 --> 54:42.760]  At this point, it is getting to become so overwhelming that we need to uphold the rule
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.000]  of law and the Constitution of the United States.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  All right.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.720]  And then she goes on to the need for impeachment.
[54:51.720 --> 54:55.080]  So we need to uphold the rule of law.
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.560]  And you illegally spied on Trump, the Democrats, all this.
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.360]  And she's saying, you know, it's overwhelming the tide's turning.
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.200]  No Trump's approval ratings weigh up even in fake polls.
[55:07.200 --> 55:10.360]  I'm going to stop right there.
[55:10.360 --> 55:14.840]  I told you yesterday less than 24 hours for the new before the new sale gets announced
[55:14.840 --> 55:17.640]  and the old sale is gone.
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.800]  I developed the new sale yesterday with Tim, who had a great idea.
[55:21.800 --> 55:22.800]  Wait till you hear about the new sale.
[55:22.800 --> 55:29.520]  I think it has a great name, a great product list for products.
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.000]  And it's going to be the new sale that goes up, I guess the next few hours or so.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.680]  But the last sale is a big sale as well.
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.280]  And it's got great products that you and your family need and it supports this transmission.
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.520]  So it's the last 12 hours of Memorial Week mega sale.
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.360]  And then the new sale will be up.
[55:50.360 --> 55:52.480]  And we haven't come up with the exact name for it.
[55:52.480 --> 55:53.680]  I mean, I mean, I developed a few names.
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.200]  I'm not even sure which one they pick, but we have like five minute marketing meetings
[55:57.200 --> 55:59.000]  once a week.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.520]  And Tim said, why don't we call it, you know, the total force sale, everything with force
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.080]  in its name, whether it's Space Force T-shirt that's already a best seller or whether it
[56:10.080 --> 56:17.000]  is Turbo Force or whether it's Rain Force or whether we've got four products with force
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  in the name.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.360]  So that'll be the new sale and it's a big sale.
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.400]  It's the total super force special sale.
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.400]  That's the name that they were just telling me.
[56:27.400 --> 56:29.760]  That is the new sale that will be up in the next few hours.
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.640]  Already the Space Force shirt is 33% off and I want to explain something.
[56:33.640 --> 56:41.040]  This is expensive, soft fabric, designer fabric, everything, just the shirt itself before the
[56:41.040 --> 56:45.880]  printing of the color American flag, red, white and blue and this great baby and all
[56:45.880 --> 56:49.600]  of it with a space shuttle on it cost me $9.
[56:49.600 --> 56:53.840]  Just the shirt cost $9, then we've got a print on the shirt.
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.440]  So a designer shirt like this at the malls, usually $50 at another place, $30, we're selling
[56:59.440 --> 57:08.520]  it for $20 right now, even though it's already a best seller as part of the Space Force America's
[57:08.520 --> 57:12.840]  back designer shirt, now available for pre-order.
[57:12.840 --> 57:18.920]  The shirts arrive tomorrow, made in America, printed in America and if you want it, I knew
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.960]  it be a hit just at gut level because I wore a similar shirt with a NASA patch, we redesigned
[57:23.960 --> 57:27.800]  it and people just went crazy over the shirt, they go crazy all over, I don't know what
[57:27.800 --> 57:28.800]  the deal is.
[57:28.800 --> 57:31.080]  It wasn't just I was on Joe Rogan, I wore the shirt anywhere, they love it.
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.880]  Well we took it, redesigned it, made it better with a red, white and blue American flag and
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.760]  with the Space Force emblem on the front, got a pro human future and it's going crazy.
[57:41.760 --> 57:47.160]  So get that as well but the big Memorial Day special has to end, be sure and check out
[57:47.160 --> 57:58.720]  those specials.
[57:58.720 --> 58:05.160]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[58:05.160 --> 58:11.440]  energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.720]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[58:15.720 --> 58:17.800]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.400]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[58:24.400 --> 58:27.240]  and beyond system in the world.
[58:27.240 --> 58:31.960]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it, it is a total game changer and it comes
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.880]  in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.560]  Warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours so take a half pack at the
[58:40.560 --> 58:44.360]  first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take
[58:44.360 --> 58:46.360]  you into overdrive.
[58:46.360 --> 58:48.120]  Turbo Force and EnforceLive.com
[58:48.120 --> 58:57.680]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[58:57.680 --> 59:02.800]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[59:02.800 --> 59:07.800]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've
[59:07.800 --> 59:12.400]  sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake up America of
[59:12.400 --> 59:14.400]  Patriot Blend coffee.
[59:14.400 --> 59:17.880]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate
[59:17.880 --> 59:19.920]  the world's finest coffee bean.
[59:19.920 --> 59:25.080]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot
[59:25.080 --> 59:30.560]  Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need
[59:30.560 --> 59:31.560]  in the morning.

[59:36.200 --> 59:39.600]  a powerful blend to support your immune response and stamina.
[59:39.600 --> 59:44.120]  It's time to take care of your morning routine, get a bag of Patriot Blend coffee to support
[59:44.120 --> 59:53.080]  the show while enhancing your morning routine at InfowarsStore.com.
[59:53.080 --> 01:00:11.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:17.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:25.040]  Okay, I've already spent most of the first hour on the fact that big tech bet off more
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040]  than it can chew.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:31.680]  It sold out to the chai comms and now elements of our government that are half sane are moving
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.320]  against this clear and present historically unprecedented danger.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  Do you agree with me?
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.120]  Do you disagree with me how big this is?
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.560]  And you have to know we have to keep the heat on now on the president, on Congress, on big
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.400]  tech with all this, because Democrats are going to announce all these fake hearings
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.040]  that are going to divert off of that.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.400]  There's so much more we're going to get to.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.400]  We've got new developments in Russiagate.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.440]  We've got filth dungeons in San Francisco where people pay to eat with rats that actually
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.040]  eat with them at the table.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]  That's Fox News.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.160]  I'm not joking that that report's coming up.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:13.160]  We've got a huge pedophilia coming out of the closet.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.880]  Me-day invasion is what I'd call it, or Operation Barbarossa, you know, the Germans, the Nazis
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880]  attacking Russia.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.760]  I mean, it's a big invasion.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:29.560]  It's all over the news every day with major tech companies promoting love knows no age,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.400]  which is an ambulance slogan.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.240]  And so get ready to have a potbellied goblin at your door wanting to date your five-year-old
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]  son or daughter.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.880]  And I'm going to hit that at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.960]  It's something that is very, very, very, very important.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.240]  Also John Bounds and a really important report that is that brief history of Alex Jones to
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.040]  learn what the globalists are afraid of.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.920]  It's like a brief history of kryptonite or wooden stakes or holy waters or things like
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.120]  that to them.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.080]  It's important to analyze what they particularly fear and why we're going to be getting to
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080]  that.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.000]  You know, Beko O'Rourke has come out, we're going to play with him, and said that we don't
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.280]  have enough migrants.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.600]  We need more tent cities, more rats, more collapsing, everything, more of the poorest
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:21.440]  people from Europe and Latin America brought in and Africa to further weigh things down.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.640]  He's also said that abortion is something that we really need to defend, especially
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]  partial birth abortion.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:38.320]  So I'm going to go to this clip, Beko says that abortion, again, is just a wonderful
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.280]  sweetsie pie situation, so we'll play that report and then we will come back from break.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:52.520]  But the real headline from theamericanmirror.com is, Beto plays two tins in tiny Tulsa room.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520]  He's pathetic.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:08.960]  The attack on a woman's right to choose its connection to a maternal mortality crisis.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.480]  We have this country, particularly bad in some states, maybe also no one on the circle
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:20.000]  in Texas, who likes this bad for a woman of color, but it's not just safe, legal access
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  to an abortion.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.040]  It's also to the circle of cancer screening that a Planned Parenthood clinic will provide
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.560]  for a family planning help, or in a state like mine, refused to expand Medicaid.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:35.400]  Just being able to see it go wider at all, that's connected to life or death decisions
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.800]  that are increasing the mortality rate and diminishing the age to which women live, at
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.680]  least in my own state, I think by extension, throughout much of the country.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.240]  In 2019, a woman on average is paid $0.80 when a man is paid for the same work, the same
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]  hours, the same value.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:01.120]  A woman of color is paid $0.61, a Latino woman $0.53 for what a man is paid, and this is
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120]  in 2019.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:09.000]  You still do not have robust protections for women in workplace, or in colleges, or in
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.360]  high schools, against abuse, or against violence.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.800]  You have a secretary of education, again, who's diminishing those standards and the funding
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:25.120]  necessary to pursue justice when somebody has been attacked or violated.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.360]  There are many responses to this, from ensuring that any nominee that be made to the Supreme
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:36.920]  Court believes that 1973 decision overs is a settled model, complimenting that by statute,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.360]  by working with Congress to ensure that no state can diminish that standard.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.360]  Having a Department of Justice that will side with women every single time this comes up
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:52.200]  in our federal courts, and then doing this, making sure that in our administration, we
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:58.520]  do the campaign work necessary to ensure that we ratify and put rights in them.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.920]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.720]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.640]  kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.120]  Another role is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.800]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.640]  anchovy fish oil, ultrapurified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.000]  boost your child's mind and body.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.560]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive,
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.320]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.080]  brain growth spurts.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:43.400]  Based on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.760]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.160]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:06:21.120]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:27.880]  Dancing Queens, that's the name of the show that's now been renewed in second season on
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]  Netflix.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:36.240]  It's all about your sons being taken at age four or five and put in a girl's outfit
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:43.080]  and told their girl and having gay men teach them how to shake their ass.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:48.360]  Little girls are involved as well.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:55.600]  So we also have the left from Gloria Steinem to Miley Cyrus celebrating abortion and fetishizing
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:02.160]  and how sexy it is and how good it feels and weird vice videos with women having orgasms
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.960]  while they have the deadly procedures, the dangerous procedures.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.880]  Miley Cyrus celebrates abortion in bizarre new promo, abortion is healthcare, and then
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:21.200]  it's her licking a pink pink cake in simulated oral sex with a woman.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.720]  That's right.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:30.320]  They are indoctrinating systematically our kids, drag queen story hour, proceeds despite
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.240]  parent protest and now in California they're saying if you don't want to take your kids
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:42.360]  to school during this, you will be fined or arrested, you must go to the sensitivity training.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:48.680]  You must teach your five-year-old to sit on a 300-pound man with a big beard's lap in
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:54.640]  some cases who are convicted pedophiles.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.640]  You couldn't make it up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.120]  And what does Fox News and NBC News and all of them, they joke down in Houston, they go,
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.120]  you ought to get them while they're young.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.000]  So what is the latest up on newswars.com?
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.320]  Outrage after Snapchat debuts Love Has No Age filter for Pride Month.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320]  That's right.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.040]  You go to Snapchat and they put a filter over your video that Love Has No Age.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:33.320]  That is an actual nambla saying, and I first learned about nambla like 30 years ago.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.400]  Howard Stern would have them on making jokes about actual nambla members and people that
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.840]  had published books about sex with children and it was disgusting.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.880]  Then I learned that UN had accepted them as a group, civil rights group, and it was in
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.760]  my first film, America Destroyed by Design, I made in 1997.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:56.840]  So I knew about it by then, but Love Has No Age, North American Man-Boy Love Association.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:08.160]  So the slogan of the pedophile organization is now a Snapchat filter for your children.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.640]  And of course, it's a nice place for the pedophiles to get in touch with them, I guess.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  That's up on newswars.com.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.480]  You might want to get that out to parents, you know, and churches out there.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:25.680]  Outrage after Snapchat debuts Love Has No Age filter for Pride Month and women on Instagram
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.320]  and on Facebook and on Snapchat have been saying, this sounds dangerous and they're
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.760]  being ridiculed, they're haters, you see.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.640]  Let's continue.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.880]  Netflix promotes pedophilia with Drag Queen indoctrination series, John Bowne did a report
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880]  on this.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:52.880]  It's up on infowars.com and newswars.com, I hope you get his report, we'll just air that
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.080]  report next segment, but let's go through some more of these.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.480]  UK pays for transgender men to get pregnant.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.880]  So see, it's all about what type of mental illness will we put up with.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:12.840]  Women take male hormones, then they get pregnant and then the government pays for them.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.560]  So we'll pay to have your testicles cut off.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.440]  We'll pay to have, but if women want to say they're men, but then they get pregnant, well,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.000]  we'll just say that's a man having a baby.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.920]  That's right and I'm a bird, I can fly in the sky or I'm a penguin or I'm a giraffe
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:35.360]  or maybe I'm a dolphin, but you're not a dolphin.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.880]  This is the total assault and they go into our children and they brainwash them and they
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.000]  teach them this.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.720]  UK government declares that men can get pregnant too, not just women.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.680]  Call expectant mothers pregnant people, the government suggests.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.160]  That's right, take the power of women away and just say pregnant people.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.560]  Take your identity away.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:04.400]  Men and women, you can't say men and women, which is the Orwellian brave new world, Huxley
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.400]  attack.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.880]  Trans dad tells doctors, you can be a man and have a baby.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880]  That's right.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.240]  You can jump up a 50 story building and fly without a parachute.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.000]  Of course you won't, you'll hit the bottom and die, but this is all part of just the
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.800]  sick insanity of weirdo freaks who the university assistants promote and then they get access
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.680]  to your kids and then if you criticize it, you get banned everywhere by the big crazy
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.440]  tech giants because at Google, it's so insane with the drugs and the money and the jet copters
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.600]  of the power with even mid-level people making 50 million a year, literally that's like low
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.600]  level.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.600]  Minions get 400,000 a year, managers 20 million a year, kind of higher level managers 50 million
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:54.000]  a year, 100 million a year, just high level guys billions a year, hundreds of billions
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.800]  of top people a year and they go to these amplitheaters and out comes the vice president
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:08.520]  in a golden dress and he goes, I am a dragon female and they go, you are a dragon female.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.840]  This is, there's transcripts of this, he goes, I am a beautiful building.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.000]  You are a beautiful building.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.640]  There are no pregnant women, there are no pregnant women.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.760]  This is the cult takeover and it's like, oh liberal, happy, give us your children, have
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:35.440]  fun, be inclusive, but it's not inclusive, it's conquering society, it's taking over,
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.160]  it's scrambling everything and telling people, you don't need to have a future or be somebody
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.240]  or write a book or be a farmer or do something.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.360]  You can just say you are a thing and everyone will worship you because you are this new
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:56.040]  beautiful thing, but notice, they then tell us, mainstream British government says we
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.160]  need to stop saying women exist, stop saying mother and father on exams.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.440]  Some folks don't have mothers and fathers, it hurts people to say mother and father.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.080]  Just say Jesus Christ and don't say mother or father, everything else exists but that
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:16.320]  because the body snatcher, the counterfeiter always removes the real thing.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:28.920]  So official NAMBLA promotions are being pushed on mainline tech forums and mainline video
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:38.120]  filters for children, introducing them to NAMBLA, introducing them to all this and promoted
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:45.000]  Netflix shows like the one we're about to play a trailer for show stadiums full of people
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.280]  praising and worshiping little children, dressing up little boys dressing like girls,
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.080]  girls dressing like boys, shaking their asses and worshiping this.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:03.480]  During the day I'm a business owner, I'm a teacher and a mentor and by night I am the
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:10.280]  Grand Amdiva of the south, Melissa Edwards.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.440]  My plan is to conquer this country one competition at a time.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.960]  Competitive dance, it's all about winning, second place is for losers, we want first
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960]  place.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:28.160]  The kids stand out at competitions, they're products of me, now you can't come to Beyond
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160]  Belief and have a flamboyance.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:35.000]  Okay I can't watch any of this anymore, so if you thought that the child pageants were
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.640]  creepy and had an element of pedophiles on them and dead kids, you were right, this is
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:44.720]  beyond that but don't forget, the very people involved in this show go to Louisiana city
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.400]  councils and they say we're grooming your kids, your kids are ours, get out of the way,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.760]  stand down and the media praises them.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.400]  They're coming, we're meeting with your kids, whether you like it or not, they're ours,
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.600]  the kids you understand that, here it is.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.880]  Hi, my name's Ellen Pontiff, I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.160]  for drag queens story time, so apparently to a lot of people in this room I'm the big
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:16.160]  bookie man, I am just as talented as a singer or a dancer or anyone that has a special talent,
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.960]  it's just mine is dressing up as a woman, entertaining a crowd.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.960]  The eyes that people give you whenever they think that you are the one that's in support
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.240]  of this event is truly disgusting, but I'm here to let you know that this event is something
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.600]  that's going to be very beautiful and for the children and the people that support it
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.680]  are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation, we
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.960]  are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did and just
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.240]  because I said that you heard the little plur people behind me, it's disgusting.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.960]  It's a year disgusting, he goes on to say that he works in a gay strip bar and it's basically
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.800]  a sex worker, but he goes that night time with your children will happen, I'm going
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.960]  to be with your children, they're going to sit on my lap.

[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.160]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.720]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.680]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.040]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.280]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.200]  literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.360]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.080]  gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.200]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.840]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.480]  nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.400]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:39.120]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.120]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:50.600]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.720]  discovery.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:02.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:17.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.960]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, I'm here on air, been in this time
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:31.800]  slot for 22 years, been on air 25, by the grace of God and thanks to your support, remember
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:37.280]  when I thank you, I mean it from the bottom of my heart, it's like when you look at the
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:42.120]  blue sky, you thank God for the sky existing, or you bring a cold glass of water, if you've
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.480]  been for a job, you just thank God for it.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.680]  You literally are the reason we exist and we're here, so when I thank you, you better
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.600]  understand I mean it a trillion percent.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:58.120]  I appreciate you and it's important you know how important you are to this fight.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:06.240]  We're the most awake, focused, involved patriots on the planet and you have changed the world,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:11.560]  this broadcast has changed the world, so everybody from this crew, to our stations, to Matt Drudge,
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:18.360]  to my family, to everybody, I just want to say thank you all because things are rough,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:23.400]  things are dangerous, things are dark, things are bad, but we're turning the corner and
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.840]  fundamental things like free speech and control of our telecommunications, we're about to
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:34.360]  fight back to get and we're turning the corner in so many ways.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.800]  I want to open the phones up into the next hour, Joe Biggs, a former InfoWars broadcaster
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:45.400]  and an informed fellow will be joining us in the third hour around Shotgun, whether it's
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.480]  to discover the waterfront, but I want to open the phones up specifically on one topic
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:22:01.680]  because I really value your ideas, your information and that is this simple question.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.600]  What do you think of Trump getting ready to do antitrust against Big Tech?
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.560]  What do you think of the EU coming in and saying they control the internet and control
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560]  our speech?
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560]  That was announced today.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.000]  What do you make of how we make sure this gets followed through on and how the left's
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  going to strike back?
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:31.560]  I want your take on this, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, first time callers is the first round, first
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.640]  time callers, I want your take on how good this is or how bad this is or how exciting
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.880]  you think this is and how you think the globalists are going to strike back.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.480]  That's the questions that I've got for you and I want to hear from you on that because
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:52.480]  this is so incredibly big if we don't have communications, we don't have anything.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.040]  We're going to go to this report, not because it's about me, but because I didn't tell
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.720]  bound to do this report, but because it's understanding why the enemy hates us, why
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:06.840]  the enemy fears us and what it is we've been doing that's been defeating them.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.120]  This is key research and it's important and we'll come back and take your phone calls
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.120]  and so much more.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.120]  Here it is.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:19.360]  Two months before September 11th, George Bush signed an ordering all FBI and defense and
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.360]  tell officers they would be arrested under national security violation if they stopped
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.400]  the al-Qaeda terror rings in Chicago, Florida, New York, and New Jersey.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:33.920]  The deputy head of the FBI, let me give you the facts and you go check it out for yourself.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.000]  See the forbidden news at infowars.com.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.760]  We need your support more than ever, so go to infowarsstore.com.

[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.880]  fight for freedom.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.000]  The globalists had a strategy to put out in the last 50, 60 years of TV and movies, 70
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  years, just disinfo and pablum and dumb down garbage.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.480]  But along came the internet and the globalists were so arrogant that thousands of different
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.480]  individuals started shows on the internet.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.920]  But I was able to get on talk radio on hundreds of stations.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:18.120]  We didn't play all of the cut from the Lear News Hour, but it says, yes, black helicopters
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.160]  are being used for surveillance of the public by sheriff's departments and police departments
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160]  around the country.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.160]  Wait a minute, what's your name, Collar?
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160]  It's Tracy.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:33.160]  Do you want to hurt the squirrels and the golden-cheeked warglers and the deer and the salamanders?
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:39.800]  Give it to Frank Cooksy, give it to this group here in Austin, they care, man.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.800]  What's your problem?
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.680]  They're doing a great job in the third world at slaving the people.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.200]  The UN gives China awards for its human rights for women, how they tie little girls down
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.800]  to starved judges, they're not good workers.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.400]  And I've shown it here, they're trying to help.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400]  What's wrong with you?
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:00.680]  And I'm going to put the call out that you call the White House and tell them, look,
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.440]  we've seen the news stories that you've wanted to blow things up, that you have blown things
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.320]  up and that you're saying that four million of us are going to die and we need martial
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:16.520]  law and the Associated Press and one of your little drills you had and that we're aware
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.720]  of who the terrorists are if you pull this.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.440]  This can stop this hitlerian Reichstag event.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.520]  Look, I can't deal with it anymore.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.560]  I watch CNN sometimes, CNN headline news, and I'm not exaggerating with people.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.800]  I'm not exaggerating with you out there.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:37.760]  Literally, in a 30-minute newscast, CNN headline news revolves every 30 minutes with new news
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.680]  news, sometimes, 80% of the stories, 20-something minutes, of it will be children.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.880]  Children, children, children, children.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.920]  But it's not what you're going to do for the children.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.240]  It's not what I'm going to do for the children, it's not what the local communities are going
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.740]  to do for the children, it's not what the churches are going to do for the children,
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.840]  it's not what the universities are going to do for the children, it's not what the
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.400]  schools are going to do for the children.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.000]  It's what the federal establishment is going to do for the children.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.600]  Two months before September 11th George Bush signed it ordering all FBI defense and tell officers
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:17.000]  It would be arrested under national security violation if they stopped the Alcatra rings in Chicago, Florida, New York and New Jersey
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  The deputy head of the FBI
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:25.840]  Let me give you the facts and you go check it out for yourself. By the way, deputy FBI director John O'Neill quit
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:32.080]  Release the document and was dead on September 11th. Okay, and the documents out there
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.480]  David Shippers on General Park and all these people it was just died on September 11
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.200]  Yeah, he died on the 24th floor that of the World Trade Center
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.680]  He had just been hired. He was on the trade
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.080]  He had just been hired by the owners of the Trade Center right after quitting. He thought it was a great deal
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.480]  He didn't see the full scope the Rockefeller family along with the Port Authority own those towers and it just transferred it two weeks before the attack
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.880]  But he'd already been hired his first day on the job. He was taken out. He's the guy that blew the whistle preemptively
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.560]  It's in the New Yorker magazine. Just one of the 500 publications
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.720]  We're now here in Southern, California at little town called Victorville
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.080]  Where George Air Force Base is located the Chinese have been attempting
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.640]  To acquire the Air Force Base and we're told may still acquire it
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:23.240]  But that's not gonna stop them bringing in their slave goods from their over 30 million political dissidents in slave labor camps right here
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:30.840]  This is the first we're told by the workers of 20 such wholesale markets where slave goods will be brought into the US and sold at
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.200]  Discount prices to retailers. So here you have it. No more middleman for the Chinese military industrial
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:45.680]  Complex to sell slave goods. They're actually buying up the land and this again is the first of 20 such facilities to be built
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.160]  Then after they circled the wagons put out project Megiddo
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.160]  34 page report demonizing Christians
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.360]  Demonizing homeschoolers demonizing jury rights
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:06.580]  Organizations demonizing Second Amendment and pro-constitutional groups got a circle the wagons against those that would respond to what's happening now
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:14.800]  They predominantly fail in phase one then they have the execution of McVay earlier this year to hype up the demonization of patriots
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.800]  Once again, those that would resist this Reichstag problem reaction solution takeover
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.280]  and I was able to infect these Brian Stelter and
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.440]  The Clinton Foundation and others own words. I was able to infect
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.200]  Sean Hannity Rush Limbaugh
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.460]  Tucker Carlson Laura Ingram you put into them now. They sound just like me. They're not copying what I said
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.840]  They're now actually took the blinders off. They see exactly what I see
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:55.800]  Interesting little smattering surpassed events. All right, you're take on Trump taking the gloves off going after big tech and their monopoly straight ahead. Stay with us
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.920]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the Empire of the world
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:13.440]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken its former colony
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:18.400]  The US had to save the Empire was there ever a vote who do we fight for it?

[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.120]  I
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.600]  Mean info wars calm and news wars calm
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.000]  There you go. You knew this
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.440]  Syndrome is coming forever. We have our own video streams our own audio streams, and it's all free to air anybody can use it
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.680]  We upload it do whatever you want people go to info wars calm and news wars calm
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:58.520]  That's where they find it. You know, there's what things go websites. Please go there
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:23.600]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  Please remember folks
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.120]  But I don't cover negative news because I'm trying to demoralize you or be negative
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.760]  Good people though. We're in denial about how bad stuff's gotten
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.680]  And that's my frustration is that I get used to globalist propaganda
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.960]  And once I've seen one piece of it, I've seen a hundred pieces of it
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.440]  So gives me a headache in that I saw this video that we're gonna play at the start of the next hour
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:07.720]  We're gonna post it up on info wars calm and it reminded me of a whole bunch of other things that Gloria Steinem did that left us did
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.360]  That Miley Cyrus
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.440]  Just did coming out and praising abortion and sexualizing it like it's sexy and fun
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.920]  And so for the last 45 minutes since I saw these new articles and videos
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.120]  I've had the crew trying to find which they haven't been able to do
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.600]  And I get it. There's just so much because I can't remember the exact headline. It's my fault
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.200]  I want to say it was a vice piece pretty sure it was
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.280]  It was about two years ago
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:41.880]  And it turned out she was an actress, but she really did it and it's something like vice airs peace with woman saying abortion
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.920]  Feels good and the and then it empowered her and she's doing a fake orgasm
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:56.120]  While they're killing her baby going. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's so sick, man
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.720]  That's what I'm saying. There's no
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.160]  Into these people and so I
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.360]  Got invited to Sundance one of the biggest film festivals in the world
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.960]  This year and I didn't go you couldn't pay me to go be part of being around Hollywood
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.800]  but I did send a representative and
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:24.720]  He was there at the highest levels of it and he said he came back depressed and he said, oh my lord
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.360]  He said this is good and evil period and this guy didn't even believe in Jesus five years ago
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:36.120]  I mean people are either getting the devil or they're getting Jesus. He was like he said Alex I
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.440]  Was in all these meetings and I was with winners
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.640]  I was with all and then they were like we've got to destroy people our job is to do to demoralize and
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.400]  To do the most horrible sickening stuff. We can that's our orders. That's what gets paid for and
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.240]  We want outrage so everyone covers the shockiness of what we're doing so that we get covered
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.480]  Well, that's the cover story. No, they want the shocking evil to
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:12.840]  Sear the conscience to blacken the heart to harden the heart so we can accept the great evil coming. I'm gonna go to your calls. It's just that
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.360]  Disturbing PBS documentary shows woman killing her unborn twins like it's nothing at all
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.160]  Like she's going to have her toenails trimmed or something get a
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.280]  It's a pedicure of the hands no manicures hands a pedicure
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.440]  So she's going like she's getting a wart taken off her ass and
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.880]  Is this woman thinking anybody's gonna care about her when she's old?
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.400]  No, it's this heartless
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.480]  showless thing and now
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:51.920]  Everybody wants to be on TV. Everybody wants to be famous. There's thousands of new Netflix shows almost everyone
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.920]  I know is acting or whatever
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.760]  It's all completely empty like people think they exist once they get on the silver screen
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:08.120]  Or once they get on TV. No, it's the most unhappy empty group of people ever. I'm not on radio and TV to be famous
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.280]  I'm here to fight these people
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.080]  But that's why they always say oh, Jones is fake
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.720]  Jones is an actor Jones doesn't mean what he's saying
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.560]  No, we just got Trump elected. We're just bringing down the EU. We're just risking our lives to do this
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.320]  I go out and have leftist attack me inside Beto crowds, you know, because I'm fake
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.080]  You're fake the globalists are fake their minions are fake not me
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:39.240]  And they know our audience is real and a red-blooded humans that love God
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.680]  You could be brown. You could be black. You could be pink. I don't know you
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.160]  I guess there are some white people some white people are white
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:54.880]  The point is is that? Whether you love God or you don't love God. That's the difference and we should just be glad
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.960]  We've made the decision to be with God doesn't matter how much money you have doesn't matter whether
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.680]  Establishment a lead us look down on you or whatever and all they're bling
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.600]  What matters is your heart and being close to God
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:15.480]  And you see them sexualizing children and we've got to find that I think Paul Watson did an article about it two years ago
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.920]  But this woman is on the abortion table acting like she's having an orgasm
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.440]  Killing her baby and she talks about how wonderful it wasn't on red
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.920]  It was hoping the system would then cast her in bigger roles if she did something evil like that
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:37.080]  But that's what the Satanists do they say sacrifice a baby with us to prove you're in the club to prove her in the cult
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:44.480]  You've all heard about black gangs white supremacist gangs Hispanic gangs and and the really serious gangs are like you got to murder people
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  For this organization
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  Before you even become a member
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  Yeah, but you guys found it
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  Can we stop pretending like abortions don't feel good? God? I said two years ago. That was four years ago
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:08.240]  Or maybe that's another one because like I said the propaganda is just repeated over and over again
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.480]  She's she's on the table. They're killing her baby
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.680]  And who knows if it's even real these people are so criminal
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760]  I mean what planet is this
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:28.000]  You're like, you know, it's pretty obscene you're acting like this. I'm just repeating what they're doing
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:35.040]  Now there it is I come really hard when I get an abortion and it's not just because I'm killing a baby
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.360]  There's actually nerve centers in the back of the uterus
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.320]  That can be stimulated through regular intercourse
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.520]  Wow, they're fetishizing killing babies
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.320]  The only way to achieve that kind of orgasm is to visit a clinic and
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320]  And have my vagina
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.120]  Speculated and scooped out like the bottom of a bin and Jerry's pint on
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.960]  Me night
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:10.360]  That's so satanic man. It's me time. I'm gonna scoop that baby out. See you guys think I'm joking about this
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:15.120]  I've been around it. Look here. Yeah. Oh, you found it. You found it. Okay. Let's go. So let's go back
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:21.080]  Holy Toledo fact print it all just print it all get to understand folks. I
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  Didn't get around
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.840]  Satanists that are in trailer parks killing their dog when they're taking LSD so they can see demons
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.640]  Which by the way do pop up when you kill your dog. They demand really bad stuff
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.520]  I I fell into real Satanist. Okay, you know with helicopters and mansions
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.600]  For not very long. I was never part of it. They just wanted me in it
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.800]  That's why I tell you that I've told you Anderson Cooper behind the scenes in his own house walks around his house
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.640]  And now you've seen do it on TV you have to experience devil worshipers and you know them
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.560]  But but but let's just go back to this lady
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.840]  Because they've got shows saluting abortion saying how good it feels how wonderful it is. It's everywhere. So let's go back
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.040]  Can we stop?
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:22.800]  Pretending most of this is one vice abortions don't feel good. So let's go back and read her talk about scooping her baby out and
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.200]  Having an orgasm
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.560]  To see I remember something like that and I say it and I go, you know what?
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.120]  Let's actually show you because I don't want you thinking that came out of my brain. I
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:40.760]  Come really hard when I get an abortion. It's not just because I'm killing a baby
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.520]  The only way to achieve that kind of orgasm is to visit the clinic and have my vagina
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:59.320]  speculated scooped on like the bottom of a Ben and Jerry's pint of me night
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.520]  It's a dangerous but liberating with the adrenaline rush
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.080]  From base jumping or snap chatting nudes to a co-worker
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.220]  In the final equation
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:21.680]  They give their children to the fires of Moloch and Bale just as the scripture tells us
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.400]  An interdimensional transmission controls them
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.840]  And when you see the entities controlling them, they're fallen. They're they're evil. You're like, why are they doing this?
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.000]  And it's because their spirit never truly touched God
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.320]  But for some it's even worse
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.560]  Some commit the ultimate sin and feel the Holy Spirit and they're given a vision of
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.600]  the next level and refuse it to engage in
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:55.240]  In the interdimensional sex with the demons. Oh, yeah, when you're killing your kid and you know, you're doing a ritual
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:03.880]  You you get fully possessed recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.640]  backed up with human waste and
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.440]  Debris this is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:21.320]  Like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products. And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.000]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged

[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.960]  You
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:11.440]  Satan wants one thing the future that means our children now again, I saw a video last hour
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.440]  A pbs with a woman celebrating killing her babies
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.720]  And selling it as a woman's right but now the left says no, it's a sacrament to satan. It's not a joke to freak out conservatives
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.480]  It's they're coming out. So I mentioned a few years ago
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.880]  I saw a vice piece
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.960]  Where the woman's having orgasms killing her baby and they sexualize it and the people in the room are all getting off and all
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.720]  Have demonic looks on their faces like governor Cuomo and they signed that bill to kill babies after they're born look like
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.680]  You know that he again
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.960]  Was in ecstasy
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:56.240]  Because you've if you hadn't been around satan's I mean real hardcore ones folks. You don't know what to look for
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.720]  But now the way they're running around it's damn obvious, isn't it that can we put
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.000]  the
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.160]  trillionaire globalists up on screen please we put the cnn house inerson cooper
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.880]  the
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.880]  manor belt
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.720]  Uncloaking showing you his real face and they're gonna do it more and more because they don't know what to do and I'm explaining
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.520]  They want to kill your children. This isn't Salem's lot a Stephen King movie
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  This is real
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.480]  And I'm gonna explain something about Stephen King. I'm getting ready to come out against Stephen King
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.680]  I'm getting ready to come out against them all
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:43.840]  Stephen King put stuff in his books and things he says that unless you've actually been in this stuff. You wouldn't know about
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040]  What a piece of crap
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.840]  They're all pieces of crap and they're all slaves to the devil
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.480]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls and I apologize
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.400]  I just want everybody to really decide which side they're on right now
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:06.000]  No, because I talk about I literally have flashbacks
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.440]  About flashbacks. I see one article celebrating abortion and my brain goes
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.800]  Like a hundred things flood in and I'm just like
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.200]  It's just about economy attack, you know, we gotta fight them. It's like I don't just know I know
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.240]  I was noticing on the Joe Rogan show last week that he had a guest on I saw the clip
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:32.160]  I forget what's got but they're like Joan said a Joan said on your show three years ago
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:40.640]  That there'd be a 100 trillion dollar green new deal global tax and AOC just said 100 trillion announced it. How does he know that?
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.520]  Because it's the you the UN runs it
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.040]  I mean do people just think I'm saying all this
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  I
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:01.840]  Imagine you just want to date some hot girl in high school and you find out her family and a bunch of the rich people
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.760]  All act like this behind the scenes. These people are crazy
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.680]  By the way, that's just step one
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.680]  I
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.080]  Mean you don't want to see what these kids see man. You don't want to see what these people see it's bad, man
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.720]  I never I
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.320]  Went around the edge of it. I never was involved in any of it
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320]  And let me tell you something when I wasn't involved in it
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:41.920]  You think Stephen King writes books folks. Let me tell you something. There's a lot of stuff going on around here
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.920]  And people aren't ready to deal with
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.160]  You think things like Nasferatu is just a German movie
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.920]  He's not a movie folks
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.960]  That's freaking Nasferatu on your screen right there and you can see him right there boy
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600]  That's a one evil son of a bitch
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.800]  And I swear on the altar of god
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.640]  Eternal resistance to these people
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  We will break them
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.880]  And not because we want their power but because we're going to get them out of the way of the children
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:19.440]  And they are going to pay for what they've done
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.280]  And we're not going to back down and we're not going to submit to them anymore
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.200]  You understand that you chicken that demon
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.240]  These are the weak people that serve satan
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:40.800]  And they become completely turned over to a spirit of evil
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.920]  And I just think Jesus Christ our lord and savior that the enemy tried to recruit me
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.680]  And every time they try to recruit me they failed
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.400]  The power the sex the money all of it the threats
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.640]  The intimidation
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.640]  I am beyond their grasp now
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.640]  But children aren't
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.840]  And that's why these demons come after our children and we'll just pray against Anderson cooper
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.800]  And if we'll just pray against the enemy
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:18.480]  God will break them not us vengeance
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.120]  belongs
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.120]  to god
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.960]  But we
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.960]  In many cases are
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.040]  The dagger which god will
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.000]  Plunge into their metaphysical heart
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:37.200]  I want to explain that vengeance is mine say at the lord
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:46.640]  Vengeance is mine, but who says the gods doesn't use vehicles, but god is a god of free will
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:50.240]  God doesn't trick you
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:55.600]  And god doesn't give you jobs you can't complete you may tell god i'm completely turned over to you
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:59.360]  I'm ready to die for the truth. I'm ready to do whatever it takes and god will say
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.480]  All right, let's give you a test. Let's see how much you can handle. Let's put this much weight on you
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.600]  You didn't handle it no more weight
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:14.480]  But when you start handling the weight god starts piling it on and on and on and on and as the weight piles on
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:16.880]  Your interdimensional site opens
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.800]  Like pressure when you're doing a deep dive
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.840]  And the threat is in how deep you go
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:33.200]  Instead of you ever try to go back to the surface you're no longer a person of that
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.480]  You don't stare into the abyss
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.320]  And come back from where you were
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.640]  When you stare into the abyss as a conscious being
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:52.320]  You don't become fallen like these vehicles like these automatons like these avatar flesh bags
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.120]  Like this particular
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  Mother riches man on earth
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.960]  But you don't ever come back
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:10.640]  And I think that's something you need to know ladies and gentlemen you don't ever come back
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.720]  Mr. Glenn Danzik said it's a long way back from hell
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.520]  And do you really want to cross that line?
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:25.680]  Do you want to take a life?
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  But you see
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.640]  You don't need to fear he who can
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.640]  take
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640]  Take the life
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  But he you can take the soul
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.120]  So just remember
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:56.960]  If you want some intergalactic space junk trash to run your life if you want to be ennis and cooper
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  Then you can join the dark side
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.520]  But if you want the keys to eternity
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:14.400]  And the keys to things that the eye has not seen the ears not heard you must reject the devil
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:21.920]  In all of his minions and all of his pimps and all of his pumps and all of his enforcers and all of them
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.320]  And that doesn't mean
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:31.840]  That you give up who you are
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.320]  The truth is god will show you who you are
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.320]  But until you've crossed those bridges until you face those demons
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:50.240]  You're never going to have god open the gates up for you
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.440]  And once you've seen into heaven
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.400]  And you'll never know why people didn't join god. It's extremely painful
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.200]  And i'll tell you you will feel very pathetic and weak in the presence of god
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.360]  You will feel unending power and understanding and
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  Explosive will
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.920]  But you yourself in god's presence will feel incredibly dirty
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:26.400]  And the truth is someone close to god has unlimited power over these devil worshipers
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.280]  But
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.240]  Once you're in the presence of god like it says in revelation
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.880]  The saints take the crowns off
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  They throw them out
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:45.280]  Because god's consciousness and all the secrets of the universe is so big it's pathetic
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:52.560]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing that what god gave us from other nature is incredible
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.800]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are so upset
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.480]  The problem is people forget to take them
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.320]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:13.920]  So we looked at that we made the very best a.m. And p.m. Packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules

[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:58.560]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:04.880]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:10.640]  In the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.320]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:18.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:25.360]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.760]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:34.960]  In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.680]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.320]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:47.600]  Head to info worse life.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets

[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:30.480]  Well, thanks so much for having me alex can you hand me your i can thanks for calling
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.440]  Well, what do you think about trump taking the gloves off and going after big tech for antitrust?
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.720]  Oh, look there's something's going on. I don't know what's going on, but like this is
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:45.920]  Okay, so we've got three chinese warships in sydney harbour
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.760]  And the perhaps our prime minister is acting like he knew
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:55.200]  Okay, he's the only one that knew though because the premier didn't know the defense minister didn't know
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:00.640]  But the thing is when i've tried to tweet it out to the international community twitter is
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:09.600]  Deletion my tweets and i tried it three time. Okay, and then my phone shut down alex my phone shut down
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:17.200]  Wow, you know, we put the article up there from abc news australia australian broadcasting system company
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.480]  And i was aware that china isn't making a lot of threats, but wow
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:25.840]  I'd love to see the chinese actually try to take on the ossees they get their ass kicked in about 10 seconds
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:32.160]  But yes, they admit it's a provocative move to let you know they're in command. Uh, what do you make of that?
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.960]  Look, it's they're doing a drive-by
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.840]  They've failed and i play what they're trying to do is they're basically they're testing their stealth weapons
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.880]  Right because they've just basically sailed in willy-milly and we didn't no one knew they were coming
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.520]  But but slow down and explain this they just showed up
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:56.160]  Missile cruisers and pulled in because you know, they're the big extractors of almost all the rare earth minerals in australia
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:02.160]  So australia has been the government deep in bed with them. Uh, i mean, i mean, i know they own a lot of australian debt
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:05.520]  Like they own us debt. Do you think they're showing up to piss on their property?
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:12.160]  Oh, yeah, definitely. Look at the display of strings alex there's just no two ways about it
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:17.760]  There's no two ways about it. They just rocked in without warning and the only way our p.m. Is covering it
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:21.840]  He's just saying oh, i knew they were coming. No, he didn't
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.080]  Well, i should have led the show with this just print me all the articles. I see the articles
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.520]  I had one on the stack the the unannounced arrival exactly warships pull in like they're in charge

[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:36.240]  Trust me when I read zuckerberg saying my users trust me. They're dumb efforts. I'm the opposite of that
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.280]  And I because I'm some goody tissue
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:48.080]  I Metaphysically don't even think like that, but if I even imagine the enemy screwing over people that count on me
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:52.160]  That's when I get scared. Yeah, I'm never scared. I'm never scared
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.760]  Except if I think like the enemy, huh? I get really scared. I get really alone. I started having a panic attack
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.840]  Like who the hell was to kill babies like celebrated that ain't good luck man. That ain't good luck

[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:13.440]  I don't want to blow the planet up
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.440]  That ain't that special
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:21.200]  That's what listeners don't need to call it and tell me how great I am how great I am
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:24.640]  Because because I I know I come from a long line of humans
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:27.600]  So I want to be pro-human and I want my kids to have a future
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:30.960]  Being sane is not special folks
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.400]  Except when you live in a world of crazy people
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.440]  I said I take your calls
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.440]  It's just all the evils being confirmed the whole world government the whole plan to get our kids
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.520]  And I can't believe we've got to go through this. I mean you look at god the good governor northam
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.040]  You know, I don't wish any harm against governor northam
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:05.360]  And I pray nobody does anything to him, but if somebody walked up to him with a say of samurai sword
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:08.240]  And cut his head clean off
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.000]  Well, we say it was a post-birth abortion that he promotes
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.040]  Or is it wrong to cut his head off with a samurai sword
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.320]  Because maybe that didn't keep him comfortable
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:26.160]  Maybe maybe maybe maybe you I'm not saying do this. I'm saying hypothetically like a Stephen King novel
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:32.400]  He got kidnapped and taken to a house and then you you you put him under with a medical injection
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:35.040]  So he doesn't feel it when you cut his head off
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:39.520]  Because you kept him comfortable or maybe you put him on a bunch of painkillers and he's all
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:46.080]  I'm gonna keep you comfortable now like you did that little baby because you see you're gonna kill the baby after they bone
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:52.640]  Well, why not keep him comfortable? You see why not? I mean, when do we stop aborting people northam? Oh, I get it
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  You have value northam
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:56.400]  Northam
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.240]  You exist
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.760]  And because you exist and you decide which baby live and which baby
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.320]  That makes you somehow some high and mighty person
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.440]  But let me let me tell you something about northam
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.240]  Northam is a coward
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.320]  and a climber and a piece of crap and
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:20.800]  God isn't gonna do anything to northam
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:25.440]  When northam soul leaves his filthy body
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:30.160]  It's gravity. It's a charge
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.600]  Northam has a
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  energy field
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:40.720]  That is gonna tie on to him and drag him down a black hole
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:47.360]  And he's gonna go into a place with trillions of other entities from around the universe
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.800]  That have done the similar stuff and he's gonna be with them for
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:53.440]  ever
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.440]  so
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.080]  He wants to talk about how he killed baby
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.360]  How he keep him comfortable
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:07.840]  And talk about how most power he got he go find out the power
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:15.120]  In trillions and trillions and trillions of earth orbits
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:19.600]  In the phantom zone
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.440]  And you already look at his eyes he already looks scared
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:29.200]  He already done some stuff for power. He already scared
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:35.120]  And the evil tells him if you just do more and kill the baby
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  And
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.200]  You might get out of it like Faustus
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:48.160]  Like Faust he believes he can get out of this he's trying to figure it out
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:53.760]  Well, let me tell you northam you already gonna figure it out
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:15:00.480]  You'd be lucky if somebody chopped your head off of the samurai sword brother that ain't happening

[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.040]  Well the governor of virginia
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.480]  Northam who famously posed in blackface
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:48.800]  Who said that kill babies after they're born totally normal trying to pass the same law as new york and other states
[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.760]  He died today. It's it's just been announced in a post birth
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  Abortion, but it's okay because he wasn't a human
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.240]  It was after he was born and they kept him comfortable when they did it so governor
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:04.960]  Northam is dead
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:10.640]  Obviously that's sick satire, but that shows how whacked out and how crazy and how out of control
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.440]  This individual is and we're going to get to all your calls chris and carolin lee and
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.480]  Joey and shawn and thad and peter and pam
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:25.520]  Right now with joe biggs, but joe biggs army veteran patriot in fours.com former reporter doing his own stuff out there kicking
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:30.080]  But I just was thinking hey, well I get joe biggs back on i'm like hey joe what do you want to cover and he's like well
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.880]  I want to cover
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:39.600]  That love knows no age, which is an actual namble of statement being put out by different leftist publications right now
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.240]  and all this sexualization of
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:49.840]  Children that we were just talking about milie syris celebrating abortion in bizarre video where she talks about how it's sexual and
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:57.920]  But but again outrage after snapchat debuts love has no age filter on pride month. That's up at news wars.com
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:01.520]  So joe good to have you back with us. I agree with your t-shirt
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:05.120]  We should expel alexandria cortez because she hates america so much
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:10.320]  But but but what do you think the left's doing right now with all the pro pedophile stuff without even looking?
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:14.000]  I don't know like 10 stories today about the left promoting pedophilia
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:19.440]  Well the easiest way to control this country and the easiest way to break it down is to destroy the family
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.720]  And that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to manipulate
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:26.560]  Manipulate and brainwash our kids and they're trying to do that through
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:31.280]  They're incrementally doing that we've seen that through these drag queen story hours over the past few years
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:35.600]  I mean we used to joke all the time that they were going to add a p to lgbtq and here we are
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:42.800]  We're finally seeing them kind of make that final push and they're doing the open now by saying that love has no age
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:46.560]  I mean, yeah in five years old six years old. Yeah, we can experience love
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:51.360]  We understand what love is but it's the same thing with it's not sexual and it's not with adults
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:53.840]  Yeah, but but but but it's the way they do it
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:56.960]  It's the same thing with the the saying is do you do you support our troops?
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:58.560]  Well, of course we support our troops
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:03.920]  But the true meaning behind that is do you support our policies that lead to war and no we don't but
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:09.200]  But to get people around that we say do you support our troops and that's what this love has no age thing as is
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:12.320]  They they try to cover it as oh, yeah, you know as a kid
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:18.320]  But as you said love has no age that is that is namble a statement. I mean that is the actual namble
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:21.440]  slogan
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:26.720]  When you pull the mask off that slogan what's behind it two sweaty old 45 year old guys
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:32.000]  That are getting off to my little pony cartoons. It's disgusting and it's nasty and that's what this is all about
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  It's trying to normalize
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:36.400]  Adults have a relationship with these young children
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:40.080]  When you look at that kid out of Canada that wants to be this drag queen star
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.400]  He always looks like he's drugged out of his mind. He looks like this slave
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:50.000]  Uh, and then you've got these two creepy dudes that are you know, probably in their 30s that are just you know
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:54.160]  Loving every single bit of it. Yeah in the background. It says we're all hitting off
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:56.400]  But Joe it's way worse than you're saying
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:00.640]  They're actually in their 40s one guy is a convicted guy that cut up his boyfriend to death
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:03.840]  And it says we're hibbing all the date rape drug and they say in the video
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:06.480]  We're going to corrupt your children bring them to us
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:12.800]  So these are the guys that launched the club kid movement that is about promoting pedophilia in the 90s. So yes
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.720]  What you just said is true
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:18.640]  It's disgusting and parents are going along with it. These are our kids. This is our future
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.200]  People should be pissed off every single adult out there right now should be making videos about how
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.760]  Angry and disturbed they are. I mean snapchat is a disgusting place. Let's be honest
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:33.120]  I mean, I only use snapchat to talk to these two girls and I know outside of that when you look at the things they promote on there
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:39.200]  It is disgusting filled. There's nothing anything on there worth a damn whatsoever
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:44.960]  It is it's people fighting. It's it's just disgusting people, you know frothing at the mouth over the brand new
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.400]  $3,000 pair of shoes or something like that. There's nothing good that comes out of this doesn't support
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:52.800]  Let me ask you this you're a smart guy
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:57.760]  Why is this all coming out now like the house of drag queens got caught and is charged
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:02.640]  With making child porn with little kids and you look at the photos. They all have that crazy look that I can't even make
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.280]  Here, let me try to make it for TV viewers. It's like this
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:13.520]  Well, give us your children and like we're convicted pedophiles and the schools let them in like to have your kids on their laps
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:18.080]  Like what freaking planet do you let these looms next to your kids?
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:23.680]  I mean, I mean look at Joe Biden. I mean, this is the frontrunner for the democratic party right now and this guy's creepier than the hell
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:28.160]  I mean, he's grabbing up on women left and right. You know, it just doesn't surprise
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:35.280]  Grabbing a little kids. Oh, yeah, it's nasty. It's disgusting. So so let me ask a question again. Why is it suddenly?
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:39.840]  Coming out. It's like it's just it's just coming out. You follow those others
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:45.760]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit some deal with a guy going we're grooming your kids and we're not asking
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:51.680]  We're grooming your kids and we're not asking and they're gonna sit on my lap and you're like, what the what is going on?
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:57.280]  Well, who's the frontrunner though? Joe Biden, how does he how do we make him look normal to go up against trump?
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.560]  We've got to make it this normal thing every world society. I agree. You imagine if trump was like rubbing little girls in the face
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.120]  Going, oh, you're so beautiful. I mean like and I had family doing that. One of my kids had punched him
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:11.840]  He said when you're rich, they let you grab them by the you know, whatever
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:17.520]  That's consent. They let you but this guy is creepily going up behind people
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:23.040]  And you can see that look of disgust in their eyes. You can see the goosebumps appearing on their skin
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:29.200]  You can see the fact that they just want to escape and not be there. Exactly. They start repelling. They start pulling back
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:31.280]  Yeah
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:34.480]  And that's what it is is we have to normalize that type of behavior
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:40.560]  So Joe Biden can be a candidate to go up against president trump. It's 2020 sadly. That's kind of what I think it is
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:44.960]  I'll ask it again because I want your opinion. Why is it suddenly exploding everywhere?
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:49.360]  I don't know. I mean like I said, I think it's just to normalize Joe Biden
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.640]  So you've answered it. You just think
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:56.160]  Well, it's like why are they suddenly saying martin loser king's a pervert with no proof
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:02.880]  Classic super right wing nazi propaganda about him with no proof because he said don't judge people by race judge them by what they do
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.600]  There's a full on left movement everywhere saying martin loser king is the worst person ever
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:10.800]  Yeah, because he's going against what they want now
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:16.240]  You don't think or if you think for yourself then you're outcast if you if you go with the grain then you're good
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  They love you you're a hero
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.480]  I mean look at anybody out there look at any celebrity now
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.400]  They say f trump they they get all this money to get all these crappy roles and films
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:29.520]  But if they don't they're banished they're blacklisted they're kicked off everything and they have to you know, hopefully they saved money
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.520]  They did what they're supposed to do throughout the career
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.360]  I want to take phone calls with joe bigs. I want you on more joe on all our shows
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.080]  I don't know how like you get busy. I get busy. I should come on your show
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.040]  You don't want to great stuff
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:42.160]  We're going to break it a minute but tell people because you haven't been banished in some places
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.640]  You've been you've been uh attacked for your bank accounts because you dared interview the proud boys
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.760]  You've been persecuted some but working people find uh planet bigs
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:57.200]  Uh, you can go to twitter at rambo bigs or you can go to my website staff sergeant bigs.com. That's ssgbigs.com
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.800]  I want to go to calls and I've got so many issues we could talk for a thousand years
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:05.360]  But what else is on your radar? What else you want to hit when we come back?
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:10.880]  This whole thing with the Mueller investigation. I mean look it's over let it go
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.320]  These these people are still
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:21.280]  Frothing at the mouth trying to find something to get them big surprise crubs on a russian agent. He's a flaming americana
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:23.840]  Everyone in the world right now should be
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:28.800]  Scared out of their mind. They should be horrified. They should have pissed off and angry. They created a crime
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:34.960]  Then they found a person to blame it on and then they tried to create a trail to lead that person to that crime
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:39.280]  I mean that's insanity and people are going to know that's okay. Trump's the bad guy. No, he's not
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.240]  The only question is will trump go on the offense against this and I think the answer is yes

[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:23.520]  All right, I want to ask Joe begs and the rights of these patient amazing callers
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:27.040]  I really appreciate calling in on this to stay global broadcast
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:31.440]  Trump's delivering. I mean he's delivering at a sickening level
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:34.080]  dictators can't get this much stuff done
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:40.080]  And culture goes oh, we got double the illegal aliens. Yeah, cuz the u.s. Launching an attack
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.600]  And they got refugee centers running at all. It's like
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:47.600]  It's like the japanese attack us at pearl harbor and now it's our fault
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.480]  Uh, it's the same thing over and over again
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.080]  And if trump does something wrong, I'll turn on him
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:57.360]  faster, you can say
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:59.280]  Possum gut
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:03.840]  But the point is is I don't see that happening and I see the whole system crapping their drawers
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:10.560]  I see nationalism and populism exploding and like joe begs said though, they're doubling down harassing anybody that tells the truth
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:12.880]  And now
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:15.840]  Trump's got as we told you before it even broke because I was up in dc
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:18.320]  I was meeting with folks that had been in the meetings with trump
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:20.320]  And
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.040]  I'll be honest
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.240]  I don't have the conversations with trump because that becomes a national security issue
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:29.920]  I just have conversations with the people that are going to meet with trump and I hope write memos to trump
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.760]  And and you know, I'm proud of that because my analysis is on
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:40.400]  Uh, and you know, we talk about how china and the eu is creating regulations and we're not creating regulations to block it
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:43.680]  So by extension, we're letting them regulate when we say we're against regulation
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:48.320]  Well, this doesn't matter the regulating she better regulate and and all the rest of stuff is now in the news front and center
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:53.600]  So I'm really proud of this audience. I'm proud of the crew. I'm proud of what we've done because it's actually
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:35:00.640]  Freaking me out the amount of effect. We're all having together in the symbiotic spirit of america that that is info wars
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:04.400]  And what we're doing, but joe begs for you all these calls and ride shotgun with us a little bit the next hour
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:12.560]  What do you think about what trump's doing and the antitrust and the announcements because they can debate all day
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:17.280]  Oh, you can't say what corporations do with speech. Let's let's just say they're right, which they're not
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.360]  Doesn't matter. You're running combines. You're running monopolies. You're buying up all the other companies
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:28.080]  You're not letting people set up their own things. So you're done and I just can't believe they don't get like the jig is up
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.280]  It's a scary situation to kind of get into that conversation
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:38.800]  She didn't know do we have government step in what do we do to this? How do we how do we how do we deal with this?
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:42.560]  You know the government in itself doesn't really take care of things too well
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:45.600]  I mean, let's look at a lot of the things that they're in charge of they
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.560]  Really don't do that well with the money and all that so
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:53.200]  That's one of the things always makes me if you know, do we want to jump into that that whole thing?
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:56.240]  Um, but I think trump's done a really outstanding job
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.400]  I mean think about the amount of negative attention he gets day in and day out
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:06.560]  Think about the silvia obama holdovers that are in there think about the wraps that are still left over within the white house
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:12.080]  listening or adding them out a snitching trying to say whatever they can to come up with something to create some kind of
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.720]  hostility or some new headline
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:18.480]  Some guy trying to put out a new book every other day someone who's got tapes
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:20.960]  I mean all this stuff he's had non-stop
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:24.800]  It's been 98 negative force come at him non-stop
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.160]  And he's still been able to do more than any present in my lifetime
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:33.280]  I mean the things that we've been able to accomplish are pretty outstanding and amazing and he's done it
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:38.240]  No, I agree Joe, but I want your I want your take on this. I agree. We're laws. They fair. I'm a libertarian too
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:40.960]  I believe in the invisible hand of capitalism and
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.440]  Adam Smith and all that what I'm saying is if the chai comms and the eu
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:50.800]  Are already bringing in regulation and so we don't have regulation
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:54.800]  But because we don't they then decide the regulatory architecture
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:01.200]  So what I'm saying is congress is woken up to that now and we can have laws that prohibit regulation
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:04.240]  I'm saying we need laws that don't control the internet
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:10.240]  We need laws like we had on the books before that are being ignored like section 230 that protect the open freedom
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:12.000]  Yeah
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.560]  Count the second amendment. It isn't a prohibitive law
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:19.600]  It's a law enshrining and defending an unalloyable un
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:22.160]  unalienable right
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:25.600]  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I got it
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.640]  So, so what is your take on that?
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:33.280]  No, I mean that's fine and like that that's good. That'll work, you know, but you know, like I said, it's just
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.920]  It's who's involved who's going to be writing this and who's going to be no
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:43.680]  No, I agree. You're totally right getting government involved taking big text in the woodshed is dangerous as well
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:46.400]  But here's the thing joe. They put us in this situation joe
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:53.120]  You know what really what I'd like to do is I just say screw twitter screw facebook let them all fail
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.280]  I mean, I think we need to make a shift somewhere else
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:38:01.680]  But you understand let's say you started a social network that was rivaling. They're going to come in offer you a billion dollar show
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:05.280]  They buy everybody up
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:08.320]  Yeah, I mean
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:11.440]  That's the thing though. I mean, I just don't know. It's one of those it's one of those things
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:13.920]  I really don't have an answer to it's one of those things
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:16.640]  I'm still when I when I sit here and I hear everybody talking about it
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:18.800]  Well, I do have an answer to it
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:22.400]  I do have the answers and I just mean that very calmly and I'm not I'm serious
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.360]  You get what I'm saying if the chinese and the eu
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:31.280]  Are bringing in regulations that we're now going to follow if we don't block that we've given them control
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.440]  You do agree with me. We shouldn't give them control, right? Yeah, exactly
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:39.120]  That's why so so so
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:41.760]  Now that we're going to have regulations
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:45.120]  Because it's happening now, but we've we've crossed that bridge
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:47.760]  We're here now. What do you think should be done?
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:49.760]  I
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:56.560]  To be quite honest I like I said I get scared when I put when I think about giving government control and stuff like this
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:00.960]  Yeah, we block other people from taking control. Um, but I think it needs to be very limited in the scope
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:07.760]  I totally agree with you. We need government to tell the chai comms and the eu to go jump off a goddamn cliff. Excuse my french
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:14.560]  Because you get laws can be prohibitive of a regulation, right?
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.080]  Like the first amendment says congress shall make no law
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:26.240]  Respecting unestablished from religion are prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the right to peacefully assemble or read us the government
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:28.880]  for grievances
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:35.440]  So you kind of see the compendium, right? It's a law saying you don't touch this. You don't have jurisdiction
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.840]  You get you understand what I'm saying
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:39.920]  Exactly. Yes, I do
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:46.000]  So don't we need that again in post? No, no, like I said, I agree with you on that. Of course outside of that
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  I don't know what else to do
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:51.280]  All right, I want to go to phone calls Joe and I want to ask what else on your radar
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:54.000]  I want to get you back on a routine basis. You're a smart guy. You're a funny guy
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.120]  And you've got a lot of common sense for folks and I think you're honest about it
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:00.880]  Like you're like saying hey, I don't want to regulate stuff. I get it brother neither do I
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:04.960]  What do you do when the chai comms and the eu are doing it though?
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.560]  Yeah, like I said, that's one of those things that I
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.480]  You know, I just from from things I've seen, you know working in the government for so many years
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:18.720]  It just scares me when when I have to think about giving them power of stuff
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.200]  Oh, I agree with you. Oh, Joe
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:29.040]  Joe look right here though. Here's ap. Here's here's bloomberg. You understand the eu has declared control over the us internet
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:33.920]  So it's already happened the eu brother. So what does our government need to do then?
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.720]  Tell them to f off
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:38.720]  Exactly that's all I'm saying
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  Yeah
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:46.240]  Let me ask you this. Why do you think they're so arrogant they would try this Joe?
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:51.680]  Well, I think most people think that they can
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:55.920]  They're I think they're used to you know having this Obama kind of thing
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:00.080]  I think that that's what they were that they were hoping on they were hoping they were going to have a hillary clinton
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.640]  So since everything's fell and I guess you're still trying to push through and see if you know
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:07.760]  Maybe president trump will bend and break on some issues like that
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:10.720]  And maybe they can slide in and get some control or something like that
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:12.720]  But I don't really see that he's going to play that game
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:16.480]  You know, I think they're just kind of coming out with a final blow and see what they can do
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.600]  You know they had all this stuff lined up for years under obama and they were ready to pass that torch over to hillary clinton
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.080]  to kind of do a final blow to just take complete and total control and
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:30.400]  Didn't work out too well for him. So I think they're just trying anyway to see what they can do
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:36.240]  So that's why I have joe big zone because joe you act like the common guy and you are just a common sense guy
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.840]  But you just said incredibly sophisticated things you just crystallize it all
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.800]  They had all this world government plan with obama and hillary
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.560]  It was all supposed to go down and now it's not going the way they wanted you just said everything right there
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.560]  I
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:59.440]  Apologize to college front getting to you have my word of honor when we come back
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:04.880]  We're going right to carol right to mike right to lee right to joey right to joe right to sad right to p.m
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:08.240]  We'll go a little bit the next hour and then and then and then I've got
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.680]  He already left today, but we taped it and it's powerful
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:15.120]  constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes on
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:17.840]  How big this is but let me just explain something
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.680]  For trump to take on the shy comms was big because they got a lot of traders and payoffs here in america. That was
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:27.040]  That was godzilla battling megaline
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:30.080]  When trump took on big tech
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:36.000]  Gamora or wherever you call it the three-head dragon. That was it. I mean, let me tell you trump's the real deal period
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:40.800]  I mean, he is the real mccoy. There's there's no doubt now
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.760]  But my gut already told me trump is for real
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.720]  And this is america's last chance to turn us around joe big is our guest your call straight ahead
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:53.680]  I promise on the other side 10 seconds into the next segment. We're going to the callers. Stay with us

[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.400]  Who's been holding the longest i think it's carol

[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:51.200]  You're on the air with staff sergeant joe bigs american patriot and alex jones. Thanks for holding her on the air
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.920]  Hi alex hi joe. How are you good to have you on thanks for holding
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:02.000]  Um, i gotta tell you god bless the both of you. I mean i met a lot of great fellow patriots and
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:05.760]  I mean that have become really good friends and because of both of you
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:09.200]  Putting it out there and me connecting with a lot of great people ma'am
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:12.400]  We love you too. It's so great to meet all the patriots out there
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:19.440]  And whether they're black or ispanic or white the electricity in people's eyes that love liberty is incredible
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:22.000]  exactly
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  It isn't and also since like I am in love with those power bars the peanut butter ones. They are the bomb
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.560]  I'm going to tell you right now. They are the best. Well, thanks for plugging that because we just got them back in stock
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:35.280]  We've got peanut butter and chocolate and we've got coconut and chocolate
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:40.080]  They're high-end bars that like Whole Foods itself are seven dollars a piece for three dollars a piece
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:44.720]  But discounted they're even less so there's no filler though. Some people are like man. These take forever to eat. They're so
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:47.520]  They're so thick. They're so heavy. There's no filler
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.640]  You can cut the price with corn and wheat down to like a
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:57.440]  Ten cents a bar if you if you put filler in it. We don't do that. You actually get real protein real quality. So thank you
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.960]  I just I just bought my box last week. You can count on me alex. Thank you very much, ma'am. We wouldn't be here without you
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:05.680]  Oh, so here's my question
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:10.480]  Um, I know Paul Joseph Watson. He had mentioned that we need a like an internet bill of rights
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:14.720]  How can we how can we get that we'll get that through our great president?
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:18.400]  You know get that to his desk. He said we need like a bill of rights just to hammer down
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.040]  for the internet just gotta be way
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:26.640]  Now that's a great idea carol. Thank you. That's my mom's name. I appreciate you calling
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.360]  I think the internet bill of rights was the digital millennium copyright act 2000
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:35.840]  We had the laws it made sense the inventors the internet wrote them for congress was like
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:39.600]  More third parties anybody could post what they wanted if it's illegal
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:41.600]  It gets taken down the police get involved
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.040]  But we're just like if you have a message board somebody can say I'm gonna kill somebody
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:49.200]  Well, I've got a message board. It's not my fault. Then if it gets reported they get in trouble
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:53.200]  Big tech's thrown that away. They've thrown away. We already have the laws
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:50:00.000]  America built the internet with the british. We already had the system and it just got thrown away joe begs
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:05.200]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, hey, it's it's already been there. We need to go back to it. I
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:09.200]  Someone says something violent someone says they're gonna do something obviously, you know
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:12.160]  You report that you do something other than that, you know, sorry
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:15.360]  It's it's okay to be offended. I should be able to offend you
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.120]  I should be able to say things that hurt your feelings and you can get over you can block me you can mute me
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.520]  You can move on that's the end of the day or if you just choose to go somewhere else and not get on that website
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  I mean, it's okay to be offended and uh, I don't care if other people are you know
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:32.160]  But at the end of the line if we're going to talk about, you know, you've got people out there
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:32.960]  It'll look at youtube
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:35.760]  I mean they've got videos pushing that affiliate things like that
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:36.720]  It's okay for them
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.840]  But if I quote someone saying something stupid then I get banned, you know on facebook for 30 days
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:45.360]  It's just ridiculous what we're seeing happen. Well, you're being bad because you're effective
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:50.000]  Not because you're actually saying hateful things and it's not like we want to say these big things like oh
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:52.400]  I don't like such-and-such. That's not who I am
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:55.280]  Uh, it's just crazy great points joe
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:01.280]  Oh, all right. Let's go to pam in the great state of wisconsin pam in wisconsin. You're on the air with joe begs. Go ahead
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:04.960]  I'm sure I'm done there
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:06.240]  Go ahead
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:08.400]  Please be one second. Sorry
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.800]  Yeah, phones used to be better in this country like I remember a joke joe rogan had like 15 years ago
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:17.040]  It was like we're supposed to have jet packs in the year 2010 and now phones are even worse. I like
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:19.760]  God almighty, uh, go ahead pam
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:22.720]  I work. Sorry. I work in a concrete building. Um
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:26.160]  I just want to talk about how like it's funny that you know
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:30.320]  Caitlyn Bennett was when she was in england
[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:35.120]  I think she was telling someone that their opinion didn't matter since 1775
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:41.520]  Which I think that the eu should take that and use it to their advantage because I don't think that their opinion should matter
[02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:44.080]  on the american internet
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:48.160]  And the fact is they think that they can take it. Well, it's like my guns. They can come and take it
[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:53.120]  Well, I mean just from a territorial position or just law and again, I'll say it it's all over the news
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:58.080]  Like I keep saying the eu is because nobody also do it is running internet law worldwide
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:02.400]  Because our government won't say no and so I think you just said it right there
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:05.680]  Well, I think that we should you know
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:12.080]  Start taking back what was ours. I mean, I'm not gonna let my forefathers who fought in the revolution
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:14.160]  you know
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:15.520]  and died
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:19.120]  and died died for nothing Pam, I totally agree with you
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:21.200]  But I'm telling you I talked to conservatives
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:26.640]  And they're so ingrained with we don't regulate corporations. We don't regulate speech
[02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:32.000]  The corporations are regulating speech. They're working for foreign governments. They're following their orders
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:34.800]  So we have to have laws saying you don't do that
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:40.640]  Yeah, definitely. I agree with what um the earlier caller
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:47.200]  Right before me said that, you know, I think that we should start putting in a bill of rights for the internet because I'm tired of
[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:49.920]  people who aren't saying anything
[02:52:50.480 --> 02:52:54.320]  bad get banned and however like we have congresswomen that are going to
[02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:58.320]  terrorist organizations and rallying and saying that they hate jewish people
[02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:04.000]  I mean jewish people are citizens just like you and I are and I agree and by the way, I don't agree with saying
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:06.720]  Jews or the devil get rid of israel
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:10.080]  But if someone wants to say that as long as they're not called for violence, it's all right
[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:14.800]  But instead the very islamic groups that are calling for that
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:20.640]  Then call for citizens saying that's wrong to have our rights taken and I've been told what the litmus test is
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:26.320]  Don't talk bad about radical islam. I appreciate your call Pam back down to that. Joe. Have you run into that?
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:31.680]  Oh, yeah, of course and one of the things we really need to focus on here in this country is after trump
[02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:33.600]  What I'm going to do after trump leaves
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:38.800]  You know what we're seeing happen over in europe right now with the censorship of people going to jail for same things on the internet
[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:41.760]  That's frightening and that's going to move over here in this country soon
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:46.320]  You know, who do we have that's going to come up? Who are we looking at to come and replace trump?
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:51.440]  You know after his time is done in 2024. That's one of the big things that we really need to focus on
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:54.080]  We need to focus on what happens after him
[02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:56.720]  Because hands down
[02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:01.840]  Trump's going to be by that's easy. I mean by the way, josh holly has been saying what do we do post trump?
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:07.040]  We launch a populism that transcends left and right and it's just about the country and prosperity
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:10.080]  I I think josh holly's plan is this dead on
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:14.240]  Yeah, I mean that's something that we really need to focus on. It's not just now
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:17.200]  It's the steps down the road. We've got to think about this chess game
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:18.800]  You know it's not just a move now
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:23.840]  But a few down the road and that's really going to help secure our internet freedom and what we're going to be able to do
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:26.480]  Because if we don't do that now, we're surely going to fold it
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:30.400]  She agree with me that if we don't defend free space, we don't have anything
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:35.920]  Yeah, exactly. I know that's an over simplification folks. We all get it, but it's like well
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.640]  How satisfying is it to see trump taking action though? I mean
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:46.560]  I'm not here to kiss trump's ass, but I'm sorry the guy's delivering in royal flushes. I mean if we don't think god for this
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:48.160]  We're idiots
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:53.360]  Yeah, he does a fantastic job and like I said, there's been times that I've disagreed with him on it and I've called him out on that
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:56.880]  I mean, I you know, he's not my king. You know, I'm not his servant
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:01.680]  You know and if I see something that I don't like I've called him out and I've seen you do the same thing as well
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:05.600]  I've had private conversations with him where I disagree with something and show him facts
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:11.520]  And then two days later. He changes his position. It's it's it's it's it's it's wild. He listens though
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:16.320]  He listens. I've got a lot of friends that work close to him and they say he's one of the most genuine
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:22.560]  Awesome americans out there. I mean he really when he goes to restaurants and he's taking troops and stuff to go eat
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:27.920]  He will go and speak to every single person at that restaurant from the bus boy all the way to the general man
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:32.800]  Oh, yeah, he's all about people in this anti human globalist system that's post human. He's pro human
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:37.680]  I remember learning when he was running for office from people that were close to him not just roger stone with others
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:40.080]  That he told his wife. He said look
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:43.760]  I'm 69 years old. He's now 72 73
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:47.440]  He said I'm gonna have to totally commit to this if I do it. He just said
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:51.840]  I just want to have a life. It's gonna be too exhausting because if I step in this position
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:54.720]  I won't be able to give up because I can do a business negotiation
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.200]  But then there's not always one every day if I do this
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:00.720]  I'm gonna be killing myself and it was Melania came to him
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:03.680]  That's what they said Melania said didn't run and Trump doesn't want to run. It was all lies
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:05.280]  Melania came to him
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.920]  She's a big christian and said god told me you absolutely have to run and later was even in
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:13.920]  Politico this whole story about how he did it was the name of the article, but
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:16.640]  Trump is literally
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:19.040]  pouring himself out 18 hours a day
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.200]  Totally committed because not only will he be destroyed and his family for signing on to the reboot of america
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.600]  He gets we will so you're getting we're getting a champion here folks that is
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:31.520]  metaphysically
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.640]  100 percent committed and that's why the enemy is so scared. That's why they want him out of there
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:39.760]  Think about the mental capacity that this man has
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:46.960]  I mean that he has a mental capacity that most athletes and their crime and and most geniuses and their crime can't even like comprehend
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:49.440]  I mean the fact that he's running an entire nation
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.520]  Being a family man
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:57.040]  Remembering the names of every person that works for him taking the time to speak to each and every one of them
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:00.960]  What he wasn't spoke to the air force the other day for their graduation for their ceremony
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:04.720]  He stayed there afterwards and shook hands with every single person
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:10.240]  I mean and again it took two hours to see other no no leftists would do that people's an old big deal
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:15.280]  Yeah, because they're servants to them. They don't care. They're beneath them. That's beneath hillary cliff
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:18.160]  But see again the spell is is that humans suck?
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:23.280]  We're in a post-human world. Trump is involved in a ritual telling people they have power
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:29.600]  You understand, it's not just about him showing them. He cares and him shaking their hand. He wants to show them
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:32.240]  There what's important
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:34.160]  Which is the globalist tell us we're not important

[02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:03.200]  Found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[03:00:04.880 --> 03:00:11.120]  I hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this country
[03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:20.000]  Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are big and I don't mind them
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:26.320]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up the things that leave me
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:33.520]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking on the fight inside of me
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:39.600]  Yeah, walking on the fight inside of me running down
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.200]  Running down go big start guests great patriot when I get him back routinely all these great guests
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:52.640]  We've got to get on taking a few calls here lee in florida than sad in texas lee you're on the air with a fellow floridian joe bigs
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:54.640]  Thanks for holding
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:00.480]  Hi alex I think uh, you know just going into what you were saying about you know
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:05.600]  How he's doing a lot for the country trump is but his biggest adversary is jared kuster
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:11.280]  You know, he's definitely in with the elitist and he's one of the people who's taking papers off of his desk
[03:01:11.280 --> 03:01:17.760]  I mean the proof is in the pudding. I mean president. He is pro 5g. He's pro vaccine
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:25.120]  He knows that the caravans are funded by source NGOs and he won't move it move to stop it and and get tough with the un
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:30.880]  Now I agree. There's a lot of things trump should do and I'm not into some defensive jared kusher, but
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:36.400]  What is the proof that that that jared kusher is taking stuff off his desk?
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:39.520]  I thought that was general kelly and kelly didn't like kusher
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:42.240]  Well, there's no proof that he's taking
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:46.720]  Papers off of his desk, but it's not not a not a
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:54.080]  It's not untrue that he is a business partners with george soros and his though and his uh, what a real estate trust
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:55.920]  What is that thing called?
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:01:59.520]  Well, I mean, I mean here's the thing george soros is one of the biggest real estate owners in the world
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:04.560]  And so the fact that I looked at that like one little property george soros is in hedge funds and stuff
[03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:08.160]  So obviously there's something there. I'm not even here defending jared kusher
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:14.960]  I'm just behind trump and I like what trump's doing and I'm absolutely saying expose the vaccines and trump's gonna get around to that
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:19.360]  I think but uh, I mean, I think what you're saying is, you know legitimate. You're a listener
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:22.800]  You've got a point to make and I and I and I appreciate
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:26.560]  What you're saying li you were gonna talk about any trust won't see the day of light
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:31.200]  I don't think so because uh, the eu which is really a
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:36.800]  You know a revitalization of the holy roman empire. They know that the future will be fought, you know
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:42.160]  Not only, uh, you know in a kinetic war here on land, but also online. All right. Listen. I appreciate your call
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:43.920]  Here's the deal
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:48.960]  The freak out about trump is real. He's really doing things and we've pushed it to this point
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:52.880]  Uh, and like I've I've written reports to the president. I'm not bragging
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:57.760]  But the week later he's quoting on tv because they we have footnotes and everything. I have law firms do this
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.600]  Like I come up with the ideas but law firms check it and then we put the president so, uh, I just
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:11.120]  I think you've seen real fights against the globals. This is a real trade war. These are real things to get us out of syria. Joe bigs
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:13.920]  Oh, yeah, I agree with you completely
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:19.920]  I mean, it's look there's gonna be people around trump that you know are gonna have not the country's best interest
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:26.480]  Some people they're gonna be more I can't even on my office, right? I got great crew if you imagine having 10,000 employees like trump
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:28.960]  I know
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:34.640]  It's it's amazing that this man gets anything done and the fact that he keeps taking hits and he keeps on going
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:36.800]  And he stays focused and that's one of those things
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:37.760]  It's really uh
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:42.240]  Difficult as a human being because we all make mistakes. We all get knocked off track and it's easy
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:46.640]  To to kind of get down and bogged down when everything around you's so negative
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:52.160]  but this man can say laser focused and uh, kind of say right on track with all this going on around him
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:55.840]  Not even knowing who he can trust the left and right of them sometimes. I mean that's got to be
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:59.920]  Well, he knows he can trust us because I'm not doing my horn, but we have u.s. Intelligence
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:01.520]  And then they said this isn't a secret
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:05.120]  When they call up we write a report we send it to trump they check it that they go
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.840]  I mean and it's not like they're patents on the head. They really know
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:11.200]  We're out here as huma for the president human intelligence
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:14.480]  I've got buddies who work secret service for him and who work at the
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:16.560]  For pompeo and things like that
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:22.880]  I mean they say that he is one of the greatest guys they've ever had the pleasure of working with anyone who's ever been around this guy
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:24.960]  Like especially from that aspect
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:28.000]  They said it's a complete and total joy their job now
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.600]  Compared to hillary that tells veterans their pieces of filth
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:34.880]  Yeah, they hate dogs and stuff like that and get them out of here
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:39.600]  All right, I apologize the other callers. I promise you call me back tomorrow to go to the head of the line
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:44.880]  I give each each listener a free space force teacher from info or store.com
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:49.840]  Get their get their address a free shirt and the size they want coming up
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:54.480]  Bob Barnes in studio with the next level of the attack
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:05:01.600]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history
[03:05:02.400 --> 03:05:10.800]  This is a digital ai enforced gag order not to say the name alex jones are in full wars.com
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:23.920]  This is nazi germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President. We need your help. We need hit now
[03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:31.760]  You can take on big tech. They saw info wars as a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:37.360]  Pro-family populist organization. So they thought first they come for alex jones
[03:05:37.360 --> 03:05:40.560]  And then when people say okay take him off the air
[03:05:41.200 --> 03:05:44.000]  Everyone else like dominoes would fall the way to fight back
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:50.960]  Is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:53.280]  Take us down. They'll take everybody else down
[03:05:55.920 --> 03:06:01.120]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:07.120]  You know my spirit animal is bob barns
[03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:10.480]  I thought it was brisket
[03:06:10.640 --> 03:06:14.400]  Seriously, ladies and gentlemen, we've got huge breaking news today
[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:17.920]  And it's not breaking news to you because
[03:06:18.720 --> 03:06:25.360]  We don't just say we have sources. We don't just say we have our ear to the ground as a powerful audience of activists who are in the arena
[03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:31.360]  We point things out. It's not like Oprah Winfrey's secret where it just magically happens in the ether
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:35.520]  You take action. You call congress. You call talk radio. You write letters
[03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:43.040]  We have expert lawyers on we have experts from intelligence on we have expert in in finance and in academia on
[03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:48.720]  And we come to a consensus about the historic constitutional way to deal with the type of big
[03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:53.920]  Monopoly systems we're facing we've been through this before it's not america's
[03:06:53.920 --> 03:06:55.920]  First rodeo
[03:06:57.120 --> 03:07:03.120]  And so just as I told you a month ago, trump's not just going after apple or google or facebook. He's going after them all
[03:07:03.840 --> 03:07:07.440]  Well over the weekend. They said it was going to be google. You notice our headlines is
[03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:12.480]  He's going after google apple and facebook bare minimum
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:17.040]  Now you can say well, aren't they going after amazon? Well amazon's done some monopolistic practices
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:19.840]  Let's not lie to each other and I don't like them. I've been a big credit
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:26.240]  But they're not in bed with the chai comms and they're not giving missile seekers the chinese and they're not giving ai to the chinese
[03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:29.600]  Bezos is big enemies with the chinese and alibaba
[03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:34.720]  You'd think these other guys if you wanted to run a monopoly be a little smarter when their home base is here
[03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:38.880]  So robert barnes was on with us yesterday. He's about to leave town today
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:44.160]  And he laid all of this out and he said watch it's going to be apple next. Well
[03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:50.880]  Uh, the paint wasn't dry on this the ink wasn't dry on this. Here's cnbc. Here's roiders
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:56.320]  Exclusive us just department considering apple probe, which means they're preparing
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:00.480]  The apple probe the uss department has jurisdiction for a
[03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:06.560]  Potential probe of apple ink as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using
[03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:10.720]  Their size to act in an anti competitive manner two sources told
[03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:15.440]  Reuters and the supreme court already ruled a month ago on this opening the door
[03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:20.480]  So let's start with this first your sources. You've been up to see pack on their events. So this was coming
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:24.320]  Now it's coming. What does this signify? I mean, I think it's fair to say the real headline is here
[03:08:25.760 --> 03:08:29.280]  The executive branch is opening a probe of
[03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:34.800]  Apple because that's what it means to say considering a probe exactly it's legal war
[03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:38.720]  You know what happened is these big tech giants decided to take their monopoly
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:43.840]  That was more of a natural monopoly in the technology sphere and make it a monopoly over other things speech
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:47.920]  Advertising press what you could say what you could think what you could do
[03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:55.040]  Getting involved in surveillance that was beyond the scope of what anyone believed or assumed to be the case getting involved in invading privacy
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:01.360]  Monetizing people's personal information if they would simply would have stayed out of using their platform control as leverage
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:07.040]  To try to monopolize the the public square of speech thought and ideas and press
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:11.200]  They wouldn't be here. That's what other commentators are saying all across the globe
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:18.160]  They're saying this happened because these particular, you know, why is something happening with apple and google and facebook?
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:25.120]  but not amazon because apple because amazon has not been using its book access and its book monopoly
[03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:30.880]  To decide what you can speak what you could say what you can hear what you can share what you can discuss what you can debate
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:38.240]  Apple chose not amazon chose not to do that apple did apple chose to use its itunes to discriminate against gab in favor of twitter
[03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:45.920]  Apple used its itunes access to decide which podcast you could hear which podcasts were listed which podcasts were accessible when you searched
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:48.800]  google decided to do the same thing with its youtube control
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:56.320]  Facebook decided to do the same thing by banning even people saying the words alex jones in a favorable light info wars in a favorable light
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:04.560]  In completely the platforming paul joseph watson entirely from facebook and instagram those actions is what led to this day
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:08.560]  It's what led to them and now once the doors are open there ain't no closing them
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:15.280]  So unless they decide to completely retract from these spaces and decide they're not going to try to monopolize the public square
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:20.560]  They're not going to try to discriminate against people based on viewpoint. They're not going to try to de-platform
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.760]  independent members of the press that question institutional narratives then until they do that
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:29.200]  They're going to be subject to meaningful scrutiny and investigation and inquiry
[03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:36.960]  Which will reveal their monopolistic practices were even worse than what got microsoft into trouble in the 1990s and a very easy way worse
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:39.360]  They were just having a monopoly over an operating system
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:47.200]  This is a monopoly down to what you can say and what you can do and tracking what you do over it and then working with the chai comms again
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:52.720]  That killed five times what hitler did. I mean, this is the most evil regime the planet's ever seen
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:56.880]  It's it's got tentacles into our lives and I think that's what really jumped the shark
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:02.480]  I mean, I agree the president took action when they banned paul watson myself from saying our names and a favorable like that
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:06.480]  That was the next level and they admitted they were doing it when they'd already denied it to the white house
[03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:13.200]  But when last year they told google apple did we're not helping you with ai
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:16.640]  We're moving to china and apple said we're not working with you either
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:19.600]  We're moving to china to be tax exempt when the point that
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:24.320]  Our taxpayers our consumers our DARPA technology make no mistake
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:27.680]  Raise the seed money for microsoft. It's declassified
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:34.480]  The seed money for apple the seed money for google and they're supposed to be subsidiaries that just like the internet
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:40.000]  We invented was supposed to be for freedom globally. Well, they are using that as a weapon now show the
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:42.800]  social contract between the
[03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:48.480]  Pentagon and and and the american government is broken and they thought oh, we've got obama. We've got hillary
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:52.640]  She's going to get in we continue to transfer to china and finishing america off
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:58.560]  Well, guess what the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray it didn't work that way
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:01.440]  So in the middle of your big shanghai scam
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:09.200]  Uh bushwhacking us kidnapping our technology in the middle of the gang rape america woke up on the table
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:14.160]  And you may have a mile of gremlins, you know behind us lined up giving it to us in the keister
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:19.920]  It doesn't matter. We're awake now and there's no putting that giant back to sleep again
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:22.480]  Oh, precisely and that's what's happened across the board
[03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:29.360]  So what what the what this was was you had moller try to take his little shot last week bar responded by doing the cbs interview
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.120]  And it's not a coincidence to the timing the timing is connected to china
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:38.080]  The timing is connected to the censorship bar says i know we're destroyed your command and control system
[03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:41.120]  Is what we built that you've hijacked. That's what we're taking it back
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:44.480]  Exactly as someone told me that worked with bar back during the 70s
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:50.160]  Said that the most important thing to know about bar is he's actually seen deep state operatives taken out
[03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:58.000]  Because he saw the success of the mk ultra exposure the assassination church committee all the frank church committee hearings that exposed all that
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:03.760]  We didn't know about cointel pro until then we know about the scope of what hoover was doing until then and it shows the arrogance
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:10.480]  Of google and apple and facebook that just because they're spying on everybody and just because they have this omni presence
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:13.120]  That we don't have swat teams that will go grab them
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:16.080]  I mean they don't get it still humans still run the planet
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:19.360]  Needle deck and i'm sorry to use that type of term, but that's what it is
[03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:25.200]  They still don't get you're not gonna rake us up and down the coals because you've got a sundar pachai
[03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:30.320]  And we won't arrest a guy with brown skin because let me tell you the intel i got is from meetings with trump
[03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:34.880]  That folks have had is that trump's saying why are they in bed with china?
[03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:39.760]  Why are they giving them all our technology? That's espionage. They should be arrested and you know what people are going?
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.440]  Yeah, actually, that's right
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:45.040]  They've gotten so far out of bounds that they've run a trillion miles
[03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:49.760]  Well, just because a fish runs out 300 yards a line doesn't mean that hooks still ain't their mouth
[03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:53.440]  And so I look i'm not predicting i'm saying it's in the cards
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:58.960]  For espionage indictments for google and apple executives. I know that's being looked at right now
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:03.040]  And that's the clearest way. Let's not even deal with antitrust all this. Let's just arrest their asses
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:06.880]  They gang raped this country with the chai comms. They're the real enemy
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:08.480]  When they committed real crimes
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:13.440]  I mean clearly they committed real crimes in the antitrust context clearly them kick they committed real crimes in the
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:14.880]  The perjury context
[03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:20.000]  I mean they went up in front of congress and lied left and right and their actions over the last 60 days
[03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:25.200]  Confirmed the scope and severity and seriousness of those lies and those lies were not only to suppress speech
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:31.120]  And to dictate what press could speak in america, but it was to meddle in the elections in the 2020 elections
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:35.920]  So they could dictate and determine the outcome for a pro china president to get elected
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:43.120]  Against president trump that would undermine speech press in the united states and impose a chinese social credit model type system
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:47.120]  On the united states social media using private ownership to do it exactly
[03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:50.400]  And i want to be clear when we come back from break and talk about the solutions and the next you to drop
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:53.120]  You've accurately predicted so far or forecast
[03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:56.720]  That be clear here. I'm not an authoritarian. I'm mr. Libertarian
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:03.280]  When big tech that's bigger than most governments with trillions of dollars colludes with media colludes with universities colludes with banks
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:06.880]  Colludes with the chai comms again who are the heavyweight
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:08.640]  champions
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:14.560]  Of the world at killing their own people and the eu and hollywood to demoralize us and they get caught
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:20.320]  They're going to be held accountable. So they want to end our speech arrest us take our bank accounts away
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:25.760]  Well, then it's war and we're not going to do the kind of stuff left to stew like auntie for beating folks up
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:26.880]  We're not violent that way
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:28.640]  We're just going to take the government back
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:31.120]  And then we're going to take your companies away from you in the infrastructure
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:34.000]  And turn it back over to the people and america and the industry
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:38.320]  And if you get in the way of that if you're trying to cut up the chai comms, well, you know, what else is going to happen
[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:48.480]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones

[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  It's like
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  Bob Barnes constitutional lawyer
[03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:29.040]  super successful winning rate on all sorts of cases civil rights, you name it
[03:20:30.240 --> 03:20:32.400]  dialed into both the democrat and republican system
[03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:35.200]  I just want to
[03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:37.680]  Before we get back into news here just take a breath
[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:39.840]  which I never do
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:41.840]  And sit back and just ponder
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:47.200]  Yeah, a lot of us have been beat up and slapped around and some of it hadn't been fun
[03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:49.200]  But we didn't do this
[03:20:49.760 --> 03:20:56.480]  To be a bunch of candy asses that just care about our fancy car and you know how great shape we're in and we're just avoiding conflict
[03:20:56.480 --> 03:21:00.960]  I'm not looking for conflict, but if I need to have it for the right thing to happen
[03:21:01.280 --> 03:21:07.920]  Then I do love it. It's kind of that alchemy if I'm looking for a fight, but as soon as fists are flying man, I'm like a pig and you know what?
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:11.200]  So we're here right now
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:14.320]  With the border trying to be collapsed with the federal reserve
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:17.360]  It's private trying to implode the economy with foreign governments
[03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:22.240]  Literally attacking us every front with communist china seeing our war against us shooting at our ships
[03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:25.920]  We have hollywood the left trying to undermine the country saying it sucks
[03:21:26.640 --> 03:21:31.520]  We're in a war that when people look back folks. This is a new world war. It's a 21st century war
[03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:34.640]  And it's even being called that now
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:41.040]  And so it's not that trump's perfect or info wars is perfect or that bob barns is perfect or that bill bars perfect
[03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:48.080]  It's that we don't want civil war. We don't want physical world war 3 and we just want to stabilize and have a good society in the system
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:51.120]  And we believe in free speech
[03:21:51.120 --> 03:21:57.920]  And to see the other news we're going to cover next segment with pedophiles that Muller has been protecting that we talked about being busted
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:00.960]  Indicted today. We told you this was coming
[03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:04.480]  But getting back to the justice department
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:12.720]  But getting back to the justice department preparing for antitrust action against apple when they are one of the most guilty grips out there
[03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:16.240]  Probably even more guilty than than google. You can correct me if you think i'm wrong
[03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:22.480]  And our own antitrust actions we've been preparing just shows us the perfect season for all this. We can't get to that yet
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:26.640]  Just how big this is because
[03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:30.000]  I remember I sent you a story about it three weeks ago and I covered it here on eram
[03:22:30.800 --> 03:22:32.480]  the
[03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:35.920]  leftist slash neocon establishment publication
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:38.880]  Atlantic monthly that kind of exists just to communicate with the establishment
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:41.760]  to insider publication
[03:22:41.760 --> 03:22:47.920]  You know just it had this neocon in there saying oh, don't worry. Trump will never actually go after any big tech
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:51.280]  It's all talk. He's a joke. Well, I made sure that got sent to the white house
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:56.400]  And by the way a day later they changed the headline. I'm sure others sent to the white house
[03:22:57.360 --> 03:23:00.720]  Because they're all telling trump. They're not doing it in these articles. They admit they're doing it
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:04.000]  So I would folks to know if you're not thinking
[03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:07.200]  God
[03:23:07.440 --> 03:23:09.440]  And sweet little baby jesus
[03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:13.520]  For what's happening you better at least thank your lucky stars because
[03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:19.600]  If hillary was in and I'll get your take on this in a moment. How bad would it be now? There wouldn't be any antitrust
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:23.200]  That's why they were so cocksure. We'll talk about if hillary got in next segment
[03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:27.200]  But bob we don't have committee meetings. We don't agree with each other before we go on air together
[03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:31.440]  So I don't know what your view overall is on this, but how do you quantify this epic moment?
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:34.560]  We're in and what trump's doing. This is exactly what he had to do
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:38.800]  And their stocks are plunging hundreds of billions as we speak which we don't want
[03:23:38.880 --> 03:23:42.480]  But you know if they want to wreck our freedom and keep us captive then, you know, it's a war
[03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:46.160]  They're gonna get it and the left keeps saying hey, this could hurt the economy. They tell barb
[03:23:47.200 --> 03:23:53.440]  Or burr, uh bill burr, you know, you could get uh, uh hurt in this. He's like, oh, that's fine. We all die
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:57.200]  So so this is this is a time of real conflict
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:00.880]  Oh, well, this is a crossroads that was going to determine whether we went down the
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:07.280]  Chinese social credit model system of a sort of corporateist status approach which controls thoughts controls ideas
[03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:10.720]  Controls speech controls press dictates where people can believe
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:16.080]  Surveys them invades their privacy routinely and regularly whether that's the model of a society
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:22.080]  We're going to live in in a digital age in which the digital square is the digital public square is the public square
[03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:25.760]  The digital space is where most people spend their time and live their lives
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:29.600]  I just talked with three minutes and I was gonna give you four, but I've got to stop you because you're saying so epic
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:34.240]  I want this one. I'm saying I want to just stop at this moment of history. We're at a fork road
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:37.040]  we're at a crossroads and
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:40.960]  Trump and america and the world are starting to take the right turn
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:46.080]  Do you agree? This is really wonderful is what I'm saying. Thank god. It was fundamental. It was critical. It was defining
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:48.960]  It was going to be we were already on that other wrong path
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:53.280]  And we would have stayed on that path unless the president took dramatic action and there has been calls
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:57.200]  If we go back to the exactly dramatic attacks means dramatic action
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:24:57.760]  Exactly
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:25:00.320]  It's what we were talking about about a month or two months ago
[03:25:00.560 --> 03:25:04.720]  When we had the emergency broadcast after the pay they went in message to the president
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:09.440]  Exactly the message was use the FTC use the FCC use the Department of Justice
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:15.520]  And if you want to use real power use the antitrust technique that all of those different departments have in different respects
[03:25:15.520 --> 03:25:21.600]  FTC has it in certain areas. SEC has it in other areas. The the Department of Justice has the most powerful tool
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:25.200]  And that's precisely what's happened and he's launching it against everybody
[03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:32.640]  Everywhere across the board that has been involved in this manipulation of our public square to monopolize speech
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:35.920]  In a way that favors politically protected privilege groups
[03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:40.800]  And that's how freedom always works is good people aren't looking for power. They're not really paying attention until things get dire
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:43.040]  But the growth curve the learning curve is
[03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:48.320]  90 percent of the time is just getting up to speed but boom the last 10 percent of the time we ripped their head off politically
[03:25:48.640 --> 03:25:50.240]  You look at the
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:54.400]  junior senator from Missouri and everybody else they understand what's happening
[03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:59.200]  And there's an explosive move now by the pentagon everybody else to go my god
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:05.360]  You actually allied with the chai comms to end freedom and put a bunch of leftist prepared brainwashed hordes
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:07.600]  You've been training for 20 years in charge
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:11.520]  The pentagon particularly now gets this is a military takeover
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:14.240]  And so it's over all your ai all your crap
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:17.440]  It isn't going to work because now you didn't get it finished
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:23.040]  Humat is now going to take back control exactly. I mean I had the privilege of talking to senator holly
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:25.120]  Who's the new senator from Missouri?
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:28.640]  Back up at cpac and he understood all these is he not amazing
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:29.600]  Oh exceptional
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:35.520]  He and he's been leading the political fight in the senate in congress for the president to take the exact actions
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:39.440]  The president has taken he provided the cover from the legislative sphere
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:42.080]  So the president could take the actions that were needed and necessary
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:46.160]  Which is now being taken by attorney general bar and general bar is a real general
[03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:52.000]  And he's taking command of the law and using the law to equalize the playing field to bring these monopolies to heal
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:53.200]  To break them up
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:58.160]  It's it's the equivalent of like when when putin came in in russia and he broke up the oligarchic control
[03:26:58.400 --> 03:27:04.160]  Which nobody thought could happen to replay that it is and it had to happen because we had our own overlords
[03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:10.960]  Our own oligarchs dictating the future of our economy our society and our politics and that's why that's the trump card
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:14.560]  Even for some of the old bush establishment people is wait a minute
[03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:16.960]  We really are basically under the control of chai comms
[03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:23.360]  And we really have a group of people like aoc that says brock cauliflower's racist and then america sucks
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:27.520]  We got it. This is cancer. We can't play games anymore. Oh, no doubt
[03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:31.360]  There was someone wanting to control this fear and have people only think what they wanted them to think
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:35.280]  Hear what they wanted to hear say what they wanted to say and they just went too far
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:41.280]  And they went so far that the president they gave the president the political cover to act to where people were waiting for this
[03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:44.960]  People were calling for this people needed this and doing this is going to
[03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:52.080]  revolutionize and change the future and change the future in a way that brings the american imprint the american footprint the american blueprint
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:59.920]  Into the future into the 21st century into the 22nd century that protects it and promotes it which totally trumps the chai comm slave model
[03:27:59.920 --> 03:28:07.200]  Exactly. It's totally opposite the corporateist status control oriented. It's about independent thought independent ideas independent press
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:13.120]  Independent speech independent political action of an independent audience who controls the news and views that they get to hear
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.360]  Say and speak and that's what the president is
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:19.920]  Is making happen and making continue to happen by taking the antitrust actions
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:23.840]  He's taken if he hadn't we would be in a perilous position for our american future

[03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:11.120]  It's info wars broadcasting worldwide
[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:17.840]  The juniors senator from missouri's been knocking out of the park former pretty general that state. He was the first state to sue google
[03:33:17.840 --> 03:33:21.840]  Well, I remember a few months ago. He knocks it out of the park
[03:33:22.560 --> 03:33:24.320]  I'm talking to the
[03:33:24.320 --> 03:33:27.680]  Head of the defense department and the chairman of the joint chiefs. He brought up
[03:33:28.320 --> 03:33:32.000]  Google and said they're inadvertently working with china and the chairman says no
[03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:40.000]  They're actively working with china. Well, that's the final straw by the sjw is that are so imprinted on hating america
[03:33:40.480 --> 03:33:42.320]  Even though google was born here
[03:33:42.320 --> 03:33:45.360]  They're in bed and in league with the authoritarians in china
[03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:47.600]  What a dirty group of leftists here it is
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:52.240]  Let me just shift and ask about
[03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:59.760]  Our challenge in emerging technologies cyber and space in particular china's investment in those areas and our
[03:34:00.400 --> 03:34:01.920]  Eroding advantage
[03:34:01.920 --> 03:34:03.920]  I was struck, uh, mr. Secretary
[03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:07.600]  By a comment that you make in your written testimony
[03:34:08.080 --> 03:34:14.320]  You say some u.s. Companies have voiced ethical qualms about working with dod to develop advanced technology
[03:34:14.320 --> 03:34:21.360]  In some cases even terminating relationships often while continuing to work with china. What are we talking about here?
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:24.560]  I think we're talking about google
[03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:27.680]  And their support to china
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.640]  And their lack of supports the department of defense
[03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:36.480]  So google has refused to work with the department of defense actually was under contract
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:39.680]  Weren't they with the department of defense tells us about that? Well, they haven't refused
[03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:45.040]  They just have said they're not going to continue to do business with the department of defense on certain contracts
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:50.800]  But they are doing business in china in a way that benefits. You're saying our chinese competitors
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:53.200]  Correct. They say more about that
[03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:56.320]  Well the interesting thing and this is
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:58.720]  Why china is
[03:34:58.720 --> 03:35:00.960]  This is such an important issue for our country
[03:35:01.680 --> 03:35:05.360]  You know the the fusion of commercial business
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:08.240]  with military
[03:35:08.240 --> 03:35:10.240]  Is significant
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:16.080]  Five billion dollars of five trillion dollars of their economy is state-owned enterprises. So
[03:35:16.720 --> 03:35:20.240]  The technology that is developed in the civil world
[03:35:21.200 --> 03:35:23.360]  Transfers to the military world
[03:35:24.160 --> 03:35:26.160]  It's a direct pipeline
[03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:30.000]  Not only is there a transfer. There's also
[03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:32.800]  systemic theft
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:39.200]  Of us technology that also that facilitates even faster development of emerging technology
[03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:42.240]  So I just want to make sure that I understand
[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:47.040]  Exactly what you're saying. You're telling me that google and american company supposedly
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:51.280]  Is refusing to work with the department of defense
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:54.160]  But is doing work in china with china in china
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:58.720]  In a way that at least indirectly benefits the chinese government. Is that correct?
[03:35:58.720 --> 03:36:03.600]  I haven't heard the word refuse, but there's a lack of willingness
[03:36:04.800 --> 03:36:06.800]  To support do d programs
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:09.120]  General you're nodding your head. Do you want to weigh in on this?
[03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:10.400]  No center
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:16.720]  I'm nodding your head on exactly the point that you made that the the work that google is doing in china is direct
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:19.920]  Is indirectly benefiting the chinese military
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:23.760]  And and i've been very public on this issue as well
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:30.960]  In fact the way I described it to our industry partners is look where the good guys in the in the values that we represent
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:36.480]  In the in the system that we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive
[03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:41.920]  And and that's the way I've characterized. So I I was just nodding that what the secretary was articulating
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:46.880]  Is a general sense of all of us as leaders and we watch with great concern when industry partners
[03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:52.160]  Work in china knowing that there is that indirect benefit in fact frankly indirect maybe
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:55.680]  Uh, maybe not a full characterization of the way it really is
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:36:58.240]  It's more of a direct benefit to the chinese military
[03:36:58.640 --> 03:37:04.480]  So he he said they don't want to crash this top market, but they're like it's not indirect. They've merged with it. No one explained
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:10.880]  They took DARPA ai technology, which is still dangerous as hell and the pentagon better be careful
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:13.040]  We all better be careful for our kids. Okay
[03:37:14.720 --> 03:37:16.160]  But the chai comms
[03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:23.760]  20 years ago had cows that produced human milk and spiders that created body armor were part goat. I mean they have no bottom
[03:37:24.320 --> 03:37:27.040]  Political this is being murdered millions of people in death camps
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:31.760]  It's it's insane. They have no bottom. They have no morals. They have no nothing
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:35.600]  They have no they they dump toxic waste right in the rivers. They do it all
[03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:37.520]  and
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:42.080]  Google has gone over there and the equivalent has put their legs behind their ears. Okay
[03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:47.520]  And so quite frankly this is not enough of the senator not enough
[03:37:48.080 --> 03:37:52.480]  Of of dumford not enough of shanahan. Your response is
[03:37:53.120 --> 03:37:57.360]  Anemic and I'm not saying that that I'm trying to piss on you and saying you're weak and stupid
[03:37:57.920 --> 03:38:02.640]  When our technology and everything we built and done is handed over to chai comms
[03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:08.880]  And then our government lets media rape pro-american voices. Holy hell
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:12.640]  Do you want us to get our rifles? And I'm not doing that at this point
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:15.040]  I'm not calling for that, but jesus
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:17.520]  And I mean that respectful way
[03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:20.480]  Please give us guidance because we're in dangerous waters
[03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:28.480]  No doubt in in fact, I mean they clearly were trying to soft pedal the severity and the seriousness of what senator holly was discussing
[03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:34.240]  It's total treason completely what you have is it may not like the legal definition of treason is very limited
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:40.240]  So often it comes under this espionage. What does it it's usually espionage or sedition or it comes under those statutory guidelines
[03:38:40.400 --> 03:38:45.440]  And there's criminal transfer things that the criminal transfer there's contracts on everything they were given by darpa
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:53.200]  Correct. Oh, exactly. And and those components where they're sharing information in a way that violates us law puts us national security at risk
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:56.960]  Is one thing but then to leverage that to try to impose a
[03:38:57.360 --> 03:39:03.760]  Chinese social credit style system on us public discussion and us public debate of us citizens
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:10.160]  In order to meddle in us elections was was the last step as you said it's now mainstream news what you said six months ago
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:15.600]  The chai comms are working with big tech when the same social score to control us. It's here
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:20.960]  Exactly. You have people like professor robert eppstein who's a very leftist professor to the left
[03:39:21.200 --> 03:39:26.880]  But he documented and detailed the way in which google can just do slight changes in their algorithms
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:29.040]  Manipulate in in metal in elections
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:36.080]  And now when you do that when you combine the chinese social credit model system, which is tracking people using its surveillance mechanism to
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:39.200]  Say hey, these are disfavored people and here's where they're at
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:44.640]  Here's where these blacklisted people are getting together when you're doing those kind of activities ways that for example
[03:39:44.640 --> 03:39:47.440]  And t for other groups could target dissident individuals
[03:39:47.680 --> 03:39:53.600]  You're encouraging incentivizing a political structure that is precarious to the fundamental american freedoms
[03:39:53.760 --> 03:39:57.040]  And let me ask you this and we're gonna do one more segment. You got to go catch your plane a minute
[03:39:57.040 --> 03:40:01.520]  Uh, and we're gonna be airing this in the fourth hour tomorrow. Paul Watson's on vacation
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:04.240]  but
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:07.360]  What is the mindset of google
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:11.520]  To say we don't work with the u.s. Government, but we work with china
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:16.800]  I guess because they're not white that they're good. It's it's sjw to a level
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:19.680]  I mean it's just so reckless and they didn't think
[03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:23.360]  That the u.s. Government would finally in some sectors wake up
[03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:26.080]  When it's one thing to sell out to china, but to then
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:33.600]  Throw their home country to the wolves. Don't they know this was gonna happen. I mean this is what should have happened
[03:40:33.840 --> 03:40:38.320]  Thank god they're moving with antitrust and all this but I just can't believe that they're this crazy
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:43.600]  It's a combination of the leftist who embraced the statism of china with the neo liberals
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:50.960]  Who embraced the corporatism of china with the neo conservatives who are willing to sell out american interests for for a few foreign dollars
[03:40:50.960 --> 03:40:56.400]  And you combine those three and you get how the ideological impetus was driven so that these big tech
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:03.680]  Megalop monopolies not only monopolies, but overlords and really only they're mega oppolish mega monopolies
[03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:08.400]  Because they're all like they're they're they're monopolies that form oligopolies that have formed a mega oppoly
[03:41:08.720 --> 03:41:15.600]  Precise because when you've got thousands of companies under one company like uh, facebook or google has done that is a mega
[03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:21.120]  Monopoly mega mega. It's like the you know those old cartoons where they put all the big trust together and how they're orchestrating and
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:24.880]  Puppeting the rest of political life. That's what this was but it was this times 10
[03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:27.840]  The railroads could never even have imagined this kind of power
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:33.440]  Hoover could have never even imagined this kind of power and the fact that they were in bed with deep state operatives and in bay
[03:41:33.680 --> 03:41:36.560]  And in bed with the china and out of the gates they start abusing it
[03:41:37.120 --> 03:41:42.640]  Exactly, oh and wouldn't stop and we're willing to do it to the existing president of the united states
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:44.400]  By the way, you know what I knew
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:46.560]  Just last year. I went and screamed at sundar pacai
[03:41:47.280 --> 03:41:50.800]  They had a google and I said you're a trader. You're a piece of crap. He freaked out went the wrong door
[03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:54.560]  The police were having heart but after he went in they said thank you sir. We agree screw him
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:58.640]  Yeah, and it was it was like congressmen the center's like nodding their heads and oh, yeah, you're right
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:01.520]  I mean that's how much they knew google was a trader even then
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:07.680]  Exactly and that they'd been doing it repeatedly routinely and then their aggressivity was only uh, uh escalating
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:11.840]  I mean here's somebody that sits in front of congress and just lies about very basic information
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:18.800]  It's proven to be perjury within a year of his testimony. I mean it's just it revealed a brazenness that people like senator holly recognized
[03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:26.720]  posed an imminent threat to american security american safety and american freedom, but but you it's kind of like the chairman of the joint chief said
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:33.360]  America let you have all this freedom and do this and you're running under the black wings of the chai comps
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:39.120]  Why are you why you should know they'll just take you over like they've already done? Why would you do that?
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:46.240]  Why would you do that to america when more values are undoubtedly a thousand times better than the chai comps one more segment

[03:45:55.360 --> 03:46:00.080]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night. So I had half the turbo force this morning
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:02.080]  The dude
[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:57.920]  And get the fish oil.
[03:46:57.920 --> 03:47:07.920]  Or listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:46.920]  That's in the last system.
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:50.920]  The American system has delivered more wealth for the average person than the other system.
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:53.920]  In the 50s we had half the world's wealth, 4% of the population.
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:47:55.920]  The globalist came here and they took us over.
[03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:57.920]  I'm not an authoritarian, I'm a libertarian.
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:00.920]  And I would guess that postulate you call yourself a classical American.
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:02.920]  I think that's a good way to describe it.
[03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:04.920]  It's not that I want war with the Chinese.
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:09.920]  It's not that I want the Justice Department to go out and attack everybody and take stuff over.
[03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:15.920]  But Google and Facebook and Apple are already running slave farms.
[03:48:15.920 --> 03:48:23.920]  They're already saying we don't have speech and roosters up on hilltops bragging about it.
[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:26.920]  They're already pushing anti-human, anti-American agendas.
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:31.920]  So, there's a point that once the war starts, people become barbarous.
[03:48:31.920 --> 03:48:34.920]  And if our establishment acted like this, I'd be against them.
[03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:37.920]  In fact, I've been against neocons and Rainline Democrats.
[03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:40.920]  But I see, you know, I've been against them.
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:45.920]  If I acted like this, I'd be against them. In fact, I've been against neocons and Rainline Democrats.
[03:48:45.920 --> 03:48:55.920]  But I see in Trump a real Americana vein of populism and of prosperity and of standing against the system
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:48:59.920]  and a real sea change, not just here, but around the world, there's a hunger.
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:02.920]  And again, it doesn't mean he's Jesus Christ.
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:04.920]  It doesn't mean he's perfect. None of us are.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:09.920]  But the fact that he means well is the signal that scared the establishment so much.
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:14.920]  No doubt. And the thing was, he laid out for them for years, including after he got elected, what needed to happen.
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:17.920]  They needed to shift jobs back here to the United States.
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:24.920]  They needed to protect U.S. technology that was largely supported by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. universities,
[03:49:24.920 --> 03:49:29.920]  developed here in the United States with special legal immunities like Section 230,
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:33.920]  special subsidies and various forms and federal funding and federal contracts.
[03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:38.920]  They needed to keep intellectual property here, protect and promote it here, bring jobs back here.
[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:44.920]  They needed to pass the tax bill that was designed so they bring revenues and monies that they had stashed offshore
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:49.920]  back into the United States for investment in the United States to improve the liquidity of the banks,
[03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:54.920]  to improve lending to small businesses, to improve wages for ordinary workers.
[03:49:54.920 --> 03:50:00.920]  And they needed to not use their platform in a way that manipulated speech, monopolized speech,
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:06.920]  to try to use their platform access to become a publisher controlling, censoring and editorializing
[03:50:06.920 --> 03:50:10.920]  what opinions people could have, what press could exist, what press are allowed to listen to,
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:14.920]  what candidates are allowed to support. And they just decided to ignore all of it.
[03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:17.920]  They're like, screw it. We're not going to do business with the U.S. Department of Defense.
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:20.920]  We're not going to protect trade secrets here in the United States.
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:21.920]  This is called megalomanium.
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:26.920]  It is. It's the mega monopolies led to megalomania.
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:32.920]  And it led to a madness that was endangering every level of American freedom in terms of American security.
[03:50:32.920 --> 03:50:36.920]  The globalists know, they're smart enough to know, even if they're bad people on them,
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:40.920]  you're on a collision course with billions of people that aren't going to give in,
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:45.920]  so expanding on this in these final stories in the shower.
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:49.920]  I have been at public events before we protested Beto,
[03:50:49.920 --> 03:50:53.920]  and I was at a local restaurant bar having dinner before he wasn't going to speak until 10.
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:50:57.920]  So we were there like nine o'clock having a quick bite to eat and a few drinks.
[03:50:57.920 --> 03:51:03.920]  And I had people that worked at Google, even had their badges and showed me, waddle over and they go,
[03:51:03.920 --> 03:51:06.920]  doesn't matter what you think, you're of the past, you're defeated.
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:11.920]  Well, I understand you're crushing, you know, but just for the greater good of what we're doing in our master plan.
[03:51:11.920 --> 03:51:16.920]  And I was like, they were like 25, 30 year old college graduates who, you know, I said, how much you paid?
[03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:20.920]  It was like $200,000 a year and stuff, you know, people with insurance degrees don't get that.
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:25.920]  But they were the new arrogant acolytes that are just a placeholder before AI takes over.
[03:51:25.920 --> 03:51:31.920]  But then even the bar manager saw me talking to them at the restaurant 30 minutes in and threw us out.
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:36.920]  And then even the little Google people kind of went, okay, see, we're in charge now.
[03:51:36.920 --> 03:51:42.920]  They had no idea how authoritarian they were or how ridiculous they were or the type of pushback they get.
[03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:46.920]  And I wasn't mad when I was thrown out of the restaurant because they I finally talked to them.
[03:51:46.920 --> 03:51:47.920]  They saw who I was.
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:50.920]  And oh my God, it's all shows getting out of before we have a disturbance.
[03:51:50.920 --> 03:51:54.920]  It was the entitlement that you see like of Queen Elizabeth II.
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:51:59.920]  Well, she's actually Queen Elizabeth II in her family conquered Europe and everything else.
[03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:00.920]  And she's still evil and bad.
[03:52:00.920 --> 03:52:01.920]  We don't like her.
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:06.920]  But it's like they're these nothings that have like this royal entitlement.
[03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:12.920]  And basically they were foreseeing a future where they wanted people to go along with a matrix type existence,
[03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:16.920]  where they were celebrating artificial intelligence that would replace ordinary labor,
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:21.920]  that would replace people's thoughts that creating algorithms that would monopolize and cult.
[03:52:21.920 --> 03:52:22.920]  Absolutely.
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:26.920]  It was it was you would just hook up to the machine, do what the machine told you to do,
[03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:31.920]  dumb you down, just appreciate the entertainment that the machines provided.
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:32.920]  And that was it.
[03:52:32.920 --> 03:52:36.920]  And you were just there to consume their selected entertainment and nothing else.
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:37.920]  I think now is the point.
[03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:39.920]  Humanity that's been caught.
[03:52:39.920 --> 03:52:43.920]  It's gays caught in its spell for a while.
[03:52:43.920 --> 03:52:45.920]  I think we're breaking the spell and making a turn.
[03:52:45.920 --> 03:52:46.920]  Exactly.
[03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:48.920]  It's returning back to the value of real labor, the value of independent thought,
[03:52:48.920 --> 03:52:51.920]  the value of independent speech, the value of independent ideas,
[03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:54.920]  the value of the value of a real woman and not porn.
[03:52:54.920 --> 03:52:55.920]  Oh, exactly.
[03:52:55.920 --> 03:52:58.920]  The value of an independent economy where people interact.
[03:52:58.920 --> 03:53:04.920]  Like you look at the Infowars model where Americans produce things that are good for people that people buy directly,
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:11.920]  that support in a little D democratizing economic structure to support a democratizing press and speech structure.
[03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:16.920]  That is completely counter this AI global sort of monopolies.
[03:53:16.920 --> 03:53:21.920]  Because the AI tells you what to buy and the four minutes we have left only to this whole thing with Mueller and huge developments.
[03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:25.920]  Briefly, I've only had two hit t-shirts over the years.
[03:53:25.920 --> 03:53:27.920]  Hillary for president and the Obama Joker.
[03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:32.920]  And we got a lot of them out there and they spread the word and the president paid attention.
[03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:37.920]  This new one that I basically designed, I wore an official master shirt on Joe Rogan's show was so popular.
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:40.920]  So I said, make it a red, white and blue American flag on the right hand shoulder.
[03:53:40.920 --> 03:53:41.920]  Beautiful.
[03:53:41.920 --> 03:53:47.920]  And then do a space force established 2017, 1776.
[03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:50.920]  So this is an asset design upgraded by us.
[03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:53.920]  Infowars.com under the American flag, red, white and blue.
[03:53:53.920 --> 03:53:56.920]  And your purchase of this funds the operation.
[03:53:56.920 --> 03:54:00.920]  Now, you can get it for $29.95 right now.
[03:54:00.920 --> 03:54:02.920]  It costs us like over 10 bucks for the shirt and then the credit.
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:05.920]  It's a very nice, soft, expensive, made American shirt.
[03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:09.920]  But starting today, they haven't updated it yet.
[03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:15.920]  We're going to have it for 33% off or $19.95, which means we make like six, seven bucks on it.
[03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:16.920]  That's okay.
[03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:18.920]  I just want to flood the world with the shirt.
[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:23.920]  It's about humanity going to the stars, a human future, love in America, love and freedom.
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:25.920]  The globalists hate a pro human future.
[03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:27.920]  We go to space to save the earth folks.
[03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:30.920]  Get the space for a shirt at infowars.com.
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:32.920]  I had a feeling it'd be a hit.
[03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:35.920]  The shirts are coming in tomorrow on an 18 wheeler.
[03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:37.920]  Preorders are already record level for the shirt.
[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:40.920]  So be the first to get it, infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:41.920]  Okay.
[03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:48.920]  Getting into Key Muller figure, George Nader, charged with transporting child porn.
[03:54:48.920 --> 03:54:51.920]  In the three months we have, right now, it's really going on there.
[03:54:51.920 --> 03:54:52.920]  Sure.
[03:54:52.920 --> 03:54:53.920]  So this is a guy.
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:59.920]  Muller has a long history of using as his informants people that are involved in child pornography in one way, shape, or form or another.
[03:54:59.920 --> 03:55:06.920]  This goes back to the Asimov case and the unusual handling of it when he was the United States attorney for the Northern District of California.
[03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:14.920]  That somehow led to him being elevated to the FBI director within months of him settling that case in a very unusual terms.
[03:55:14.920 --> 03:55:16.920]  Then came the Epstein case.
[03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:29.920]  Epstein ended up being listed and identified as another informative Mueller that allowed Mueller to develop at least potentially blacklist against high profile individuals that gave him more political power and juice for to do the deep state bidding and business.
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:41.920]  And now what you had is during the Mueller investigation, he used George Nader, a sort of mid tier lobbyist who runs in sort of MIDI circles and questionable other political and legal and financial circles had Clinton ties back in the day.
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:45.920]  They tried to tie him to Trump when he had no meaningful ties to Trump.
[03:55:45.920 --> 03:55:58.920]  And Mueller was trying to get him to give false information against Trump and in exchange was delaying or it appeared immunizing him from criminal prosecution for additional child pornography that Nader was involved in.
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:11.920]  Well, as soon as they've shut down Nader within a week, less than a week after Mueller fully retires and resigns from his position, they go back in and do what should have been done all along and indict Nader for his involvement in child pornography.
[03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:13.920]  So this is critical and essential.
[03:56:13.920 --> 03:56:31.920]  It's again the president making clear and Attorney General Barr making clear that these deep state coup attempts against the elected president United States to undermine him in the entire spy gate scandal, which involved Brennan and Comey and Clapper and McCabe and other individuals in high ranking positions in the Obama Shadow
[03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:48.920]  government in the early stages of the Trump presidency, undermining his presidency, undermining the democracy that elected him, undermining the institutions that disfavor war and wanted to propagate conflicts in Libya and everywhere else in Syria and Venezuela and Ukraine and other places where it's unnecessary to have US troops present.
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:52.920]  Those efforts to undermine the elected president have come to an end.
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:57:00.920]  Not only is Mueller over, but all of Mueller's covering up for these people involved in sleazy industries like the child porn industry is going to also come to an end.
[03:57:00.920 --> 03:57:04.920]  But he's clearly been using this to compromise people for the Clintons and others.
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:12.920]  That's their speciality with Harvey Weinstein and Loretta Express and Jeffrey Epstein, and it's all coming out just like we told you.
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:18.920]  And this happening this week is a real shine that Trump is on the beautiful war path.
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:36.920]  Exactly. The J. Edgar Hoover model that James Comey and Robert Mueller tried to instate at the Federal Bureau of Investigation is over, and it's going to return the FBI to its lawful law enforcement roots, return the CIA to its lawful orientation, return big tech to being disciplined under the guidance and governance of America.

[03:58:42.920 --> 03:59:00.920]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:59:00.920 --> 03:59:20.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:59:20.920 --> 03:59:34.920]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:59:34.920 --> 03:59:51.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
