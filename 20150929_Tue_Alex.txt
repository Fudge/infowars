[00:29.600 --> 00:36.320]  175 at a rate of one every two days many had hoped that new Saudi King Solomon would have
[00:36.320 --> 00:43.360]  diminished the brutality instead he has accelerated it the independent reports the kingdom killed 102
[00:43.360 --> 00:47.840]  convicted criminals in the first six months of 2015 alone putting it on course to beat
[00:47.840 --> 00:54.240]  its 1995 record number for the calendar year of 192 those killed included children under the age
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.800]  of 18 at the time of the offense and disabled people in fact the numbers have climbed to such a
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.800]  high level the Saudis have placed a job posting for eight new execution 20% of those that faced
[01:04.800 --> 01:11.040]  the executioner's blade were due to drug offenses adultery witchcraft and of course sorcery many
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.640]  of those executed are not given legal representation and confessed to their crimes after breaking
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.760]  under torture the bodies of the executed are regularly displayed in public squares where
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.400]  the corpse is tied to a bag with the head of the violator inside of it something the United

[01:37.280 --> 01:42.720]  regime when he was just 17 years old well then America and the rest of the representatives
[01:42.720 --> 01:48.480]  of the modern world must be furious with Saudi government for these blatant displays of medieval

[01:55.200 --> 02:01.680]  Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner responded with enthusiasm Toner said we would welcome it
[02:01.680 --> 02:08.160]  we're close allies close allies according to witness testimony to the classified 28 pages of
[02:08.160 --> 02:15.200]  the 9-11 report ladies and gentlemen the Saudi government runs out ISIS runs al Qaeda does that
[02:15.200 --> 02:20.960]  mean that sometimes he's gripped on attack Saudi Arabia to demand more goodies and more power and
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.040]  more weapons absolutely but that's the real problem there it is the New York Times convicted
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.320]  terrorists claim Saudis funded al Qaeda and knew of plots down Air Force one it's in the 28 pages
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.960]  the Saudi Arabia was running the hijackers and they were in Saudi intelligence yeah but let's go
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.040]  further than that under Clinton and Bush they protected those hijackers when the FBI tried to
[02:43.040 --> 02:49.040]  stop them when they were training when people at the flight schools were suspicious but what
[02:49.040 --> 02:56.000]  about how at least five of the 19 trained at US military bases and we're given spy training
[02:56.880 --> 03:01.520]  the head of the defense language school colonel Stephen Butler went public a week after 9-11

[03:54.160 --> 03:59.280]  that has experienced exponential war crimes undertaken by Saudi Arabia and supported by the
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.720]  United States in a related report on British arms sales Robert Perkins wrote Yemen is the worst
[04:04.720 --> 04:09.760]  country for civilian deaths and injuries from explosive weapon use in the first seven months
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.120]  of 2015 the Saudi government has been very elusive with the evidence connecting them to the bank
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.160]  rolling of ISIS it has officially condemned the Islamic state along with al-Nusra the Muslim
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.680]  Brotherhood Yemen's Houthi rebels and Saudi Hezbollah wealthy Saudi and Qatari citizens however

[04:49.600 --> 04:55.200]  comes from Sunni elites located in Saudi Arabia Kuwait and the Gulf states countries that are
[04:55.200 --> 05:02.960]  ostensibly us allies john bound for info wars dot com who do you prefer barack obama or george
[05:02.960 --> 05:09.760]  w bush well if you haven't figured it out by now these guys are corporate spokesmen they're not

[05:41.200 --> 05:48.240]  and your choice between the two parties is a myth because in reality it is a two-party tyranny with

[08:42.080 --> 08:48.400]  sunday broadcast i'm your host alex jones no guest today it's going to be tons of news video audio
[08:48.400 --> 08:57.680]  clips scientific discoveries police state developments economic upheavals it's all coming up today
[08:58.640 --> 09:05.120]  and of course we're going to have open phones there is a drudge report headline new world order
[09:05.120 --> 09:15.520]  putin outsmarts obama and i have been scanning over the editorial piece out of the new york post
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.720]  and i agree with part of it but not with some of the other parts and at the bottom of the hour
[09:20.720 --> 09:27.920]  i'm going to go over some of this article claiming that obama's naive obama's from the 1950s
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.640]  obama's trying to be friendly to russia and russia is being decisive and knows what it's doing
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.440]  russia is on the verge of economic collapse russia is under massive economic warfare russia
[09:41.440 --> 09:49.840]  is surrounded by jihad al-qaeda forces funded by the west russia is fighting for its life
[09:50.560 --> 09:53.200]  and has continued to put its hand out to the west
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.920]  but if you look at the photo it's obama trying to shake the hand of putin and it looks as if
[10:01.920 --> 10:09.120]  putin is refusing when it's russia that's been thrown out of the g8 it's russia that's been
[10:09.120 --> 10:15.120]  thrown out of the g20 it's russia that is seeing oil prices brought down to bankrupt them
[10:16.400 --> 10:23.760]  and by no means is russia some sweety cake perfect pantheon of grace and innocence and
[10:23.760 --> 10:31.680]  law-abiding love but compared to the anglo-america new world order technocratic eugenics-based
[10:31.680 --> 10:40.880]  transhumanist world government pushers russia is just good old-fashioned mafia style government
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.800]  so at the bottom of the hour i will break down that report of all these stories just just look at
[10:48.800 --> 10:57.760]  this one from biz pack review it's up on info wars dot com school goes into lockdown after student
[10:57.760 --> 11:05.200]  displays confederate flag on backpack so now they've gone from somebody's got a gun or a knife to
[11:05.200 --> 11:18.080]  lock down to the children screamed in fear they had seen the symbol of evil they had seen the symbol
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.200]  of the south the confederate battle flag they didn't know what it meant they didn't know it was a
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.800]  scottish christian symbol they didn't know that it had nothing to do with slavery all they knew
[11:28.800 --> 11:35.600]  was the mainstream media had told them it was a sign of great evil and to add to the hysterical
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.680]  religious experience the school was locked down for hours and armed police ran through the halls
[11:42.640 --> 11:49.440]  children were then suspended three of them one wearing the flag others that were collaborators
[11:49.440 --> 11:57.120]  in the criminal acts school goes into lockdown after student displays confederate flag on backpack
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.320]  i've never flown the confederate battle flag of robert e lee but i'm tempted to because
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.160]  you've got a counter this type of brainwashing just like when they try to ban guns or have all
[12:14.160 --> 12:19.360]  these hollywood movies have cops pull people over in texas and say you got a rifle in your
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.760]  car you're going to jail that's illegal that's an almost every cop show every drama even though
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.800]  that's not the law they'll show that to create the perception so your neighbor calls the police on
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.960]  you when they see you putting a deer rifle in your car and so folks engaging in concealed
[12:34.960 --> 12:41.920]  carry have been protecting society and lowering crime rates but open carry has been actively
[12:41.920 --> 12:48.080]  promoting the idea that our guns aren't illegal and have been showing the sheeple that and countering
[12:48.080 --> 12:55.680]  the brainwashing and it's just as important of a civil rights human rights god-given move as
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.320]  rosa parks sitting at the front of the bus or folks trying to eat at lunch counters where
[13:00.320 --> 13:06.640]  they've been told blacks wouldn't be served it is just as epic just as seminal just as important
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.320]  i personally know the south was manipulated into the war by british intelligence that's
[13:14.320 --> 13:21.120]  declassified over a hundred years ago the north engaged in great crimes certainly the south engaged
[13:21.120 --> 13:28.720]  in some crimes as well the founder of texas sam houston was against it and was removed
[13:29.440 --> 13:36.000]  from office as the governor of texas first he was the president and he was governor
[13:36.000 --> 13:46.400]  and they removed him he had to step down from office because he was against the war he said
[13:46.400 --> 13:49.440]  you're being set up you ought to go read in fact i'm going to do a whole piece on this
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.440]  so i was reading a book about it reading his quotes i looked online they're online as well
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.560]  just sam houston's comments sam houston's quotes on the civil war he said the north's got 10 times
[13:58.560 --> 14:04.000]  the industrial might they've got three times the population were being completely set up
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.880]  believe me i ran the operations to come into texas with the north and take it over
[14:10.880 --> 14:17.760]  in an intelligence operation with andrew jackson 30 years ago you don't want to do this they've
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.320]  got a giant intelligence network they control the ocean they've got a huge navy
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.320]  we're going to lose we're being set up they said ah be quiet you're out of there you Yankee
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.480]  he was he wasn't a quote Yankee he was from Tennessee and famous fighter
[14:38.480 --> 14:44.160]  and he was proven correct and there was a lot of my family that was against the civil war in texas
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.880]  some of them were neutral and went further west others joined the confederacy i've got ancestors
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.080]  that were confederate kernels and generals and i'm not going to get into it but the point is that
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.960]  that they were like robert e lee they were against it as well but once the war started
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.400]  following the constitution they had to join their state but it was not some glorious war
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.560]  it was a disaster so i don't particularly like the confederate battle flag because
[15:12.560 --> 15:17.680]  it makes me think of the south being manipulated by british intelligence in an attempt to break
[15:17.680 --> 15:27.280]  the country in two but it is a flag that even in the annals of the british the french and others
[15:27.280 --> 15:32.800]  is seen as one of the most powerful symbols of underdogs because many times the south fought
[15:32.800 --> 15:44.240]  10 to 1 5 to 1 3 to 1 and would run out of bullets and would still win with swords and knives so
[15:44.240 --> 15:52.160]  so the south was amazing and because everybody that had gone south and gone west were the wagon
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.160]  trained folks and they'd been fighting their whole lives and they'd been hunting to eat their whole
[15:56.160 --> 16:05.840]  lives and there was also the napoleonic era had kind of ended but it persisted in texas and a
[16:05.840 --> 16:13.120]  few other areas where people still had duels in the streets and people still were into dying in war
[16:13.120 --> 16:19.440]  that was the the greatest thing you could do it was almost viking it wasn't almost viking you had
[16:19.440 --> 16:24.880]  the francs and then you had uh william the conqueror and you had that whole culture in europe
[16:24.880 --> 16:32.400]  that basically was viking uh the norse culture is what made europe what it is today and was the
[16:32.400 --> 16:42.960]  medal that made europe rise to be the dominant force it is militarily that culture of berserking
[16:42.960 --> 16:48.640]  of fighting to the death of dying with a sword in your hand of wanting to die in battle of enjoying
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.680]  it of of of going past fear and being completely wild eyed craved and taking hallucinogens as well
[16:55.680 --> 17:04.000]  well that was uh basically the the the norse culture if you're a new lester don't believe me
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.960]  just look it up look up vikings and mushrooms and you'll you'll get the rest of the story
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.560]  but i digress it it's just the hysteria imagine if someone saw swastika and they locked the school
[17:20.560 --> 17:26.720]  down what if you're walking in for your world history class in say the 10th grade and you've
[17:26.720 --> 17:31.440]  got poster board and it's got the allied symbols and the nazi symbols do they lock the school down
[17:31.440 --> 17:39.920]  for that i've actually had people when i was a teenager come over to my parents house and see
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.520]  big bookshelves everywhere and then books on the shelf that had swastikas on them like rise and
[17:45.520 --> 17:50.480]  fall the third rike that want to pull a surprise and people would say why do you have this so like
[17:50.480 --> 18:01.200]  this one knows how to read he's got to get watched just ah no i saw it a confederate battle flag oh
[18:01.200 --> 18:09.760]  no it's so evil it's so bad school goes into lockdown after student displays confederate flag
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.880]  on backpack the purge of culture thanks to political correctness biz pack review article
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.680]  a student display the confederate battle flag on his backpack eventually led to a georgia high
[18:19.680 --> 18:25.040]  school but going into lockdown oh and the suspicion of three students last week the suspension
[18:25.840 --> 18:31.280]  the incident started with a 10th grade boy not a young man arrived at rock mart high school in
[18:31.280 --> 18:40.640]  polk county with the flag attached to his backpack hysteria only went on from there oh my god oh my
[18:40.640 --> 18:49.200]  goodness does you see it oh swatching help me swatching help me oh my god i mean this is mental
[18:49.200 --> 18:54.800]  illness look at that there's a confederate flying flying at that capital get it down get it down
[18:54.800 --> 19:03.360]  a month later oh i saw one on a car i saw one on a shirt i saw it this is what we've become
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.320]  no knowledge no history no background no culture just here's the symbol we're banning it
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.960]  and months after the hysteria begins it's taken off capitals statues are pulled down
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.320]  and and police arrived because someone saw a symbol
[19:22.240 --> 19:28.160]  but when people come across the border with the al-qaeda or the isis flag or people come across
[19:28.160 --> 19:34.320]  illegally from syria or from libya it's okay we're going to get to that in the news today as well
[19:34.320 --> 19:40.240]  well and in germany cps now takes your kids if you criticize the migrants
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.520]  back to nazi germany where they nazis took your kids if you didn't do it you were told
[19:46.720 --> 19:52.160]  it's all liberal so it's okay sides there are families that can't have kids that need your kids
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.280]  they deserve kids so they're going to take them from yours don't be homophobic

[24:19.200 --> 24:24.320]  al-qaeda and other radical islamist scripts from Saudi Arabia predominantly are going to attack
[24:24.320 --> 24:31.280]  a city man then the last five years our government has openly funded these very groups to take over
[24:31.280 --> 24:36.960]  multiple countries in the middle east and north Africa now they're allowing them to embed themselves
[24:36.960 --> 24:42.320]  in quote refugees and migrants many of which are migrants into countries they were trying to take
[24:42.320 --> 24:50.160]  over like syria and are now being sent to the united states and other areas of europe this is
[24:50.160 --> 25:01.360]  while we have the headline isis planning nuclear tsunami and obama warns of apocalyptic cult
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.840]  that is isis which is simply al-qaeda under a new name to confuse the public
[25:09.840 --> 25:20.080]  so this is how ridiculous things have gotten and how illiterate politically the public has
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.640]  gotten that they could even pull something off like this trust in mainstream media hits rock
[25:24.640 --> 25:32.720]  bottom in a new gallup poll only 40 say they have any level of trust and that level is low
[25:32.720 --> 25:41.120]  yes congress has a nine percent approval rating in gallup they can attack the president on supposed
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.920]  racial issues or claim people are and then get a 35 40 percent approval rating for him
[25:45.920 --> 25:53.040]  but just based on personality but the policies have a nine percent approval rating another

[26:10.560 --> 26:18.720]  Saudi arabian forces the whole time as iraq has been saying for three years that we're supplying
[26:18.720 --> 26:25.600]  them we're not doing it the criminals that hijacked our country are oh look at this article out of

[28:11.520 --> 28:18.400]  make the magnitude of evil up and how concerted it is germans who make racist anti-immigrant posts
[28:18.400 --> 28:21.680]  that means any criticism could have their children snatched by the state and
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.000]  fired from their jobs according to german lawyers association it goes on and and here's zuckerberg
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.800]  we have the video and the audio of this maybe we should grab that and play it later mark zuckerberg
[28:34.800 --> 28:42.960]  caught on hot mic live mic saying facebook will censor anti migrant posts yeah we showed how the
[28:42.960 --> 28:47.600]  pope did that fake thing with that girl last week it had tens of thousands of shares in a few hours
[28:48.960 --> 28:54.000]  and they just erased the shares down to zero and you could not share it and could not post it on

[29:03.440 --> 29:09.120]  and facebook is actually hiring stasi folks as well i'm not kidding this is mainstream news
[29:11.840 --> 29:17.440]  to then alert the authorities in germany so the stasi are really helpful people marcus will
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.600]  former head of the stasi the most infamous director worked for three years when we founded
[29:21.600 --> 29:27.120]  homeland security establishing the bureau facebook ceo mark zuckerberg was caught discussing the
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.080]  censorship of anti-migrant posts on the united nations development summit saturday while speaking
[29:32.080 --> 29:37.200]  with german chancellor angela merkel at just service last night that's just some of the news on that
[29:37.200 --> 29:46.480]  front i'm going to get into obama when we come back and the fact has he been shown up by vladimir
[29:46.480 --> 29:54.960]  putt we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.960 --> 30:06.640]  did you know that only six corporations control 90 percent of what millions of americans see here
[30:06.640 --> 30:13.520]  and read every single day it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is owned
[30:13.520 --> 30:20.000]  by only a handful of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other hand the internet is
[30:20.000 --> 30:26.560]  an interconnected network of billions of sources so you can research information for yourself
[30:26.560 --> 30:33.040]  from multiple sources or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media
[30:33.040 --> 30:39.280]  never questioning what you are being told this gives you a false sense of reality i mean do you
[30:39.280 --> 30:45.280]  actually know what you think you know or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version

[40:28.880 --> 40:37.040]  thugs that can't back up anything you're all talk and no action and when all the hell breaks loose
[40:37.040 --> 40:44.080]  you're gonna be crying for your mommy and she ain't gonna be there now let's get back to this
[40:44.080 --> 40:53.200]  look at this okay well before i get to the article let's just play obama's statement just at the un
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.960]  obama has turned puttin into the world's most powerful leader no russia is not perfect but
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.880]  russia's not on an offense russia is surrounded russia is deindustrialized russia is under attack
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.720]  russia's having their only export energy brought down russia's surrounded by chechen fighters
[41:12.720 --> 41:19.200]  that are now in all the caucuses and are in ukraine and are in syria their only Mediterranean port
[41:20.800 --> 41:27.280]  attacking them and so the russians are defending their absolute core national security
[41:28.880 --> 41:34.880]  and so the reason everyone's being driven into the former kgb agents arms is because obama and the
[41:34.880 --> 41:41.200]  globalist in an educated politically informed world america has the least amount of travel except
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.440]  for like north korea outside the country america has the lowest level of information about geopolitics
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.440]  america is just completely illiterate when it comes to these geopolitical developments
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.440]  and so china is incredibly corrupt and bad i don't like the communist russia's got big problems
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.160]  but russia's tried to reform compared to china and the globalists don't want that they don't want
[42:04.160 --> 42:08.960]  any sovereign nations they don't want any sovereign sectors they don't want any sovereign
[42:08.960 --> 42:15.440]  places to run and so russia's trying to have their own currency they're trying to team up
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.320]  with india and china russia's trying to defend itself russia's trying to build a culture russia's
[42:20.320 --> 42:26.720]  promoting the family russia is is going after pedophiles russia doesn't put fluoride in their water
[42:26.720 --> 42:33.200]  you turn on russia news gmo shows to be a system put into reduced fertility here's the un documents
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.680]  fluoride has been proven to lower iq and destroy fertility that's why the west puts it in their
[42:37.680 --> 42:41.840]  water as part of population control here at the russian ministry of the interior we do not wish
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.760]  to destroy your fertility but through cultural means of the communist we have our fertility
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.000]  lowered we must have children or we will fall this is a part of a larger plan to i mean the russians
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.080]  know folks because they've been through 85 years of new world order gang rape
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.120]  and isn't it fitting as world government arises and as almost every country's fallen
[43:05.120 --> 43:12.880]  on russia is over there infiltrated corrupt double dealing has its own problems but ideologically
[43:12.880 --> 43:19.120]  is being defiant to this first clip is obama in case you think i'm making it up talking about
[43:19.760 --> 43:27.440]  apocalyptic isis which is a sock puppet a hand puppet a finger puppet a marionette
[43:27.440 --> 43:37.840]  a avatar a front of saudi arabia nato the globalist the criminals that run our country
[43:37.840 --> 43:42.960]  the criminals that run our country harvest babies while they're alive they run al qaeda
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.360]  they're trying to ban christian speech and ban churches and man crosses they're already doing
[43:47.360 --> 43:52.880]  it in germany they're already doing it in sweden they're coming it's communist with megabanks
[43:52.880 --> 44:01.440]  financing them with radical muslims taking over we are under attack period period now let's go to
[44:02.080 --> 44:07.200]  obama warning of the apocalypse of jihad and out of this crisis they will bring in their
[44:07.200 --> 44:12.640]  world government here it is when a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people
[44:14.400 --> 44:17.120]  that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.720]  it breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all
[44:26.320 --> 44:32.000]  likewise when a terrorist group beheads captives slaughters the innocent and enslaved women
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.800]  oh he's all behind all of it not a single nation's national security problem that is an assault
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.120]  on all our humanity total evil totally behind it and then acts like he's against it that's
[44:41.120 --> 44:46.720]  emperor palpatine level i've said before and i will repeat there is no room for accommodating an
[44:46.720 --> 44:52.400]  apocalyptic cult like icin and the united states makes no apology for using our military as part
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.480]  of a broad coalition to go after them i can't listen to do so with a determination to ensure that
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.680]  there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes of course they're
[45:03.680 --> 45:07.840]  creating a safe haven out of our demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit
[45:07.840 --> 45:15.280]  out of syria we will not be outlasted by extremists oh no they're totally empowering
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.760]  them 14 years after 9 11 you know let's go to putin first and then obama when we come back
[45:19.760 --> 45:25.680]  here's part of putin's address the un yesterday and then compare it to what obama's saying the
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.320]  russians have invited the usn to take these people out they're not going to take out their own people
[45:31.200 --> 45:37.680]  and again this is all coming out in the news the world knows we run al-qaeda and the world's
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.720]  meant to learn that because down the road america is going to be crippled america is being set up
[45:42.720 --> 45:49.600]  for a major fall not a complete fall but a game changer europe is to lead the world government
[45:51.280 --> 45:53.600]  america is to supply hessian mercenaries
[45:56.240 --> 45:58.000]  the new atlantis is to be brought down
[45:58.000 --> 46:09.360]  let's go ahead and go to russian president latimer putin isn't however that far from
[46:09.360 --> 46:17.440]  learning from others mistakes everyone just keeps repeating them and so the export of revolutions
[46:17.440 --> 46:23.040]  this time of so-called democratic ones continues it was suffice to look at the situation in the
[46:23.040 --> 46:29.760]  middle east and north africa as has been mentioned by my previous speaker certainly political and
[46:29.760 --> 46:35.680]  social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time and people there wished for
[46:35.680 --> 46:45.600]  changes naturally but how did it actually turn out rather than bringing about reforms and aggressive
[46:45.600 --> 46:51.280]  foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and their
[46:51.280 --> 46:58.560]  lifestyle itself instead of the triumph of democracy and progress we got violence poverty and
[46:58.560 --> 47:07.520]  social disaster nobody cares a bit about human rights including the right to life i cannot
[47:07.520 --> 47:15.680]  help asking those who have caused the situation do you realize now what you've done but i'm afraid
[47:15.680 --> 47:22.560]  no one is going to answer that indeed policies based on self-conceit and belief in one's
[47:22.560 --> 47:31.120]  exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned it is now obvious that the power
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.640]  vacuum created in some countries of the middle east and north africa led to the emergence of
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.600]  onaki areas which immediately started to be filled with extremists and terrorists
[47:41.600 --> 47:49.280]  in these circumstances it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.720]  the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels of financing and
[47:54.720 --> 48:03.040]  supporting terrorists including the process of drug trafficking and illicit trade in all
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.560]  arms it will be equally irresponsible to try to manipulate extremist groups and place them at
[48:08.560 --> 48:15.440]  one's service in order to achieve one's own political goals in the hope of later dealing
[48:15.440 --> 48:23.680]  with them or in other words liquidating them pressure has always been consistently fighting
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.560]  against terrorism in all its forms today we provide military and technical assistance
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.840]  both to iraq and syria and many other countries of the region who are fighting terrorist groups
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.560]  we think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the syrian government and his
[48:38.560 --> 48:48.560]  armed forces violently fighting terrorism face-to-face we should finally acknowledge that no one but
[48:48.560 --> 48:55.840]  present assaults armed forces and Kurds militia are truly fighting the islamic state and other
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.160]  terrorist organizations in syria we know about all the problems and contradictions in the region
[49:02.160 --> 49:09.040]  but which we based on the reality dear colleagues i must note that such an honest and frank approach
[49:09.040 --> 49:15.040]  of russia has been recently used as a pretext to accuse it of its growing ambitions as if
[49:15.040 --> 49:22.000]  those who say it have no ambitions at all however it's not about russia's ambitions dear
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.720]  colleagues but about the recognition of the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state
[49:28.720 --> 49:36.160]  of a face in the world what we actually propose is to be guided by common values and common interests
[49:36.160 --> 49:44.000]  rather than ambitions and that's the key and that's why putin is now the main leader of the world
[49:46.160 --> 49:54.000]  because compared to our leaders putin is moral and putin tells the truth over and over again
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.200]  and the whole world sees that and sees that our government wants to overthrow even friends
[50:00.320 --> 50:07.040]  our government is overthrowing people in egypt people in libya but also in eastern europe
[50:07.040 --> 50:13.120]  you name it because wicked corporations now run our government and they want to discredit america
[50:13.120 --> 50:17.120]  as well they want to destroy all the nation states so they're willing to use this as a
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.200]  battering ram even though it's going to break us in the end they're using our wealth our goodwill
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.960]  our strong name to build this world government russia is completely backed into a corner the
[50:28.960 --> 50:34.800]  united states is moving new medium range cruise missiles into europe admitting they're going to
[50:34.800 --> 50:41.440]  prepare to nuke russia and so russia is now being pushed closer to china and they're moving into the
[50:41.440 --> 50:48.960]  middle east this is biblical and it's being directed by the e u by the globalist and we're
[50:48.960 --> 50:54.960]  not hearing a word from the pope about this we're only hearing how we need to cut the third world's

[59:06.480 --> 59:11.760]  from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because of the

[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:27.600]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.360]  i pray many times a week i wouldn't say every day but four or five times a week
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:44.480]  and it seems to help me because i get so angry sometimes i get a crick in my neck
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:53.760]  and i have trouble breathing i actually get in a very aggressive mode because i just started
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.360]  thinking about the crimes being committed there are resting people in germany that criticize
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.640]  open borders they're working with zuckerberg to censor people here domestically including us
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.040]  our government's funding al-qaeda to murder all these innocent people in ices
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.480]  the federal reserves destroying the country by design
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.880]  and i just don't want to sit here and take it anymore
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.600]  now when we start the next segment i played latimer putin's speech or an excerpt of it
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:30.400]  where he said this is not about russia's interest this is about morally doing the right thing
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.000]  and it's about defending our national sovereignty against radical al-qaeda groups and ices groups
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.160]  that the west is funding and using and how dare you do this and it's a fact
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.560]  you know i took the bait that putin in 99 had bombed
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.200]  his own apartment buildings and he still may have he was the vice president
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.800]  he needed to be able to attack the chetians that were working for the west
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.440]  trying to peel away several countries away from russia
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.760]  and not defending the bombing of apartment buildings they did bomb apartment buildings
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.600]  that were working apartment buildings not elderly so that most people weren't in the
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:20.240]  buildings when they did it still terrible and moscow police or a suburb of moscow police
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.400]  caught fsb in a building with a plastic explosive and then they said oh it's part of a drill
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:33.680]  so there's a good chance russia has engaged in false flags that is latimer putin has when he was
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:40.400]  vice president but there's not total proof of that but i was told by a lot of other russian
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.280]  experts that though that was done uh to actually destabilize russia and to try to i'll take the
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:53.840]  fight away from chechnya into russia itself but that's not the effect it had but that's why i say
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.160]  we can't fit her and completely trust latimer putin all i know is putin's not trying to take
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:06.800]  my guns all i know is latimer putin is not trying to force vaccines on me or gmo all i know is
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:14.960]  latimer putin's not trying to teach my seven-year-old uh how she can be a man uh all i know is is that
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.920]  latimer putin's not trying to make me drink fluoride latimer putin is not funding isis and
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:27.120]  isle and all the rest of these western back groups and latimer putin's not trying to bring in a one
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:34.160]  world government so we have the headline of the new york post obama has turned putin into world's
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.000]  most powerful leader and they make it political and certainly obama's part of that so you could
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.320]  say that and be fair but isn't it globalism has made putin look like a world leader or the
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.680]  predominant world leader because globalism is such a miserable tyranny by the way it's not
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.280]  a failure though you know putin said oh the west has failed and what it's done i guess it's failed
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.480]  to have al-qaeda and isis take over i guess that's true but not failed in funding these groups that
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:11.120]  was their plan so what do you think the larger geopolitical plan is and what do you think is
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.240]  going to happen now that obama's announcing they're not going to be backing syrian rebels in
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:23.600]  anymore against Assad is that a fake statement is that a fraud is that a faint uh is that a
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:31.840]  zig when they zag is that a fake handoff is that a sneak play or what does that signify
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.800]  what do you think the next geopolitical move is going to be we've already seen soros and nato
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.040]  take down ukraine and spin it to russia did it what's coming next i want to take your phone calls

[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:08.320]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:16.480]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network i don't normally talk about movies that are concerning
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:22.400]  entertainment because that's a diversion but so much of it's scripted and in that people can
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.080]  really train themselves to see the propaganda and then to tell others about it in fact i found
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:34.240]  it's easier to wake the public up exposing propaganda in movies and in books and on television
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.240]  than it is to get them to wake up the propaganda involved in politics
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:47.200]  and here's an example did nasa time its mars announcement to coincide with a new movie the
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:55.920]  martian starring matt daemon that's yahoo news associated press and ridley scott who's a great
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.600]  director i can't wait to see the movie said i knew there was water months ago
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:10.400]  well we knew there was water on mars 100 plus years ago with telescopes there were white
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:19.760]  ice caps on its northern and southern hemisphere visible in 1900 or before people 300 years ago
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:25.280]  thought that there was canals and water on it because the rivers they could see we just know
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:32.000]  most the rivers are dry but yes the probes have proven there's running water in the summer months
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:40.160]  and it comes up out of the ground like springs when it gets up above 50 degrees or so on mars
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:49.920]  so that's what's going on on mars but that's just oh my gosh is this all a pr stunt g was the
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.160]  pope getting in the new fiat the larger fiat you think that was a stunt from italy i wonder
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.720]  gee the police opening the line up letting a little girl run up to the pope it was obviously
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:08.240]  staged he was ready for it anybody could see it was staged it was bad acting we said it was staged
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.920]  mark zuckerberg had it censored well i guess with his people he admitted that at the un
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:20.080]  hearing saturday that they'd censor any criticism of open borders in america or in europe and they
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.800]  report people that do to the german police and folks are arrested i mean think about the tyranny
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.840]  in germany no free speech and we came out and said the pope kid what they're not telling you it's
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:39.600]  totally fake the day it happened then it got taken down it got blocked kit daniels came out and then
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.240]  talked about it more with darin mcbrane when he hosted the nightly news so not only is this
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:51.600]  stuff staged when you try to expose that you're being manipulated they censor you now nobody's
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:58.080]  going to censor us if we talk about clearly nasa coinciding a great promotion of space travel
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.960]  and travel inside the solar system to our nearest neighbor fourth rock out from the third rock
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.880]  rock certainly that's the type of propaganda we need to see promoting human exploration
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:19.520]  trailblazing making astronauts heroes again the word propaganda has been made synonymous
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:28.080]  with lying no that's black propaganda propaganda is simply material that promotes your point of
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:34.960]  view so i put out propaganda all day about the bill of rights the constitution property rights
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.040]  it's medical freedom mother nature supplements
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:47.680]  my relationship with christ because it's what i believe it's what makes me feel good it's what
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:54.960]  i've had good experiences with i'm trying to share information with people i've been down on
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:01.440]  the hiking bike trail before at a really busy waterfall and i was sitting there and talking
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:07.120]  to a group of people and i said you know about 500 yards down is an even bigger waterfall
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.960]  but you got to walk further and there's hardly anybody there and guess what the unanimous response
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:20.240]  is we want to go down there don't tell everybody and i kind of get that you find a fishing hole
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.720]  that's really the best at some national park or state park you don't want to tell everybody where
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:32.480]  the fish are at or next they'll all be there so maybe i'm a party pooper but the globalists don't
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.560]  want to build bigger economies so that everybody can be successful they want smaller economies
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.320]  they control so they can dictate total terms to everyone we're going to launch the phone system
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:13:00.800]  and i'm going to give the phone number out the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.560]  and i specifically want to get your take on putin's address versus obama's address
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.280]  and the media rightfully saying here in the u.s that putin is now the leader of the world compared
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:23.600]  to obama in the past american presidents were the leaders of the free world and most the world
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:32.160]  hailed their support towards america because china was so nightmarishly evil soviet union was so out
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:41.680]  of control bad we've got a crew member who i guess immigrated here when she was young from russia
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.160]  we're going to interview her soon and she was just telling us during the break she's going to do a
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.520]  piece tonight that will air tomorrow where she's going to in the actual russian tell you what putin
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.080]  said and i've seen this in the russian news as well their transcripts are different than ours
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.120]  putin said at the u.n your government's behind al qaeda and isis and how dare you do this and we're
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.080]  going to fight it and you know you're really corrupt and by the time it's on us news it's been
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:14.720]  watered down this is the level of deception they're putting everybody under so it goes from white
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.400]  stuff like the martian being released uh right as nasa announces um their big mars mission i mean of
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:31.120]  course that's going on that's propaganda but it's white propaganda it's pro human pro exploration
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.840]  propaganda but still they should admit they did it on purpose just out of respect for the public
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.840]  then you've got deceptive stuff like the pump and the little girl and then you've got a really deceptive
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:52.160]  and then you've got a really deceptive stuff where zuckerberg comes out and tries to stop people from
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:59.280]  exposing what's going on and then admits it at the u.n talking to the german chancellor
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.520]  and then the deception gets even worse where they take what latimer putin says and twist it
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:14.880]  no wonder americans are so ignorant politically because we're just bathing in disinformation
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:23.760]  let's talk to the watcher in fema region nine i guess formally uh there in the pacific northwest
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:30.080]  he wants to talk about putin's speech thanks for calling alex he sounded so much like you
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.480]  you it wasn't for the translation on rt that i would have thought you were on the stage
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.320]  well the truth the truth it is and i i was so excited my wife thought i was out of my mind
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:51.280]  uh but i was like wow okay the jig is up and then when it came to obama's speech i just turned
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.560]  him off i don't want to listen to the lies i just because all he does is about fourth lies and then
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.480]  the media just plays it up well we're going to play what he had to say i've got the transcript
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.800]  here he came and said we come in peace we love you get in the candy truck get in the ice cream
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.440]  truck i have a puppy i mean he basically just said we love you russia please stop attacking
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:15.120]  everyone please stop being evil please help us fight isis while they run it while putin's like
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:21.360]  okay i'm there battling them join me it's just total inversion of reality it is i have friends in
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.440]  ukraine and one of my friends was helping me translate the actual uh russian version of the
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:34.240]  end is pretty much spot on but when during the ukraine crisis when it occurred she flew over
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.960]  there the thursday before it happened and when everything blew up and her and a friend were
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:50.080]  watching this basically a mock military action between the ukrainian army and the russian army
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.400]  but they were all ukrainians okay so they watched it and these guys come together and they
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.040]  they tackle and capture these ukrainian troops and then when the cameras rolled away
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.520]  they all stopped to start shaking hands patting each other on the back and
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.920]  she says like what are they doing so she says she thought she saw staged stuff being shot ahead
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.520]  of the so-called revolution being launched days later it was two days after it started
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.160]  but she watched later that night she watched it on the news with her friend and her friend's like
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:31.920]  whoa whoa whoa whoa that's not what happened and she goes yeah when she came back two weeks later
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.600]  after having to go through a whole lot of stuff to get out of there um she she called me up said
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.880]  we've got to talk in person i said okay what's going on she goes i can't tell you right she gets
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:49.120]  over she tells me all of this and i was like yeah i mean the alex is saying the same thing it's all
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.240]  staged but what's going on over there it's just like you know the victoria newland stuff where she
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:01.040]  said fd eu and all that and they were picking out who was going to be the leader i showed her that
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:07.920]  and she heard her face dropped she uh she's like oh my god what's going on yeah it's it's insanity
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:13.440]  and our government which i don't like to call our government it's our occupiers like you say
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:20.400]  are orchestrating almost everything that's going on in the world it's bad right now it certainly is
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.160]  and and russia is grabbing its interest in the country the last is trying to get its interest
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.560]  the issue is this is russia's doorstep it used to be part of russia and our government overthrew
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.040]  the elected government and then put a bizarre white supremacist group in that actually hails hitler
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.000]  and then our news had the nerve to call putin hitler and claimed that the russians were like hitler
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.200]  i mean even for americans people should see through that but the russians were the main group
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.840]  that fought hitler and lost 20 million people it's it's just it's so crazy that not all the western
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.720]  ukranians are bad people and they have real beefs with what the russians did to them under lennon
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:12.080]  and stalin absolutely but now to resurrect the the the nazi movement in ukraine from world war two
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:19.280]  and put it in charge is just crazy but what do you expect from george soros who told cnn
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:26.240]  for reads our caria that yes i was key in my foundations with what you're now seeing over
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:33.040]  there today i am one of the main person behind it yes i'm very proud another bizarre nazi collaborator
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:40.800]  who's jewish you can't make this up it's like specter nobody's who they seem funding actual
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:47.520]  grandkids and kids of nazis to run around and murder everybody i mean it's just it's crazy and
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.960]  that's why america's lost so much of the moral high ground and then we have nato general shooting
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.040]  their mouths off about how we can defeat russia easily let's just have a war

[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.120]  killed it they just killed the story brought it down to zero shares you couldn't share it
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:48.800]  and then zuckerberg saturday on the dais up there with merkel said we're gonna censor
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.960]  we're gonna control we're gonna call on mike we're gonna stop any criticism of the quote migrants

[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:11.120]  censor anybody that tries to expose that that is hardcore totalitarianism that is hardcore while
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.800]  they act like they're not censoring oh we don't censor and i'm not even singling out facebook
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:24.240]  here a lot of these platforms do this and people should really be freaked out a lot of liberals
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.880]  are on a power trip you bet we're gonna shut your speech down now it's our time to take over
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:36.480]  well that's not liberal the precedent's being set with liberal causes because that's the agenda
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.800]  being used to domesticate the public but down the road you're gonna be censored too
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:49.280]  splash some cold water on your face if you're a so-called liberal and ask yourself is this
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.840]  really who you are let's go ahead and go to erin in montana erin you're on the air thanks for
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:03.040]  holding go ahead hey how's it going alex good hey you know i was just thinking about this
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.600]  you know in the beginning of putin when he was first running his reelection campaign he's running
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:14.960]  around with his shirt off horseback in uh shooting guns up you know just completely the man's man
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.960]  everybody you know i'm a man right that's clearly a ploy but they're but they're promoting masculinity
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.880]  being in charge and having strong families the globalist here promote an effeminate obama on
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.840]  purpose so so what putin's doing i i think it's healthy to have a john wane stahl president
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:38.560]  but what i'm getting at is they're doing it on purpose because obama what does he do he appoints
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:44.320]  a civilian gay person to head secretary like the defense department now and he's completely
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.680]  demasculinating the military exactly it's it's like it's a design it's completely
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.560]  um it's a complete program of ending the family as we know it and making americans the most broke
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:03.360]  back sure vile knock need weirdos you can imagine yeah i yeah
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:14.400]  that's yep my other point uh if i could make would be we have a a local issue in montana with
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:21.280]  a gun control may or michael bloomberg's initiative oh boy is now taking is now taking effect in
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:29.120]  mazula montana they're implementing a firearm sale ordinance that basically says no more person to
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.040]  person sales without a federal background check over 200 cities even in conservative areas like
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.040]  montana are now bought and paid for by bloomberg thank you so much great call sir great point
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.240]  on the putin situation absolutely the russians know they're dying they know they're collapsing
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.280]  they're desperately hoping a strong man can save them we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.640]  in the wake of pope francis visiting the united states and barely addressing the
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.960]  issue of pedophilia within the catholic church we have this former house speaker denitz haster
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.960]  negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid 3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.160]  with a male the daily mail reports a may indictment says haster agreed to pay 3.5 million to someone
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.560]  identified only as individual a to hide past misconduct it has been claimed that individual
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.120]  a is a victim of sexual abuse that hasard was attempting to silence citing anonymous sources
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.280]  the ap reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.920]  be linked to his days as a high school teacher before leaving congress in 2007 hasard was the
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.320]  longest ever serving republican speaker because when you have skeletons in the closet you are easy
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:46.000]  to control haster was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981 haster took groups of
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.800]  boys on foreign trips including diving expeditions to the bahamas and now that john bainer is stepping
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.440]  down under his own free will it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet rob do

[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:47.840]  propaganda uh at the united nations yesterday but first i wanted to play a piece from a few months
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:55.040]  ago where dr group and i and others break down how amazing liver shield is one of the newest
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:01.360]  products from info wars life dot com and this product is now back in stock it's been sold out
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:08.960]  for a long time it's very very popular it's now back in stock at info wars life dot com
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:17.440]  or by calling toll free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine and here is
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:24.000]  the piece where we break down how amazing uh this product is in conjunction with a larger
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:34.480]  uh liver cleanse here it is
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.160]  and when you eat all these toxins if you ate mcdonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.640]  plasticizers in them your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do so the liver
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:55.680]  basically excretes that into the gallbladder and it holds it just google gallbladder stones and it's
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.080]  disgusting but you need to look at it and when you finally get filled up with these it burst
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.880]  or it gets infected they've got to remove it and we'll scroll through these there's even
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.240]  grosser ones like let's scroll down on average they're green or black if they're black they're
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:20.240]  really old and toxic they're generally green and this stuff's meant to be passed out of you but we
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:26.800]  eat such artificial food that it doesn't these are way beyond kidney stones you name it you also
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:35.040]  have liver stones and medical doctors won't tell you on average hey flush your liver they'll just
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.880]  say hey your liver's sick it's going to get progressively worse we're going to get you on
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:46.000]  a list for a liver transplant it is unbelievable we're showing these disgusting images so
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.080]  about a year and a half ago Anthony Goosey already just said man i just have a doctor
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.080]  grips liver cleanse the one he recommends and he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.640]  on himself right now you really got to do it the results are dramatic after six days and i'm like
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.760]  no way no way i'm doing it i don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.040]  i'm this how ignorant i am and he's like look at it online i'm not looking at it online because
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:18.720]  stuff like that grosses me out i don't want to go there well finally about six months ago they
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.120]  convinced me to do it i personally think everybody should go through a liver cleansing if you haven't
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.920]  done one and then take the for example the liver shield can be taken two different ways it could
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.200]  be taken as a liver support formula where you just take a couple dropper folds but that's not going
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.640]  to purge the liver and remove all that stuff from it in order to do that you have to do the
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.640]  six day walk through how the liver works the different types of cleanses with you and give
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.720]  you the floor but i'm asking a lot of selfish questions here up front um how does the apple
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.640]  cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over the six day cleanse
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.200]  how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end lay on your side for an hour as you go to
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:05.520]  sleep why does it then have the gallbladder release well this is something that i that is a very
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:11.360]  controversial issue and but results speak for themselves i mean hundreds of thousands of
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.560]  people have done this and and it dates back even a thousand years drinking oils to cleanse and purge
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.400]  the liver actually the greeks and the over in india with ayurvedic medicine have done it the same
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.640]  way but how it works is what you should do and this is what our proprietary research led us to do
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:34.640]  back starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:41.200]  was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.760]  globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder and that's really what the first five
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:51.120]  days is for that's where you mix the bottle of liver shield you pour the whole bottle in a gallon
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:57.920]  of distilled water and then you drink four eight ounce glasses a day of that four or five days at
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:04.160]  the same time though okay folks that's just part of the informational video that is on info wars
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:13.840]  life dot com on the liver shield liver cleanse page and he walks through how you do it and generally
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:20.160]  what response the public sees you can read the reviews from third party individuals for yourself
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:27.040]  but overall it has a four point eight rating unheard of by power reviews one of the largest
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:32.000]  and most respected third party review sites out there there are also other third party review
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.680]  sites do your own research of the entire info wars life com product chart and see why we call these
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:45.120]  amazing game changers but i didn't even believe this two years ago when they wanted to develop it
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:51.040]  and wanted me to sell it and thought it was a great idea i finally did it and i've talked about
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:57.680]  what happened it's embarrassing but it's real nevertheless now leon macadoo's friend has done
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:04.880]  it leon hasn't done it yet she corrected me earlier she's doing it next week but her friend is a
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:12.000]  actress in some pretty big movies and also been a fitness model and she had gained some weight and
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.120]  stuff and wanted to try it out she wasn't paid to do it it was leon and her idea talking about it
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:23.120]  because they were getting ready to do these cleanses together and her friend did it um so leon's
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.560]  about to do it next week uh anthony utiarty and leon macadoo join us here and and of course you're
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.720]  not just getting an amazing product you're also funding the operation when we talk about this but
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:38.000]  getting our bodies healthy is such a big part of the fight against the globalist uh leon macadoo
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.800]  by anthony utiarty we've only got a little bit of time five six minutes a piece in this segment
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.120]  i'm gonna come back and go to calls but i appreciate you coming on today to talk about this because
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.840]  liver shield is finally back in one of our best sellers we just get a large shipment of it it's
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.520]  concentrated herbs that i guess prepare and open up the liver to be detox but i'm also told you can
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.200]  take this by itself and also it reportedly we believe has some benefits so anthony let's start
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.960]  with you and then leon macadoo yeah exactly you don't have to go through the full spectrum
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.040]  liver cleanse which involves you know the apple cider vinegar the water they have some salt all
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.280]  that kind of stuff six day regimen right i still pretty easy though right but i put this every
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.680]  single day in my protein shake or my daily water and i take it every single day to support the
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:27.200]  natural detoxification of the liver anyway you don't have to do the full cleanse but that said if
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.080]  you do the full cleanse as you'll see from the hundreds of reviews on infowarslife.com
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.040]  some really crazy things happen and we don't have to go into full detail you know we're not claiming
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.880]  to know what it is coming out of us but we're talking about green balls black balls sometimes
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.920]  golf ball size balls that come out of you when you do the full sometimes martians sometimes
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:54.160]  a little dream that's a joke sometimes it comes out and the laughing pen comes out
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.200]  but no it is pretty wild stuff sometimes you you crap hillary clinton pens it's actually been proven
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:08.000]  in gosh i hope not my worst nightmare sorry it's a family show i apologize but if you think about
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.240]  right even having an image of hillary clinton's not family-friendly absolutely not obscene
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.480]  absolutely is there an FCC file for showing a picture of hillary clinton on broadcast tv
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:22.000]  definitely it's pretty uh yeah show horses rear end the graphic image actually could be uh frightening
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.720]  the children but you think about every single day you were distressing his advice sorry it's
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.360]  all right every single day how much we expose ourselves to from everyone drinking alcohol to
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.280]  the crap in the food the chemicals everything we possibly can imagine that we eat on a daily
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:41.120]  basis all of it goes through the liver and the liver is just being hit with so many toxic compounds
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.440]  on a daily basis that there's no surprise there's none of the liver is being hit by migrants if
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.080]  you drink a bottle of jack Daniels it's a migrant it's a right to be there eating it has a right to
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.400]  destroy your liver and i think it's bad if you take liver shields so don't take it don't go to
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.040]  enforce liver shield is pure crud these aren't well-known ancient herbs concentrated uh none
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.000]  of the toxify it's not good it doesn't help you the government's good do whatever the government
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.920]  says exactly so i'm not even gonna keep talking about them just don't buy it don't know the great
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.120]  part is people did try it we've opened the phones up before and it's crazy what folks say comes up
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.720]  it is crazy and if you look up liver obviously we're not doctors but we can get doctor group
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.680]  and others to come on and talk about it but when we show you know search google gallstones or liver
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.040]  stones it's admitted that the things coming out of us look like what they're saying online at medical
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.280]  sites is happening i just can't believe this is in me i didn't believe it when you first told me
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.600]  about right and we're not saying we're we're not telling you what it is coming out of you we know
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.520]  it's messed up i've look i've i know people that have done independent research on what's coming
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.960]  out of them and we can't talk about an error because it's studies and things stuff like that
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:53.200]  but i've i've had people confirm it to me well do your own research do your own research is the
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:58.960]  bottom line you know the all we have to think about is logically what we're exposing to ourselves
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.200]  to it on a daily basis and realize well yeah our liver is definitely flooded with a bunch of junk
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.840]  it's not i mean take mcdonald's admit they have plasticizers in all their fried foods basically
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:13.120]  plastic your body's got to do something with that and here's a study from today chemical exposure
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.000]  linked to rising diabetes obesity risk as if it's a male who know well it is the chemical
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.840]  exposure your body gets hit with a number of toxic compounds every single day to the point
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.320]  where it can't function at its optimum levels anymore and that's why we do things like natural
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.240]  detoxification it is a real powerful thing just like this story next you're gonna tell me exercise
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.920]  is good and drinking lots of purified water is good you're such a racist i know it's bad
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.440]  you're right i think we should let the migrants the toxicity in our body is really just a migrant
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:46.240]  form we should let the migrants inhabit our bodies like squatters when hitler took cyanide
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.440]  it wasn't poison it was a migrant yeah and then he flopped around a foam at the mouth and died
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.320]  i think there's nothing wrong with that what what about what happened when your friend took the
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:01.040]  anti-migration pill well i made her send me pictures i was like i know it's gross i don't
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.280]  know oh i didn't know this i might be sick and twisted but i wanted to see he's a lovely lady i
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.920]  don't want to picture that in the in the photo it wasn't that it wasn't that now but it but it was
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:19.840]  like quarter size and it was green and black and she is a very healthy person she cleanses a lot
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:26.480]  she eats pretty you know pretty well as well and i was surprised she was surprised and she's
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.480]  done tons of cleanses and nothing like that ever happened to her so i i'm really glad that we have
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.800]  this product back because i've been waiting about two months to be able to go ahead and do this with
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.600]  her now folks should consult their physician because i never heard this in the comments or calls
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.360]  or anybody but anthony and and just to be truthful the last time you tried to cleanse tell folks what
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.200]  happened i mean people in your toxic some things can happen you want to tell folks what happened to
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.920]  you i've done the liver cleanse like six or seven times and sometimes you'll feel nauseous you'll
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.200]  feel really disgusting and ultimately when you pass these disgusting things out of your body
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.640]  you'll feel for me personally a lot better but you will feel toxic you will feel disgusting i mean
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.240]  it's a matter of doing a serious cleanse i mean you're eating right for you said you started
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:17.360]  hallucinating well i felt extremely weird i felt extremely weird actually the emi said the exact
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.440]  thing let's just be honest she felt like she was kind of like oh she felt the exact same
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.400]  i felt crappy the next morning and then i called group i go nothing's happening
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.960]  everybody says the stuff happens and then it's not happening like a day later it was like
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.880]  i was walking to the alamo draft house movie theater with my kids and i'm like stay right here
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:40.800]  sit at this bench i run it was like whoa yeah it worked for me disgusting you didn't you didn't
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.400]  believe it either you were like i was bitching you out yeah you're like this i don't know about this
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.080]  i don't know about this and i was like give it a few days give me nothing's happening right
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:54.720]  and then you call me at like 10 p.m you're like oh my god this is real yeah it took me two days
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:00.080]  though yeah two days well a day and a half because you took it supposed to happen six
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.600]  eight hours so i took it like at 10 o'clock one night you know done the six days and then
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.520]  a whole next day and then like seven at night the next day yeah i just can't believe that was in me
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.480]  i've only done it once all right because i started it and then quit because i was busy with a bunch
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.000]  of stuff i need to go ahead and do it again though you should do it with us next week why do you
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.960]  think you got sick on the seventh one well you know it depends on what you're putting in your body
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.960]  i was more stressed out i was eating worse around just less and less come out each time less and
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.400]  less does come out in each time from from my experience and the experience of others that
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.640]  i've read ultimately the goal i mean if it takes two days for something to pass through you anyway
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.480]  in your experience that's obviously bad right if you're if you're intestinal tract takes two days
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.080]  to pass whatever it is going through it that means you need to do another one also if it's black i hear
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.520]  according to the experts that's even worse because it's a larger built up gunk deposit that's been
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.360]  there for a longer period of time and by the way oxy powder goes with this which you can take
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.760]  separately from doing the cleanse it's worked like dynamite for me i mean it's it's not rocket
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.640]  science it's higher level oxygen that releases in your intestines and just blows everything out

[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.400]  and cayenne cayenne pepper and syrup and he was like yeah you know i did i'm on my 41st day
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.000]  something crazy like that he's like the effects are all right and then he did this liver cleanse
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.160]  and he was like oh my god that took five days it wasn't even that hard it's so much better and that's
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:40.240]  exactly what emmy said yeah it was really simple so i'm looking forward to it we'll take some before

[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:33.440]  incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking rfid signals

[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:13.840]  well nancy polosi came out yesterday and was asked about planned parenthood and the dozens of
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:20.080]  horrible videos some of which are six seven hours long unedited where they macabre sit around these
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:27.760]  fine meals slurping red wine and discussing selling baby parts and Lamborghinis and she
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.240]  basically came out in two different statements and said these videos should be investigated i
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:39.040]  believe they're fake but i haven't looked at them that's like hillary did you have your fake email
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.160]  to hide that you were sending secret emails oh that's a preposterous conspiracy theory
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:51.920]  be like asking elmer fudd do you have a shotgun to shoot rabbits that's preposterous i mean it's crazy
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.680]  i'm gonna take my son dove hunting i'm went and got a license a few days ago
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:02.480]  and done that in a few years and it'd be like do you have a license to hunt dove
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:10.160]  no it's a conspiracy theory i just went and got this license because i felt like it
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.200]  you know are you wearing that red hat to wear a red hat no i just have a red hat on my head
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:22.400]  they just play these games meanwhile new article kit daniels info wars dot com so important
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:30.320]  planned parenthood admits over 86 percent of revenues are from abortions previously they said
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:38.400]  that they don't make money on any of it planned parenthood president makes $520,000 a year for
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:46.160]  organization and also has most of her expenses paid for so let's go ahead and play uh nancy
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:52.160]  polosi who hasn't seen any of the videos but she thinks they're fake and should be investigated
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.120]  even though planned parenthood first said they weren't real then said they were edited and now
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:02.640]  is just defending the content on the subject of the planned parenthood in the attempts to defund
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:07.200]  parenthood have you seen the videos is there not anything on those videos that bothers you at all
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:16.800]  well what i don't stipulate that these videos are real and the fact is in fact is that the research
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  that that is being criticized there is research that has been supported no i haven't seen i've
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  seen some news reports of it but i also know uh that some it is not real and you can create any
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.680]  reality that you want but you okay so even if you don't that is so key backed out up as we
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:41.440]  analyze this propaganda that is so key it's earth shattering member carl rove told the new york times
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:48.160]  and the washington post a bunch of more around him like 2004 and they said listen iraq wasn't
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:54.960]  involved in 9 11 that was al-qaeda out of saudi arabia why do you keep saying they were and carl
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:01.120]  rove said we control reality we're history's actors we can make any reality we want in fact here's
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:07.280]  the quote and while you're studying that reality judiciously as you will will act again creating
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.800]  other new realities which you can study too and that's how things will sort out we're history's
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:19.680]  actors now and you all of you will be left to just study what we do so here she is saying
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:25.520]  they can put out fake videos and create any reality they want i say they're not real but i
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:34.000]  haven't watched them but they need to be investigated ported no i haven't seen i've seen some news
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.240]  reports of it but i also know uh that some it is not real and you can create any reality
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.880]  that you want but you okay so even if you don't accept the the the videos that on their on their
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:52.720]  and i think they should be investigated as to how they obtained the obtained those and
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:59.520]  doctored those and then had them because i mean the videos are not doctored they've released
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:05.120]  with all of them the full unedited surveillance videos some of them seven obnoxious hours long
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:09.920]  i've sat through hours of it i'll i've never sat through an entire one i'll tell you that right
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:17.120]  now and it's just her lying to the audience telling him it doesn't exist just like hillary
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:22.880]  says the email scandal is a conspiracy theory of course it's all admitted we're going to come back
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:29.280]  and go to matt and jim and tim and sebastian michael everybody that's holding your phone
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:34.400]  calls straight ahead bam bam bam she also later says that the head of plant parenthes
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.600]  such a nice lady he was such a nice neighbor till we found all the dead bodies in his basement
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:45.280]  i mean it's the same sickening praying on her audience talking to him like they're idiots
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:52.000]  inter constituents are idiots i mean you know they're for all of recorded history civilizations

[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:26.000]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones hurt memo wrote a story yesterday somewhat
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.280]  critical of donald trump's tax plan saying it doesn't cut enough i've tried to read at trump's
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:38.640]  website exactly what it's going to do it's somewhat transparent but also has a few pitfalls
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:45.440]  but the wall street journals come out saying tax reform for security and prosperity for tax
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:53.360]  brackets zero 10 20 and 25 that's a lot better than the 40 bracket i'm in i had a cpa tell me this
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.880]  morning we try to pay all the fake taxes because we know we're targets that the way we had it set
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:07.120]  up we're probably paying too much taxes but no marriage penalty no alternative minimum tax so
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:12.160]  we're going to try to research here in fact check trump's tax claims and i'm going to try to get to
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:17.920]  the bottom of it for myself and find out who exactly is right around here i was just getting an
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:26.800]  antsy Pelosi saying i haven't seen the planned parenthood videos but that it's doctored it's
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:32.560]  fake it's a lie and it should be investigated and that she basically makes her own reality
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.280]  and she looks like if i was casting a woman for like a brainwash robot person or a stepford wife
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:47.200]  it'd be her i mean these people are just the most ridiculous con artists you can imagine
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.200]  who've been getting away with doubling and tripling down their fraud for so long
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:58.400]  they just sit there shoveling pure bull directly at us and i guess history will be the judge
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.640]  whether they were triumphant in this overthrow of reality jim in fema region four uh what former
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:12.640]  stator you in now under fema occupation jim carolina all right well welcome i'm calling about uh
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:23.280]  uh putin a side killery clinton and the conspiracy behind the propaganda to keep us stupid um it
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.760]  was vital for putin to get crimea first that way he could have the black seat turkey's going to be
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:36.640]  key in that kind of black male game they're playing with nato and the banks um the criminal
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:42.720]  government has been killing everybody in that region who has proof of their you know of uh
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.680]  of them being crooks and so what putin did was he went and got buddy buddy with iraq first
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:57.840]  set up set up military there got into syria got in good with the side to keep him alive
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:06.240]  he's a he's a big poker chip and you algae zira and one israeli newspaper were the only
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:12.880]  ones to report about china coming in through the suez canal that was big time so china's
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:18.000]  going to have a little role to play in this too but you know france france is in there messing
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.280]  around with uh isis and well that's right they say france is the biggest single backer even more
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:32.480]  than the us uh in this isis backing so so france stays out of all these other wars but then commits
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:40.640]  itself behind isis how sickening all right do you do you remember uh tuesday i ran had a big parade
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:47.680]  military defense parade they they showed off a ballistic missile and it wasn't long after that
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:54.960]  germany goes and and they showcase their uh laser nuclear gatling gun thing well the only
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:01.440]  purpose for that thing is to shoot down ballistic missiles that's all that's that's so purpose of
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:08.080]  a laser gatling gun and so it's looking like you know they want to control the propaganda they want
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:14.720]  to control what we know you know facebook and all that alternative media you everybody from controlling
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.000]  the narrative of what's really going on putin is going to be the new daddy of the middle east and
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.640]  he's going to be backed by china so we're we're going to lose our influence over there and that's
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:31.840]  going to break which was probably a plan the whole time by the globalist never think about that see
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.520]  they've got to bring america down and and they put russia in a position where russia has to defend
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:45.760]  itself and is given the moral high ground which then makes america sink that is a globalist chess
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:52.640]  game for you right there great points jim i couldn't agree with you more i just very uh forcefully
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:58.000]  and simply put forward your debt on thank you sebastian and others your calls are straight ahead
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:03.280]  this article from medical express appeared on the drudge report chemical exposure linked to

[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:13.200]  to two of the biggest public health threats facing society diabetes and obesity and that's

[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:21.920]  groundbreaking 2009 report which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:27.200]  disrupting chemicals are edc's and the risk posed to human health i made a search using two words

[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.280]  evidence also indicates that edc exposure is connected to infertility hormone related cancers
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.400]  neurological issues and other disorders edc's do this by blocking our otherwise interfering

[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:12.480]  at a product like survival shield mason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:17.600]  plain view for over a hundred years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:22.400]  that iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:33.680]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind time to take the ball to the walls
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:40.640]  in the fight against tyranny that means press the accelerator all the way down the metal
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:47.200]  that means take a wreck and ball to the globalist burlin wall of media censorship
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:56.080]  where facebook and others here in the united states and in europe will censor any criticism of
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:03.120]  open border stunts facebook last wednesday and thursday completely banned within hours
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:12.960]  an article by kit daniels quoting the term pope kid in staged photo op they just blocked it
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:18.560]  and now mark zuckerberg caught on tape it's up on info wars dot com you want to hear it and see
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:25.440]  it admitting that they're censoring anti migrant post on facebook and promising the president of
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:36.560]  germany that he'll do more to censor and then i have experienced it i can't show a fake staged
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:42.960]  event with an anchor baby i'm not against that little girl but i can't go to mexico and have a
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:49.040]  baby free the elite want to bring in third world populations to drive down wages and create political
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:57.120]  anarchy that is a tower of babel we're all fighting with each other so they can rule over us but the
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:02.160]  fact is whether my criticism of immigrants is good or bad i have free speech and you shouldn't be
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.400]  censoring it when it doesn't violate your terms of service i know i keep hammering on that but
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.560]  it's a big big deal meanwhile speaking of censorship and i'm going right back to your calls
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:20.080]  there's this article out of the washington examiner lawmakers u.s plan for internet may
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:25.280]  be unconstitutional president obama's plan to internationalize that's a quote the internet
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.160]  may be unconstitutional key members of congress are saying the group of lawmakers sent a letter
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:34.080]  to the government accountability office last week saying the plan her relinquished oversight of
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:39.440]  internet domain name functions to a global multi stakeholder body raised questions about the
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.960]  administration's authority to transfer possession and control of critical components of the internet
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:51.520]  infrastructure to a third party yeah the u.s built it paid for it it's working fine it's global
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.760]  why give it to the un because they're going to put under un regulations taxes and censorship
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:02.160]  we had articles yesterday about this un summit with the feminist groups saying any criticism
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:12.000]  by the patriarchy will be bad the letter was signed by the chairman of both
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:22.000]  congressional judiciary committee senator chuck grassley and bob good latte i pronounced that
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:29.200]  right presidential candidate senator ted cruise daryl issa and others the lawmakers point out the
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:34.160]  constitution says congress has the exclusive power to dispose of and make all needful rules
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.880]  and regulations representing and respecting the authority the territory and other property
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:45.440]  belong to the united states yeah but constitution says a lot of other stuff too that the central
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:52.560]  government the the executive branch the bureaucracy has been completely trampling into the dirt
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:12:04.080]  coming up court upholds judgment against monsanto looming catastrophe from diseased
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:11.840]  rates billionaire warns of danger ahead we're going to be getting into all of that some of
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:18.320]  the news up on info wars dot com as well and i'm researching the so-called tax cuts of donald trump
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.600]  deeply i mean i've read what he said i've read what he claims i'm trying to compare it to the law
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.680]  current tax structures but i think it's some of the most aggressive tax cuts i've heard of in a
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:38.640]  long time and if and so in a cursory research a cursory view of it i think it's a great idea
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:45.040]  i'm not criticizing one of our writers curt nemo i don't really control what curt says or does i
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.760]  don't really read what he writes first before he puts it out because i know he's a smart guy
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:55.760]  i respect him i probably agree with 95 of his views and so my writers are not slaves uh to
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:01.120]  info wars i review them i think they're good people i think they care about the truth i think
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.000]  they have interesting perspectives and so then i let them write what they want but i read this
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.280]  article yesterday and i thought well what is this millions of americans will realize little or no
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:17.760]  benefit from donald trump's tax plan political class will never admit taxation is theft so i
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:24.160]  guess instead of going with all the other headlines that donald trump wanted massive cuts curt went
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:28.640]  with kind of a catchy thing and the more i read his article and the more i read actually what
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.520]  they're doing i guess he's got a point the income tax is unconstitutional the income tax wasn't
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.640]  around till 1913 with the federal reserve enactment most americans were exempt from it till the 50s
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:45.200]  we built the country without it we had 10 growth rates a year before it now on average about five
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:50.000]  percent growth rates it's not good it's selectively enforced and i get curt's point
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:54.800]  because when you read it the upper middle class
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.520]  doesn't get any tax cuts
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:05.760]  presidential frontrunner donald trump releases the tales of his tax plan
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:11.760]  and if really you want to get the economy going get the middle class a tax cut too the plan posted
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.440]  on trumps make america great site is billed as a way to let people keep more money in their pockets
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.960]  and increase after tax wages many americans however will realize they see living at gain
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:30.080]  the plan is designed to primarily benefit the poor the lower middle class and corporations
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:36.240]  well that's fine i'll take whatever i can get if you are single and earn less than $25,000
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:41.600]  a year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 you will not owe any income tax to plan
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:48.640]  states well that's fabulous because i mean even if i'm not in a $50,000 tax bracket that's going
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:55.280]  to stir the economy up create more investment more saving to take huge taxes off folks making
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.800]  $50,000 a year but the average person making $50,000 a year right now is paying something like
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:10.080]  25 that'd be zero folks that'd be huge trump claims the plan removes nearly 75 million households
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.880]  over 50 from the income tax rolls and will simplify income tax for all americans for
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:22.080]  individuals earning between $50,000 and $150,000 the tax rate will be 20 that's beautiful a reduction
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.480]  of approximately five percent although this varies to a certain degree under the current
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.800]  arcane tax structure well yeah here's the problem they've gotten rid of all the loopholes
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:38.960]  and they're not loopholes if this company or this corporation buys equipment it's counted
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.680]  as my property and i got to pay taxes on it and then that stifles growth ladies and gentlemen
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.480]  i'm not going to read the rest of it i mean i see kurt's point it's kind of a winding Byzantine
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:58.640]  article but how about donald trump's bold tax plan doesn't go far enough how about that
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.840]  maybe it's a good article because it's got me thinking it's giving me a headache
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:10.560]  because i want to cut taxes but i get the point that we need to really just get rid of the
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:16.720]  income tax entirely but then if they do a national sales tax they're going to have federal tax police
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:24.640]  out roaming around cracking down on every clandestine black market under the table situation that we
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:31.520]  really just call swap meets farmers markets and stuff like that let's go to your phone calls right
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:39.600]  now sebastian in colorado you're on the year worldwide go ahead yes good to hear from you alex
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:49.600]  i just wanted to ask about the globalists in particular they have access to military technology
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:55.600]  that's far beyond advanced beyond anything that that modern excuse me the modern civilian is
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:02.320]  aware of so how are we to protect ourselves and prepare ourselves if they decide to use any of
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:09.200]  these advanced technologies against us such as maybe vibrational harmonic type devices that
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:15.600]  can affect our emotions or something like that sure darpa admitted it's got to be like 18 years
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:23.760]  ago in the toronto papers but also in the baltimore sun that they are testing based on cell phone
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.200]  technology waves to quote calm the public and it was i guess a test article to see what response
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.840]  uh then openly admitting that would have and we've had dr nick baggachan a lot to talk about
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:39.680]  about some of the different electronic warfare systems that are out there before the globalists
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:47.120]  can use things like this really wide scale they've got to get centralized control over everything
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:52.880]  and they've got to get full control over scientific research which they don't have completely yet
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.920]  before they can move ahead with such bold moves they certainly have been testing things like that
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:04.320]  i mean here's an example of trojan horse stuff hiding in plain view vw now um
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:10.480]  oudie other companies are coming out saying yeah we have similar similar fraud systems in our
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:15.360]  emissions testing so that does show how big bold things can go on for quite a while
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.920]  and undoubtedly there is a lot of testing going on but uh i don't think we can become
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.880]  intimidated seven and a half billion humans by different forms of technologies because
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:29.120]  a lot of that stuff's going to blow back on the establishment themselves you know the dumbing
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:34.560]  down of the public is also blowing back on the establishment uh so the best laid plans of mice
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:42.320]  and men often go astray is what i'm getting at but uh yes we're not in kansas anymore and there is
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:47.760]  a lot of advanced technology but a lot of it is not theoretical it's a lot of it's been developed
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:54.400]  and fielded but still it's not widespread in its usage and before they roll out with widespread
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:59.760]  they'll start admitting a lot of it in the news like oh we are doing some geoengineering to save
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:06.960]  the earth oh we do add to some of the jet fuel aluminum dioxide oh we are weather modifying
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:13.120]  for the children and then you know it's really getting ready to gear up once they start leaking
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:19.440]  it and testing it and preparing the public does i answer your question yes it does thank you i
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:24.160]  appreciate that also i just want to say really briefly that me and my wife i love it when you
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.600]  get mad on your show not not praying onto the ill of your health but we think that it's great we
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.480]  should all be this upset well you and your wife are awesome god bless you brother yeah but then
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.760]  when i get mad i got a big crick in the back of my neck and i want to blow up and it's not healthy
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:45.760]  but i mean you focus on this stuff as much as i do it's very healthy to be exposing it
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:50.640]  so we're doing good work but getting down in it and having to focus on it and research it
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:56.080]  it's just so ridiculous what they've gotten away with i mean it's but that's the secret it's so big

[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:25.200]  Alex Jones here back live thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday Worldwide Edition
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:32.240]  I will continue with your phone calls it's all free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:39.840]  then I'm gonna get more into a big stack of economic news more on the attempts to regulate
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:45.280]  and censor the internet I mean really what we've got going for us is that it's all out in the open
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:51.760]  now but we also have that against us because if the public isn't warned or explained to how this
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:57.200]  is a bad idea they may take all the things that are happening because it's calmly being done
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:03.360]  as no big deal and accept them like oh yeah in Europe you're arrested if you criticize open
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:09.120]  borders oh yeah in Europe you can't criticize the government now oh yeah in England you have no free
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:16.000]  speech oh yeah in America you have no free speech yeah there's a police lockdown because somebody
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:22.320]  had a rebel flag on their backpack and the news just reports it with a straight face this is the
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:33.120]  hysteria of a totalitarian system with just a Pavlovian dumbed-down public where they ring the bell
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:41.840]  and the public basically just starts cowering in fear of all the false threats while just
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:50.400]  merrily marching by the graveyard whistling past it as our country's future is being prepared to
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:57.840]  enter the grave they are digging the hole right now all our power all our infrastructure what we
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:05.600]  built what we made what we did our intellectual property the internet our industry our coal
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:14.240]  our resources our children our military everything is being trashed right now and America is being
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:22.480]  put on trial worldwide for all its crimes but we're not being told we're kept in this bubble
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:31.920]  as Putin has made the leader of the world but i'll tell you i'm not an idiot i know our elite
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:38.960]  is more organized more evil more out of control i don't think Putin is playing a part in all of this
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:46.480]  and does not want the united states to be destroyed but nevertheless Putin is being set up by the very
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:52.800]  globalist in europe that run this country at one level to be the savior so he can be brought down
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:59.520]  as well because the globalists want to bring down every nation state standing every family
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:06.160]  every private company every sole proprietorship everybody's got to learn to hit their knees
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.720]  and not just hit their knees out of fear hit their knees out of total subservience and dependence
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:21.360]  on this one world government system forbs three years ago asked the question why is there a war
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:29.680]  on lemonade stands farmers markets and swap meets 15 million dollar fines on garage sales
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:35.360]  that's a fox news headline under federal regulations they haven't implemented yet
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:36.240]  but they're starting to
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.960]  what's that about the ultimate crime in the future the ultimate crime will be defending
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:54.240]  yourself physically defending yourself legally or selling or trading produce or fuel or services
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:00.080]  to anyone homeland security is set up where you're not going to get a job unless the tsa
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:05.040]  authorizes it they're going to be on every street corner i told you 14 years ago this now you see it
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:12.800]  at the pub's visit to pennsylvania you name it it's a total plan domestic controls the tsa
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:18.800]  announced with the irs last year that they didn't want any americans being able to get out of the
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:23.840]  united states with even a thousand dollars cash and then they went further they said outside
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:31.200]  of law until congress called them in finally they said if the irs has even opened a private
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:39.600]  investigation of even a form you didn't fill out with somebody you had to do work for you
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:47.680]  the in their filing they said anything including clerical errors or irs questions or irs investigations
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:55.520]  not indictments not grand juries for any reason they that you would not be allowed to leave the
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:00.240]  united states and then they went further they said you know what we don't want you to be able to get
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:08.960]  on a plane or international park and we're going to check id's the national id when you do it
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:16.240]  everything we said the national id would be for they have said in spades in triplicate i mean
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:28.000]  this is the most brazen biggest healthiest most gargantuan oppressive classical flaming tyranny
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.080]  on steroids the world's ever seen and it's just growing and its tentacles are going into place
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:40.880]  everywhere and it's just licking its big old lips with big old sharp teeth and if you think the
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:48.080]  globalists have persecuted people so far that was only a baby suckling now it's on both legs and
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:54.400]  it's ready to kill the empires on the run i promise i'm going to rock your call tim radio
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:30:00.320]  never write your call to him and eventually either stay with me in the wake of pope francis
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:04.320]  visiting the united states and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the catholic
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:09.200]  church we have this former house speaker denis haster negotiating a guilty plea over charges
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.640]  he paid 3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male the daily mail reports
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:19.680]  a may indictment says hasterd agreed to pay 3.5 million to someone identified only as individual
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:24.080]  a to hide past misconduct it has been claimed that individual a is a victim of sexual abuse
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:28.560]  that hasard was attempting to silence citing anonymous sources the ap reports that the payments
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:32.800]  were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.920]  teacher before leaving congress in 2007 hasard was the longest ever serving republican speaker
[02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:42.160]  because when you have skeletons in the closet you are easy to control hasard was a wrestling
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:47.920]  coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981 hasard took groups of boys on foreign trips including diving
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:52.560]  expeditions to the bahamas and now that john bainer is stepping down under his own free will it
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:56.560]  makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet rob do reporting for info wars dot

[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:22.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:28.640]  there are a million different ways to jump up and down like a wild gorilla
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:36.640]  and warn your troop not to come up to a certain water hole because 25 foot crocodiles are in it
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:43.120]  and they're going to grab you and eat you but if the group doesn't listen to you and they go over
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:49.520]  the hill and go down to the water hole and a 25 foot crocodile launches out like a arrow out of a
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:59.840]  boge and snatches the orangutan the chimpanzee whatever it is and drags it into the mud eating it
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:08.560]  now the group will start to listen and that's the allegory i'm using right here as i went out to
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:12.960]  break i'm going pure evil they hate you and your family they want to hurt you they're coming after
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:18.160]  you i use this example a lot because it's one of the totally cut and dry cases where they were
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:25.040]  caught red-handed in france and in australia bear pharmaceutical who gives money to the force
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.400]  and oculation lobby that gives money to the gun control lobby that gives money to the open borders
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:41.920]  lobby you look at the fortune 100 all of them but the coke brothers give to open borders gun
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:48.800]  control world government socialism and this whole system of dependence the coke brothers give to
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:57.120]  both sides i used to be just giving to the democrats but clinton screwed them over so they started
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:06.240]  paying both sides but that's both sides of the same coin so they're made the ultimate conspiracy
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.680]  pariah because oh my gosh there wouldn't be a right wing media that wasn't for the coke brothers
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:16.800]  everyone that talks bad about the new world order why you know they must work for the coke brothers
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.200]  every pseudo-intellectual out there doesn't have to actually do anything they can just say alex
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:26.640]  jones works for the coke brothers and then be super intellectuals and lay back and talk about how
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:34.800]  smart they are now wish the coke brothers would give me 20 million dollars a year i could fund
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:39.520]  this operation i don't have to sell anything i don't have to advertise squat in fact i'm ready
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.400]  right now the coke brothers have never given me one dime they want to give me 20 million dollars a
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:49.280]  year i will continue to cover the exact same issues i am now and i will not do anything they tell me
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:56.640]  to say or do but i will take their money right now gladly so please hand it over but oh and
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:02.400]  rachel madel get stimulus money from general electric that's tax exempt and exempt from obama
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:09.120]  care and exempt from the power plant rules that's okay and mpr and the rest of it that's that's all
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:19.600]  right and now there's an admitted war in the words of media matters in the memo that came out in
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.720]  politico four years ago to bring down the alternative libertarian conservative press
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:34.000]  to bring down fox news matt drudge and alex jones i can't stand half of what's on fox news i i love
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:41.280]  the drudge report it's just a bunch of different diverse news but fox news is one of the most vicious
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:47.040]  attackers of this show and why is that because rupert murdoch in his other media empire promotes
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:58.800]  anti-gun anti-family carbon tax garbage 24 7 pel mel and they don't like the fact that there's
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:07.280]  another news organization out there that is really libertarian that is really patriot that is really
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:16.320]  dedicated to saving the republic that is really dedicated to free market it's truly sickening
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:22.640]  i remember about six seven years ago what happened for about two years fox news executives and i'm
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:29.600]  going to your calls their major developers would call me and want me to go do pilots for fox news
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:33.920]  and you notice sometimes my producers or my staff would be on fox news and not me
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:39.600]  in these tv shows because i said nope but i said if you want to interview one of my staff you can
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:46.160]  i'm not going to work for fox news they'd say you really don't want to have a show on fox news and
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:55.600]  i'd say no i don't want to have a show on fox news i mean for one thing i already reached an audience
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:00.640]  worldwide in many respects you have more shows than i do so you're much bigger but for just
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.360]  you know one show per capita i reach as much as one of your top shows does so why would i want to
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:12.480]  do that when i'm already reaching audiences as bigger bigger oh the other part i make more money
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:19.360]  than the average fox news hosts a lot more and the difference is i don't care about that money
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:27.120]  that's money to then build an organization i took the money that i made on over 160 plus radio stations
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.800]  and i took that money that that other hosts would give them have jet airplanes and mansions and
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:39.360]  trophy wives and i put that money not into luxury golf course memberships and stuff like that
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:44.320]  but not the things wrong with that that's what makes the economy go i'm just saying i put it into news
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:50.880]  i put it into trying to build something better and i'm just digressing off into this i'm going to go
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:58.160]  to your calls momentarily because to show how they spend things after
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:03.440]  i would never go up to fox news and meet with these people
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.440]  them
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:11.200]  they then had national news pieces out about alex jones
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:16.960]  wants a show on fox news and they had articles in rolling stone and articles in new york daily
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:22.160]  news and all these articles about how i was refused a job at fox news and i'm bitter and
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:28.560]  i'm unhappy think about the narcissistic mental illness of the executives at fox news
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:35.040]  news creating news articles that i later learned they had spurred to get written
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:44.240]  in the new york magazine at least that was another one to make it look like i was a failure and
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:49.520]  they were winners can you imagine the delusional world where guys sit around in offices and people
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:53.840]  come in and kiss their butt all day and they've got teleprompter readers that just put out the
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.440]  same dribble to pacify conservatives and stalk libertarians so we think we've got a voice and
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:04.240]  then they're they're out having articles written where they have simulated victories over me and
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:10.880]  simulated victories where i've been spurned can you imagine being that type of egomaniac
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:18.880]  that you would waste your time on that but that's who the globalist hire are these empty
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:28.640]  yes men shellouts who would die and go to heaven to have all the opportunities i've had and the
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.960]  things i've turned down and i'm not bragging i'm just getting people into the nature of the
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:40.240]  sellouts i mean i get offered to be in big movies routinely and just go sorry i can't do it i get
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:46.240]  offered to have my own tv shows routinely sorry i can't do it and that just shows how the truth
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:53.200]  is what sells the truth is what is popular and the world can't stand the fact that we've been
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:57.360]  successful because you're part of this the viewers and listeners just as much as i am and that they
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:04.480]  don't run and control what we say and what we do and they see is growing and growing and growing
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:15.840]  and that's why i know they're so easy to beat the minute the general public realizes what a
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:22.080]  fraud they are and i'm not signaling out fox news i mean fox news is nothing compared to the mental
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:34.080]  institution that is msnbc or the twisted sycophantic joke that is cnn i mean these people are jokes
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.640]  these people sold out the greatest country the world had ever seen these people thought they
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.040]  were powerful because they were able to get control of america and run us in the ground
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:50.720]  on that's like taking control of a great ancient beautiful ship and running it onto the rocks and
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:57.840]  then dancing around on the deck you know peeing on the main main sail the main the main mast and
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:04.400]  going i dominated this you didn't dominate anything you trash you ran it on the rocks you scum
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:12.160]  because its existence and all the honor associated with it made you so upset and so nauseous that you
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:17.600]  couldn't you you couldn't be around it like a vampire can't be around the light of the midday sun
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:24.320]  i don't mean to start ranting i said i'd go to the calls it's just
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.520]  i just start thinking about the type of men and women we're up against at work for the system
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:37.680]  at the top the type of delusional trash like nancy polosi saying that the planned parenthood
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:43.200]  videos are all fake and she wants it investigated and they're a fraud and they're a hoax and they're
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:52.160]  manufactured and then going but i've never seen any of it we have yes men running things that
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:58.960]  don't care if 91 percent of the nuclear reactors or is it 93 excuse me are leaking i mean 30 years
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:05.840]  ago they cared they don't care anymore they don't care about their kids they're mentally ill this
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:13.280]  world creates a type of artificial borderline personality disorder that is now spreading
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:18.400]  like a disease for the general public as well where they don't even care if they're being destroyed
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.960]  they don't even care if things are falling apart around them they don't even care if they're wrong
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:29.920]  they don't care they will continue to jibber and laugh and say they control reality while they sink
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:37.600]  the entire planet let's go to your phone calls i apologize to tim saying i'd go to him and i

[02:43:54.640 --> 02:44:00.880]  course neither do you and neither do uh 99 percent of your listeners most likely but uh i'm i'm
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:06.800]  pretty much a new listener to you um you you actually said something that i've uh but i said
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:13.120]  myself a few years ago i had no idea that other people even thought that way i said it to a woman
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:19.200]  who with the league of women voters she said why do you think the parties are the same and i took
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.440]  a quarter out of my pocket and i flipped it in the air and i said look both sides are attached to
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:28.640]  each other may have the same core value so you said the coin this is attached to the coin
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:36.000]  absolutely i appreciate that yeah i appreciate that i mean i'm glad that uh people are people are
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:43.440]  waking up to the fact that our country is basically being destroyed from the inside and the outside
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:48.640]  i'd say more from the inside than the outside unfortunately uh when i was uh when i was a
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:54.720]  member of the john berks society years ago i i started being woken up um friends of mine told me
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:58.640]  hey this alex jones guy you got to listen to him i didn't even know about you this was this was
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:03.920]  about 15 years ago and and you were i mean fairly new i guess at the time but i didn't even know
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:08.160]  about you i had no idea and i've just started listening like i say i you know i appreciate
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.040]  everything you're doing and everything you're saying and of course i'm not trying to just
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:18.400]  you know blind no i hear you brother i appreciate you too and it's the power of word of mouth it's
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:24.000]  the power of the people that will overthrow the establishment media the establishment corporations
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.720]  and all these globalists look at how mcdonald's is in trouble look at how all these globalist
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:34.960]  corporations like monsanto are in trouble we the people do have the power that's why the system
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:39.280]  wants to overthrow what's left of the free market and our power to vote with dollars
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:45.440]  and our purchases and replace it with a totally top-down command and control economy where there
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:50.080]  is no choice then they've really got us god bless you good to have you as part of the listenership
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:56.000]  tim thank you great points mitchell in texas thanks for holding you're on the air hello brother this
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.600]  is mitchell from the foreword area i've been listening to politics for about a year now and
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.880]  just four days ago alex i made a twitter and i came to this conclusion what exactly wrong is
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:11.760]  wrong with our society if i could break it down into two reasons i would say it's our loss of
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:17.200]  social cohesion we no longer have this idea of loving by neighbor we have an asset for
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:24.240]  future society reason number two we've lost our strong local christian morals and our passion
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:31.200]  has become strange and conservatives are now crazy brother are you there i'm listening yes
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:35.840]  yeah there's somebody on call why didn't call you okay if i could just tell you a real quick
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.720]  story i've been going to a community college in my area and i got kicked out the other day and i
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:45.520]  told i could never come back until i talked to a crisis counselor i uh i've been told by my
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:50.720]  teachers that i was not allowed to talk about libertarian ideas before and after class and um
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:56.560]  oh yeah universities everywhere if you even talk at lunch or in a courtyard to one person about
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:03.440]  freedom uh you're being given academic suspension or probation it's even happening to phd students
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:06.880]  at the university of texas we're doing kind of an undercover thing we're about to start i'm just
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:10.480]  gonna let them know they don't care they're so arrogant where they actually you know basically
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:16.080]  chant we do not have questions we do not ask questions we submit whites are evil this is
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:21.120]  white people we are bringing in world government i mean it is it is total cult level control
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:26.400]  so so tell me about your um evil that you committed you talked to someone after class
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.440]  that's not allowed and you and you got in some trouble for talking in america absolutely the
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:35.520]  day before it happened i was in a conversation with a veteran next to me i was talking about
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:42.400]  how abortion was just about um huge population control and dehumanizing and uh it got the whole
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:47.280]  class in their own little clique talking about politics and my professor walked in my welding
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:51.760]  professor and he said i don't even want to know because everybody had started clapping alex but
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.680]  didn't they weren't clapping for me they were clapping against me they were tired of hearing
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:01.680]  my political dissidents and they hated me alex but um i i tried to leave i i went to my my uh
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:05.920]  professor and i told him i can't do this you're trying to impress my pursuit of happiness i only
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.600]  want to talk about life literally in the pursuit of happiness i'm just not mature enough to go a
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:15.600]  single day without talking about my passion and um they they told me i couldn't do it and that
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.920]  i packed up my stuff and i tried to leave i'll only say how this works you shouldn't let them win
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:26.240]  and i get once class starts you can't be disruptive and it's not and it wasn't a political class i
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:32.320]  would do it on the grounds at lunch in the parking lot the folks you talked to but it does show the
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:37.680]  mindset of people where in a group they get a thrill out of shutting speech down and they're
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:40.960]  going to enjoy when their bank accounts are taken they're going to enjoy when they're forcibly
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:47.200]  inoculated but they've been taught groupthink and the power of hissing and shouting somebody down
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:52.240]  good to hear from you but you know i just you can't be disruptive and i'm not saying you were
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:59.120]  disruptive uh but you're saying you packed up yourself and left because of it uh i'm not saying
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.440]  you're in the wrong i think they're in the wrong but you've got to know when to hold them know when
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:07.040]  to fold them know when to walk away know when to run never count your money when you're sitting
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:11.520]  at the table they'll be calm enough for counting when the deal is done uh let's go ahead and talk
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:17.840]  to mike in illinois you're on the air go ahead hey alex nice talk to you again uh i've spent
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.680]  some time researching this and i've kind of written it out so let me just spit it out real quick and
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.080]  i want your opinion on it um if people think what's been done in this country under the current
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:32.160]  administration is bad it's what is yet to come that we need to keep our eye on ultimately it'll
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:36.160]  be the people as a whole that'll either stop or participate in the demise of this country all
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:40.640]  the perversion and anti-american activity that's been pushed or displayed to the population is being
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:46.960]  done with a purpose if we look back just 70 years ago we can see why in germany prior to the adoption
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:51.680]  of national socialist country was comprised of two-thirds protestants and one-third catholic they
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.880]  were essentially a christian nation coming into the 1930s and before the rise of hitler germany
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:01.920]  was considered the most socially progressive country in europe open homosexuality transgendered
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.960]  persons the whole cabaret culture was adopted and trusted upon the population the roaring 20s it
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:13.200]  became super party time correct by the types of people that we would call liberals today in fact
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:19.120]  first recorded male to female gender reassignment surgery occurred in berlin in 1931 this type of
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.680]  activity and behavior was hefted upon the average german who was tolerant because of their christian
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:29.920]  foundations and they're having a real christians are susceptible because we are so open and free
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:36.960]  and then we are taken over by other cults correct so having this thrown in front of their face over
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.440]  and over and over again they saw it as destroying their traditional value system and we're watching
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  it being thrust upon their children it was grinding on the psyche of the average german
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.560]  citizen much like is happening in the united states today then suddenly a tough talking guy
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:55.680]  comes on the scene speaking in populist language about restoring the greatness of germany knowing
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:01.680]  exactly this is exactly what the average citizen desired one of the first actions taken to return
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:05.760]  germany to greatness was the Reichstag fire decree which i know you were totally familiar
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:12.320]  with yeah false then hitler had all the homosexuals in the essay rounded up and killed
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:18.560]  and out of the long knives that pleased the public i'll just ask for it ahead so we can skip a lot
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:23.520]  of it but the Reichstag fire decree opened up all sorts of restrictions on personal liberty
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:29.440]  rights of freedom of expression it even allowed for postal telephonic and telegraphic communications
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:34.800]  to be eavesdropped on i mean it's a mirror of what happened with the patriot act after that they
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:39.120]  started with the book burning which was literally the burning of pornography and associated materials
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:43.200]  and textbooks that were viewed as the source of the perversion and once they set that precedent
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:48.720]  then they could ban all other criticism it got worse and worse and worse then the roundups began
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:52.800]  and once they started concentrating people in ghettos and rounding people up the brow beaten
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:56.800]  population was now effectively scared and it's submission and they started having lockdowns
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:01.440]  of ghettos and checkpoints only in select areas to condition the public same thing now
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:07.040]  absolutely at this point there's submission and worship of god was transformed into
[02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:11.040]  submission and worship of the state and the groundwork was laid for all hell to break loose
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:17.040]  so as scary as the shift in under the current political leadership in america is it's the rapid
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:22.160]  and extreme movement in the other direction that we should all be acutely aware of the people are
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:26.800]  ready to support anyone who's willing to get the job done and this is the point where joseph
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:32.080]  stallens said decades can happen in weeks swinging this country so far in the other direction that
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:36.560]  will find ourselves quickly on the wrong side of history we have a stunningly ignorant brow
[02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:41.840]  beaten population crying out for a strong leader to restore the greatness of america we have the
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:46.160]  legal framework of control in place we have dozens of groups from preppers and patriots to
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:51.360]  transgendered persons who have arrogantly identified themselves thanks to pop culture encouragement
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:56.560]  through tv and whatnot the surveillance structure that's in place to catalog everybody so they
[02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:02.480]  know who's a threat before they ever take a move and that's jade hell we have it's it's all sorts of
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:06.560]  things that have been going on we have religious ethnic and other minorities that have been blamed
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:11.360]  for every ill possible proudly identifying themselves we have leaders emerging who are
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:16.640]  pitching populist messages with a get it done attitude who will pledge to restore the greatness
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:20.960]  of the united states everything is in place we just need the right leader in another catalyst
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.920]  event and we're going to be in deep trouble one has to ask themselves if for instance the republican
[02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:30.880]  tough guy candidate with the populist rhetoric if he were to be elected and with his get it done
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:36.720]  attitude wanted to round up and deport ethnic or religious minorities like hispanics and muslims
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:41.520]  how many people in today's society would really all the folks would go for it and then he'd have
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:47.760]  the president to do it to everybody absolutely so once that starts how is the voice of reason
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:52.960]  ever going to stop it the bottom line is one man is not going to fix the mess in this country
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:58.960]  he will only act to lead us all to our own demise the only way to fix this is for the people themselves
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:05.120]  to find it in their gut to stand up and speak out thank you for letting me get that out sure let me
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:12.560]  say this mike i you wrote that didn't you because i mean that was well written yeah yeah and what
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:18.240]  website is that on what'd you write that for i wrote it last night i emailed a rough copy to
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.960]  david nine i was busy when i wrote it well i know this i was sent some other great stuff
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:26.800]  from an investment banker i met in the cayman islands i read it this morning meant to give it
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:30.720]  to the webmaster to post i didn't i'm going to give that to some of the guys during the break i
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.960]  just i just forget there's so much going on what you wrote really sounds great so why don't you
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:41.600]  send it to show tips at info wars dot com and will post it absolutely the danger of the extremist
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:47.760]  leftist takeover right now is real so i'm fully opposing the democrats if the republicans start
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:53.280]  acting fascist and there's some guy on a white horse i will then oppose them it appears the
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.960]  globalist worldwide though are afraid of fascist movements and they're going with liberal socialist
[02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:05.200]  communist-styled movements uh but this is so outrageous that it makes me wonder if they're
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.040]  trying to condition us to accept a fascist curveball and so i think what you're saying is very very
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:14.720]  important in fact we'll take this five-minute call and put it up as its own video i think it's very
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:20.720]  informative uh what would you call it parallels from nazi germany to america uh or beware of the
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:27.200]  man on a white horse what should we call this piece mike i'm just honored that you would do it
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:31.840]  no sure but we'll put your article up but but i mean what i'm asking is what would you call this
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:38.080]  last five minutes that that that the political climate is ready for fascism i like your first
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.640]  line better because the parallels there they're almost done you can't ignore them they're so
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:48.720]  blatantly obvious well the same british social engineers that set germany up are setting the
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.600]  us up and i'm not saying britain runs it but their systems of control with the british empire
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:59.120]  are the most sophisticated and it's all declassified man they put hitler in they set him up they had
[02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:04.240]  secret treaties uh he was hanging out with the king of england uh he thought that he was playing
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:09.120]  the bad cop forum then england was going to come in and with the us and go after the russians
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:13.920]  they double crossed him started giving weapons to russia he turned an operation barbarosa
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:18.400]  and so i'm not saying hitler was a good guy he was crazy and really bad but he thought he was good
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.360]  and man look how he got set up and the germans were smart but they just could not deal with the
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:30.960]  super you know fifth dimensional level fourth dimensional level chess that british intelligence
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:36.880]  plays i mean it's nasty it's sickening it's filthy it's evil and it's what the british developed in
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:44.000]  a thousand years of war with their neighbors and it's just a system of a map of false reality
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:50.880]  and it's it's a great crime i appreciate your call mike we're going to go to break and do five

[03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:08.000]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:13.760]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network that's right i literally come from me to you
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:20.000]  in deep in the heart of texas from fema region six in occupied territory that we should come in
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:26.400]  with a red dawn intro with anything you're already in the next segment let's jam in some more calls
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:32.080]  denise in texas fema region six thanks for holding her on the ear hey thanks alex thanks for taking
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:38.640]  my calls um listen to pope i wanted to talk about it because i was listening to your insider from
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:44.880]  italy there and he seemed a little over the top demont demonizing the pope and it makes me think
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:51.120]  like you know this kind of worship that we saw that was scary and all the the bright faces millions
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:56.240]  of them out there just for a little tiny glimpse of the pope and the adulation and all this and
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:02.000]  then him demonizing and you have to go okay wait a minute like look at this from a pr perspective
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:07.600]  back in 2000 the the vatican published a study and they expected their major growth in the next
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:13.440]  millennia to be from latin america now they're putting all their catholic charities efforts
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:18.320]  pretty much towards building that population including yes bringing them here so its finances
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:23.920]  on our back that also keeps their base here because being conservative they lost a lot of
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.600]  people with you know their stance against birth control acting liberal they can sell we need to
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:33.440]  educate latin americans that communism is a forward foundation weapon to keep them down
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:39.680]  and and and look i may have gone too far in some cases going after the pope because i feel guilty
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:45.200]  that i didn't criticize uh some of the political aspects of catholicism previously enough and
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:52.240]  then now it's so naked uh that it's got to be exposed i can see the temporal political things
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:56.640]  that the pope's doing from the perspective of the catholic church but if the catholic church
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:01.920]  continues on as a globalist organ it really died it doesn't survive you see what i'm saying
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:07.200]  i think what it's going to be doing though is looking to align itself with whoever is globalism
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.640]  out there and right now i think that that's the fact that you're insider from there is saying
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:18.320]  that you know putin he's casting putin as like an you know the outsider against globalism i think
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:25.280]  that's not so i think that that it's up for grabs and that's why you know russia and iran are aligning
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:31.840]  and and you're right there's a major global power struggle about who will dominate a new bipolar
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:37.920]  world moving from a unipolar world where the united states was the center of power well the thing is
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:41.680]  china never got packed it in and now you see they're stepping up with russia and this has been going
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:48.160]  on for more than a decade you know yeah well it took hard work by the people running the us to
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:53.920]  drive russia and china into each other's arms and screw up the us i mean i'm saying this is sabotage
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:58.960]  by design what they're doing i appreciate your call god bless you they our government is running
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:04.640]  al-qaeda and isis the whole world's learning about it to hurt the united states the globalists want to
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:10.160]  bring this country down and they're doing it from within and without it makes me want to throw up

[03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:25.520]  of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing i want to challenge
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:30.320]  the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to lose you are the tip of the
[03:07:30.320 --> 03:07:34.880]  spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely
[03:07:34.880 --> 03:07:39.600]  changed my life and many other people's lives that i know and the final reason to try x2 is
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:44.320]  that it's so hard to keep in stock we ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is
[03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:49.040]  about to sell out it may be a month or two until more comes in i want to challenge all of you in

[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:16.400]  right now i got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:23.600]  the chair is against the wall the chair is against the wall john has a long mustache john has a
[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:29.280]  long mustache it's 12 o'clock american another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on
[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:40.160]  or behind the lines this is your song but they took a lot of people away people that they thought
[03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:44.320]  we're gonna make trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted to just took them away
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:50.000]  but where we education camps that's what they call it so part of it we have to break through our
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.400]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and
[03:08:54.400 --> 03:09:00.560]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities i have decided we really need camps for adults
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:09.440]  and we need the kind of camps that you all run i mean really all persons of japanese descent
[03:09:09.440 --> 03:09:14.160]  were required to register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:19.760]  almost overnight had built assembly centers come on i'm a star citizen i refuse to recognize you
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:23.920]  guys what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of
[03:09:23.920 --> 03:09:29.120]  constitution lists a lot of people that it starts out with um plus you have a lot of people that
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:33.920]  are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build ids and
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:40.720]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized and they don't support
[03:09:40.720 --> 03:09:46.000]  the united states and they're disloyal to the united states it's our right and our obligation
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.320]  to segregate them from the normal community
[03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:59.840]  is what we're doing here and let's not kid about it we're building a domestic army because the
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:08.240]  government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down really rallying patriots worldwide
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:14.720]  in defense of human liberty it's alex jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:24.800]  so these people will hold themselves out to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:40.720]  terrorists if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:50.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is the fourth hour of overdrive i'm anthony gucciardi
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:55.360]  and i will be your host for the rest of the show we've got a lot of interesting news to cover
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:00.400]  including some news that joe bigs is going to come in and talk about from a firsthand experience
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:06.240]  as well about how isis could be gaining nuclear capabilities and they claim that they're going
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:12.800]  to wipe out millions through some type of religious cleansing ceremony by using nuclear weapons
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:17.920]  we're also going to talk about how the mainstream media is dying we have some victory stories some
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:24.000]  good news some inspirational news some new gallup polls that show that trust in congress is completely
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:30.160]  decimated the mainstream media is dying alternative media is rising and we're going to talk about
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:37.520]  how finally scientists are admitting that obesity and diabetes and a number of other
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:42.320]  conditions are actually a result of the chemicals that you're being exposed to on a daily basis
[03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:48.320]  first i'd like to get right into this new gallup poll which is exciting stuff and we've seen this
[03:11:48.320 --> 03:11:54.400]  pretty much every single year they do want on this subject headline america's trust in media
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:12:00.640]  remains at historic low this is from gallup directly just came out four in ten americans
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:07.120]  trust the mass media only four ties 2014 and 2012 for the lowest trust level in gallup's trend
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:12.160]  younger americans less likely than older to trust the media says four in ten americans say
[03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:16.800]  they have a great deal or fair amount of trust and confidence in the mass media to report on
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:23.440]  the news fully accurately and fairly so it ties in with the past couple years so about four in
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:29.200]  ten americans actually trust the mainstream media and you know i went to cnn i read this gallup poll
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:34.080]  and i decided well you know i'm going to go to cnn and see how how much i trust the mainstream media
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:41.360]  which of course is not much but i did discover he breaking news under their featured news section
[03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:48.640]  such as facts of life star kim fields joins real housewives of atlanta that is of course
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:53.600]  essential breaking news don't worry about isis getting nuclear weapons or some type of event
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:58.720]  inside the united states or really anything that's important you take the good you take the bad you
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:03.200]  take them both and what you have a beloved sitcom schoolgirls and their house mother
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:10.800]  let's see what the ladies have been up to since the show 1988 wow key news second piece of key
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:16.000]  news from the mainstream media which no one trusts anymore again this is under featured news on cnn.com
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:24.240]  l l cool j son naji smith arrested after a restaurant fight lace l l cool j son was arrested
[03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:28.640]  early tuesday in new york after a fight in a restaurant where two law enforcement sources
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:36.800]  blah blah blah wow really important news thank you mainstream media it's no surprise and no wonder
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:41.200]  that so many people are turning to real independent news media and tired of the mainstream media
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:47.280]  every single time we turn on the television or we go to websites like cnn there's some
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:52.640]  important news mixed in but it always seems like the celebrity culture and the gossip culture and
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:57.040]  whatever the weirdness of the day is is mixed in with this top stuff and there's nothing wrong
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:01.760]  with looking at the celebrity culture or the fun weird silly news or whatever
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:05.840]  that sometimes populates some of the websites that we all visit there's nothing wrong with that
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:12.960]  but when they mix in things like l l cool j son being arrested next to isis reportedly getting ready
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:17.200]  to kill millions of people that's a little bit of a disconnect and of course the fact that we all
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:23.280]  know the mainstream media is feeding us a bunch of horse manure but gallop didn't stop there
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:27.840]  here's another poll and this seems to be the same thing over and over again
[03:14:28.560 --> 03:14:32.720]  majority americans see congress as out of touch and corrupt gee you think
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:40.240]  however likely drama over to fund the government past september 30 unfolds most americans appear to
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:46.000]  have little faith in most lawmakers to do the right thing gee now most lawmakers are corrupt
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:50.800]  out of touch and favor special interest according to the poll 48 percent say their own representative
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:57.360]  is out of touch 32 percent say their own member is corrupt and obviously there is massive amounts
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:02.640]  of corruption but that's admitted because insider trading is allowed the fact of the matter is
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:08.080]  that we have lost faith in our so-called government we have lost faith in our so-called
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:13.840]  electives you know our elected individuals that are supposed to represent us in all of our ways
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:20.320]  and our thoughts and our desires there's no question that there is an ideological collapse
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:26.000]  of america that has already begun whether or not that will follow with a physical type of economic
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:31.200]  collapse or whatever the ideal the ideology of america has already collapsed and that's why so
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:36.480]  many of us are waiting for a catalyst to really begin and speaking of catalysts we're going to
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:42.240]  talk in the bottom of the hour with joe biggs about some of these articles and he has some
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:47.920]  insider information about when he was in afghanistan and iraq on interacting with some of these
[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:56.720]  extremists crazy people isis nuclear weapons this is from hngn terrorist group plans to kill
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:03.200]  hundreds of millions in largest religious cleansing in history says report isis is planning to use
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:08.320]  nuclear weapons to launch a global assault on anyone who holds differing religious beliefs
[03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:15.360]  all in the name of worshiping a law according to german journalist jergen todenhofer who in 2014
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:19.840]  was the first wettern western reporter allowed to embed with a terrorist outfit and live to tell
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:25.120]  about it spending 10 days in northern iraq with its fighters so we're going to talk about that too
[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:31.520]  a western journalist spent 10 days with isis apparently and he has some stories to tell about
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:36.960]  it and their plans to do all this madness and we'll talk about how putin says that's basically
[03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:43.680]  just american backed bs another report from ibt international business times islamic state
[03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:48.320]  nuclear weapons isis claims it can smuggle devices through nigeria mexico to the united states and
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:54.480]  that was on june 3rd 2015 isis nuclear weapon islamic state claims it can buy nukes from pakistan
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:17:00.880]  within a year in propaganda magazine that was from may 23rd 2015 so this has been going on
[03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:06.080]  for a very long time later towards the end of the hour we're also going to speak to paul joseph
[03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:11.440]  watson who was sick today so i decided to fill in for him and he's going to come and host the show
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:15.600]  tomorrow but he's also going to talk about some of the breaking and exclusives that he's got tomorrow
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:21.120]  and reveal a little bit of it today at the end of the hour as well so let's get into some more news
[03:17:21.120 --> 03:17:26.000]  and also talk about there was a caller that was on hold unfortunately he dropped i wanted to talk to
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:32.720]  him he had called into alex right before we jumped over to the overdrive hour and was talking about
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:38.160]  people that just attack everybody and without getting in any specifics of who was talking about
[03:17:38.160 --> 03:17:41.920]  or anything like that he did it pretty cordially so you know there's people that will just attack
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:49.120]  anybody with a message and i find that you make yourself a target when you decide to have an opinion
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:53.760]  because if you think about all the historical figures all the powerful figures that we all
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:18:00.480]  know today whether you believe in them or not whether it's jesus or ghandi or buddha or anyone
[03:18:00.480 --> 03:18:05.360]  that you believe to be you know have have done an amazing things and really stood for something
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:12.720]  what happened to them well they were harassed or tortured or killed or at least made fun of and
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:18.720]  insulted in numerous different ways and hated to this day because you will find that when you stand
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:24.960]  for something others will at the most base levels of their humanity for some reason hate you and
[03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:31.600]  there are people that all they want to do is kind of like if you were able to sprout wings and fly
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:37.120]  away and fly high and have an amazing life they would just pull on those wings and pull you down
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:43.040]  to the ground just because they don't have wings and when you decide to enter the so-called arena
[03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:47.840]  of information and talk about these kind of things talk about the mainstream media dying and talk
[03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:52.080]  about the real information in the news and the life-saving stuff talking about avoiding the
[03:18:52.080 --> 03:18:56.240]  chemicals that give you cancer talking about all that kind of stuff there's always going to be
[03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:02.480]  be a core group that will incessantly want to attack you and bring you down and the caller was
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:07.040]  kind of touching on some of those things about total negativity and toxic people I think it's in
[03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:13.040]  all branches but really when you make the decision to make yourself a figure of truth and a figure
[03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:18.080]  of anything and we're all we all make mistakes we all have our own issues right we're all a little
[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:22.080]  messed up in some ways but we try our best overall to help people and that's what matters most and
[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:26.880]  when you do that you make yourself a serious target of all forms of attacks from mentally ill
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:31.360]  people from people that are hurting themselves from people that really don't know what's going on
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:36.320]  and at the end of the day that I think is an important thing to consider we'll be back we're
[03:19:36.320 --> 03:19:40.480]  going to talk to Joe Biggs not in this next segment but in the next segment we're going to cover all
[03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:56.400]  the news more about ISIS bands on GMO crops in the EU more victory news more good news stay tuned

[03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:14.240]  alex jones show this is the fourth hour overdrive i'm anthony gucciardi your host for the rest of
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:21.520]  the hour and you know if you think about life just 100 years ago and how different it is today
[03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:27.600]  in the ways that were inconceivable at the time and the predictions of flying cars and total
[03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:32.560]  insanity and how wrong they were it really puts into perspective how we don't know what's going
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:37.600]  to happen even in the next few decades because of the time spiral system that we're all familiar
[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:45.200]  with technology has advanced in such a way that 2030 and 2040 i believe would be similar to 1800
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:50.640]  and 1900 just because of the advancements and technology that we're now seeing this article
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:57.680]  from the telegraph caught my eye very interesting very uh demented by 2050 human on robot sex will
[03:24:57.680 --> 03:25:02.560]  be more common than human on human sex says report a shocking new report from a futurologist
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:06.720]  reveals predictions about the future of sex and robots pretty graphics don't only get totally
[03:25:06.720 --> 03:25:10.960]  into it but says can you imagine having sex with a humanoid robot apparently this will be the norm
[03:25:10.960 --> 03:25:16.880]  in a few short decades dr. ian pierce has released a report which he predicts the future of sex i don't
[03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:21.520]  think it's possible to predict the future up to 2050 because of the massive advancements in
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:27.760]  technology i remember there's a project i think it's called the 2055 project i could be wrong
[03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:34.080]  and it says that by 2020 we'll start having artificial bodies and by about 2050 we'll hit
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:38.880]  complete singularity i don't really see that as the case i think it'll take a bit longer than that
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:44.240]  because of the political fight for you know against artificial intelligence but it is
[03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:49.760]  pretty insane it's like the movie x machina which is a great movie where essentially a tech founder
[03:25:49.760 --> 03:25:56.000]  that's very similar to google starts a sex robot company and starts taking over with these concepts
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:01.280]  and it basically he can't keep up with it and the ai system he created becomes so intelligent
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:06.400]  that it eventually kills him some interesting stuff but i want to open up the phone lines and
[03:26:06.400 --> 03:26:12.240]  take some calls i also want to talk about some victory and some good news austria and italy
[03:26:12.240 --> 03:26:18.320]  celebrate bans on gmo crops with e you opt out austrian health minister subpoena open
[03:26:18.320 --> 03:26:22.880]  overhauser and a number of italian ministers have confirmed that both countries are officially
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:29.040]  requesting an opt out from growing growing eight varieties of gma's permitted or to be set permitted
[03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:32.400]  at the u level so they're basically opting out saying we don't want to grow this we don't want
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:37.520]  this it's a huge victory even if you support gmo's is a huge victory because they're saying hey
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:42.480]  we're our own individual countries and we're going to do what we want let's jump into some calls
[03:26:42.480 --> 03:26:46.480]  before the next segment when joe biggs is going to talk about the latest developments of isis and
[03:26:46.480 --> 03:26:50.800]  how they apparently have nuclear weapons and want to kill millions of people in total insanity

[03:28:04.720 --> 03:28:09.600]  extremely close and i'm pretty i'm pretty sure he did knew a couple hours about all the inside

[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:21.280]  really well so we can ask him that question too but yes definitely an interesting case well thank

[03:29:03.520 --> 03:29:07.440]  on the ground telling people what's going on or you're talking about like an armed revolution
[03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:12.880]  because i think really the battle is and i can see the statistics on social media with my pages
[03:29:12.880 --> 03:29:18.080]  and other pages and alex's pages there's such a massive reach i mean alex his page alone i think

[03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:28.880]  things is spreading the word but it's also doing more than that it really results and translates

[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:06.240]  addressing the issue of pedophilia within the catholic church we have this former house speaker
[03:30:06.240 --> 03:30:12.000]  denis hashter negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid 3.5 million in hush money to cover up
[03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:17.280]  sexual contact with a male the daily mail reports a may indictment says has her degree to pay 3.5
[03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:21.920]  million to someone identified only as individual a to hide past misconduct it has been claimed that
[03:30:21.920 --> 03:30:26.480]  individual a is a victim of sexual abuse that hasard was attempting to silence citing anonymous
[03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:30.800]  sources the ap reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct
[03:30:30.800 --> 03:30:35.120]  believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher before leaving congress in 2007
[03:30:35.120 --> 03:30:39.040]  hashter was the longest ever serving republican speaker because when you have skeletons in the
[03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:45.040]  closet you are easy to control hashter was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981
[03:30:45.040 --> 03:30:49.280]  hashter took groups of boys on foreign trips including diving expeditions to the bahamas

[03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:22.480]  overdrive i'm anthony gucciardi and we're about to talk about some really interesting news and
[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:29.360]  we've got joe bigs here the staff sergeant he was in afghanistan iraq he's got some news to talk about
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:33.840]  on breaking news on isis and i've got some stacks of news here too but i want to hear his personal
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:38.480]  take on this and when he's really experienced firsthand when he was over there but here's
[03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:42.960]  the headline isis nuclear weapons terrorist group plans to kill hundreds of millions in
[03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:48.640]  largest religious cleansing in history says report and then previously we have isis claims
[03:33:48.640 --> 03:33:54.000]  it can smuggle devices through nigeria mexico to the united states isis nuclear weapon islamic state
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:59.440]  claims it can buy nukes from pakistan within a year and their propaganda magazine might just be
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:06.320]  be completely contrived lies but joe bigs what do you think there's definitely possible you know
[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:14.160]  we definitely created these guys by going in and invading iraq based off lies we created a radical
[03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:18.640]  islam to say i mean imagine you're a home you've already got a problem with the taliban you know
[03:34:18.640 --> 03:34:23.360]  these other groups out there that are very extreme which really represent a one percent of islam
[03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:28.080]  and they can't stand those guys but then you have western allies come in and start bombing
[03:34:28.080 --> 03:34:32.320]  the hell out of your town who are you going to hate more the fear of the bogeyman or the actual
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:36.480]  bogeyman who's dropping bombs and taking your family out and that's how that's how you create
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:40.560]  this radical islam these guys are sitting around like man i hate isis now all of a sudden they're
[03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:43.920]  getting bombed and they're losing their families they're like well you know what isis might not
[03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:48.240]  be as bad let's go join them the west is really pissing me off and that's kind of what's happened
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:53.040]  so what i want to talk about is a book that jergen toddenhofer wrote it's called inside is tens
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:57.520]  ten days inside the islamic state now this is a german reporter who embedded with the islamic
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:04.480]  state for ten days he's the only western journalist to uh live and come out of it alive uh he got back
[03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:10.160]  a little bit less than a year ago when he wrote this book and basically what he said is is the
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:14.720]  terrorist plan on killing several hundred million people the west is drastically underestimating the
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:19.280]  power of isis and i know anytime we post or say anything about isis don't you mean the cia don't
[03:35:19.280 --> 03:35:23.120]  you mean that and they have to hear that same little story all the time by people yeah we know
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:28.000]  it's just like if i'm a man i have my wife we have a kid i can control what my kid does up until
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:32.080]  a certain age but then it's an adult it can go do whatever it wants all right we might have started
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:38.400]  isis but it's now grown into this super powerhouse and it can basically do whatever it wants it's
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:42.960]  broken away but at the same time even though it's broken away and we know that our our kids doing
[03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:47.920]  bad so to say the u.s government's creation is doing bad they're still arming these guys
[03:35:47.920 --> 03:35:53.520]  now isis intends to get his hands on nuclear weapons uh tadenhofer says the group uh says
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:36:00.160]  that a nuclear tsunami will basically kill off a large population of people in this religious
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:06.320]  cleansing and uh they now control a land greater in size in the united kingdom and are supported by
[03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:11.520]  an almost ecstatic enthusiasm the likes of which you've never seen in a combat zone i've been in
[03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:16.960]  combat zones i've seen the afghan army operate they're weak they uh they're not motivated they
[03:36:16.960 --> 03:36:21.040]  get scared easily the first time you have signs of someone who's bigger than them they kind of back
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:25.840]  away and will give their arms off like we're seeing with the rebels in syria and so forth and so on
[03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:29.200]  we're supposedly dropping these weapons and what do they do they give them al-nazra they give them
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:34.400]  to isis al-qaeda whoever because these guys are bigger and stronger so that's something that we have
[03:36:34.400 --> 03:36:40.640]  to stop doing this whole funding these guys this whole dropping ammo uh off and weapons to these
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:45.200]  guys isn't working obviously and they raid the bases and just take it all but my question is so
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:50.880]  this guy he's a western journalist did he fly over there with the intention of getting in with
[03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:55.120]  isis or what well this is a thing he flew over there and how do you how do you thought he was
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:36:59.200]  going to get killed he thought he would get killed but he was planning on writing this book he's
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:04.160]  written many books before about uh iraq the invasion with you know going in after Saddam
[03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:09.840]  Hussein and uh he was given a letter he said i received a secured a security guarantee from the
[03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:14.400]  caliphate he's like but obviously there was no way to find out that was a guarantee now after the
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:19.360]  the fact that he's back he says the guarantee turned out to be genuine and the isis uh group
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:24.640]  stuck with their agreement during our visit to mazol and raka he said earn that under that time
[03:37:24.640 --> 03:37:29.200]  i was surveilled by the secret service and had to hand over my mobile phone and laptops from
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:33.200]  time to time so they could look through the pictures he'd taken the video and all that
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:37.280]  and then he said isis also went through his pictures and deleted some to protect the relatives of
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:44.640]  forward fighters that's what censorship is now there's a copy in this uh it almost sounds like
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:49.280]  a propaganda piece though to go over there oh i i was accepted but i'm not saying this is untrue
[03:37:49.280 --> 03:37:55.920]  it's just you know playing devil's advocate here go over there get taken in by isis for 10 days
[03:37:55.920 --> 03:38:00.800]  and come back and talk about how they're way more powerful than we thought they could wipe out hundreds
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:05.840]  millions of people this is what they want to do you know i mean is he not slanting it towards
[03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:10.000]  they're much greater than we thought or what i mean it's possible i mean you got to think any time
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:13.600]  that anyone's been held by them for some time when they get on video you hear him saying oh the
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:18.240]  islamic state's great this and that he could have definitely been you know playing to their whole
[03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:21.680]  thing because he doesn't want to get killed or they could have threatened his family who knows at
[03:38:21.680 --> 03:38:25.680]  the same time the georgia guys don't say that they want to take out a large population of the people
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:30.240]  maybe the end of the day this is their in game they want to use this creation isis to wipe out a
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:34.400]  large population of people so they can do whatever it is they want to do right as alex said of course
[03:38:34.400 --> 03:38:38.560]  isis could just be a way of just blaming things on the isis group you know something bad happens
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:42.640]  oh is isis you know a nuclear weapon because off it was isis anything oh when you have something
[03:38:42.640 --> 03:38:46.000]  bad going on in the way that you know something's not working out the way you want it you create
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:50.240]  another problem to take away from the other and everyone hates isis there's there's no one that's
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:56.080]  going to say well isis isn't that bad you know isis is literally the devil in terms of the
[03:38:56.080 --> 03:39:01.520]  political spectrum you know isis is just the worst most concentrated evil that could possibly exist
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:04.880]  and it's tainting everything like you were talking about earlier less than one percent
[03:39:04.880 --> 03:39:09.040]  of the muslim community is actually radically no etc etc but uh sorry go on with all this
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:14.640]  yeah i mean so i've been over there before and like i said i've seen how these these people act
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:19.360]  you know a lot of people think that you know isis these are a bunch of guys are cave dwellers they're
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:22.880]  they're idiots they don't know what they're doing no they're usually pretty intelligent people
[03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:27.360]  you know the times that i was uh in the calse province in afghanistan i was between uh
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:33.440]  uh fob salerno which is a forward observation base and tears iedc and that's on the western part
[03:39:33.440 --> 03:39:38.960]  of afghanistan on the pakistan border and we were doing a convoy from salerno back to the dc where i
[03:39:38.960 --> 03:39:43.920]  lived and we caught uh three guys trying to replace an iedc which is an improvised explosive device
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:49.600]  like a car a bomb they put in a road a roadside bomb and the guys that we stopped we found these
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:55.040]  guys were professors they had degrees they were scientists you know chemists all this stuff these
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:39:59.920]  weren't just random they're trying to take our jobs you know like you know farmers out there they
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:04.640]  have maybe the the slant is that isis is these crazy losers that don't know what they're talking
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:08.720]  about in reality they might be a lot stronger than we think i think it is possible i mean because
[03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:12.720]  i've seen how it happens over there when you go in and you start bombing a group of people just
[03:40:12.720 --> 03:40:17.680]  imagine the people here started bombing us people that we never even thought about all the sudden
[03:40:17.680 --> 03:40:22.720]  your hate for the the u.s government or distrust in the u.s government's going to start to go away
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:25.840]  and you're going to start not being mad at them anymore you're going to be mad at the bombs coming
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:30.400]  overhead that just took out your family and that's what's happening we've taken this distraction away
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:35.520]  and we've created another so there's a whole lot of craziness going on up there but i mean this guy
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:40.400]  wrote a really interesting piece talking about uh like you said that uh you know he's he was able
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:44.720]  to spend two days in this isis reception camp close to the turkish border he said in those two
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:49.840]  days each day there was about 50 plus people who came through these people came from the u.s england
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:54.160]  sweden russia france and germany so yeah you're going to get a lot of young kids that come out
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:40:58.560]  there that see this it's this new trendy cool thing to be part of the caliphate apparently
[03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:02.400]  and those are the ones that get killed off easy because most of those guys are probably idiots
[03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:07.440]  but you're going to have a lot of people who have lived in those areas who are you know hardcore
[03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:12.640]  against isis hardcore against uh the taliban insurgents all that and then all of a sudden they
[03:41:12.640 --> 03:41:16.240]  started getting bombed and they're sitting there going you know what screw this i'm going to join
[03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:20.160]  these guys because at least i have a fighting chance we already know the u.s is giving them
[03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:24.880]  weapons i'm going to have better weapons than the the forces here in iraq or the forces in syria
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:30.240]  to fight against them these guys are outnumbered i mean we've got they've got more people they're
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:37.040]  seizing oil fields are taking over airstrips it seems like a an attractive scenario so what's
[03:41:37.040 --> 03:41:42.720]  your take on isis claiming it can smuggle devices through nigeria and mexico and nuclear weapons
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:46.720]  and saying that it could you know eventually bring them to the united states and start blasting them
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:54.240]  off i mean that's extremely possible i mean there's so many canals and tunnels from the
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:41:59.200]  mexico to u.s side that's what the cartels use to smuggle this stuff and anyone who thinks that
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:04.400]  a group like isis doesn't have the money to pay off a cartel just to let them look the other way
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:09.040]  or to help them get them through a tunnel they're out of their mind i've walked across the border
[03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:14.880]  dressed as an isis jihadi i've walked across dressed in civilian attire it's wide open the
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:19.360]  given there are a lot of places where there's fences but guess what video is insane of you dressing up
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:23.920]  like osama bin laden wasn't it no no osama bin laden was james o' keith i dressed up like the isis
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:28.080]  jihadi with the flag like isis and chopped off the head you had like a fake beheading and you
[03:42:28.080 --> 03:42:32.480]  walked across the mexico border we're just screaming and everything and no one said anything
[03:42:32.480 --> 03:42:37.360]  huh no one even cared nope no helicopters coming in no border patrol no ice agents anything like
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:42.560]  that just walked across freely didn't get bothered actually sat out there for a long time and filmed
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:47.360]  some other videos where i burned an isis flag and you know so and then you saw a bunch of
[03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:53.040]  presumably illegal smuggling drugs in in in a van right and that was laredo texas yes so i went
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:57.040]  down there the day before trump was supposed to speak and i went out to do a stand up to talk
[03:42:57.040 --> 03:43:02.320]  about trump coming in and his immigration policy so to say and how he wants to build this wall
[03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:07.680]  and over my shoulder there's seven guys coming across the uh Rio Grande with these huge satchels
[03:43:07.680 --> 03:43:12.880]  and this red suburban pulls up trunk opens up and these guys load in the drugs jump back across
[03:43:13.520 --> 03:43:18.400]  at that time the board patrol just driven away by the way i said illegals that according to
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:23.200]  south park's pc principal i don't know if you've seen that oh yes the great episode where it breaks
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:28.320]  down political correct me dude i actually should not have said illegals i should have said undocumented
[03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:34.240]  citizens is what i should have said and i apologize for that i was not politically correct
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:38.720]  in that statement and you can't say businessman or business woman because that singles out
[03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:43.440]  folksmen so you have to say spokesperson or business person because we live in a pc world
[03:43:43.440 --> 03:43:47.840]  now just like the kid who had the confederate flag on his backpack and was kicked out because
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:53.360]  it's offensive let's lock the school down and so i guess you've seen that episode and i've seen
[03:43:53.360 --> 03:43:58.480]  the trump episode too yes i think the creators of that show are genius oh yeah and basically pc
[03:43:58.480 --> 03:44:02.960]  principal comes in politically correct principal and cartman has said spokesman or something like
[03:44:02.960 --> 03:44:08.400]  that and pc principal just beats him it's uh it's actually it's actually inappropriate but a great
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:13.200]  and then kyle makes fun of uh bruce Jenner and that's the reason he gets he gets four days of
[03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:18.320]  tension because he didn't say katlyn Jenner because he didn't say katlyn Jenner was a hero
[03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:25.040]  and because he said bruce too as well absolutely because bruce is you know homophobic transphobic
[03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:30.640]  misogynist sexist the katlyn Jenner formerly known as bruce yeah he should she should take
[03:44:30.640 --> 03:44:34.320]  a line from prince and become and it's funny because they're sitting down and they've got like
[03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:38.720]  the the whole uh all the the fathers and you know south park and they're sitting there like
[03:44:38.720 --> 03:44:44.320]  you know katlyn Jenner is a hero uh a great uh great person who katlyn Jenner is a hero
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:48.000]  katlyn Jenner is a hero all right guys i'm doing a live facebook mention oh look at that it's alex he
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:52.720]  comes on and he's doing facebook mentions live hey everybody hello did i tell you guys i was coming
[03:44:52.720 --> 03:44:57.920]  in here no no uh i saw you were covering when i was in my office because you don't got a tv on
[03:44:58.720 --> 03:45:02.560]  doing the fourth hour and i got mad at myself and this is something i preach at you guys all day
[03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:07.920]  about and i but i tell you when i preach at you it's about me too i'm preaching to myself
[03:45:07.920 --> 03:45:15.200]  we get this learned helplessness we get this learned normalcy bias where we're around this news
[03:45:15.200 --> 03:45:21.360]  this information so long so intensely that we get to where huge news doesn't even affect us like
[03:45:21.360 --> 03:45:26.800]  darpa admitting this week yeah we put brain chips in people but we've done that you've heard the rumors
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:31.760]  people called us cooks now it's confirmed uh or them coming out admitting okay endocrine
[03:45:31.760 --> 03:45:37.200]  disruptors are causing massive cancer that was in the news today the fact that they're saying
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:42.800]  armageddon holocaust uh what was that the word that's an egg cleansing what was the word obama
[03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:48.080]  using a speech uh armageddon apocalyptic apocalyptic that was an apocalyptic and now they're saying
[03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:53.520]  isis may have nuclear weapons now they're saying isis may have dirty bombs our criminal hijack
[03:45:53.520 --> 03:45:57.440]  government not our general government but the people at the top created this group on record
[03:45:57.440 --> 03:46:02.720]  we now have the former head of defense intelligence the general public talking to the mic to all of
[03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:06.480]  this is happening oh and of course you guys are on air i should be talking into the mic excuse me
[03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:11.120]  the point is is that i'm in there watching them and like there's bigz and gucciardi because i'll
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:16.480]  let you guys pick whatever topic you want covering what i should have been covering for three hours
[03:46:16.480 --> 03:46:24.880]  today uh and it's the fact that american jihad is top isis commander uh isidi slave that reveals
[03:46:24.880 --> 03:46:30.320]  that she was beaten and held captive by u.s citizen who directs attacks and keeps vile of poison to
[03:46:30.320 --> 03:46:34.640]  kill himself have caught but the point is they've allowed a major infiltration they said six months
[03:46:34.640 --> 03:46:38.480]  ago the immigrant wave would be about that here they are openly saying they're getting ready to
[03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:44.240]  nuke us and i'm not even making a big deal out of this i'm not saying nukes are coming i'm saying
[03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:49.280]  the globalists are fully able to let a group do something like this or do it and blame it on them
[03:46:49.280 --> 03:46:54.560]  to bring in martial law and all the preparations we've seen isis nuclear weapons terrorist group
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:59.520]  plans to kill hundreds of millions in largest religious cleansing and history says report and
[03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:05.040]  what's crazy is everything isis keeps saying they're going to do a hundred times bigger than al-qaeda
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:09.200]  literally they're doing they said six months ago we're going to invade european immigrant waves it
[03:47:09.200 --> 03:47:13.200]  happened they said we're going to attack russia it happened we're going to attack france it happened
[03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:18.160]  we're going to attack america it happened so this isn't synthetic care these are real jihad groups
[03:47:18.160 --> 03:47:23.840]  funded and protected and nested in a nursery by the criminals that run our government so i want to
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:29.040]  ask what's their master plan and you know facebook mentions this supposedly a deal just about your
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:34.160]  own personal life well it is my personal life dammit i've got three children i don't want them
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:37.520]  getting hit with a nuke i'm in a major target always military bases you're in a major target
[03:47:37.520 --> 03:47:42.400]  here in austin guarantee austin's major target probably at number three or four after dc uh new
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:48.640]  york or la and the globalists have absolutely set this group up hundreds of thousands of operatives
[03:47:48.640 --> 03:47:53.600]  left the borders open to let them infiltrate we're getting contacted in fact i forgot to
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:57.360]  tell you that by high level people that's one reason they have the feds watching us the bad
[03:47:57.360 --> 03:48:00.720]  feds is they don't a lot of good feds are aware of what's happening and have been exposing what's
[03:48:00.720 --> 03:48:05.360]  going on this is a crazy time to be alive right now i'm going to go and finish a briefing for
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:10.560]  facebook mentions folks and people can find this feed at info wars dot com forward slash show
[03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:14.480]  with joe bigs and anthony uchiarty i'm going to throw it back to you but i just normally would
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:18.800]  run around and say see i'm mad at myself or you didn't cover something big or why aren't we covering
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:23.200]  this because i'll bitch at them or i'll bitch at myself i dropped the ball today barely mentioning
[03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:28.320]  this we can't drop the ball on this we have to expose what's happening even bright marts reporting
[03:48:28.320 --> 03:48:33.600]  their letting syrian refugees come into the u.s illegally out of mexico so that's gone from being
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:38.000]  a conspiracy theory to confirmed back to the live transmission great job guys anything you want to
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:42.480]  say anthony uchiarty the viewers well i think it's really simple things are so insane that we forget
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:46.800]  the realistic grasp of where we are i mean when we have ice is saying they're going to kill millions
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:50.560]  of people or hundreds of millions people in a religious cleansing that sounds so insane you
[03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:54.480]  don't even process it in your brain well government won't fight them well it makes no sense to fight
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:48:59.680]  them well more bad and months ago they made fun of me for going into an opera mexico to look for
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:04.400]  these bases the judicial watch reported on the fbi even came out and said that that's a credible
[03:49:04.400 --> 03:49:09.840]  source of information that that's very possible they don't have the jurisdiction to go into mexico
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:14.000]  and actually look so they were counting on someone like me who could go in freely and look around to
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:18.320]  give them some intel they just they they're not even going to do it and everyone's coming out saying
[03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:22.080]  it's possible that you can come across the border it's wide open but you have the democrat saying
[03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:26.800]  oh the border's fine let everybody across no there is a serious problem do this building a giant
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:31.360]  arresting people in germany to criticize it yeah and and now you've got facebook you got you've got
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:35.600]  uh zuckerberg merkel all sitting there saying hey yeah we're going to start monitoring facebook to
[03:49:35.600 --> 03:49:40.160]  make sure that people aren't saying anything that could be seen as racist against these uh
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:44.400]  migrants coming across because you know we don't need that that's ridiculous the political correctness
[03:49:44.400 --> 03:49:48.880]  is not a suicide pact go ahead people don't believe this because in their daily lives nothing is being
[03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:52.800]  directly impacting them so that's a cognitive dissonance of sorts like we're here freaking out

[03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:16.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is the fourth hour of overdrive i'm anthony gucciardi
[03:54:16.400 --> 03:54:22.160]  and we're here with joe bigs we just talked about some pretty insane news and alex popped in while
[03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:27.840]  doing a live stream on his facebook mentions which he's on facebook you can follow him follow myself
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:32.240]  as well on my page and he has something called facebook mentions was just where you can live
[03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:37.120]  stream and it's a really cool function you should check it out anyway so we were talking about isis
[03:54:37.120 --> 03:54:42.960]  and their plan to use nuclear weapons to religiously cleanse millions and millions of people and joe
[03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:46.880]  just mentioned a new story came out and he wanted to highlight that what's going on all right so
[03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:52.160]  there's a new article out of info wars dot com by michael failin obama gave over 1500 terrace
[03:54:52.160 --> 03:54:57.120]  asylum in u.s documents reveal now documents obtained by judicial watch revealed that the
[03:54:57.120 --> 03:55:04.080]  obama administration gave as many as 1519 terrace asylum in the u.s in 2014 now according to the
[03:55:04.080 --> 03:55:08.880]  government watchdog the administration let that many people in uh before the obama administration
[03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:13.440]  tweaked a federal law last year these four nationals would have been banned from the country for
[03:55:13.440 --> 03:55:17.920]  supporting terrace causes judicial watch rights but under the changes the security of homeland
[03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:24.080]  security has discretionary authority to waive certain grounds of that and to let people come in
[03:55:24.080 --> 03:55:28.240]  and stay and have asylum so this fits in right with what we're talking about the borders are open
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:34.640]  not only are the borders open now we have the government allowing these terrace to come in
[03:55:34.640 --> 03:55:40.400]  and gain asylum and one of the things inside this uh book i'm reading by jergen toddenhofer
[03:55:40.400 --> 03:55:44.960]  where he's talking about inside the uh is he says he thinks the greatest threat would be people who
[03:55:44.960 --> 03:55:49.760]  are already in the other countries not the ones mainly in syria and iraq but the ones who've already
[03:55:49.760 --> 03:55:55.120]  dispersed and are already in the u.s in the u somewhere over that way waiting like a sleeper
[03:55:55.120 --> 03:56:00.000]  cell just to wait no attack right it's an ideological sleeper cell it's not like we know
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:03.760]  that they're affiliated with the group it's an ideological change someone can join isis right
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:06.720]  now someone sitting right here could join isis right now i decided i'm gonna join i says i'm
[03:56:06.720 --> 03:56:10.560]  gonna go blow something up so that of course is the biggest issue and all of this like we were
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:15.200]  talking about before when alex kind of came in here and did his facebook stream this has reached
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:20.800]  a point of insanity where i believe our simple human brains can't understand it anymore i mean
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:25.440]  think about it for thousands of years not only have we not have that had the news hitting us
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:30.640]  with daily updates and the craziness of the world we've really only had to focus on a small tribe
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:35.760]  a tribe that has its own inner politics and infighting and kind of stupid stuff like that
[03:56:35.760 --> 03:56:40.240]  but we've never had to think about like what's going on in afghanistan what's going on in iraq
[03:56:40.240 --> 03:56:44.960]  what's going on in the india pakistan border what's going on north south korea what's going on in
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:50.400]  texas pennsylvania kansas oklahoma just everywhere around the world all the geo locations all
[03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:54.960]  converging onto one point and there's so many different hot zones of all these things that
[03:56:54.960 --> 03:56:59.360]  we've never been able to understand or know about before that our human brain is thinking
[03:56:59.360 --> 03:57:04.480]  gee how do i possibly understand this how do i understand isis taking nukes to kill hundreds of
[03:57:04.480 --> 03:57:09.520]  well most americans are spoiled you got to think most most americans daily struggle in life is
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:15.280]  their coffee machine breaking or online or cyber bullying or you know someone fat shaming or
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:19.360]  something like that or we've got petty things like this feminism stuff and all these other
[03:57:19.360 --> 03:57:23.600]  little things that we create so we have something to bitch about and complain all right these people
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:29.360]  live every day in guerrilla warfare and at the same time they're getting their doctorates and
[03:57:29.360 --> 03:57:34.000]  becoming physicists and chemists and things like that while their homes are being bombed while their
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:39.200]  families are being kidnapped murdered raped beaten tortured every day people in america need to wake
[03:57:39.200 --> 03:57:42.960]  up and understand guess what there's a lot of bad things going on in this country and you need to
[03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:47.840]  pull your head out of your butt because your daily struggle of trying to get a coffee and come into
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:54.400]  work on time or your volvo or your new set of rims on your car is bs who cares there are people out
[03:57:54.400 --> 03:58:00.000]  there who have to fight every day literally and at the same time have to fight to wake up to get to
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:04.720]  school to get a degree to do something so when we go over and do stuff like that we're not fighting
[03:58:04.720 --> 03:58:08.400]  you know people who have no idea what's going on in the world they have to deal with this every day
[03:58:08.400 --> 03:58:12.480]  and get an education and you've seen the first hand very inspirational message all our problems
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:16.320]  are relative we really need to put it into perspective i'm anthony gutiarty thanks for
