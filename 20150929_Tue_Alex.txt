[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.421]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:08.183]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:09.944]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:11.506]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.087]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:17.271]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.315]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:26.703]  2015, a banner year for beheadings in Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:33.710]  According to Amnesty International, beheadings have surpassed 175 at a rate of one every two days.
[00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.714]  Many had hoped that new Saudi King Salman would have diminished the brutality.
[00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:40.216]  Instead, he has accelerated it.
[00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:52.289]  The Independent reports, the Kingdom killed 102 convicted criminals in the first six months of 2015 alone, putting it on course to beat its 1995 record number for the calendar year of 192.
[00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.334]  Those killed included children under the age of 18 at the time of the offense and disabled people.
[00:00:57.334 --> 00:01:02.940]  In fact, the numbers have climbed to such a high level, the Saudis have placed a job posting for eight new executioners.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.951]  Twenty-eight percent of those that face the executioner's blade were due to drug offenses, adultery, witchcraft, and of course, sorcery.
[00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:17.600]  Many of those executed are not given legal representation and confess to their crimes after breaking under torture.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.862]  The bodies of the executed
[00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:19.503]  We're good to go.
[00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:49.671]  Well then, America and the rest of the representatives of the modern world must be furious with Saudi government for these blatant displays of medieval barbarism.
[00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:50.472]  Wrong.
[00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:54.954]  Saudi Arabia has been chosen to head an important UN Human Rights Panel.
[00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:59.717]  And State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner responded with enthusiasm.
[00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:01.818]  Toner said, we would welcome it.
[00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:03.339]  We're close allies.
[00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:04.739]  Close allies.
[00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.221]  According to witness testimony to the classified 28 pages of the 9-11 report,
[00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:15.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Saudi government runs ISIS, runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:20.288]  Does that mean that sometimes these groups don't attack Saudi Arabia to demand more goodies?
[00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:21.029]  And more power?
[00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.049]  And more weapons?
[00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.350]  Absolutely.
[00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.370]  But that's the real problem.
[00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.752]  There it is in the New York Times.
[00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:30.814]  Convicted terrorist claims Saudis funded Al-Qaeda and new plots to down Air Force One.
[00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:36.497]  It's in the 28 pages that Saudi Arabia was running the hijackers and they were in Saudi intelligence.
[00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:37.698]  Yeah, but let's go further than that.
[00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:48.819]  Under Clinton and Bush, they protected those hijackers when the FBI tried to stop them, when they were training, when people at the flight schools were suspicious.
[00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.282]  But what about how at least five of the 19 trained at U.S.
[00:02:53.282 --> 00:02:57.085]  military bases and were given spy training?
[00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:05.192]  The head of the Defense Language School, Colonel Stephen Butler, went public a week after 9-11 in the San Jose Mercury News and said,
[00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:09.546]  I don't know what's going on, but we train these guys at our bases.
[00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.826]  Mohammed Adda was in my class.
[00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:12.826]  Something's wrong.
[00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.487]  Of course.
[00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:15.787]  Of course.
[00:03:15.787 --> 00:03:17.587]  Do we know exactly what happened?
[00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:22.168]  No, but we know that this was allowed to happen, bare minimum.
[00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:26.349]  There's ABC News, still secret, 28 pages, it could change our understanding of 9-11.
[00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:34.731]  I've been told by the congressman on this show and military intelligence people on this show, they've seen it, what it says.
[00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:35.431]  Senator Graham.
[00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:40.784]  Former Senator of Florida, 9-11 Commission, has said what's in it.
[00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:43.286]  We know what's in it.
[00:03:43.286 --> 00:04:00.119]  This ally of ours funded the 9-11 terror attacks and has been dubbed the Great ISIS by Colonel Sharaf Luckman, the official spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, a region that has experienced exponential war crimes undertaken by Saudi Arabia and supported by the United States.
[00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:10.603]  In a related report on British arms sales, Robert Perkins wrote, Yemen is the worst country for civilian deaths and injuries from explosive weapon use in the first seven months of 2015.
[00:04:10.603 --> 00:04:16.365]  The Saudi government has been very elusive with the evidence, connecting them to the bankrolling of ISIS.
[00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:23.228]  It has officially condemned the Islamic State, along with al-Nusra, the Muslim Brotherhood, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and Saudi Hezbollah.
[00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:37.533]  Wealthy Saudi and Qatari citizens, however, continue to fund and support Sunni Wahhabist groups in the Middle East, including ISIS, al-Nusra, Liwa al-Taheed, Arar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam, and other jihadi fighters in Syria.
[00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:40.514]  And none of these wealthy agitators have been beheaded.
[00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:57.578]  The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists notes, a good portion of the funding for the ISIS and similar terror groups such as the Al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra comes from Sunni elites located in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Gulf States, countries that are ostensibly US allies.
[00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:59.319]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.920]  Who do you prefer?
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.503]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:09.467]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:10.528]  They're not leaders.
[00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.190]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.012]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:18.795]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:23.159]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:24.661]  So what's it gonna take?
[00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:27.404]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:28.225]  Think about it.
[00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:37.376]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:40.921]  It's elephants and asses screwing the masses.
[00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:44.884]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[00:05:44.884 --> 00:05:49.768]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:51.530]  Divide and conquer.
[00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.494]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[00:05:56.494 --> 00:06:06.382]  InfoWars.com Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you the hands-down best deal we've ever offered on high-quality storable foods.

[00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:03.231]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:07.492]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:14.755]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:25.620]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.141]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:30.262]  What do you have to lose?
[00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.963]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:38.707]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:07:38.707 --> 00:07:42.010]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.193]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:07:46.193 --> 00:07:48.515]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:55.481]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.942]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:22.048]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:22.048 --> 00:08:23.869]  I want you.
[00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:24.630]  I need you.
[00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:33.645]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:34.145]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:35.806]  Central we're here live.
[00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:39.687]  We return weeknight 7 o'clock Central with M4 Wars Nightly News.
[00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:41.167]  And of course Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.188]  with a live Sunday broadcast.
[00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:44.908]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:45.729]  No guests today.
[00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:53.631]  It's going to be tons of news, video, audio clips, scientific discoveries, police state developments, economic
[00:08:55.094 --> 00:08:58.797]  Upheavals, it's all coming up today.
[00:08:58.797 --> 00:09:01.760]  And of course, we're going to have open phones.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.046]  There is a Drudge Report headline, New World Order Putin Outsmarts Obama.
[00:09:09.046 --> 00:09:19.735]  And I have been scanning over the editorial piece out of the New York Post, and I agree with part of it, but not with some of the other parts.
[00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:23.278]  And at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go over some of this article.
[00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:35.756]  Claiming that Obama's naive, Obama's from the 1950s, Obama's trying to be friendly to Russia, and Russia is being decisive and knows what it's doing.
[00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:38.656]  Russia is on the verge of economic collapse.
[00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:41.177]  Russia is under massive economic warfare.
[00:09:41.177 --> 00:09:47.578]  Russia is surrounded by Jihad Al Qaeda forces, funded by the West.
[00:09:47.578 --> 00:09:53.179]  Russia is fighting for its life, and has continued to put its hand out to the West.
[00:09:56.527 --> 00:10:04.870]  But if you look at the photo, it's Obama trying to shake the hand of Putin, and it looks as if Putin is refusing.
[00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:16.615]  When it's Russia that's been thrown out of the G8, it's Russia that's been thrown out of the G20, it's Russia that is seeing oil prices brought down to bankrupt them.
[00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:25.059]  And by no means is Russia some sweetie-cake perfect pantheon of grace and innocence and law-abiding love.
[00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:43.688]  But compared to the Anglo-American, New World Order, technocratic, eugenics-based, transhumanist world government pushers, Russia is just good old-fashioned mafia-style government.
[00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:46.691]  So at the bottom of the hour, I will break down that report.
[00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:49.334]  Of all these stories, just look at this one.
[00:10:51.206 --> 00:10:52.667]  From BizPakReview, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.828]  School goes into lockdown after student displays Confederate flag on backpack.
[00:10:54.828 --> 00:11:12.039]  So now they've gone from somebody's got a gun or a knife to lockdown to AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:16.064]  They had seen the symbol of evil.
[00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:21.287]  They had seen the symbol of the South, the Confederate battle flag.
[00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:22.488]  They didn't know what it meant.
[00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:25.330]  They didn't know it was a Scottish Christian symbol.
[00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.272]  They didn't know that it had nothing to do with slavery.
[00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:33.556]  All they knew was the mainstream media had told them it was a sign of great evil.
[00:11:33.556 --> 00:11:41.682]  And to add to the hysterical religious experience, the school was locked down for hours and armed police ran through the halls.
[00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:46.581]  Children were then suspended, three of them.
[00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:52.403]  One wearing the flag, others that were collaborators in the criminal acts.
[00:11:52.403 --> 00:11:58.226]  School goes into lockdown after student displays Confederate flag on backpack.
[00:11:58.226 --> 00:12:10.891]  I've never flown the Confederate battle flag of Robert E. Lee, but I'm tempted to because you've got to counter this type of brainwashing
[00:12:12.503 --> 00:12:21.307]  Just like when they try to ban guns or have all these Hollywood movies, have cops pull people over in Texas and say, you got a rifle in your car, you're going to jail, that's illegal.
[00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:32.552]  That's what almost every cop show, every drama, even though that's not the law, they'll show that to create the perception so your neighbor calls the police on you when they see you putting a deer rifle in your car.
[00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:39.715]  And so folks engaging in concealed carry have been protecting society and lowering crime rates, but open carry,
[00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:51.806]  Has been actively promoting the idea that our guns aren't illegal and have been showing the sheeple that and countering the brainwashing.
[00:12:51.806 --> 00:13:02.834]  And it's just as important of a civil rights, human rights, God-given move as Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus or folks trying to eat at lunch counters where they've been told blacks wouldn't be served.
[00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:06.697]  It is just as epic, just as seminal, just as important.
[00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:14.245]  I personally know the South was manipulated into the war by British intelligence.
[00:13:14.245 --> 00:13:17.487]  That's declassified over 100 years ago.
[00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:19.588]  The North engaged in great crimes, certainly.
[00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:24.212]  The South engaged in some crimes as well.
[00:13:24.212 --> 00:13:32.698]  The founder of Texas, Sam Houston, was against it and was removed from office as the governor of Texas.
[00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:35.980]  First he was the president, then he was governor.
[00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:40.964]  And they removed him.
[00:13:40.964 --> 00:13:46.248]  He had to step down from office because he was against the war.
[00:13:46.248 --> 00:13:47.629]  He said, you're being set up.
[00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:48.190]  You ought to go read.
[00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.612]  In fact, I'm going to do a whole piece on this.
[00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:52.193]  So I was reading a book about it and reading his quotes.
[00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:52.773]  I looked online.
[00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:53.594]  They're online as well.
[00:13:53.594 --> 00:13:55.175]  Just Sam Houston's comments.
[00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:57.277]  Sam Houston's quotes on the Civil War.
[00:13:57.277 --> 00:14:00.139]  He said, the North's got 10 times the industrial might.
[00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.662]  They've got three times the population.
[00:14:02.662 --> 00:14:04.083]  We're being completely set up.
[00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:15.971]  Believe me, I ran the operations to come into Texas with the North and take it over in an intelligence operation with Andrew Jackson 30 years ago.
[00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:17.751]  You don't want to do this.
[00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:19.912]  They've got a giant intelligence network.
[00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:21.253]  They control the ocean.
[00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:24.714]  They've got a huge Navy.
[00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:25.914]  We're going to lose.
[00:14:25.914 --> 00:14:26.955]  We're being set up.
[00:14:26.955 --> 00:14:28.915]  They said, ah, be quiet.
[00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:30.416]  You're out of there, you Yankee.
[00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:33.388]  He wasn't a, quote, Yankee.
[00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:38.674]  He was from Tennessee and famous fighter.
[00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:40.497]  And he was proven correct.
[00:14:40.497 --> 00:14:44.281]  And there was a lot of my family that was against the Civil War in Texas.
[00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:47.425]  Some of them were neutral and went further west.
[00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:48.807]  Others joined the Confederacy.
[00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:58.616]  I've got ancestors that were Confederate colonels and generals, and I'm not going to get into it, but the point is that they were like Robert E. Lee.
[00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:04.539]  They were against it as well, but once the war started, following the Constitution, they had to join their state.
[00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:07.161]  But it was not some glorious war.
[00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:09.182]  It was a disaster.
[00:15:09.182 --> 00:15:18.608]  So I don't particularly like the Confederate battle flag because it makes me think of the South being manipulated by British intelligence in an attempt to break the country in two.
[00:15:20.182 --> 00:15:31.571]  But it is a flag that even in the annals of the British, the French, and others, is seen as one of the most powerful symbols of underdogs.
[00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:37.235]  Because many times the South fought 10 to 1, 5 to 1, 3 to 1.
[00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:40.397]  And would run out of bullets.
[00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:41.898]  And would still win with swords.
[00:15:42.932 --> 00:15:43.052]  Yeah.
[00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:13.251]  There was also the Napoleonic era had kind of ended but it persisted in Texas and a few other areas where people still had duels in the streets and people still were into dying in war.
[00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.493]  That was the greatest thing you could do.
[00:16:15.493 --> 00:16:18.135]  It was almost Viking.
[00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:19.356]  Well, it wasn't almost Viking.
[00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:26.363]  You had the Franks and then you had William the Conqueror and you had that whole culture in Europe that basically was Viking.
[00:16:27.376 --> 00:16:38.521]  The Norse culture is what made Europe what it is today, and was the metal that made Europe rise to be the dominant force it is militarily.
[00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:55.708]  That culture of berserking, of fighting to the death, of dying with a sword in your hand, of wanting to die in battle, of enjoying it, of going past fear and being completely wild-eyed crazed, and taking hallucinogens as well.
[00:16:56.772 --> 00:17:02.894]  That was basically the Norse culture.
[00:17:02.894 --> 00:17:04.914]  If you're a new lister, don't believe me, just look it up.
[00:17:04.914 --> 00:17:14.176]  Look up Vikings and mushrooms and you'll get the rest of the story.
[00:17:14.176 --> 00:17:15.737]  But I digress.
[00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:18.097]  It's just the hysteria.
[00:17:18.097 --> 00:17:20.798]  Imagine if someone saw a swastika and they locked the school down.
[00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:30.611]  What if you're walking in for your world history class in, say, the 10th grade, and you've got poster board, and it's got the Allied symbols and the Nazi symbols.
[00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:31.833]  Do they lock the school down for that?
[00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:50.183]  I've actually had people, when I was a teenager, come over to my parents' house and see big bookshelves everywhere, and then books on the shelf that had swastikas on them, like Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, that won a Pulitzer Prize, and people would say, why do you have this?
[00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:52.324]  It's like, this one knows how to read!
[00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:54.666]  He's gotta get watched!
[00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:57.268]  Just, ahhh!
[00:17:57.268 --> 00:17:58.309]  I saw it!
[00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:01.111]  A Confederate battle flag!
[00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:02.252]  Oh no!
[00:18:02.252 --> 00:18:03.733]  It's so evil!
[00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:04.734]  It's so bad!
[00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:11.050]  School goes into lockdown after student displays confederate flag on backpack.
[00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:16.071]  The purge of culture thanks to political correctness, BizPak review article.
[00:18:16.071 --> 00:18:22.152]  A student displayed the confederate battle flag on his backpack eventually led to a Georgia high school going into lockdown.
[00:18:22.152 --> 00:18:24.453]  And the suspension of three students last week.
[00:18:24.453 --> 00:18:26.033]  The suspension.
[00:18:26.033 --> 00:18:33.435]  The incident started with a 10th grade boy, not a young man, arrived at Rock Mart High School in Polk County with the flag attached to his backpack.
[00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:36.976]  The hysteria only went on from there.
[00:18:36.976 --> 00:18:40.438]  Oh my gosh!
[00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:41.899]  Oh my goodness!
[00:18:41.899 --> 00:18:44.040]  Did you see it?
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.801]  Swat team help me!
[00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:47.022]  Swat team help me!
[00:18:47.022 --> 00:18:48.543]  Oh my gosh!
[00:18:48.543 --> 00:18:49.803]  I mean, this is mental illness.
[00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:50.764]  Look at that!
[00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:53.345]  There's a confederate flag flying at the Capitol!
[00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:54.026]  Get it down!
[00:18:54.026 --> 00:18:55.026]  Get it down!
[00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:58.068]  A month later, I saw one on a car!
[00:18:58.068 --> 00:19:00.349]  I saw one on a shirt!
[00:19:00.349 --> 00:19:01.310]  I saw it!
[00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.451]  This is what we've become?
[00:19:05.182 --> 00:19:08.404]  No knowledge, no history, no background, no culture.
[00:19:08.404 --> 00:19:10.545]  Just, here's a symbol, we're banning it.
[00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:22.391]  And months after the hysteria begins, it's taken off capitals, statues are pulled down, and police arrive because someone saw a symbol.
[00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:32.437]  But when people come across the border with the Al-Qaeda or the ISIS flag, or people come across illegally from Syria or from Libya, it's okay.
[00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:34.458]  We're going to get to that in the news today as well.
[00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:42.267]  And in Germany, CPS now takes your kids if you criticize the migrants.
[00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:46.788]  Back to Nazi Germany where the Nazis took your kids if you didn't do what you were told.
[00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:49.489]  But it's all liberal, so it's okay.
[00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:53.830]  Besides, there are families that can't have kids that need your kids.
[00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.511]  They deserve kids, so they're going to take them from yours.
[00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:57.331]  Don't be homophobic.
[00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:03.751]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:07.793]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:07.793 --> 00:20:12.015]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:15.177 --> 00:20:20.399]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:29.103]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:21:59.008 --> 00:22:05.730]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:11.211]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:11.211 --> 00:22:15.753]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:15.753 --> 00:22:20.034]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:24.295]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect,
[00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:28.016]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:30.956]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:30.956 --> 00:22:35.377]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:36.478]  They did.
[00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:41.519]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:42.679]  They did.
[00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:46.540]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.900]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.401]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:50.401 --> 00:22:52.381]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:53.441]  We're good to go.

[00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:26.176]  So we're told that we've got to give up all of our rights in the last 14 years because Al Qaeda and other radical Islamist groups from Saudi Arabia predominantly are going to attack us any minute.
[00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:33.744]  Then the last five years our government has openly funded these very groups to take over multiple countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:49.924]  Now they're allowing them to embed themselves in, quote, refugees and migrants, many of which are migrants into countries they were trying to take over, like Syria, and are now being sent to the United States and other areas of Europe.
[00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:57.910]  This is while we have the headline, ISIS planning nuclear tsunami.
[00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.373]  And Obama warns of apocalyptic cult.
[00:25:04.329 --> 00:25:13.632]  That is ISIS, which is simply Al-Qaeda under a new name to confuse the public.
[00:25:13.632 --> 00:25:23.075]  So this is how ridiculous things have gotten and how illiterate politically the public has gotten that they could even pull something off like this.
[00:25:23.075 --> 00:25:26.196]  Trust in mainstream media hits rock bottom in a new Gallup poll.
[00:25:28.064 --> 00:25:32.845]  Only 40% say they have any level of trust, and that level is low.
[00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:38.407]  Yes, Congress has a 9% approval rating in Gallup.
[00:25:38.407 --> 00:25:48.450]  They can attack the President on supposed racial issues or claim people are, and then get a 35-40% approval rating for him, but just based on personality.
[00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.111]  But the policies have a 9% approval rating.
[00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:57.864]  Another Pentagon report predicted West's support for Islamic rebels would create ISIS.
[00:25:57.864 --> 00:26:05.487]  Anti-ISIS coalition knowingly sponsored violent extremists to isolate Assad, roll back Shia expansion.
[00:26:05.487 --> 00:26:15.090]  The Pentagon, of course, had these reports suppressed, but our government's been arming the Saudi Arabian forces the whole time.
[00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.972]  As Iraq has been saying for three years, that we're supplying them.
[00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:21.390]  We're not doing it.
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.692]  The criminals that hijacked our country are.
[00:26:24.692 --> 00:26:26.293]  Oh, look at this article out of Breitbart.
[00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:28.374]  It's up on Infowars.com as well.
[00:26:28.374 --> 00:26:39.822]  DOJ drops charges against Syrian woman arrested at Texas border with Mexico being brought in illegally.
[00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:41.423]  That's okay.
[00:26:41.423 --> 00:26:42.564]  She's just allowed to come in now.
[00:26:44.517 --> 00:26:45.037]  D.O.J.
[00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:54.079]  dropped charges against a Syrian woman, McAllen, Texas, the place where we went down and showed the feds completing the smuggling process, where they give them the vouchers and put them on the buses.
[00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:59.621]  A federal court in this border city dropped all charges against a Syrian woman and her brother-in-law, a U.S.
[00:26:59.621 --> 00:27:02.902]  citizen, who was arrested as they attempted to enter the U.S.
[00:27:02.902 --> 00:27:03.522]  from Mexico.
[00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:04.222]  He was bringing her in.
[00:27:06.252 --> 00:27:08.113]  As reported by Breitbart Texas, U.S.
[00:27:08.113 --> 00:27:27.058]  Customs and Border Patrol arrested 27-year-old Wala al-Army and her brother-in-law, 46-year-old Mohammed Zayed al-Zalam last week in the border city on the charge of misusing a U.S.
[00:27:27.058 --> 00:27:27.878]  passport.
[00:27:27.878 --> 00:27:29.839]  That was in the border city of Hidalgo.
[00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:34.640]  Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas reveal that the woman traveled to Beirut, Lebanon
[00:27:37.571 --> 00:27:43.640]  To be picked up, and then it goes into how she was transported to the United States.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.283]  Let's continue.
[00:27:46.283 --> 00:27:48.807]  Germans could have their children snatched for anti...
[00:27:49.804 --> 00:28:01.229]  Migrant Facebook posts lose their job, and they are serving 120-day jail sentences, no judge, no jury, and 5,000 euro fines, and they've reactivated Stasi officers to carry it out.
[00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:07.152]  Paul Joseph Watson, that's right, they've reactivated the Stasi and have them Germany-wide with Zuckerberg.
[00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.413]  You cannot make this up.
[00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:15.707]  You cannot make the magnitude of evil up and how concerted it is.
[00:28:15.707 --> 00:28:26.775]  Germans who make racist anti-immigrant posts, that means any criticism, could have their children snatched by the state and fired from their jobs according to German Lawyers Association, it goes on.
[00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:30.138]  And here's Zuckerberg, we have the video and the audio of this.
[00:28:31.837 --> 00:28:33.838]  Maybe we should grab that and play it later.
[00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:41.842]  Mark Zuckerberg caught on hot mic, live mic, saying Facebook will censor anti-migrant posts.
[00:28:41.842 --> 00:28:45.644]  Yeah, we showed how the Pope did that fake thing with that girl last week.
[00:28:45.644 --> 00:28:55.869]  It had tens of thousands of shares in a few hours, and they just erased the shares down to zero, and you could not share it and could not post it on any other pages.
[00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:56.690]  Isn't that just special?
[00:28:57.847 --> 00:29:03.651]  Facebook CEO tells German Chancellor we need to do some work.
[00:29:03.651 --> 00:29:07.374]  And Facebook is actually hiring Stasi folks as well.
[00:29:07.374 --> 00:29:11.997]  I'm not kidding, this is mainstream news.
[00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:13.899]  To then alert the authorities in Germany.
[00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:17.081]  So the Stasi are really helpful people.
[00:29:17.081 --> 00:29:23.546]  Marcus Wolf, former head of the Stasi, the most infamous director, worked for three years when we founded Homeland Security, establishing the Bureau.
[00:29:24.683 --> 00:29:36.048]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was caught discussing the censorship of anti-migrant posts on the United Nations Development Summit Saturday while speaking with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at just service last night.
[00:29:36.048 --> 00:29:37.669]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:46.793]  I'm gonna get into Obama when we come back and the fact has he been shown up by Vladimir Putin?
[00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:52.293]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.293 --> 00:29:54.961]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.085 --> 00:30:09.109]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:11.030]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.770]  Think about it.
[00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:17.813]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:30:17.813 --> 00:30:23.375]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:35.799]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:38.760]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.540]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.442]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:47.002]  Think about it.
[00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:58.457]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:30:58.942 --> 00:30:59.502]  I want more candy!

[00:31:00.643 --> 00:31:00.823]  Mine!
[00:31:00.823 --> 00:31:01.103]  Mine!
[00:31:01.103 --> 00:31:02.224]  Mine!
[00:31:28.922 --> 00:31:29.682]  I think so.

[00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:37.119]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:38.079]  We are back live.
[00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:42.520]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, the 29th day.
[00:33:47.165 --> 00:33:47.805]  Of September 2015.
[00:33:47.805 --> 00:33:54.928]  To watch how the media spins things.
[00:33:54.928 --> 00:34:05.012]  The last few months they've had all these headlines about Russia is secretly bringing weapons into Syria to keep the civil war going.
[00:34:05.012 --> 00:34:16.177]  While Russia has been making announcements for five years about shipping them anti-ship missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank weapons.
[00:34:17.358 --> 00:34:26.866]  Delivery systems, early warning systems, radar systems, advisors, air bases, troops.
[00:34:26.866 --> 00:34:30.509]  The Russians make announcements almost on a weekly basis.
[00:34:30.509 --> 00:34:32.931]  It's all over foreign news.
[00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:40.798]  But see, they know how Americans are, so they go, the Pentagon has caught Russia sneaking more weapons into Syria.
[00:34:40.798 --> 00:34:44.441]  Again, it's the same thing where the feds from Indiana,
[00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:51.434]  To Wisconsin, to Pennsylvania, SWAT team on a monthly basis, Amish.
[00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:52.597]  Who haven't even committed crimes.
[00:34:53.442 --> 00:34:57.024]  They'll have a million-plus-dollar, two-year sting.
[00:34:57.024 --> 00:34:59.946]  Feds will move in next door to the Amish leader.
[00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.467]  No criminal record.
[00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:04.248]  Totally, you know, Christian.
[00:35:04.248 --> 00:35:05.389]  Almost zero crime.
[00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:06.249]  Best people.
[00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:07.210]  Most trustworthy.
[00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.410]  Most Christian.
[00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:15.074]  They'll move in for a year, two years in some cases, to quote, get their trust, to get them to sell them cheese and milk.
[00:35:15.074 --> 00:35:21.098]  And then one day, a year in, they'll go, yeah, I'm taking this to give it to my brother in the next state.
[00:35:21.758 --> 00:35:22.399]  Yeah, I must go.
[00:35:22.399 --> 00:35:23.521]  All right, good, thank you.
[00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:27.307]  Well, if you need more, we'd like to give it to you, but you'd like to pay for it.
[00:35:27.307 --> 00:35:27.747]  Thank you.
[00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:33.534]  And then an hour later, helicopters, SWAT teams, armored vehicles, get on the ground!
[00:35:33.534 --> 00:35:34.394]  Get on the ground!
[00:35:34.394 --> 00:35:43.375]  So the stupid little jury that's already got Alzheimer's at age 40, can't tie their shoelaces, don't know what planet they're on, knows absolutely nothing.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:45.756]  I use this example a lot because it's key.
[00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:47.436]  Goes in and sees the SWAT raid.
[00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:50.357]  Here is the SWAT raid grand jury.
[00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:55.858]  Well, I mean, if you've got guys in black masks throwing down Amish, I mean, it's like Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:35:55.858 --> 00:35:56.958]  They go, okay, I'll indict them.
[00:35:57.799 --> 00:36:00.921]  If that's the lucky damn rights you're gonna end up, I'm gonna get you next.
[00:36:00.921 --> 00:36:05.445]  Because there's nothing like throwing an old Amish man in prison and taking their property.
[00:36:05.445 --> 00:36:07.226]  That makes you sleep real good at night!
[00:36:07.226 --> 00:36:13.791]  Because you're the loving federal government when you're not grabbing kids out of their backyards to put them on C-130s to fly them to Saudi Arabia!
[00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:17.713]  So Prince Boo-Boo can do whatever he wants.
[00:36:17.713 --> 00:36:18.694]  Filth!
[00:36:18.694 --> 00:36:20.796]  Scum!
[00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:21.976]  So that's how they run it.
[00:36:21.976 --> 00:36:23.658]  Yeah, we caught the Russians.
[00:36:23.658 --> 00:36:25.159]  We caught the Chinese.
[00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:26.560]  Put the thousand Marines in!
[00:36:29.994 --> 00:36:33.517]  And people sit there and watch the news and go, oh we caught them dirty Russians.
[00:36:33.517 --> 00:36:40.864]  And then they have the Secretary of Defense comes out last week and goes, Russia's aiding ISIS and is only going to embolden them.
[00:36:40.864 --> 00:36:45.148]  That's why we're fighting ISIS and we don't appreciate the Russians helping them.
[00:36:45.148 --> 00:36:49.752]  Now when the average American goes, Russians fighting with ISIS?
[00:36:49.752 --> 00:36:54.777]  They're worse than the Amish.
[00:36:54.777 --> 00:36:55.878]  I'm going to not blow up right now.
[00:37:00.077 --> 00:37:04.802]  This is not an act that I'm about to really blow up here.
[00:37:04.802 --> 00:37:11.949]  I just, I gotta get control of my temper right now because it's not healthy to get this angry.
[00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:15.493]  But I mean, how stupid is the public?
[00:37:15.493 --> 00:37:20.638]  How geopolitically, culturally, religiously ignorant are you people?
[00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.180]  And I'm not talking about our regular listeners.
[00:37:26.727 --> 00:37:29.269]  So, here's what's happened to Obama.
[00:37:29.269 --> 00:37:32.431]  Obama is the politically correct, trendy front man.
[00:37:32.431 --> 00:37:35.513]  That's the new religion of global government, is political correctness.
[00:37:35.513 --> 00:37:41.658]  And political correctness is whatever the new correctness is this month, this week, today.
[00:37:41.658 --> 00:37:54.467]  It's just total cultural Marxism, directly out of the Stalin era, and the Lenin era, and the Soviet Union, where it's just whatever they say this week, you better repeat it exactly as they said it, or you're going to a forced labor camp.
[00:37:56.425 --> 00:38:02.308]  Well, they already fund camps.
[00:38:02.308 --> 00:38:05.190]  But the military's heating up, getting ready, gearing up.
[00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.531]  On record, army.mil.
[00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:24.081]  Just type in Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, Emergency Centers Establishment Act, Resettlement Army Manual, Social Security Numbers, how to process you and your family, how to break up the political leaders, how to put the leader men in another camp, how to helicopter us out for torture.
[00:38:25.447 --> 00:38:27.908]  In quote, re-education?
[00:38:27.908 --> 00:38:31.349]  And those commies are gonna be in there, boy, and they are gonna just have their way with us.
[00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.909]  It's gonna be hellish.
[00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:35.790]  Of course, we're not planning to go to those.
[00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.410]  We're ready for you, trash!
[00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.211]  We're ready for you, scum!
[00:38:39.211 --> 00:38:41.411]  You filthy, degenerate maggots!
[00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:42.872]  We know exactly who you are!
[00:38:42.872 --> 00:38:45.412]  You think you're gonna get in a fight with us?
[00:38:45.412 --> 00:38:47.393]  It's gonna be a cakewalk?
[00:38:47.393 --> 00:38:49.333]  You've taken our restraint as weakness?
[00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:51.414]  You've taken our kindness as weakness?
[00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:52.274]  You're gonna find out!
[00:38:55.512 --> 00:38:57.094]  The truth of this just hits me and I get angry.
[00:38:57.094 --> 00:39:04.404]  It's so sick to watch reality twisted and inverted and turned sideways and just spun to hell.
[00:39:04.404 --> 00:39:05.546]  God help me.
[00:39:05.546 --> 00:39:08.970]  God help me be calm.
[00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:09.291]  Anyways.
[00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:12.718]  I mean, I'm so angry about Zuckerberg.
[00:39:12.718 --> 00:39:16.081]  I already know they censor key stuff we put out.
[00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:17.121]  Like, why aren't you on Facebook?
[00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.042]  Why aren't you on Facebook?
[00:39:18.042 --> 00:39:20.364]  Because it advertises as a public commons.
[00:39:20.364 --> 00:39:21.465]  We're very popular there.
[00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:24.188]  We reach hundreds of millions of people there.
[00:39:24.188 --> 00:39:25.028]  That's why we're there.
[00:39:25.028 --> 00:39:27.411]  Why aren't you on the battlefield if the enemy's attacking back?
[00:39:27.411 --> 00:39:29.953]  Because that's where the enemy is.
[00:39:29.953 --> 00:39:36.699]  It's the most stupid, mindless, sheep-like, moron, idiot statements I've ever heard.
[00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:41.964]  I mean, how stupid are you trolls and all you sycophant morons out there?
[00:39:41.964 --> 00:39:47.808]  This system is designed to suck out your prosperity, suck out your health, and destroy you!
[00:39:47.808 --> 00:39:49.149]  You fools!
[00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:54.352]  You just think you joined with the New World Order, then it gave you power, and somehow you're on the winning team?
[00:39:54.352 --> 00:39:55.913]  You useful idiot trash!
[00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:07.218]  Dishonored this republic and trashed our name by design for world government to flush America down the toilet.
[00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:13.002]  Very soon, you people are the biggest idiots I've ever seen in my life.
[00:40:13.002 --> 00:40:22.729]  You're like a spoiled, rotten 15-year-old whose dad gives him a brand new car and you bitch because it doesn't have leather seats and run up and kick the door in.
[00:40:24.343 --> 00:40:32.629]  You're a bunch of slack-jawed, lazy, cocky, arrogant thugs that can't back up anything!
[00:40:32.629 --> 00:40:35.332]  You're all talk and no action!
[00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:42.998]  And when all the hell breaks loose, you're gonna be crying in front of your mommy, and she ain't gonna be there!
[00:40:42.998 --> 00:40:44.138]  Now, let's get back to this.
[00:40:44.138 --> 00:40:49.943]  Look at this.
[00:40:49.943 --> 00:40:52.985]  Before I get to the article, let's just play Obama's statement yesterday at the UN.
[00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:57.776]  Obama has turned Putin into the world's most powerful leader.
[00:40:57.776 --> 00:41:02.740]  No, Russia is not perfect, but Russia is not on an offense.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.161]  Russia is surrounded.
[00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:05.622]  Russia is de-industrialized.
[00:41:05.622 --> 00:41:07.063]  Russia is under attack.
[00:41:07.063 --> 00:41:10.545]  Russia is having their only export energy brought down.
[00:41:10.545 --> 00:41:19.231]  Russia is surrounded by Chechen fighters that are now in all the Caucasus and are in Ukraine and are in Syria, their only Mediterranean port.
[00:41:21.002 --> 00:41:48.212]  attacking them and so the Russians are defending their absolute core national security and so the reason everyone's being driven into the former KGB agents arms is because Obama and the globalist in an educated politically informed world America has the least amount of travel except for like North Korea outside the country America has the lowest level of information about geopolitics America
[00:41:49.978 --> 00:41:54.662]  is just completely illiterate when it comes to these geopolitical developments.
[00:41:54.662 --> 00:41:57.084]  And so, China is incredibly corrupt and bad.
[00:41:57.084 --> 00:41:58.365]  I don't like the communists.
[00:41:58.365 --> 00:42:03.750]  Russia's got big problems, but Russia's tried to reform compared to China, and the globalists don't want that.
[00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.811]  They don't want any sovereign nations.
[00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:07.773]  They don't want any sovereign sectors.
[00:42:07.773 --> 00:42:11.296]  They don't want any sovereign places to run.
[00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:14.913]  And so Russia's trying to have their own currency.
[00:42:14.913 --> 00:42:16.854]  They're trying to team up with India and China.
[00:42:16.854 --> 00:42:18.535]  Russia's trying to defend itself.
[00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:20.096]  Russia's trying to build a culture.
[00:42:20.096 --> 00:42:21.617]  Russia's promoting the family.
[00:42:21.617 --> 00:42:23.499]  Russia is going after pedophiles.
[00:42:24.594 --> 00:42:26.895]  Russia doesn't put fluoride in their water?
[00:42:26.895 --> 00:42:31.937]  You turn on Russian news, GMO shows to be a system put in to reduce fertility.
[00:42:31.937 --> 00:42:33.357]  Here's the UN documents.
[00:42:33.357 --> 00:42:36.638]  Fluoride has been proven to lower IQ and destroy fertility.
[00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:39.579]  That's why the West puts it in their water as part of population control.
[00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:46.462]  Here at the Russian Ministry of the Interior, we do not wish to destroy your fertility, but through cultural means of the communists, we have our fertility lowered.
[00:42:46.462 --> 00:42:48.442]  We must have children or we will fall.
[00:42:48.442 --> 00:42:52.784]  This is part of a larger plan to... I mean, the Russians know, folks.
[00:42:53.404 --> 00:43:01.208]  Because they've been through 85 years of New World Order gang rape.
[00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:14.295]  And isn't it fitting, as world government arises, and as almost every country's fallen, Russia is over there, infiltrated, corrupt, double dealing, has its own problems, but ideologically is being defiant to this.
[00:43:16.155 --> 00:43:32.146]  First clip is Obama, in case you think I'm making it up, talking about apocalyptic ISIS, which is a sock puppet, a hand puppet, a finger puppet, a marionette, a avatar, a front.
[00:43:33.676 --> 00:43:38.059]  of Saudi Arabia, NATO, the globalists, the criminals that run our country.
[00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:59.192]  The criminals that run our country harvest babies while they're alive, they run Al-Qaeda, they're trying to ban Christian speech and ban churches and ban crosses, they're already doing it in Germany, they're already doing it in Sweden, they're coming, it's communists with megabanks financing them, with radical Muslims taking over, we are under attack, period.
[00:43:59.192 --> 00:43:59.633]  Period.
[00:44:00.492 --> 00:44:07.955]  Now let's go to Obama warning of the apocalypse of Jihad, and out of this crisis they will bring in their world government.
[00:44:07.955 --> 00:44:09.015]  Here it is.
[00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:19.519]  When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs.
[00:44:19.519 --> 00:44:26.521]  It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all.
[00:44:26.521 --> 00:44:28.902]  Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives,
[00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:31.596]  Oh, he's all behind all of it.
[00:44:31.596 --> 00:44:32.336]  Total evil.
[00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.957]  Totally behind it, and then acts like he's against it.
[00:44:34.957 --> 00:44:36.018]  That's Emperor Palpatine level.
[00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:37.078]  I can't listen to this.
[00:44:59.795 --> 00:45:03.236]  Never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes.
[00:45:03.236 --> 00:45:05.376]  Of course, they're creating a safe haven out of part of Iraq.
[00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:08.137]  We have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of al Qaeda.
[00:45:08.137 --> 00:45:10.597]  And out of Syria.
[00:45:10.597 --> 00:45:12.698]  We will not be outlasted by extremists.
[00:45:12.698 --> 00:45:14.218]  Oh, no.
[00:45:14.218 --> 00:45:16.378]  You're totally empowering them 14 years after 9-11.
[00:45:16.378 --> 00:45:19.919]  You know, let's go to Putin first and then Obama when we come back.
[00:45:19.919 --> 00:45:22.980]  Here's part of Putin's address to the UN yesterday.
[00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:25.740]  And then compare it to what Obama's saying.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.863]  The Russians have invited the US in to take these people out.
[00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:31.405]  They're not going to take out their own people.
[00:45:31.405 --> 00:45:33.466]  And again, this is all coming out in the news.
[00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:36.829]  The world knows we run Al Qaeda.
[00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:41.773]  And the world's meant to learn that, because down the road, America's going to be crippled.
[00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:44.315]  America's being set up for a major fall.
[00:45:44.315 --> 00:45:48.138]  Not a complete fall, but a game changer.
[00:45:48.138 --> 00:45:51.440]  Europe is to lead the world government.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.622]  America is to supply Hessian mercenaries.
[00:45:56.479 --> 00:46:01.083]  The new Atlantis is to be brought down.
[00:46:01.083 --> 00:46:06.048]  Let's go ahead and go to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[00:46:07.779 --> 00:46:13.384]  It seems, however, that far from learning from others' mistakes, everyone just keeps repeating them.
[00:46:13.384 --> 00:46:21.090]  And so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues.
[00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.714]  It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:46:25.714 --> 00:46:33.260]  As has been mentioned by my previous speaker, certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time.
[00:46:34.443 --> 00:46:37.626]  And people there wished for changes, naturally.
[00:46:37.626 --> 00:46:42.691]  But how did it actually turn out?
[00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:52.560]  Rather than bringing about reforms and aggressive foreign interference, has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:59.807]  Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster.
[00:47:01.528 --> 00:47:07.314]  Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.
[00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:13.541]  I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, do you realize now what you've done?
[00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:15.022]  But I'm afraid no one is going to answer that.
[00:47:18.817 --> 00:47:25.982]  Indeed, policies based on self-conceit and belief in one's exceptionality and impunity have never been abandoned.
[00:47:25.982 --> 00:47:41.851]  It is now obvious that the power vacuum created in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa led to the emergence of anarchy areas, which immediately started to be filled with extremists and terrorists.
[00:47:43.312 --> 00:48:04.478]  In these circumstances, it is hypercritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels of financing and supporting terrorists, including the process of drug trafficking and illicit trade in oil and arms.
[00:48:04.478 --> 00:48:12.621]  It would be equally irresponsible to try to manipulate extremist groups and place them at one's service in order to achieve one's own political goals in the hope
[00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:20.923]  Of later dealing with them or in other words liquidating them.
[00:48:20.923 --> 00:48:25.884]  Russia has always been consistently fighting against terrorism in all its forms.
[00:48:25.884 --> 00:48:34.106]  Today we provide military and technical assistance both to Iraq and Syria and many other countries of the region who are fighting terrorist groups.
[00:48:34.106 --> 00:48:40.007]  We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces.
[00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:45.050]  Valiantly fighting terrorism face-to-face.
[00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:58.540]  We should finally acknowledge that no one but present Assad's armed forces and Kurdish militia are truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:03.924]  We know about all the problems and contradictions in the region which were based on the reality.
[00:49:05.265 --> 00:49:17.426]  Dear colleagues, I must note that such an honest and frank approach of Russia has been recently used as a pretext to accuse it of its growing ambitions, as if those who say it have no ambitions at all.
[00:49:19.478 --> 00:49:30.343]  However, it's not about Russia's ambitions, dear colleagues, but about the recognition of the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world.
[00:49:30.343 --> 00:49:39.468]  What we actually propose is to be guided by common values and common interests rather than ambitions.
[00:49:39.468 --> 00:49:40.769]  And that's the key.
[00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:44.051]  And that's why Putin is now the main leader of the world.
[00:49:46.314 --> 00:49:50.698]  Because, compared to our leaders, Putin is moral.
[00:49:50.698 --> 00:50:00.585]  And Putin tells the truth, over and over again, and the whole world sees that, and sees that our government wants to overthrow even friends.
[00:50:00.585 --> 00:50:04.629]  Our government is overthrowing people in Egypt, people in Libya,
[00:50:05.575 --> 00:50:13.944]  But also in Eastern Europe, you name it, because wicked corporations now run our government, and they want to discredit America as well.
[00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:21.212]  They want to destroy all the nation states, so they're willing to use us as a battering ram, even though it's going to break us in the end.
[00:50:21.212 --> 00:50:25.397]  They're using our wealth, our goodwill, our strong name to build this world government.
[00:50:26.738 --> 00:50:28.980]  Russia is completely backed into a corner.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:36.967]  The United States is moving new medium-range cruise missiles into Europe, admitting they're going to prepare to nuke Russia.
[00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:42.212]  And so Russia is now being pushed closer to China, and they're moving into the Middle East.
[00:50:42.212 --> 00:50:43.173]  This is biblical.
[00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:48.892]  And it's being directed by the EU, by the globalists.
[00:50:48.892 --> 00:50:51.913]  And we're not hearing a word from the Pope about this.
[00:50:51.913 --> 00:50:58.877]  We're only hearing how we need to cut the third world's carbon output, which is a death sentence.

[00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:20.949]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[00:54:10.095 --> 00:54:13.717]  By the way, you've heard the callers.
[00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.818]  A lot of you have gone to Infoworkslife.com.
[00:54:15.818 --> 00:54:17.579]  You've read the rave reviews.
[00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:20.161]  Some products have close to a thousand reviews.
[00:54:20.161 --> 00:54:21.101]  The average review is 4.8.
[00:54:22.902 --> 00:54:32.552]  That is unheard of for Power Reviews, one of the most respected third-party reviewal sites where people go make reviews on the product.
[00:54:32.552 --> 00:54:46.386]  These are true game changers, whether it's survival shell nascent iodine, X tube, the good halogen, or whether it is things like oxy powder that's just a higher level of oxygen, the time releases in your upper and lower intestine to flush all that stuff out.
[00:54:47.537 --> 00:54:50.539]  This is just basic game changer type stuff.
[00:54:50.539 --> 00:55:06.088]  And I've told the story many times that two and a half, three years ago, they were already developing and souping up formulas that were already out there, but more organic, more concentrated, a liver cleanse, a liver shield.
[00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:09.370]  And they had a prototype and Anthony and Dr. Group were doing it.
[00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:10.491]  And I read about it online.
[00:55:10.491 --> 00:55:12.612]  I just said, this can't be real.
[00:55:12.612 --> 00:55:14.113]  Cause I'm not a big supplement guy over the years.
[00:55:14.113 --> 00:55:15.494]  People know that I had to be shown it.
[00:55:17.168 --> 00:55:20.710]  And you take it.
[00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:24.391]  You take the apple cider vinegar with water three or four times a day for six days.
[00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:27.873]  You take five or six, depending on how your intestines work, whatever's good for you.
[00:55:27.873 --> 00:55:30.174]  Between four and eight, some people do different stuff.
[00:55:30.174 --> 00:55:30.954]  It varies.
[00:55:30.954 --> 00:55:33.455]  Of the oxy powder.
[00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:44.020]  And then on the sixth day, and we have all the details at m4slife.com, you lay on the side that your liver's on, your left side, for about an hour and a half at bedtime.
[00:55:45.270 --> 00:56:05.420]  You drink six to seven ounces of virgin olive oil, take a couple capsules of bath salt, but not the type that you, you know, hear about people getting in trouble for, you know, the actual Epsom salt, medical grade, you buy it, say, CVS.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:11.062]  And almost everyone that I've talked to, over 90% of it happens the next morning.
[00:56:11.062 --> 00:56:12.343]  For me, it didn't happen for two days.
[00:56:14.844 --> 00:56:16.425]  I'm not a doctor, so I don't know what it is.
[00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:19.527]  Gall stones, liver stones, whatever.
[00:56:19.527 --> 00:56:21.669]  I'm not going to make medical statements.
[00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:30.975]  All I know is spectacular, I hate to talk about it, it's embarrassing, but we're talking about a good 30 to 40 black stones, which means that was really toxic.
[00:56:30.975 --> 00:56:32.736]  Supposed to be green or brown.
[00:56:32.736 --> 00:56:35.958]  And I'm talking hard stones, folks.
[00:56:35.958 --> 00:56:40.541]  Just comes out of you and you're like, oh my gosh, it's like the movie Alien or something.
[00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.403]  If you're super, super healthy, maybe 1-2% of people, nothing happens.
[00:56:44.915 --> 00:56:53.036]  But, you've heard the callers, we've opened the phones up unscreened, and the people calling are just blown away by what happens.
[00:56:53.036 --> 00:56:57.937]  Leanne McAdoo's done it, her good friend's done it, she wants to come in next week and talk about it.
[00:56:57.937 --> 00:57:04.358]  And Leanne McAdoo and Anthony Gutiardia are going to be in here for about 10 minutes at the bottom of the next hour to discuss it.
[00:57:04.358 --> 00:57:05.559]  But here's the good news.
[00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:08.159]  Liver Cleanze is back.
[00:57:08.159 --> 00:57:11.460]  The Liver Shield is the name of the product by InfoWars Life is back.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.640]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:17.151]  We got a small supply back in, sold out in a few days.
[00:57:17.151 --> 00:57:23.496]  We got a large supply of InfoWars Live Liver Shield in.
[00:57:23.496 --> 00:57:30.181]  And it's only part of it with these herbs, along with the oxy powder at night.
[00:57:30.181 --> 00:57:32.422]  You take those together, so you just mix this.
[00:57:32.422 --> 00:57:35.865]  I mix it with the water when I take the apple cider vinegar.
[00:57:36.835 --> 00:57:38.756]  We don't sell the apple cider vinegar or the salt.
[00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:41.677]  But all how to do it, the recipe is very simple.
[00:57:41.677 --> 00:57:43.779]  There's five steps, six days.
[00:57:43.779 --> 00:57:44.699]  It's very easy to do.
[00:57:44.699 --> 00:57:46.860]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.041]  And just go read it for yourself.
[00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.322]  Watch the informational videos.
[00:57:50.322 --> 00:57:54.344]  Everybody says, man, your face is already slimming down.
[00:57:54.344 --> 00:57:55.925]  You look so much more healthy and vibrant.
[00:57:55.925 --> 00:57:57.105]  You've got more energy.
[00:57:57.105 --> 00:57:58.126]  You're also a bigger jerk.
[00:57:58.826 --> 00:57:59.567]  Like I used to be?
[00:57:59.567 --> 00:58:00.928]  I feel younger.
[00:58:00.928 --> 00:58:02.549]  I mean, I'm more aggressive.
[00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:04.772]  And it's just everything I'm doing.
[00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:06.473]  And I still put bad things in my body.
[00:58:06.473 --> 00:58:07.854]  I'm not perfect, believe me.
[00:58:07.854 --> 00:58:09.536]  Work hard, play hard.
[00:58:09.536 --> 00:58:17.663]  But if you want to really have the opportunity, I don't know if it's going to work for you like it did for me and all these other people.
[00:58:17.663 --> 00:58:19.105]  In fact, it just works totally horribly.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.141]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:58:21.141 --> 00:58:22.621]  Just check it out for yourself.
[00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:24.903]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:58:24.903 --> 00:58:25.943]  Liver Shield is back.
[00:58:25.943 --> 00:58:27.164]  It's so dramatic.
[00:58:27.164 --> 00:58:29.485]  I couldn't believe what it did for me personally.
[00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:30.526]  Liver Shield is back.
[00:58:30.526 --> 00:58:34.328]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:34.328 --> 00:58:38.610]  Thank you all for your support and support our local affiliates as well.
[00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.132]  We'll be back with Obama's speech and more.
[00:58:41.132 --> 00:58:44.193]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.193 --> 00:58:45.434]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:53.376]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[00:58:53.376 --> 00:58:57.641]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:58:57.641 --> 00:59:04.929]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:15.772]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:59:15.772 --> 00:59:19.273]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:59:19.273 --> 00:59:20.413]  What do you have to lose?
[00:59:20.413 --> 00:59:23.114]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[00:59:23.254 --> 00:59:28.858]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:59:28.858 --> 00:59:32.161]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:59:32.161 --> 00:59:36.344]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:59:36.344 --> 00:59:38.666]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:59:38.666 --> 00:59:45.632]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:51.056 --> 00:59:53.644]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:09.893]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.893 --> 01:00:11.453]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.453 --> 01:00:12.793]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:17.195]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.195 --> 01:00:21.256]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.554]  I pray many times a week.
[01:00:35.554 --> 01:00:38.677]  I wouldn't say every day, but four or five times a week.
[01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:41.800]  And it seems to help me.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:47.425]  Because I get so angry sometimes I get a crick in my neck and I have trouble breathing.
[01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:47.886]  I actually...
[01:00:49.463 --> 01:00:52.645]  Get in a very aggressive mode.
[01:00:52.645 --> 01:00:55.427]  Because I just started thinking about the crimes being committed.
[01:00:55.427 --> 01:00:58.489]  They're arresting people in Germany that criticize open borders.
[01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:03.613]  They're working with Zuckerberg to censor people here domestically, including us.
[01:01:03.613 --> 01:01:10.197]  Our government's funding Al-Qaeda to murder all these innocent people in ISIS.
[01:01:10.197 --> 01:01:15.141]  The Federal Reserve's destroying the country by design.
[01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:16.862]  And I just don't want to sit here and take it anymore.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:41.426]  Now, when we start the next segment, I played Vladimir Putin's speech, or an excerpt of it, where he said, this is not about Russia's interests, this is about morally doing the right thing, and it's about defending our national sovereignty against radical al-Qaeda groups and ISIS groups that the West is funding and using, and how dare you do this?
[01:01:41.426 --> 01:01:42.186]  And it's a fact!
[01:01:48.254 --> 01:01:57.941]  You know, I took the bait that Putin in 99 had bombed his own apartment buildings, and he still may have.
[01:01:57.941 --> 01:01:59.403]  He was the Vice President.
[01:01:59.403 --> 01:02:05.527]  He needed to be able to attack the Chechens that were working for the West, trying to peel away several countries away from Russia.
[01:02:05.527 --> 01:02:08.089]  I'm not defending the bombing of apartment buildings.
[01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:14.754]  They did bomb apartment buildings that were working apartment buildings, not elderly, so that most people weren't in the buildings when they did it.
[01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:15.315]  Still terrible.
[01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:28.071]  And Moscow police or a suburb of Moscow police caught FSB in a building with a plastic explosive and then they said, oh, it's part of a drill.
[01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:31.914]  So there's a good chance Russia has engaged in false flags.
[01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:35.677]  That is Vladimir Putin has when he was vice president.
[01:02:35.677 --> 01:02:38.759]  But there's not total proof of that.
[01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:44.683]  But I was told by a lot of other Russian experts that, no, that was done to actually destabilize Russia.
[01:02:45.874 --> 01:02:53.099]  And to try to take the fight away from Chechnya into Russia itself, but that's not the effect it had.
[01:02:53.099 --> 01:02:56.542]  But that's why I say we can't sit here and completely trust Vladimir Putin.
[01:02:56.542 --> 01:03:00.785]  All I know is Putin's not trying to take my guns.
[01:03:00.785 --> 01:03:06.209]  All I know is Vladimir Putin is not trying to force vaccines on me or GMO.
[01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:11.753]  All I know is Vladimir Putin is not trying to teach my seven-year-old how she can be a man.
[01:03:13.693 --> 01:03:16.896]  All I know is, is that Vladimir Putin's not trying to make me drink fluoride.
[01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:25.161]  Vladimir Putin is not funding ISIS and ISIL and all the rest of these Western-backed groups.
[01:03:25.161 --> 01:03:29.264]  And Vladimir Putin's not trying to bring in a one-world government.
[01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:35.249]  So, we have the headline in the New York Post, Obama has turned Putin into the world's most powerful leader.
[01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:51.050]  And they make it political, and certainly Obama's part of that, so you can say that and be fair, but isn't it globalism has made Putin look like a world leader, or the predominant world leader, because globalism is such a miserable tyranny.
[01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:53.672]  By the way, it's not a failure, though.
[01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:56.834]  You know, Putin said, oh, the West has failed in what it's done.
[01:03:56.834 --> 01:04:03.219]  I guess it's failed to have Al-Qaeda and ISIS take over, I guess that's true, but not failed in funding these groups, that was their plan.
[01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:10.600]  So what do you think the larger geopolitical plan is?
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:17.566]  And what do you think is going to happen now that Obama's announcing they're not going to be backing Syrian rebels anymore against Assad?
[01:04:17.566 --> 01:04:19.187]  Is that a fake statement?
[01:04:19.187 --> 01:04:20.148]  Is that a fraud?
[01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.030]  Is that a faint?
[01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:25.533]  Is that a zig when they zag?
[01:04:25.533 --> 01:04:28.135]  Is that a fake handoff?
[01:04:28.135 --> 01:04:29.176]  Is that a sneak play?
[01:04:30.689 --> 01:04:31.969]  Or what does that signify?
[01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.850]  What do you think the next geopolitical move is gonna be?
[01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:40.691]  We've already seen Soros and NATO take down Ukraine and spin it that Russia did it.
[01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:41.571]  What's coming next?
[01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:43.152]  I want to take your phone calls.
[01:04:43.152 --> 01:04:43.792]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:43.852]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:43.952]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:43.952 --> 01:04:46.613]  Infowars.com is full of key stories right now.
[01:04:46.613 --> 01:04:46.993]  Check it out.
[01:04:59.102 --> 01:05:02.203]  This article from Medical Express appeared on the Drudge Report.
[01:05:02.203 --> 01:05:05.604]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk.
[01:05:05.604 --> 01:05:13.047]  Emerging evidence ties endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure to two of the biggest public health threats facing society, diabetes and obesity.
[01:05:13.047 --> 01:05:15.688]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[01:05:15.888 --> 01:05:25.811]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:31.773]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[01:05:31.773 --> 01:05:39.615]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:49.020]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.761]  All things we've been telling you here at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:54.682]  Check out InfoWarsLife.com for more information.
[01:05:54.682 --> 01:05:57.224]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:58.823 --> 01:06:03.966]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:06:03.966 --> 01:06:10.090]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.873]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:18.456]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:06:18.456 --> 01:06:20.417]  No needles, no injections.
[01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:25.040]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:28.682 --> 01:06:29.803]  Brain Force is here.
[01:06:29.803 --> 01:06:32.024]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:32.024 --> 01:06:37.008]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:06:37.008 --> 01:06:40.310]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:43.792]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:45.774]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:45.774 --> 01:06:47.875]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.876]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:06:49.876 --> 01:06:55.500]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.602 --> 01:06:59.863]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:59.863 --> 01:07:04.845]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:04.845 --> 01:07:07.506]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:14.570]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:17.551]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:20.513]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:20.513 --> 01:07:22.534]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:22.534 --> 01:07:25.335]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:25.435 --> 01:07:31.176]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:34.677]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:37.778]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:37.778 --> 01:07:45.079]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:07:45.079 --> 01:07:48.300]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:07:54.821 --> 01:08:02.563]  I don't normally talk about movies that are concerning entertainment because that's a diversion, but so much of it's scripted.
[01:08:21.249 --> 01:08:27.474]  And in that, people can really train themselves to see the propaganda and then to tell others about it.
[01:08:27.474 --> 01:08:40.604]  In fact, I've found it's easier to wake the public up exposing propaganda in movies and in books and on television than it is to get them to wake up to propaganda involved in politics.
[01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:41.565]  And here's an example.
[01:08:41.565 --> 01:08:49.671]  Did NASA time its Mars announcement to coincide with the new movie, The Martian, starring Matt Damon?
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.584]  That's Yahoo News Associated Press.
[01:08:54.584 --> 01:08:59.592]  And Ridley Scott, who's a great director, I can't wait to see the movie, said, I knew there was water months ago.
[01:09:04.585 --> 01:09:09.746]  Well, we knew there was water on Mars a hundred plus years ago with telescopes.
[01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:18.388]  There were white ice caps on its northern and southern hemisphere visible in 1900 or before.
[01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:24.869]  People 300 years ago thought that there was canals and water on it because the rivers they could see.
[01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:26.490]  We just know most the rivers are dry.
[01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:32.031]  But yes, the probes have proven there's running water in the summer months.
[01:09:33.123 --> 01:09:41.905]  And it comes up out of the ground like springs when it gets up above 50 degrees or so on Mars.
[01:09:41.905 --> 01:09:45.026]  So, that's what's going on on Mars.
[01:09:45.026 --> 01:09:47.626]  But it's just, oh my gosh!
[01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:49.066]  Is this all a PR stunt?
[01:09:49.066 --> 01:09:53.727]  Gee, was the Pope getting in the new Fiat, the larger Fiat?
[01:09:53.727 --> 01:09:55.928]  You think that was a stunt from Italy?
[01:09:55.928 --> 01:09:56.208]  I wonder.
[01:09:57.188 --> 01:10:01.991]  Gee, the police opening the line up, letting a little girl run up to the Pope.
[01:10:01.991 --> 01:10:03.312]  It was obviously staged.
[01:10:03.312 --> 01:10:04.713]  He was ready for it.
[01:10:04.713 --> 01:10:06.074]  Anybody could see it was staged.
[01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:07.255]  It was bad acting.
[01:10:07.255 --> 01:10:09.076]  We said it was staged.
[01:10:09.076 --> 01:10:12.338]  Mark Zuckerberg had it censored, I guess, with his people.
[01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:19.963]  He admitted that at the UN hearing Saturday that they had censored any criticism of open borders in America or in Europe.
[01:10:19.963 --> 01:10:23.265]  And they report people that do to the German police and folks are arrested.
[01:10:23.265 --> 01:10:25.806]  I mean, think about the tyranny in Germany.
[01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:26.407]  No free speech.
[01:10:28.578 --> 01:10:30.779]  And we came out and said, the Pope kid.
[01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:33.900]  What they're not telling you, it's totally fake.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.760]  The day it happened.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.001]  Then it got taken down, it got blocked.
[01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:42.922]  Kit Daniels came out and then talked about it more with Darren McBream when he hosted the Nightly News.
[01:10:42.922 --> 01:10:51.085]  So not only is this stuff staged, when you try to expose that you're being manipulated, they censor you.
[01:10:51.085 --> 01:10:58.107]  Now nobody's gonna censor us if we talk about clearly NASA coinciding a great promotion of space travel.
[01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:05.133]  and travel inside the solar system to our nearest neighbor.
[01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:07.935]  Fourth rock out from the third rock.
[01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:11.098]  Certainly, that's the type of propaganda we need to see.
[01:11:11.098 --> 01:11:17.403]  Promoting human exploration, trailblazing, making astronauts heroes again.
[01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:20.605]  The word propaganda has been made synonymous with lying.
[01:11:20.605 --> 01:11:24.328]  No, that's black propaganda.
[01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:28.412]  Propaganda is simply material that promotes your point of view.
[01:11:29.935 --> 01:11:49.944]  So I put out propaganda all day about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, property rights, medical freedom, Mother Nature supplements, my relationship with Christ, because it's what I believe, it's what makes me feel good, it's what I've had good experiences with.
[01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:54.686]  I'm trying to share information with people.
[01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:57.347]  I've been down on the hike and bike trail before at a really busy
[01:11:58.752 --> 01:12:00.613]  Waterfall.
[01:12:00.613 --> 01:12:07.357]  And I was sitting there talking to a group of people and I said, you know, about 500 yards down is an even bigger waterfall.
[01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:08.517]  You got to walk further.
[01:12:08.517 --> 01:12:11.299]  And there's hardly anybody there.
[01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:14.561]  And guess what the unanimous response is?
[01:12:14.561 --> 01:12:15.581]  We want to go down there.
[01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:16.762]  Don't tell everybody.
[01:12:18.413 --> 01:12:19.374]  And I kind of get that.
[01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:27.264]  You find a fishing hole that's really the best at some national park or state park, you don't want to tell everybody where the fish are at or next they'll all be there.
[01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:28.665]  So maybe I'm a party pooper.
[01:12:31.567 --> 01:12:36.270]  The globalists don't want to build bigger economies so that everybody can be successful.
[01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:42.875]  They want smaller economies they control so they can dictate total terms to everyone.
[01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:49.459]  We're going to launch the phone system and I'm going to give the phone number out.
[01:12:49.459 --> 01:12:51.981]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:12:51.981 --> 01:12:52.021]  800-259-9231.
[01:13:03.177 --> 01:13:12.203]  And I specifically want to get your take on Putin's address versus Obama's address and the media rightfully saying here in the U.S.
[01:13:12.203 --> 01:13:17.507]  that Putin is now the leader of the world compared to Obama.
[01:13:17.507 --> 01:13:30.336]  In the past, American presidents were the leaders of the free world and most of the world hailed their support towards America because China was so nightmarishly evil.
[01:13:31.562 --> 01:13:37.445]  Soviet Union was so out of control bad.
[01:13:37.445 --> 01:13:42.907]  We've got a crew member who, I guess, immigrated here when she was young from Russia.
[01:13:42.907 --> 01:13:44.868]  We're going to interview her soon.
[01:13:44.868 --> 01:13:52.912]  And she was just telling us during the break, she's going to do a piece tonight that will air tomorrow, where she's going to, in the actual Russian, tell you what Putin said.
[01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:55.453]  And I've seen this in the Russian news as well.
[01:13:55.453 --> 01:13:56.954]  Their transcripts are different than ours.
[01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:05.119]  Putin said at the UN, your government's behind Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and how dare you do this, and we're going to fight it, and you know, you're really corrupt.
[01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:08.641]  And by the time it's on US news, it's been watered down.
[01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:14.205]  This is the level of deception they're putting everybody under.
[01:14:15.373 --> 01:14:23.815]  So it goes from light stuff like the Martian being released, right as NASA announces their big Mars mission.
[01:14:23.815 --> 01:14:25.596]  I mean, of course that's going on.
[01:14:25.596 --> 01:14:31.258]  That's propaganda, but it's white propaganda.
[01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:39.660]  It's pro-human, pro-exploration propaganda, but still they should admit they did it on purpose, just out of respect for the public.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:15:01.231]  Then you've got deceptive stuff like the Pope and the little girl, and then you've got really deceptive stuff where Zuckerberg comes out and tries to stop people from exposing what's going on, and then admits it at the UN, talking to the German Chancellor.
[01:15:01.231 --> 01:15:05.534]  And then the deception gets even worse, where they take what Vladimir Putin says and twist it.
[01:15:08.442 --> 01:15:15.967]  No wonder Americans are so ignorant politically, because we're just bathing in disinformation.
[01:15:15.967 --> 01:15:19.429]  Let's talk to the Watcher in FEMA Region 9.
[01:15:19.429 --> 01:15:23.972]  I guess formerly there in the Pacific Northwest.
[01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:25.293]  He wants to talk about Putin's speech.
[01:15:25.293 --> 01:15:27.814]  Thanks for calling.
[01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:30.196]  Alex, he sounded so much like you.
[01:15:30.196 --> 01:15:36.500]  It wasn't for the translation on RT that I would have thought you were on the stage.
[01:15:38.237 --> 01:15:40.779]  Well, the truth's the truth.
[01:15:40.779 --> 01:15:41.420]  It is.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.123]  And I was so excited, my wife thought I was out of my mind.
[01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:49.307]  But I was like, wow, okay, the jig is up.
[01:15:49.307 --> 01:15:51.649]  And then when it came to Obama's speech, I just turned him off.
[01:15:52.216 --> 01:15:54.017]  I don't even want to listen to the lies.
[01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:58.299]  Because all he does is spout forth lies and then the media just plays it up.
[01:15:58.299 --> 01:15:59.759]  Well, we're going to play what he had to say.
[01:15:59.759 --> 01:16:00.680]  I've got the transcript here.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.280]  He came and said, we come in peace.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:02.881]  We love you.
[01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:04.101]  Get in the candy truck.
[01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.182]  Get in the ice cream truck.
[01:16:05.182 --> 01:16:05.842]  I have a puppy.
[01:16:05.842 --> 01:16:08.643]  I mean, he basically just said, we love you, Russia.
[01:16:08.643 --> 01:16:10.224]  Please stop attacking everyone.
[01:16:10.224 --> 01:16:11.825]  Please stop being evil.
[01:16:11.825 --> 01:16:13.745]  Please help us fight ISIS.
[01:16:13.745 --> 01:16:16.347]  While they run it, while Putin's like, OK, I'm there battling them.
[01:16:16.347 --> 01:16:17.327]  Join me.
[01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:19.288]  It's just total inversion of reality.
[01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:20.827]  It is.
[01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:30.072]  I have friends in Ukraine, and one of my friends was helping me translate the actual Russian version of it, and it's pretty much spot on.
[01:16:30.072 --> 01:16:41.458]  But, when during the Ukraine crisis, when it occurred, she flew over there the Thursday before it happened, and when everything blew up, and her and a friend were watching
[01:16:42.478 --> 01:16:50.284]  It's basically a mock military action between the Ukrainian army and the Russian army.
[01:16:50.284 --> 01:16:53.487]  But they were all Ukrainians, okay?
[01:16:53.487 --> 01:17:01.433]  So they watched it and these guys come together and they tackle and capture these Ukrainian troops.
[01:17:01.433 --> 01:17:07.398]  And then when the cameras rolled away, they all stopped, started shaking hands, patting each other on the back.
[01:17:08.431 --> 01:17:10.573]  Well, what?
[01:17:10.573 --> 01:17:12.214]  She says, like, what are they doing?
[01:17:12.214 --> 01:17:19.640]  So she says she thought she saw stage stuff being shot ahead of the so-called Revolution being launched days later.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.102]  It was two days after it started.
[01:17:22.102 --> 01:17:28.526]  She watched later that night, she watched it on the news with her friend, and her friend's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not what happened.
[01:17:28.526 --> 01:17:29.987]  And she goes, yeah.
[01:17:29.987 --> 01:17:34.491]  When she came back two weeks later after having to go through a whole lot of stuff to get out of there,
[01:17:36.825 --> 01:17:39.147]  She called me up and said, we've got to talk in person.
[01:17:39.147 --> 01:17:40.288]  I said, OK, what's going on?
[01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:42.550]  She goes, I can't tell you.
[01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:44.732]  She gets over and she tells me all of this.
[01:17:44.732 --> 01:17:48.835]  And I was like, yeah, I mean, Alex is saying the same thing.
[01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:50.116]  It's all staged.
[01:17:50.116 --> 01:17:51.397]  But what's going on over there?
[01:17:51.397 --> 01:17:58.583]  It's just like, you know, the Victoria Nuland stuff where she said FDU and all that, and they were picking out who was going to be the leader.
[01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:03.893]  I showed her that and her face dropped.
[01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:07.016]  She's like, oh my god, what's going on?
[01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:11.781]  It's insanity in our government, which I don't like to call our government.
[01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:13.463]  It's our occupiers, like you say.
[01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:18.356]  ...are orchestrating almost everything that's going on in the world.
[01:18:18.356 --> 01:18:19.477]  It's bad right now.
[01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:20.598]  It certainly is.
[01:18:20.598 --> 01:18:24.021]  And Russia is grabbing its interest in the country.
[01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:26.322]  The West is trying to get its interest.
[01:18:26.322 --> 01:18:28.764]  The issue is, this is Russia's doorstep.
[01:18:28.764 --> 01:18:30.886]  It used to be part of Russia.
[01:18:30.886 --> 01:18:39.032]  And our government overthrew the elected government and then put a bizarre white supremacist group in that actually hails Hitler.
[01:18:40.219 --> 01:18:47.303]  And then our news had the nerve to call Putin Hitler and claim that the Russians were like Hitler.
[01:18:47.303 --> 01:18:49.604]  I mean, even for Americans, people should see through that.
[01:18:49.604 --> 01:18:54.306]  But the Russians were the main group that fought Hitler and lost 20 million people.
[01:18:54.306 --> 01:18:59.549]  It's just, it's so crazy that not all the Western Ukrainians are bad people.
[01:18:59.549 --> 01:19:03.531]  And they have real beefs with what the Russians did to them under Lenin and Stalin.
[01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:04.171]  Absolutely.
[01:19:06.855 --> 01:19:14.862]  Now to resurrect the Nazi movement in Ukraine from World War II and put it in charge is just crazy!
[01:19:14.862 --> 01:19:26.932]  But what do you expect from George Soros, who told CNN, Fareed Zarkaria, that, yes, I was key in my foundations with what you're now seeing over there today.
[01:19:26.932 --> 01:19:28.674]  I am the main person behind it.
[01:19:28.674 --> 01:19:30.255]  Yes, I'm very proud.
[01:19:30.255 --> 01:19:34.478]  Another bizarre Nazi collaborator who's Jewish,
[01:19:35.543 --> 01:19:36.443]  You can't make this up.
[01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:37.564]  It's like Spectre.
[01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.265]  Nobody's who they seem.
[01:19:39.265 --> 01:19:45.807]  Funding actual grandkids and kids of Nazis to run around and murder everybody.
[01:19:45.807 --> 01:19:47.508]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:19:47.508 --> 01:19:50.849]  And that's why America's lost so much of the moral high ground.
[01:19:50.849 --> 01:19:56.011]  And then we have NATO generals shooting their mouths off about how we can defeat Russia easily.
[01:19:56.011 --> 01:19:57.052]  Let's just have a war.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.441]  Wait a minute!

[01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:02.468]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.468 --> 01:22:03.109]  It's true.
[01:22:03.109 --> 01:22:07.251]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:12.987]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold prime.
[01:24:12.987 --> 01:24:20.270]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:22.711]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[01:24:25.722 --> 01:24:38.688]  Now they have the President's Rural Commission in the ten regions of FEMA under the Pentagon set up to end rural life.
[01:24:38.688 --> 01:24:50.453]  Set to come in and selectively cut off the resources to force us into the compact cities under agenda 21.
[01:24:50.453 --> 01:24:52.434]  Here's the best part of the song.
[01:24:52.434 --> 01:24:52.814]  Crank it up.
[01:24:53.632 --> 01:24:55.993]  Well, not if they have their way.
[01:24:55.993 --> 01:24:56.693]  You can't.
[01:24:56.693 --> 01:25:03.676]  That's why they got the ATF and the Feds out there to shut down everybody that's got their own whiskey, their own smoke.
[01:25:03.676 --> 01:25:07.257]  Not gonna survive if you get shot up with that vaccine.
[01:25:20.402 --> 01:25:23.987]  You'll get cancer when you're 45.
[01:25:23.987 --> 01:25:25.690]  Your daughter's gonna get it when she's 10.
[01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:25.910]  Really?
[01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:27.452]  They can't get you with the chemtrails?
[01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:47.433]  And I'm not saying a country boy can't survive, but you gotta do more than be out there on the back 40 in your four-wheel drive truck.
[01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:50.914]  You gotta take over your local city politically.
[01:25:50.914 --> 01:25:52.794]  You gotta take over your state.
[01:25:52.794 --> 01:25:54.035]  You gotta get on the march.
[01:25:54.035 --> 01:25:55.375]  You gotta get on the offensive.
[01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:56.936]  That's what we've gotta understand.
[01:25:56.936 --> 01:25:58.856]  We're gonna win this fight.
[01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:12.356]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:26:12.356 --> 01:26:20.283]  Does it make anybody mad that last Wednesday, last Thursday, they had the little girl run up to the Pope?
[01:26:20.283 --> 01:26:24.327]  Kit Daniels wrote a story about it saying it's obviously staged, showed the photos.
[01:26:24.327 --> 01:26:27.870]  It had close to 20,000 shares in a couple hours.
[01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:30.092]  That's super viral.
[01:26:30.092 --> 01:26:33.014]  Our average story gets three or four thousand shares.
[01:26:33.014 --> 01:26:33.475]  Still big.
[01:26:35.283 --> 01:26:38.485]  And they just killed it.
[01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:39.626]  They just killed the story.
[01:26:39.626 --> 01:26:40.646]  Brought it down to zero shares.
[01:26:40.646 --> 01:26:42.307]  You couldn't share it.
[01:26:42.307 --> 01:26:52.854]  And then Zuckerberg, Saturday, on the dais, up there with Merkel, said, we're going to censor, we're going to control, we're going to call on Mike.
[01:26:52.854 --> 01:26:56.076]  We're going to stop any criticism of the, quote, migrants.
[01:26:56.076 --> 01:27:04.601]  Imagine assaulting Europe with millions of people, a bunch of them ISIS, and then saying we're going to censor anybody that tries to expose that.
[01:27:06.866 --> 01:27:09.767]  That is hardcore totalitarianism.
[01:27:09.767 --> 01:27:11.047]  That is hardcore.
[01:27:11.047 --> 01:27:13.368]  While they act like they're not censoring.
[01:27:13.368 --> 01:27:15.309]  Oh, we don't censor.
[01:27:15.309 --> 01:27:18.309]  And I'm not even singling out Facebook here.
[01:27:18.309 --> 01:27:21.610]  A lot of these platforms do this.
[01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:23.751]  And people should really be freaked out.
[01:27:23.751 --> 01:27:25.452]  A lot of liberals are on a power trip.
[01:27:25.452 --> 01:27:27.372]  You bet we're going to shut your speech down now.
[01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:29.013]  It's our time to take over.
[01:27:29.013 --> 01:27:30.033]  Well, that's not liberal.
[01:27:32.867 --> 01:27:38.752]  The precedent's being set with liberal causes because that's the agenda being used to domesticate the public.
[01:27:38.752 --> 01:27:44.498]  But down the road, you're gonna be censored too.
[01:27:44.498 --> 01:27:50.343]  Splash some cold water on your face if you're a so-called liberal and ask yourself, is this really who you are?
[01:27:50.343 --> 01:27:54.767]  Let's go ahead and go to Aaron in Montana.
[01:27:54.767 --> 01:27:55.628]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[01:27:55.628 --> 01:27:56.248]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:56.248 --> 01:27:56.649]  Go ahead.
[01:27:56.649 --> 01:27:59.091]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:27:59.091 --> 01:27:59.271]  Good.
[01:28:00.836 --> 01:28:03.218]  Hey, you know, I was just thinking about this.
[01:28:03.218 --> 01:28:10.323]  You know, in the beginning of Putin, when he was first running his re-election campaign, he's running around with his shirt off, horse back in.
[01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:15.064]  Shooting guns up, you know, just completely the man's man.
[01:28:15.064 --> 01:28:17.365]  Everybody, you know, I'm a man, right?
[01:28:17.365 --> 01:28:24.310]  Yeah, that's clearly a ploy, but they're promoting masculinity, being in charge and having strong families.
[01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:27.652]  The globalists here promote an effeminate Obama on purpose.
[01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:32.975]  So what Putin's doing, I think it's healthy to have a John Wayne style president.
[01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:37.598]  But what I'm getting at is they're doing it on purpose because Obama, what does he do?
[01:28:37.598 --> 01:28:39.740]  He appoints a civilian gay
[01:28:40.393 --> 01:28:40.813]  Yeah, I...yeah.
[01:28:40.813 --> 01:28:41.254]  That's...yep.
[01:29:08.433 --> 01:29:15.637]  My other point, if I could make, would be we have a local issue in Montana with a gun control.
[01:29:15.637 --> 01:29:22.641]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg's initiative is now taking effect in Missoula, Montana.
[01:29:22.641 --> 01:29:26.103]  They're implementing a firearms sale ordinance.
[01:29:27.136 --> 01:29:32.658]  That basically says no more person-to-person sales without a federal background check.
[01:29:32.658 --> 01:29:38.560]  Over 200 cities, even in conservative areas like Montana, are now bought and paid for by Bloomberg.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.521]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:39.521 --> 01:29:40.481]  Great call, sir.
[01:29:40.481 --> 01:29:43.122]  Great point on the Putin situation.
[01:29:43.122 --> 01:29:44.183]  Absolutely.
[01:29:44.183 --> 01:29:45.363]  The Russians know they're dying.
[01:29:45.363 --> 01:29:46.364]  They know they're collapsing.
[01:29:46.364 --> 01:29:48.484]  They're desperately hoping a strong man can save them.
[01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:49.825]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.825 --> 01:29:52.346]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:55.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.068 --> 01:30:05.490]  In the wake of Pope Francis visiting the United States and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, we have this.
[01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:13.712]  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid $3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male.
[01:30:13.712 --> 01:30:21.435]  The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to someone identified only as Individual A to hide past misconduct.
[01:30:21.435 --> 01:30:25.616]  It has been claimed that Individual A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastert was attempting to silence.
[01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:33.401]  Citing anonymous sources, the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher.
[01:30:33.401 --> 01:30:37.984]  Before leaving Congress in 2007, Hastert was the longest ever serving Republican speaker.
[01:30:37.984 --> 01:30:41.287]  Because when you have skeletons in the closet, you are easy to control.
[01:30:41.287 --> 01:30:44.689]  Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:49.572]  Hastert took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[01:30:49.572 --> 01:30:55.116]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet.
[01:30:55.236 --> 01:30:58.837]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[01:32:32.958 --> 01:32:37.121]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:32:37.121 --> 01:32:42.065]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:55.475]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:01.087 --> 01:33:01.768]  Is the U.S.
[01:33:01.768 --> 01:33:14.069]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[01:33:14.069 --> 01:33:14.711]  To Turkey?
[01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:17.873]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:17.873 --> 01:33:20.516]  A new world order.
[01:33:20.516 --> 01:33:24.261]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[01:33:24.261 --> 01:33:31.370]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:36.995]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhadj.
[01:33:36.995 --> 01:33:40.018]  And of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[01:33:40.018 --> 01:33:44.223]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:33:44.223 --> 01:33:48.747]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[01:33:48.747 --> 01:33:54.152]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[01:33:55.193 --> 01:34:00.155]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[01:34:00.155 --> 01:34:02.496]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:34:02.496 --> 01:34:08.177]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[01:34:08.177 --> 01:34:12.479]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:34:13.079 --> 01:34:19.407]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and play an important part in events now.
[01:34:19.407 --> 01:34:23.813]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[01:34:23.813 --> 01:34:28.559]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:34:28.559 --> 01:34:30.301]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:34:32.672 --> 01:34:43.358]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:34:43.358 --> 01:34:46.540]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.741]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:34:57.037 --> 01:34:58.559]  Okay, folks, we are live.
[01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.540]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:07.227]  We are going to be going back to your phone calls and getting into a ton of really important news.
[01:35:07.227 --> 01:35:08.468]  Lawmakers say U.S.
[01:35:08.468 --> 01:35:13.733]  plan to hand the Internet over to the United Nations might be unconstitutional.
[01:35:14.233 --> 01:35:19.317]  Gee, you'd think so when the United States built it and designed it with DARPA.
[01:35:19.317 --> 01:35:20.658]  This is how they want to censor it.
[01:35:20.658 --> 01:35:22.900]  You have the UN censoring as well.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.101]  Really huge news.
[01:35:24.101 --> 01:35:36.311]  Matt, Jim, Sebastian, Tim, Eva, we're going to get to all of you coming up with open phones throughout the end of this hour, right into the third hour as well.
[01:35:36.311 --> 01:35:37.593]  So all of that is coming up.
[01:35:37.593 --> 01:35:38.874]  We're going to play some of Obama's speech.
[01:35:39.675 --> 01:35:44.048]  Of course, it was a bunch of propaganda at the United Nations yesterday, but first...
[01:35:45.094 --> 01:35:57.625]  I wanted to play a piece from a few months ago where Dr. Group and I and others break down how amazing Liver Shield is, one of the newest products from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:57.625 --> 01:36:00.627]  And this product is now back in stock.
[01:36:00.627 --> 01:36:03.309]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[01:36:03.309 --> 01:36:04.731]  It's very, very popular.
[01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:08.494]  It's now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:10.069 --> 01:36:15.233]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:15.233 --> 01:36:25.862]  And here is the piece where we break down how amazing this product is in conjunction with a larger liver cleanse.
[01:36:25.862 --> 01:36:36.251]  Here it is.
[01:36:36.251 --> 01:36:37.973]  And when you eat all these toxins,
[01:36:39.366 --> 01:36:52.818]  If you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had plasticizers in them, your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do, so the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder, and it holds it.
[01:36:52.818 --> 01:36:59.465]  Just Google gallbladder stones, and it's disgusting, but you need to look at it.
[01:36:59.465 --> 01:37:04.049]  And when you finally get filled up with these, it bursts, or it gets infected, and they've got to remove it.
[01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:06.593]  And we'll scroll through these.
[01:37:06.593 --> 01:37:08.114]  There's even grosser ones.
[01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:09.395]  Like, let's scroll down.
[01:37:09.395 --> 01:37:11.477]  On average, they're green or black.
[01:37:11.477 --> 01:37:15.680]  If they're black, they're really old and toxic.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.042]  They're generally green.
[01:37:18.042 --> 01:37:24.228]  And this stuff's meant to be passed out at you, but we eat such artificial food that it doesn't.
[01:37:24.228 --> 01:37:26.510]  These are way beyond kidney stones, you name it.
[01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:27.911]  You also have liver stones.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:34.842]  And medical doctors won't tell you on average, hey, flush your liver.
[01:37:34.842 --> 01:37:36.803]  They'll just say, hey, your liver's sick.
[01:37:36.803 --> 01:37:38.104]  It's going to get progressively worse.
[01:37:38.104 --> 01:37:43.306]  We're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant.
[01:37:43.306 --> 01:37:44.266]  It is unbelievable.
[01:37:44.266 --> 01:37:45.927]  We're showing these disgusting images.
[01:37:45.927 --> 01:37:53.711]  So, about a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Griff's liver cleanse, the one he recommends.
[01:37:53.711 --> 01:37:57.493]  And he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[01:37:57.493 --> 01:37:58.233]  You really ought to do it.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.443]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:04.706]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[01:38:04.706 --> 01:38:08.031]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[01:38:08.031 --> 01:38:10.794]  This is how ignorant I am.
[01:38:10.794 --> 01:38:12.036]  And he's like, look at it online.
[01:38:12.036 --> 01:38:13.198]  I'm not looking at it online.
[01:38:13.198 --> 01:38:14.219]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[01:38:14.219 --> 01:38:14.820]  I don't want to go there.
[01:38:16.946 --> 01:38:19.688]  Well, finally about six months ago they convinced me to do it.
[01:38:19.688 --> 01:38:27.873]  I personally think everybody should go through a liver cleansing if you haven't done one and then take the, for example, the liver shield can be taken two different ways.
[01:38:27.873 --> 01:38:37.240]  It can be taken as a liver support formula, where you just take a couple dropper fulls, but that's not going to purge the liver and remove all that stuff from it.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.521]  In order to do that, you have to do the six day liver cleanse.
[01:38:39.521 --> 01:38:45.905]  I'm going to walk through how the liver works, the different types of cleanses with you and give you the floor, but I'm asking a lot of selfish questions here up front.
[01:38:47.747 --> 01:39:02.499]  How does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over a six-day cleanse, how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end, lay on your side for an hour as you go to sleep, why does it then have the gallbladder release?
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:09.681]  Well, this is something that is a very controversial issue, but results speak for themselves.
[01:39:09.681 --> 01:39:17.583]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have done this, and it dates back even a thousand years, drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:22.844]  Actually, the Greeks over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[01:39:22.844 --> 01:39:29.005]  But how it works is, what you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[01:39:29.725 --> 01:39:44.376]  Starting in the early 90s, when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver, was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder.
[01:39:44.376 --> 01:39:47.359]  And that's really what the first five days is for.
[01:39:47.359 --> 01:39:57.987]  That's where you mix the bottle of liver shield, you pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water, and then you drink four eight-ounce glasses a day of that for five days.
[01:39:57.987 --> 01:39:59.088]  At the same time, though,
[01:39:59.968 --> 01:40:09.896]  That's just part of the informational video that is on Infowarslife.com on the Liver Shield liver cleanse page.
[01:40:09.896 --> 01:40:15.880]  And he walks through how you do it and generally what response the public sees.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.303]  You can read the reviews from third-party individuals for yourself.
[01:40:20.303 --> 01:40:21.264]  But overall it has a 4.8
[01:40:23.596 --> 01:40:30.399]  Rating unheard of by Power Reviews, one of the largest and most respected third-party review sites out there.
[01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:32.420]  There are also other third-party review sites.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:41.064]  Do your own research of the entire Infowarslife.com product chart and see why we call these amazing game changers.
[01:40:41.064 --> 01:40:47.828]  But I didn't even believe this two years ago when they wanted to develop it and wanted me to sell it and thought it was a great idea.
[01:40:47.828 --> 01:40:48.548]  I finally did it.
[01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:51.847]  And I've talked about what happened.
[01:40:51.847 --> 01:40:53.689]  It's embarrassing.
[01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:55.010]  But it's real, nevertheless.
[01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:57.934]  Now, Leanne McAdoo's friend has done it.
[01:40:57.934 --> 01:40:59.175]  Leanne hasn't done it yet.
[01:40:59.175 --> 01:41:00.417]  She corrected me earlier.
[01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:01.598]  She's doing it next week.
[01:41:02.588 --> 01:41:13.662]  But her friend is a actress in some pretty big movies and also been a fitness model and she had gained some weight and stuff and wanted to try it out.
[01:41:13.662 --> 01:41:14.923]  She wasn't paid to do it.
[01:41:14.923 --> 01:41:20.850]  It was Leanne and hers idea talking about it because they were getting ready to do these cleanses together and her friend did it.
[01:41:22.631 --> 01:41:24.912]  So, Leanne's about to do it next week.
[01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.332]  Anthony Gucciardi and Leanne McAdoo, join us here.
[01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:32.733]  And, of course, you're not just getting an amazing product, you're also funding the operation when we talk about this.
[01:41:32.733 --> 01:41:37.294]  But getting our bodies healthy is such a big part of the fight against the globalists.
[01:41:37.294 --> 01:41:42.995]  Leanne McAdoo, Anthony Gucciardi, we've only got a little bit of time, five, six minutes apiece on this segment.
[01:41:42.995 --> 01:41:46.316]  I'm going to come back and go to calls, but I appreciate you coming on today to talk about this.
[01:41:47.376 --> 01:41:50.318]  Liver Shield is finally back in, one of our best sellers.
[01:41:50.318 --> 01:41:51.819]  We did get a large shipment of it.
[01:41:51.819 --> 01:41:57.884]  It's concentrated herbs that, I guess, prepare and open up the liver to be detoxed.
[01:41:57.884 --> 01:42:04.468]  But I'm also told you can take this by itself and also it reportedly, we believe, has some benefits.
[01:42:04.468 --> 01:42:06.410]  So, Anthony, let's start with you and then Leanne McAdoo.
[01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:07.270]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:13.732]  You don't have to go through the full-spectrum liver cleanse, which involves, you know, the apple cider vinegar, the water, the Epsom salt, all that kind of stuff.
[01:42:13.732 --> 01:42:14.533]  The six-day regimen.
[01:42:14.533 --> 01:42:14.713]  Right.
[01:42:14.713 --> 01:42:16.193]  That's still pretty easy, though.
[01:42:16.193 --> 01:42:23.636]  Right, but I put this every single day in my protein shake or my daily water, and I take it every single day to support the natural detoxification of the liver anyway.
[01:42:23.976 --> 01:42:34.741]  You don't have to do the full cleanse, but that said, if you do the full cleanse, as you'll see from the hundreds of reviews on Infowarslife.com, some really crazy things happen.
[01:42:34.741 --> 01:42:36.442]  And we don't have to go into full detail.
[01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:46.087]  You know, we're not claiming to know what it is coming out of us, but we're talking about green balls, black balls, sometimes golf ball-sized balls that come out of you when you do the full cleanse.
[01:42:46.087 --> 01:42:47.428]  Sometimes Martians.
[01:42:47.428 --> 01:42:49.028]  Sometimes Martians.
[01:42:49.028 --> 01:42:49.909]  That's a joke.
[01:42:49.909 --> 01:42:51.670]  Sometimes Hillary Clinton comes out.
[01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:54.311]  And the laughing pen comes out.
[01:42:54.311 --> 01:42:56.113]  But no, it is pretty wild stuff.
[01:42:56.113 --> 01:42:58.394]  Yeah, sometimes you crap Hillary Clinton pens.
[01:42:58.394 --> 01:43:01.316]  It's actually been proven, yeah.
[01:43:01.316 --> 01:43:02.217]  Gosh, I hope not.
[01:43:03.884 --> 01:43:05.106]  Worst nightmare.
[01:43:05.106 --> 01:43:07.288]  Sorry, it's a family show, I apologize.
[01:43:07.288 --> 01:43:08.370]  But if you think about it, right?
[01:43:08.370 --> 01:43:10.913]  Even having an image of Hillary Clinton is not family friendly.
[01:43:10.913 --> 01:43:11.473]  Absolutely not.
[01:43:11.473 --> 01:43:12.354]  It's obscene.
[01:43:12.354 --> 01:43:12.895]  Absolutely.
[01:43:12.895 --> 01:43:16.559]  Is there an FCC file for showing a picture of Hillary Clinton on broadcast TV?
[01:43:16.559 --> 01:43:17.040]  Definitely.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.261]  It's pretty graphic.
[01:43:18.261 --> 01:43:19.523]  You can't show a horse's rear end.
[01:43:19.523 --> 01:43:21.225]  It's a graphic image, actually.
[01:43:21.225 --> 01:43:22.466]  Could be frightening the children.
[01:43:23.147 --> 01:43:26.168]  But, you think about every single day... Fewer discretion is advised.
[01:43:26.168 --> 01:43:26.648]  Sorry.
[01:43:26.648 --> 01:43:27.388]  It's alright.
[01:43:27.388 --> 01:43:29.189]  Every single day, how much we expose ourselves to.
[01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:37.711]  From everyone drinking alcohol, to the crap in the food, the chemicals, everything we possibly can imagine that we eat on a daily basis, all of it goes through the liver.
[01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:43.392]  And the liver is just being hit with so many toxic compounds on a daily basis, that there's no surprise.
[01:43:43.392 --> 01:43:45.473]  The liver's being hit by migrants.
[01:43:45.473 --> 01:43:47.813]  If you drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, it's a migrant.
[01:43:47.813 --> 01:43:49.434]  It has a right to be there eating.
[01:43:49.434 --> 01:43:50.914]  It has a right to destroy your liver.
[01:43:51.594 --> 01:43:54.096]  And I think it's bad if you take liver shield, so don't take it.
[01:43:54.096 --> 01:43:54.817]  Don't go to enforcement.
[01:43:54.817 --> 01:43:56.178]  Liver shield is pure crud.
[01:43:56.178 --> 01:44:00.341]  These aren't well-known ancient herbs, concentrated, known to detoxify.
[01:44:00.341 --> 01:44:01.042]  It's not good.
[01:44:01.042 --> 01:44:02.163]  It doesn't help you.
[01:44:02.163 --> 01:44:03.403]  The government's good.
[01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:05.325]  Do whatever the government says.
[01:44:05.325 --> 01:44:07.527]  I agree, so I'm not even going to keep talking about them.
[01:44:07.527 --> 01:44:08.127]  Just don't buy it.
[01:44:11.553 --> 01:44:14.294]  No, the great part is people did try it.
[01:44:14.294 --> 01:44:18.115]  We've opened the phones up before and it's crazy what folks say comes out.
[01:44:18.115 --> 01:44:18.715]  It is crazy.
[01:44:18.715 --> 01:44:24.636]  And if you look up liver... Obviously we're not doctors, but we can get Dr. Group and others to come on and talk about it.
[01:44:24.636 --> 01:44:34.458]  But when we show, you know, search Google gallstones or liver stones, it's admitted that the things coming out of us look like what they're saying online at medical sites is happening.
[01:44:34.458 --> 01:44:36.019]  I just can't believe this is in me.
[01:44:36.019 --> 01:44:37.619]  I didn't believe it when you first told me about it.
[01:44:37.919 --> 01:44:42.543]  Right, and we're not saying, we're not telling you what it is coming out of you, we know it's messed up.
[01:44:42.543 --> 01:44:51.391]  Look, I know people that have done independent research on what's coming out of them, and we can't talk about it on air because it's studies and stuff like that, but I've had people confirm it to me.
[01:44:51.391 --> 01:44:52.392]  Well do your own research!
[01:44:52.392 --> 01:44:53.753]  Do your own research is the bottom line.
[01:44:54.451 --> 01:45:03.360]  You know, all we have to think about is logically what we're exposing ourselves to on a daily basis and realize, well, yeah, our liver is definitely flooded with a bunch of junk.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.765]  I mean, take McDonald's, admit they have plasticizers in all their fried foods, basically plastic.
[01:45:08.765 --> 01:45:10.147]  Your body's got to do something with that.
[01:45:10.587 --> 01:45:12.348]  Here's a study from today.
[01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:16.470]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk.
[01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:17.310]  Who knew?
[01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:18.630]  Well it is the chemical exposure.
[01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:24.553]  Your body gets hit with a number of toxic compounds every single day to the point where it can't function at its optimum levels anymore.
[01:45:24.553 --> 01:45:27.754]  And that's why we do things like natural detoxification.
[01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:29.135]  It is a real powerful thing.
[01:45:29.815 --> 01:45:30.676]  Just like this story.
[01:45:30.676 --> 01:45:34.419]  Next you're going to tell me exercise is good and drinking lots of purified water is good.
[01:45:34.419 --> 01:45:35.319]  You're such a racist.
[01:45:35.319 --> 01:45:37.141]  I know, it's bad.
[01:45:37.141 --> 01:45:37.661]  You're right.
[01:45:37.661 --> 01:45:41.945]  I think we should let the migrants, the toxicity in our body is really just a migrant form.
[01:45:41.945 --> 01:45:44.647]  We should let the migrants inhabit our bodies like squatters.
[01:45:44.647 --> 01:45:48.790]  When Hitler took cyanide, it wasn't poison, it was a migrant.
[01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:49.350]  Yeah.
[01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:51.152]  And then he flopped around, foamed at the mouth and died.
[01:45:51.152 --> 01:45:52.713]  I think there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:56.276]  What about, what happened when your friend took the anti-migration pill?
[01:45:57.219 --> 01:45:59.860]  Well, I made her send me pictures.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.420]  I was like, I know those girls, I don't know.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:02.500]  Oh, I didn't know this.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:04.581]  I might be sick and twisted, but I wanted to see.
[01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:05.241]  She's a lovely lady.
[01:46:05.241 --> 01:46:06.822]  I don't want to picture that in the photo.
[01:46:06.822 --> 01:46:08.402]  Well, it wasn't that.
[01:46:08.402 --> 01:46:10.543]  It wasn't that.
[01:46:10.543 --> 01:46:14.264]  But it was like quarter size.
[01:46:14.264 --> 01:46:15.524]  And it was green and black.
[01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:18.901]  And she is a very healthy person.
[01:46:18.901 --> 01:46:20.682]  She cleanses a lot.
[01:46:20.682 --> 01:46:23.244]  She eats pretty well as well.
[01:46:23.244 --> 01:46:24.926]  And I was surprised.
[01:46:24.926 --> 01:46:26.307]  She was surprised.
[01:46:26.307 --> 01:46:29.929]  And she's done tons of cleanses and nothing like that ever happened to her.
[01:46:29.929 --> 01:46:36.975]  So I'm really glad that we have this product back because I've been waiting about two months to be able to go ahead and do this with her.
[01:46:37.395 --> 01:46:47.744]  Now folks should consult their physician, because I never heard this in the comments or calls or anybody, but Anthony, and just to be truthful, the last time you tried to cleanse, tell folks what happened.
[01:46:47.744 --> 01:46:50.386]  I mean people, if you're toxic, some things can happen.
[01:46:50.386 --> 01:46:51.547]  You want to tell folks what happened to you?
[01:46:51.547 --> 01:47:03.957]  I've done the liver cleanse like six or seven times, and sometimes you'll feel nauseous, you'll feel really disgusting, and ultimately when you pass these disgusting things out of your body, you'll feel, for me personally, a lot better.
[01:47:03.957 --> 01:47:06.279]  But you will feel toxic, you will feel disgusting.
[01:47:06.539 --> 01:47:08.520]  I mean, it's a matter of doing a serious cleanse.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.561]  I mean, you're eating right for fun.
[01:47:09.561 --> 01:47:11.722]  You said you started hallucinating.
[01:47:11.722 --> 01:47:14.183]  Well... I felt extremely weird.
[01:47:14.183 --> 01:47:15.404]  I felt extremely weird.
[01:47:15.404 --> 01:47:17.525]  Actually, the Emmy said the exact same thing.
[01:47:17.525 --> 01:47:18.425]  Let's just be honest.
[01:47:18.425 --> 01:47:20.687]  She felt like she was kind of like, ugh.
[01:47:20.687 --> 01:47:21.707]  She felt the exact same way.
[01:47:21.707 --> 01:47:24.469]  I felt crappy the next morning, and then I called group, and I go, nothing's happening!
[01:47:25.302 --> 01:47:34.028]  Everybody says this stuff happens and then it's not happening and like a day later it was like, I was walking to the Alamo Draft House movie theater with my kids and I'm like, stay right here, sit at this bench.
[01:47:34.028 --> 01:47:37.470]  I run in there and it was like, whoa.
[01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:39.391]  Yeah, it worked for me.
[01:47:39.391 --> 01:47:40.652]  Disgusting.
[01:47:40.652 --> 01:47:41.533]  You didn't believe it either.
[01:47:41.533 --> 01:47:42.133]  You were like, I don't know.
[01:47:42.133 --> 01:47:42.973]  I was bitching you out.
[01:47:42.973 --> 01:47:44.374]  Yeah, you were like, I don't know about this.
[01:47:44.374 --> 01:47:45.295]  I don't know about this.
[01:47:45.295 --> 01:47:47.016]  And I was like, give it a few days.
[01:47:47.016 --> 01:47:47.777]  Nothing's happening.
[01:47:47.777 --> 01:47:47.937]  Right.
[01:47:47.937 --> 01:47:51.659]  And then you call me at like 10pm and you're like, oh my god.
[01:47:51.659 --> 01:47:52.620]  This is real.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.281]  Yeah, it took me two days, though.
[01:47:55.281 --> 01:47:56.182]  Yeah.
[01:47:56.182 --> 01:47:56.522]  Two days.
[01:47:56.522 --> 01:48:06.467]  Well, about a day and a half, because it took it... It's supposed to happen six to eight hours, so I took it like at ten o'clock one night, you know, done the six days, and then a whole next day, and then like seven at night the next day.
[01:48:06.467 --> 01:48:08.269]  Yeah.
[01:48:08.269 --> 01:48:09.909]  I just can't believe that was in me.
[01:48:09.909 --> 01:48:14.852]  I've only done it once, because I started it and then quit because I was busy with a bunch of stuff.
[01:48:14.852 --> 01:48:15.813]  I need to go ahead and do it again, though.
[01:48:15.813 --> 01:48:17.814]  You should do it with us next week.
[01:48:17.814 --> 01:48:19.535]  Why do you think you got sick on the seventh one?
[01:48:21.172 --> 01:48:23.072]  Well, you know, it depends on what you're putting in your body.
[01:48:23.072 --> 01:48:24.013]  I was more stressed out.
[01:48:24.013 --> 01:48:25.373]  I was eating worse around that time.
[01:48:25.373 --> 01:48:26.753]  Does less and less come out each time?
[01:48:26.753 --> 01:48:31.114]  Less and less does come out in each time from my experience and the experience of others that I've read.
[01:48:31.114 --> 01:48:36.716]  Ultimately, the goal, I mean, if it takes two days for something to pass through you anyway, in your experience, that's obviously bad, right?
[01:48:36.716 --> 01:48:42.177]  If your intestinal tract takes two days to pass whatever it is going through it, that means you need to do another one.
[01:48:42.177 --> 01:48:50.659]  Also, if it's black, I hear, according to the experts, that's even worse because it's a larger, built-up gunk deposit that's been there for a longer period of time.
[01:48:50.999 --> 01:48:55.203]  And by the way, oxy powder goes with this, which you can take several from doing the cleanse.
[01:48:55.203 --> 01:48:56.684]  It's worked like dynamite for me.
[01:48:56.684 --> 01:48:58.225]  I mean, it's not rocket science.
[01:48:58.225 --> 01:49:02.769]  It's higher level oxygen that releases in your intestines and just blows everything out.
[01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:03.810]  It's amazing.
[01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:05.531]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:05.531 --> 01:49:07.332]  And this is how we fund our operation.
[01:49:10.535 --> 01:49:17.899]  Not taxpayer money, not a gun to your head like the IRS, but high quality nutraceuticals, high quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:49:17.899 --> 01:49:24.502]  See the informational videos there in the liver cleanse combo pack page is where you'll find that particular video.
[01:49:24.502 --> 01:49:29.445]  I'm also going to email this out to everybody that's part of the InfoWars Insider Newsletter today.
[01:49:29.445 --> 01:49:35.488]  Leanne, in the minute and a half left, other things your friend experienced and what you're expecting to experience next week.
[01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:40.108]  Well, she said it was very easy, one of the easiest cleanses that she's ever done.
[01:49:40.108 --> 01:49:48.260]  The food, the regimen that Dr. Group has prepared is very easy to follow, and the food is actually tasty.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:51.685]  She said the worst thing... So, Group's gone further now about what you're supposed to eat.
[01:49:52.725 --> 01:49:53.065]  Yeah.
[01:49:53.065 --> 01:49:54.026]  He's even expanded more.
[01:49:54.026 --> 01:49:55.207]  Oh, we have it all on the page.
[01:49:55.207 --> 01:49:56.649]  Yeah, it's very detailed.
[01:49:56.649 --> 01:49:59.731]  I mean, it's a very simple process to follow.
[01:49:59.731 --> 01:50:00.852]  It's very detailed.
[01:50:00.852 --> 01:50:02.654]  Every single day, here's what you have to buy.
[01:50:02.654 --> 01:50:03.915]  Here's how you do it.
[01:50:03.915 --> 01:50:07.278]  And the last day for her was the most intense.
[01:50:07.278 --> 01:50:08.920]  By the way, most of it you don't buy from us.
[01:50:09.557 --> 01:50:09.917]  Yeah.
[01:50:09.917 --> 01:50:10.818]  No, no, no.
[01:50:10.818 --> 01:50:13.460]  And obviously you're wanting to get organic things.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.681]  Let's be clear, though.
[01:50:15.681 --> 01:50:23.206]  I talked to someone who did the master cleanse for like 40 days, which is where you drink the water and lemon juice and cayenne pepper and syrup.
[01:50:23.206 --> 01:50:26.528]  And he was like, yeah, you know, I'm on my 41st day.
[01:50:26.528 --> 01:50:27.528]  Something crazy like that.
[01:50:27.528 --> 01:50:28.889]  He's like, the effects are all right.
[01:50:28.889 --> 01:50:32.451]  And then he did this liver cleanse and he was like, oh my God, that took five days.
[01:50:32.451 --> 01:50:33.232]  It wasn't even that hard.
[01:50:33.232 --> 01:50:33.872]  It's so much better.
[01:50:33.872 --> 01:50:35.714]  And that's exactly what Emmy said.
[01:50:35.714 --> 01:50:36.914]  It was really simple.
[01:50:38.115 --> 01:50:38.776]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:50:38.776 --> 01:50:39.557]  You don't have to starve yourself.
[01:50:39.557 --> 01:50:41.879]  We'll take some before and afters.
[01:50:41.879 --> 01:50:44.122]  Did it take a day for her or more days?
[01:50:44.122 --> 01:50:45.484]  It took several days.
[01:50:45.484 --> 01:50:47.646]  So it didn't happen right away like me?
[01:50:47.646 --> 01:50:48.087]  Exactly.
[01:50:48.087 --> 01:50:51.210]  Is it like a delayed explosion?
[01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:51.551]  Sorry.
[01:50:51.551 --> 01:50:53.293]  Alright, we're going to come back with calls.
[01:50:53.293 --> 01:50:54.814]  Thanks for coming in guys.
[01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:57.537]  Leverage Shield is back at Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:57.537 --> 01:50:58.599]  Thanks for coming in guys.
[01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:01.953]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:51:01.953 --> 01:51:04.476]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:51:04.476 --> 01:51:08.340]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:17.171]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:51:17.171 --> 01:51:20.454]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:51:21.295 --> 01:51:24.436]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:51:24.436 --> 01:51:29.798]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:51:29.798 --> 01:51:34.720]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.901]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:51:37.901 --> 01:51:40.122]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:51:40.982 --> 01:51:48.005]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:51:48.005 --> 01:51:53.606]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.987]  It is as though the protection is free.

[01:54:04.952 --> 01:54:25.977]  Well, Nancy Pelosi came out yesterday and was asked about Planned Parenthood and the dozens of horrible videos, some of which are six, seven hours long, unedited, where they macabrely sit around these fine meals slurping red wine and discussing selling baby parts in Lamborghinis.
[01:54:27.611 --> 01:54:32.052]  And she basically came out in two different statements and said, these videos should be investigated.
[01:54:32.052 --> 01:54:36.394]  I believe they're fake, but I haven't looked at them.
[01:54:36.394 --> 01:54:37.514]  That's like Hillary.
[01:54:37.514 --> 01:54:41.895]  Did you have your fake email to hide that you were sending secret emails?
[01:54:41.895 --> 01:54:45.716]  Oh, that's a preposterous conspiracy theory.
[01:54:45.716 --> 01:54:48.837]  Be like asking Elmer Fudd, do you have a shotgun to shoot rabbits?
[01:54:48.837 --> 01:54:49.917]  That's preposterous.
[01:54:49.917 --> 01:54:51.998]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:54:54.602 --> 01:54:56.005]  I'm gonna take my son dove hunting.
[01:54:56.005 --> 01:54:57.688]  I went and got a license a few days ago.
[01:54:57.688 --> 01:55:02.597]  Hadn't done that in a few years and he'd be like, do you have a license to hunt dove?
[01:55:02.597 --> 01:55:04.180]  No, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.304]  I just went and got this license because I felt like it.
[01:55:10.384 --> 01:55:12.766]  You know, are you wearing that red hat to wear a red hat?
[01:55:12.766 --> 01:55:13.487]  No!
[01:55:13.487 --> 01:55:15.329]  I just have a red hat on my head.
[01:55:15.329 --> 01:55:16.770]  They just play these games.
[01:55:16.770 --> 01:55:29.642]  Meanwhile, new article, Kit Daniels, Infowars.com, so important, Planned Parenthood admits over 86% of revenues are from abortions.
[01:55:29.642 --> 01:55:32.345]  Previously they said that they don't make money on any of it.
[01:55:33.697 --> 01:55:44.027]  Planned Parenthood president makes $520,000 a year from organization, and also has most of her expenses paid for.
[01:55:44.027 --> 01:55:59.021]  So let's go ahead and play Nancy Pelosi, who hasn't seen any of the videos, but she thinks they're fake and should be investigated, even though Planned Parenthood first said they weren't real, then said they were edited, and now is just defending the content.
[01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:03.674]  on the subject of the Planned Parenthood and the attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.
[01:56:03.674 --> 01:56:04.655]  Have you seen the videos?
[01:56:04.655 --> 01:56:07.339]  Is there not anything on those videos that bothers you at all?
[01:56:07.339 --> 01:56:11.444]  Well, I don't stipulate that these videos are real.
[01:56:11.444 --> 01:56:16.870]  And the fact is, in fact, is that the research
[01:56:17.851 --> 01:56:20.212]  That is being criticized.
[01:56:20.212 --> 01:56:22.594]  There is research that has been supported.
[01:56:22.594 --> 01:56:23.754]  No, I haven't seen.
[01:56:23.754 --> 01:56:25.595]  I've seen some news reports of it.
[01:56:25.595 --> 01:56:32.118]  But I also know that it's not real and you can create any reality that you want.
[01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:35.020]  Okay, so even if you don't... That is so key.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:37.141]  Back that up as we analyze this propaganda.
[01:56:37.141 --> 01:56:38.001]  That is so key.
[01:56:38.001 --> 01:56:39.522]  It's earth-shattering.
[01:56:39.522 --> 01:56:44.104]  Remember Karl Rove told the New York Times and the Washington Post, a bunch of them were around him, like 2004?
[01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:49.354]  And they said, listen, Iraq wasn't involved in 9-11.
[01:56:49.354 --> 01:56:52.199]  That was Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:56:52.199 --> 01:56:54.743]  Why do you keep saying they were?
[01:56:54.743 --> 01:56:56.766]  And Karl Rove said, we control reality.
[01:56:56.766 --> 01:56:58.168]  We're history's actors.
[01:56:58.168 --> 01:56:59.731]  We can make any reality we want.
[01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:10.558]  In fact, here's the quote, and while you're studying that reality, judiciously as you will, we'll act again, creating other new realities which you can study too.
[01:57:10.558 --> 01:57:12.299]  And that's how things will sort out.
[01:57:12.299 --> 01:57:17.842]  We're history's actors now, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.
[01:57:17.842 --> 01:57:23.665]  So, here she is saying they can put out fake videos and create any reality they want.
[01:57:23.665 --> 01:57:27.006]  I say they're not real, but I haven't watched them.
[01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.327]  But they need to be investigated.
[01:57:32.169 --> 01:57:33.130]  No, I haven't seen.
[01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:41.678]  I've seen some news reports of it, but I also know that it's not real and you can create any reality that you want.
[01:57:41.678 --> 01:57:47.144]  Okay, so even if you don't accept the videos on their face?
[01:57:47.144 --> 01:57:55.312]  And I think they should be investigated as to how they obtained those and doctored those and then had them be processed.
[01:57:57.264 --> 01:57:59.065]  I mean, the videos are not doctored.
[01:57:59.065 --> 01:58:06.369]  They've released, with all of them, the full, unedited surveillance video, some of them seven obnoxious hours long.
[01:58:06.369 --> 01:58:08.029]  I've sat through hours of it.
[01:58:08.029 --> 01:58:09.370]  I've never sat through an entire one.
[01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:11.311]  I'll tell you that right now.
[01:58:11.311 --> 01:58:16.514]  And it's just her lying to the audience, telling them it doesn't exist.
[01:58:16.514 --> 01:58:19.215]  Just like Hillary says the email scandal is a conspiracy theory.
[01:58:19.215 --> 01:58:20.636]  Of course, it's all admitted.
[01:58:21.778 --> 01:58:30.421]  We're going to come back and go to Matt and Jim and Tim and Sebastian, Mitchell, everybody that's holding your phone call straight ahead.
[01:58:30.421 --> 01:58:31.881]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:58:31.881 --> 01:58:36.503]  She also later says that the head of Planned Parenthood is such a nice lady.
[01:58:36.503 --> 01:58:39.804]  He was such a nice neighbor until he found all the dead bodies in his basement.
[01:58:39.804 --> 01:58:45.446]  I mean, it's the same sickening, preying on her audience, talking to them like they're idiots.
[01:58:45.446 --> 01:58:46.907]  And her constituents are idiots.
[01:58:46.907 --> 01:58:47.507]  I mean, you know, they're...
[01:58:48.959 --> 01:58:56.186]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:00:04.949 --> 02:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.011 --> 02:00:09.772]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.772 --> 02:00:11.352]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.352 --> 02:00:12.713]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.713 --> 02:00:17.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.095 --> 02:00:23.919]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.919 --> 02:00:29.742]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story yesterday, somewhat critical of Donald Trump's tax plan, saying it doesn't cut enough.
[02:00:29.742 --> 02:00:33.264]  I've tried to read at Trump's website exactly what it's going to do.
[02:00:33.264 --> 02:00:33.844]  It's somewhat
[02:00:35.936 --> 02:00:39.377]  Transparent, but also has a few pitfalls.
[02:00:39.377 --> 02:00:48.201]  But the Wall Street Journal's come out saying tax reform for security and prosperity, four tax brackets, zero, 10%, 20, and 25.
[02:00:48.201 --> 02:00:52.343]  That's a lot better than the 40% bracket I'm in.
[02:00:52.343 --> 02:01:01.126]  I had a CPA tell me this morning, as we try to pay all the fake taxes, because we know we're targets, that the way we had it set up, we're probably paying too much taxes.
[02:01:01.126 --> 02:01:02.567]  But no marriage penalty.
[02:01:04.309 --> 02:01:07.151]  No alternative minimum tax.
[02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:11.154]  So we're going to try to research here and fact check Trump's tax claims.
[02:01:11.154 --> 02:01:17.299]  And I'm going to try to get to the bottom of it for myself and find out who exactly is right around here.
[02:01:17.299 --> 02:01:30.408]  I was just getting into Nancy Pelosi saying I haven't seen the Planned Parenthood videos, but that it's doctored, it's fake, it's a lie, and it should be investigated.
[02:01:30.408 --> 02:01:32.530]  And that she basically makes her own reality.
[02:01:33.792 --> 02:01:39.798]  And she looks like, if I was casting a woman for like a brainwashed robot person or a Stepford wife, it'd be her.
[02:01:39.798 --> 02:01:51.371]  I mean, these people are just the most ridiculous con artists you can imagine, who've been getting away with doubling and tripling down their fraud for so long.
[02:01:51.371 --> 02:01:54.995]  They just sit there shoveling pure bull directly at us.
[02:01:56.673 --> 02:02:01.797]  And I guess history will be the judge whether they were triumphant in this overthrow of reality.
[02:02:01.797 --> 02:02:08.042]  Jim, in FEMA Region 4, what former state are you in now under FEMA occupation, Jim?
[02:02:08.042 --> 02:02:09.724]  Carolina.
[02:02:09.724 --> 02:02:11.625]  Alright, well welcome.
[02:02:11.625 --> 02:02:22.334]  I'm calling about Putin, Assad, Hillary Clinton, and the conspiracy behind the propaganda to keep us stupid.
[02:02:23.883 --> 02:02:28.987]  It was vital for Putin to get Crimea first, that way he could have the Black Sea.
[02:02:28.987 --> 02:02:36.072]  Turkey's going to be key in that kind of blackmail game they're playing with NATO and the banks.
[02:02:36.072 --> 02:02:45.459]  The criminal government has been killing everybody in that region who has proof of their, you know, of them being crooks.
[02:02:45.459 --> 02:02:51.443]  And so what Putin did was he went and got buddy-buddy with Iraq first.
[02:02:51.443 --> 02:02:52.644]  Set up military there.
[02:02:53.331 --> 02:02:57.994]  Got into Syria, got in good with Assad to keep him alive.
[02:02:57.994 --> 02:03:00.516]  He's a big poker chip.
[02:03:00.516 --> 02:03:09.723]  And you, Al Jazeera, and one Israeli newspaper were the only ones to report about China coming in through the Suez Canal.
[02:03:09.723 --> 02:03:11.764]  That was big time.
[02:03:11.764 --> 02:03:19.470]  So China's going to have a little role to play in this too, but France is in there messing around with ISIS.
[02:03:20.619 --> 02:03:28.966]  Well that's right, they say France is the biggest single backer, even more than the US, in this ISIS backing.
[02:03:28.966 --> 02:03:33.770]  So France stays out of all these other wars, but then commits itself behind ISIS.
[02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:35.912]  How sickening.
[02:03:35.912 --> 02:03:45.800]  Alright, do you remember Tuesday, Iran had a big parade, military defense parade, and they showed off a ballistic missile.
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.241]  And it wasn't long after that,
[02:03:47.768 --> 02:03:54.573]  Germany goes and they showcase their laser nuclear Gatling gun thing.
[02:03:54.573 --> 02:03:58.296]  Well, the only purpose for that thing is to shoot down ballistic missiles.
[02:03:58.296 --> 02:03:58.776]  That's all.
[02:03:58.776 --> 02:04:03.460]  That's that's sole purpose of a laser Gatling gun.
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:05.962]  And so it's looking like.
[02:04:05.962 --> 02:04:11.046]  You know, they want to control the propaganda, they want to control what we know, you know, Facebook and all that.
[02:04:11.633 --> 02:04:16.737]  Alternative media, you, everybody, from controlling the narrative of what's really going on.
[02:04:16.737 --> 02:04:20.139]  Putin is going to be the new daddy of the Middle East.
[02:04:20.139 --> 02:04:22.261]  He's going to be backed by China.
[02:04:22.261 --> 02:04:25.183]  So we're going to lose our influence over there.
[02:04:25.183 --> 02:04:29.746]  Which was probably a plan the whole time by the globalists.
[02:04:29.746 --> 02:04:30.907]  Yeah.
[02:04:30.907 --> 02:04:31.767]  You ever think about that?
[02:04:31.767 --> 02:04:34.989]  See, they've got to bring America down.
[02:04:34.989 --> 02:04:38.012]  And they put Russia in a position where Russia has to defend itself.
[02:04:39.312 --> 02:04:44.434]  And is given the moral high ground, which then makes America sink.
[02:04:44.434 --> 02:04:46.855]  That is a globalist chess game for you right there.
[02:04:46.855 --> 02:04:47.655]  Great points, Jim.
[02:04:47.655 --> 02:04:49.676]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:04:49.676 --> 02:04:54.578]  Just very forcefully and simply put forward, you're dead on.
[02:04:54.578 --> 02:04:55.458]  Thank you.
[02:04:55.458 --> 02:04:57.999]  Sebastian and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:04:59.102 --> 02:05:02.206]  This article from Medical Express appeared on the Drudge Report.
[02:05:02.206 --> 02:05:05.610]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk.
[02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:13.059]  Emerging evidence ties endocrine disrupting chemical exposure to two of the biggest public health threats facing society, diabetes and obesity.
[02:05:13.059 --> 02:05:15.722]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[02:05:15.902 --> 02:05:25.827]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[02:05:25.827 --> 02:05:31.771]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:39.615]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[02:05:39.875 --> 02:05:49.022]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.
[02:05:49.022 --> 02:05:51.765]  All things we've been telling you here at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:51.765 --> 02:05:54.687]  Check out InfoWarsLife.com for more information.
[02:05:54.687 --> 02:05:57.229]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:58.670 --> 02:06:06.136]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you the hands-down best deal we've ever offered on high-quality storable foods.

[02:06:53.171 --> 02:06:55.073]  That's InfowarsSelect.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.496 --> 02:07:02.799]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[02:07:02.799 --> 02:07:07.063]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[02:07:07.063 --> 02:07:14.348]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:07:14.508 --> 02:07:25.182]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[02:07:25.182 --> 02:07:28.706]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:07:28.706 --> 02:07:29.847]  What do you have to lose?
[02:07:29.847 --> 02:07:32.551]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[02:07:32.671 --> 02:07:33.071]  We're good to go.
[02:08:01.536 --> 02:08:22.702]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:25.715 --> 02:08:27.817]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.817 --> 02:08:31.379]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:31.379 --> 02:08:37.464]  Time to take the balls to the walls in the fight against tyranny.
[02:08:37.464 --> 02:08:41.267]  That means press the accelerator all the way down the metal.
[02:08:41.267 --> 02:08:48.152]  That means take a wrecking ball to the globalist Berlin Wall of media censorship.
[02:08:48.152 --> 02:08:51.174]  Where Facebook and others here in the United States and in Europe
[02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:58.553]  We'll censor any criticism of open border stunts.
[02:08:58.553 --> 02:09:04.557]  Facebook last Wednesday and Thursday completely banned within hours.
[02:09:04.557 --> 02:09:12.081]  An article by Kit Daniels coining the term Pope Kid in staged photo op.
[02:09:12.081 --> 02:09:12.962]  They just blocked it.
[02:09:14.045 --> 02:09:32.432]  And now Mark Zuckerberg caught on tape, it's up on Infowars.com, you want to hear it and see it, admitting that they're censoring anti-migrant posts on Facebook and promising the President of Germany that he'll do more to censor.
[02:09:32.432 --> 02:09:39.434]  And then I have experienced it, I can't show a fake staged event with an anchor baby?
[02:09:39.434 --> 02:09:43.536]  I'm not against that little girl, but I can't go to Mexico and have a baby free.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:51.745]  The elite want to bring in third world populations to drive down wages and create political anarchy.
[02:09:51.745 --> 02:09:53.146]  That is Tower of Babel.
[02:09:53.146 --> 02:09:57.009]  We're all fighting with each other so they can rule over us.
[02:09:57.009 --> 02:10:07.077]  But the fact is, whether my criticism of immigrants is good or bad, I have free speech and you shouldn't be censoring it when it doesn't violate your terms of service.
[02:10:07.077 --> 02:10:10.479]  I know I keep hammering on that, but it's a big, big deal.
[02:10:10.479 --> 02:10:12.661]  Meanwhile, speaking of censorship, and I'm going right back to your calls,
[02:10:15.776 --> 02:10:18.137]  There's this article out of the Washington Examiner.
[02:10:18.137 --> 02:10:19.218]  Lawmakers, U.S.
[02:10:19.218 --> 02:10:21.799]  plan for Internet may be unconstitutional.
[02:10:21.799 --> 02:10:28.803]  President Obama's plan to internationalize, that's a quote, the Internet may be unconstitutional, key members of Congress are saying.
[02:10:28.803 --> 02:10:35.687]  The group of lawmakers sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office last week saying the plan to relinquish oversight of Internet domain name functions
[02:10:36.187 --> 02:10:46.753]  To a global multi-stakeholder body raised questions about the administration's authority to transfer possession and control of critical components of the Internet's infrastructure to a third party.
[02:10:46.753 --> 02:10:48.373]  Yeah, the U.S.
[02:10:48.373 --> 02:10:51.635]  built it, paid for it, it's working fine, it's global.
[02:10:51.635 --> 02:10:52.796]  Why give it to the U.N.?
[02:10:52.796 --> 02:10:54.056]  Because they're going to put it under U.N.
[02:10:54.056 --> 02:10:57.398]  regulations, taxes, and censorship.
[02:10:57.398 --> 02:10:59.199]  We had articles yesterday about this U.N.
[02:10:59.199 --> 02:11:04.342]  summit with the feminist group saying, any criticism by the patriarchy will be banned.
[02:11:09.738 --> 02:11:20.392]  The letter was signed by the chairman of both Congressional Judiciary Committees, Senator Chuck Grassley and Bob Goodlatte.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:22.374]  Did I pronounce that right?
[02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:26.379]  Presidential candidates, Senator Ted Cruz, Daryl Issa, and others.
[02:11:28.285 --> 02:11:40.853]  The lawmakers point out the Constitution says Congress has the inclusive power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations representing and respecting the authority, the territory, and other property belonging to the United States.
[02:11:40.853 --> 02:11:55.802]  Yeah, but the Constitution says a lot of other stuff too, that the central government, the executive branch, the bureaucracy has been completely trampling into the dirt.
[02:11:55.802 --> 02:11:56.423]  Coming up,
[02:11:57.816 --> 02:12:01.338]  Court upholds judgment against Monsanto.
[02:12:01.338 --> 02:12:07.382]  Looming catastrophe from diseased rates.
[02:12:07.382 --> 02:12:09.723]  Billionaire warns of danger ahead.
[02:12:09.723 --> 02:12:11.764]  We're going to be getting into all of that.
[02:12:11.764 --> 02:12:15.166]  Some of the news up on InfoWars.com as well.
[02:12:15.166 --> 02:12:18.828]  And I'm researching the so-called tax cuts of Donald Trump deeply.
[02:12:18.828 --> 02:12:20.989]  I mean, I've read what he said.
[02:12:20.989 --> 02:12:22.050]  I've read what he claims.
[02:12:22.050 --> 02:12:25.172]  I'm trying to compare it to the law, current tax structures, but
[02:12:26.568 --> 02:12:38.703]  I think it's some of the most aggressive tax cuts I've heard of in a long time, and so in a cursory research, a cursory view of it, I think it's a great idea.
[02:12:40.049 --> 02:12:42.811]  I'm not criticizing one of our writers, Kurt Nemo.
[02:12:42.811 --> 02:12:45.092]  I don't really control what Kurt says or does.
[02:12:45.092 --> 02:12:49.515]  I don't really read what he writes first before he puts it out, because I know he's a smart guy.
[02:12:49.515 --> 02:12:50.576]  I respect him.
[02:12:50.576 --> 02:12:53.118]  I probably agree with 95% of his views.
[02:12:53.118 --> 02:12:57.520]  And so my writers are not slaves to InfoWars.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.161]  I review them.
[02:12:58.161 --> 02:12:59.502]  I think they're good people.
[02:12:59.502 --> 02:13:01.043]  I think they care about the truth.
[02:13:01.043 --> 02:13:02.504]  I think they have interesting perspectives.
[02:13:02.504 --> 02:13:04.265]  And so then I let them write what they want.
[02:13:05.572 --> 02:13:08.876]  But I read this article yesterday and I thought, what is this?
[02:13:08.876 --> 02:13:14.203]  Millions of Americans will realize little or no benefit from Donald Trump's tax plan.
[02:13:14.203 --> 02:13:17.708]  Political class will never admit taxation is theft.
[02:13:17.708 --> 02:13:22.774]  So I guess instead of going with all the other headlines that Donald Trump wanted massive cuts,
[02:13:23.809 --> 02:13:30.893]  Kurt went with kind of a catchy thing, and the more I read his article, and the more I read actually what they're doing, I guess he's got a point.
[02:13:30.893 --> 02:13:32.855]  The income tax is unconstitutional.
[02:13:32.855 --> 02:13:36.497]  The income tax wasn't around until 1913 with the Federal Reserve enactment.
[02:13:36.497 --> 02:13:38.778]  Most Americans were exempt from it until the 50s.
[02:13:38.778 --> 02:13:40.819]  We built the country without it.
[02:13:40.819 --> 02:13:44.061]  We had 10% growth rates a year before it.
[02:13:44.061 --> 02:13:46.503]  Now, on average, about 5% growth rates.
[02:13:46.503 --> 02:13:50.005]  It's not good, it's selectively enforced, and I get Kurt's point.
[02:13:52.381 --> 02:14:02.066]  Because when you read it, the upper middle class doesn't get any tax cuts.
[02:14:02.066 --> 02:14:05.827]  Presidential front-runner Donald Trump releases the details of his tax plan.
[02:14:05.827 --> 02:14:10.109]  If you want to get the economy going, get the middle class a tax cut, too.
[02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:19.594]  The plan posted on Trump's Make America Great site is billed as a way to let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
[02:14:19.594 --> 02:14:21.175]  Many Americans, however, will realize
[02:14:22.219 --> 02:14:24.141]  A significant gain.
[02:14:24.141 --> 02:14:32.189]  The plan is designed to primarily benefit the poor, the lower middle class, and corporations.
[02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:34.332]  Well that's fine, I'll take whatever I can get.
[02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:42.400]  If you are single and earn less than $25,000 a year, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax, the plan states.
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.221]  Well that's fabulous.
[02:14:45.199 --> 02:14:56.922]  Because, I mean, even if I'm not in the $50,000 tax bracket, that's going to stir the economy up, create more investment, more saving to take huge taxes off folks making $50,000 a year.
[02:14:56.922 --> 02:15:02.663]  But the average person making $50,000 a year right now is paying something like 25%.
[02:15:02.663 --> 02:15:03.924]  That'd be zero, folks.
[02:15:03.924 --> 02:15:04.924]  That'd be huge.
[02:15:06.328 --> 02:15:14.812]  Trump claims the plan removes nearly 75 million households, over 50% from the income tax rolls, and will simplify income tax for all Americans.
[02:15:14.812 --> 02:15:18.994]  For individuals earning between $50,000 and $150,000, the tax rate will be 20%.
[02:15:18.994 --> 02:15:21.595]  That's beautiful.
[02:15:21.595 --> 02:15:28.678]  A reduction of approximately 5%, although this varies to a certain degree under the current arcane tax structure.
[02:15:28.678 --> 02:15:29.518]  Well yeah, here's the problem.
[02:15:29.518 --> 02:15:31.879]  They've gotten rid of all the loopholes.
[02:15:31.879 --> 02:15:32.820]  And they're not loopholes.
[02:15:34.321 --> 02:15:41.225]  If this company or this corporation buys equipment, it's counted as my property and I've got to pay taxes on it.
[02:15:41.225 --> 02:15:44.546]  And then that stifles growth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:44.546 --> 02:15:45.547]  I'm not going to read the rest of it.
[02:15:45.547 --> 02:15:46.628]  I mean, I see Kurt's point.
[02:15:46.628 --> 02:15:58.234]  It's kind of a winding Byzantine article, but... How about Donald Trump's bold tax plan doesn't go far enough?
[02:15:58.234 --> 02:15:58.674]  How about that?
[02:16:01.877 --> 02:16:13.725]  Maybe it's a good article, because it's got me thinking, it's given me a headache, because I want to cut taxes, but I get the point that we need to really just get rid of the income tax entirely.
[02:16:13.725 --> 02:16:28.415]  But then if they do a national sales tax, they're going to have federal tax police out roaming around, cracking down on every clandestine black market, under the table situation that we really just call swap meets, farmers markets, and stuff like that.
[02:16:30.367 --> 02:16:32.228]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[02:16:32.228 --> 02:16:34.749]  Sebastian in Colorado, you're on The Year Worldwide.
[02:16:34.749 --> 02:16:36.950]  Go ahead.
[02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:39.951]  Yes, good to hear from you, Alex.
[02:16:39.951 --> 02:16:44.632]  I just wanted to ask about the globalists.
[02:16:44.632 --> 02:16:56.157]  In particular, they have access to military technology that's far beyond advanced, beyond anything that modern, excuse me, the modern civilian is aware of.
[02:16:57.051 --> 02:17:11.835]  So how are we to protect ourselves and prepare ourselves if they decide to use any of these advanced technologies against us, such as maybe vibrational harmonic type devices that can affect our emotions or something like that?
[02:17:11.835 --> 02:17:12.096]  Sure.
[02:17:12.096 --> 02:17:19.698]  DARPA admitted, it's got to be like 18 years ago in the Toronto papers, but also in the Baltimore Sun,
[02:17:20.819 --> 02:17:26.903]  That they are testing, based on cell phone technology, waves to, quote, calm the public.
[02:17:26.903 --> 02:17:31.645]  And it was, I guess, a test article to see what response them openly admitting that would have.
[02:17:31.645 --> 02:17:38.830]  And we've had Dr. Nick Bagach on a lot to talk about some of the different electronic warfare systems that are out there.
[02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:47.135]  Before the globalists can use things like this really wide scale, they've got to get centralized control over everything.
[02:17:48.317 --> 02:17:55.782]  And they've got to get full control over scientific research, which they don't have completely yet, before they can move ahead with such bold moves.
[02:17:55.782 --> 02:17:57.984]  They certainly have been testing things like that.
[02:17:57.984 --> 02:18:02.687]  I mean, here's an example of Trojan horse stuff hiding in plain view.
[02:18:02.687 --> 02:18:11.354]  VW now, Audi, other companies are coming out saying, yeah, we have similar fraud systems in our emissions testing.
[02:18:12.392 --> 02:18:28.565]  So that does show how big, bold things can go on for quite a while, and undoubtedly there is a lot of testing going on, but I don't think we can become intimidated, seven and a half billion humans, by different forms of technologies, because a lot of that stuff is going to blow back on the establishment themselves.
[02:18:28.565 --> 02:18:32.928]  You know, the dumbing down of the public is also blowing back on the establishment.
[02:18:32.928 --> 02:18:35.930]  So the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:18:37.443 --> 02:18:46.565]  is what I'm getting at, but yes, we're not in Kansas anymore, and there is a lot of advanced technology, but a lot of it is not theoretical.
[02:18:46.565 --> 02:18:57.127]  A lot of it's been developed and fielded, but still it's not widespread in its usage, and before they roll out with widespread, they'll start admitting a lot of it in the news.
[02:18:57.127 --> 02:19:00.628]  Like, oh, we are doing some geoengineering to save the earth.
[02:19:00.628 --> 02:19:04.229]  Oh, we do add to some of the jet fuel aluminum dioxide.
[02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:16.155]  Oh, we are weather modifying for the children, and then you know it's really getting ready to gear up once they start leaking it, and testing it, and preparing the public.
[02:19:16.155 --> 02:19:18.216]  Does that answer your question?
[02:19:18.216 --> 02:19:18.836]  Yes, it does.
[02:19:18.836 --> 02:19:19.436]  Thank you.
[02:19:19.436 --> 02:19:20.376]  I appreciate that.
[02:19:20.376 --> 02:19:26.359]  Also, I just want to say really briefly that me and my wife love it when you get mad on your show.
[02:19:26.359 --> 02:19:30.781]  Pray not to the ill of your health, but we think that it's great we should all be this upset.
[02:19:31.946 --> 02:19:33.266]  Well, you and your wife are awesome.
[02:19:33.266 --> 02:19:34.067]  God bless you, brother.
[02:19:34.067 --> 02:19:41.649]  Yeah, but then when I get mad, I got a big crick in the back of my neck, and I want to blow up, and it's not healthy.
[02:19:41.649 --> 02:19:44.189]  But, I mean, you focus on this stuff as much as I do.
[02:19:44.189 --> 02:19:53.252]  It's very healthy to be exposing it toward doing good work, but getting down in it and having to focus on it and research it, it's just so ridiculous what they've gotten away with.
[02:19:53.252 --> 02:19:55.092]  I mean, it's... But that's the secret.
[02:19:55.092 --> 02:19:56.232]  It's so big.
[02:19:56.232 --> 02:19:57.393]  It's so crazy.
[02:19:57.393 --> 02:19:58.453]  Therein lies the secret.

[02:22:22.416 --> 02:22:25.378]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.

[02:22:35.985 --> 02:22:40.688]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:17.211]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:17.211 --> 02:23:20.732]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:20.732 --> 02:23:23.173]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[02:24:19.964 --> 02:24:21.484]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:21.484 --> 02:24:26.846]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday Worldwide Edition.
[02:24:26.846 --> 02:24:28.226]  I will continue with your phone calls.
[02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:29.407]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:24:29.407 --> 02:24:31.668]  Then I'm going to get more into a big stack of economic news.
[02:24:37.607 --> 02:24:41.788]  More on the attempts to regulate and censor the internet.
[02:24:41.788 --> 02:24:46.289]  I mean, really, what we've got going for us is that it's all out in the open now.
[02:24:46.289 --> 02:24:59.213]  But we also have that against us because if the public isn't warned or explained to how this is a bad idea, they may take all the things that are happening because it's calmly being done as no big deal and accept them.
[02:25:00.731 --> 02:25:04.633]  Like, oh yeah, in Europe you're arrested if you criticize open borders.
[02:25:04.633 --> 02:25:07.674]  Oh yeah, in Europe you can't criticize the government now.
[02:25:07.674 --> 02:25:09.655]  Oh yeah, in England you have no free speech.
[02:25:09.655 --> 02:25:13.777]  Oh yeah, in America you have no free speech.
[02:25:13.777 --> 02:25:19.339]  Yeah, there's a police lockdown because somebody had a rebel flag on their backpack.
[02:25:19.339 --> 02:25:21.840]  And the news just reports it with a straight face.
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.622]  This is the hysteria of a totalitarian system.
[02:25:28.015 --> 02:25:51.142]  With just a Pavlovian dumbed-down public where they ring the bell and the public basically just starts cowering in fear of all the false threats while just merrily marching by the graveyard, whistling past it, as our country's future is being prepared to enter the grave.
[02:25:52.398 --> 02:25:55.439]  They are digging the hole right now.
[02:25:55.439 --> 02:26:13.426]  All our power, all our infrastructure, what we built, what we made, what we did, our intellectual property, the internet, our industry, our coal, our resources, our children, our military, everything is being trashed right now.
[02:26:13.426 --> 02:26:19.529]  And America is being put on trial worldwide for all its crimes, but we're not being told
[02:26:21.118 --> 02:26:29.242]  We're kept in this bubble as Putin has made the leader of the world.
[02:26:29.242 --> 02:26:31.282]  But I'll tell you, I'm not an idiot.
[02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:34.924]  I know our elite is more organized, more evil, more out of control.
[02:26:34.924 --> 02:26:41.307]  I don't think Putin is playing a part in all of this and does not want the United States to be destroyed.
[02:26:42.964 --> 02:26:53.165]  But nevertheless, Putin is being set up by the very globalists in Europe that run this country at one level to be the savior, so he can be brought down as well.
[02:26:54.226 --> 02:27:03.094]  Because the globalists want to bring down every nation-state standing, every family, every private company, every sole proprietorship.
[02:27:03.094 --> 02:27:16.486]  Everybody's got to learn to hit their knees, and not just hit their knees out of fear, hit their knees out of total subservience and dependence on this one world government system.
[02:27:18.092 --> 02:27:25.577]  Forbes three years ago asked the question, why is there a war on lemonade stands, farmers markets, and swap meets?
[02:27:25.577 --> 02:27:29.820]  Fifteen million dollar fines on garage sales.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:32.922]  That's a Fox News headline.
[02:27:32.922 --> 02:27:36.304]  Under federal regulations they haven't implemented yet, but they're starting to.
[02:27:39.172 --> 02:27:40.472]  What's that about?
[02:27:40.472 --> 02:27:55.857]  The ultimate crime in the future, the ultimate crime, will be defending yourself physically, defending yourself legally, or selling or trading produce or fuel or services to anyone.
[02:27:55.857 --> 02:28:00.918]  Homeland Security is set up where you're not going to get a job unless the TSA authorizes it.
[02:28:00.918 --> 02:28:02.699]  They're going to be on every street corner.
[02:28:02.699 --> 02:28:06.000]  I told you 14 years ago this, now you see it at the pub's visit.
[02:28:07.162 --> 02:28:09.142]  Pennsylvania, you name it.
[02:28:09.142 --> 02:28:10.903]  It's a total plan.
[02:28:10.903 --> 02:28:12.203]  Domestic controls.
[02:28:12.203 --> 02:28:21.684]  The TSA announced with the IRS last year that they didn't want any Americans being able to get out of the United States with even a thousand dollars cash.
[02:28:21.684 --> 02:28:23.145]  And then they went further.
[02:28:23.145 --> 02:28:28.546]  They said outside of law until Congress called them in finally.
[02:28:28.546 --> 02:28:36.267]  They said if the IRS has even opened a private investigation of even a form you didn't fill out.
[02:28:37.725 --> 02:28:40.588]  With somebody you had do work for you.
[02:28:40.588 --> 02:28:56.924]  In their filing they said anything, including clerical errors, or IRS questions, or IRS investigations, not indictments, not grand juries, for any reason that you would not be allowed to leave the United States.
[02:28:56.924 --> 02:28:58.205]  And then they went further.
[02:28:58.205 --> 02:28:59.446]  They said, you know what?
[02:28:59.446 --> 02:29:00.928]  We don't want you to be able to get on a plane.
[02:29:03.906 --> 02:29:05.589]  Or International Park.
[02:29:05.589 --> 02:29:09.094]  And we're gonna check IDs to the National ID when you do it.
[02:29:09.094 --> 02:29:15.002]  Everything we said the National ID would be for, they have said in spades.
[02:29:15.002 --> 02:29:16.104]  In triplicate.
[02:29:16.104 --> 02:29:18.347]  I mean, this is the most brazen
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:30.482]  Biggest, healthiest, most gargantuan, oppressive, classical, flaming tyranny on steroids the world's ever seen.
[02:29:30.482 --> 02:29:32.342]  And it's just growing.
[02:29:32.342 --> 02:29:35.083]  And its tentacles are going into place everywhere.
[02:29:35.083 --> 02:29:40.064]  And it's just licking its big old lips with big old sharp teeth.
[02:29:40.064 --> 02:29:45.905]  And if you think the globalists have persecuted people so far, that was only a baby suckling.
[02:29:46.505 --> 02:29:49.649]  Now it's on both legs and it's ready to kill.
[02:29:49.649 --> 02:29:51.231]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:54.054]  I promise I'm going right to your calls, Tim.
[02:29:54.054 --> 02:29:55.997]  Right to your calls, Tim.
[02:29:55.997 --> 02:29:57.278]  Linda Mitchell and others, stay with me.
[02:29:59.116 --> 02:30:05.518]  In the wake of Pope Francis visiting the United States and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, we have this.
[02:30:05.518 --> 02:30:13.740]  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid $3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male.
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:21.322]  The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to someone identified only as Individual A to hide past misconduct.
[02:30:21.462 --> 02:30:25.963]  It has been claimed that Individual A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastert was attempting to silence.
[02:30:25.963 --> 02:30:33.445]  Citing anonymous sources, the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher.
[02:30:33.445 --> 02:30:37.986]  Before leaving Congress in 2007, Hastert was the longest ever serving Republican speaker.
[02:30:37.986 --> 02:30:41.306]  Because when you have skeletons in the closet, you are easy to control.
[02:30:41.306 --> 02:30:44.727]  Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[02:30:44.727 --> 02:30:49.308]  Hastert took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[02:30:49.588 --> 02:30:55.269]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet.
[02:30:55.269 --> 02:30:58.930]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:58.930 --> 02:31:08.012]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:08.012 --> 02:31:16.154]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:16.414 --> 02:31:21.297]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:31:35.266 --> 02:31:42.130]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:31:58.991 --> 02:32:09.118]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[02:32:09.118 --> 02:32:15.242]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[02:32:15.242 --> 02:32:17.343]  They call it their low profile platform.

[02:32:22.144 --> 02:32:24.945]  6061 Billet Material with Type 3 Hard Coating.

[02:33:14.517 --> 02:33:24.282]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.282 --> 02:33:37.968]  There are a million different ways to jump up and down like a wild gorilla and warn your troop not to come up to a certain waterhole because 25-foot crocodiles are in it and are going to grab you and eat you.
[02:33:40.410 --> 02:34:03.210]  But if the group doesn't listen to you and they go over the hill and go down to the water hole and a 25-foot crocodile launches out like an arrow out of a bow and snatches the orangutan, the chimpanzee, whatever it is, and drags it into the mud, eating it, now the group will start to listen.
[02:34:06.058 --> 02:34:08.018]  And that's the allegory I'm using right here.
[02:34:08.018 --> 02:34:09.939]  As I went out to break, I'm going, pure evil.
[02:34:09.939 --> 02:34:11.379]  They hate you and your family.
[02:34:11.379 --> 02:34:12.279]  They want to hurt you.
[02:34:12.279 --> 02:34:14.840]  They're coming after you.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:22.381]  I use this example a lot because it's one of the totally cut-and-dry cases where they were caught red-handed in France and in Australia.
[02:34:22.381 --> 02:34:31.322]  Bayer Pharmaceutical, who gives money to the forced inoculation lobby, that gives money to the gun control lobby, that gives money to the open borders lobby.
[02:34:31.322 --> 02:34:32.463]  You look at the Fortune 100, all of them,
[02:34:37.128 --> 02:34:47.798]  But the Koch brothers give to open borders, gun control, world government, socialism, and this whole system of dependence.
[02:34:47.798 --> 02:34:52.423]  The Koch brothers give to both sides.
[02:34:52.423 --> 02:35:00.270]  They used to be just giving to the Democrats, but Clinton screwed them over, so they started paying both sides.
[02:35:00.270 --> 02:35:02.192]  But that's both sides of the same coin.
[02:35:04.318 --> 02:35:07.579]  So they're made the ultimate conspiracy pariah.
[02:35:07.579 --> 02:35:11.881]  Because, oh my gosh, there wouldn't be a right-wing media if it wasn't for the Koch brothers.
[02:35:11.881 --> 02:35:16.963]  Everyone that talks bad about the New World Order, why, you know, they must work for the Koch brothers.
[02:35:16.963 --> 02:35:20.284]  Every pseudo-intellectual out there doesn't have to actually do anything.
[02:35:20.284 --> 02:35:23.145]  They can just say Alex Jones works for the Koch brothers.
[02:35:23.145 --> 02:35:27.527]  And then be super intellectuals and lay back and talk about how smart they are.
[02:35:31.744 --> 02:35:34.545]  I wish the Koch Brothers would give me $20 million a year.
[02:35:34.545 --> 02:35:35.585]  I can fund this operation.
[02:35:35.585 --> 02:35:37.265]  I don't have to sell anything.
[02:35:37.265 --> 02:35:38.586]  I don't have to advertise squat.
[02:35:38.586 --> 02:35:41.066]  In fact, I'm ready right now.
[02:35:41.066 --> 02:35:42.746]  The Koch Brothers have never given me one dime.
[02:35:42.746 --> 02:35:53.089]  If they want to give me $20 million a year, I will continue to cover the exact same issues I am now, and I will not do anything they tell me to say or do, but I will take their money right now, gladly.
[02:35:53.089 --> 02:35:53.949]  So, please hand it over.
[02:35:56.189 --> 02:36:06.938]  But, oh, when Rachel Maddow gets stimulus money from General Electric that's tax-exempt, and exempt from Obamacare, and exempt from the power plant rules, that's okay.
[02:36:06.938 --> 02:36:13.323]  And NPR and the rest of it, that's alright.
[02:36:13.323 --> 02:36:24.793]  And now there's an admitted war, in the words of Media Matters, in the memo that came out in Politico four years ago, to bring down the alternative libertarian conservative press.
[02:36:25.933 --> 02:36:30.595]  To bring down Fox News, Matt Drudge, and Alex Jones.
[02:36:30.595 --> 02:36:33.416]  I can't stand half of what's on Fox News.
[02:36:33.416 --> 02:36:38.978]  I love the Drudge Report, it's just a bunch of different diverse news.
[02:36:38.978 --> 02:36:43.860]  But Fox News is one of the most vicious attackers of this show, and why is that?
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:51.322]  Because Rupert Murdoch, in his other media empire, promotes anti-gun, anti-family, carbon tax, garbage, 24-7 pell-mell.
[02:36:57.472 --> 02:37:15.520]  And they don't like the fact that there's another news organization out there that is really libertarian, that is really patriot, that is really dedicated to saving the republic, that is really dedicated to free market.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.380]  It's truly sickening.
[02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:23.323]  I remember about six, seven years ago, it happened for about two years, Fox News executives, and I'm going to your calls,
[02:37:24.923 --> 02:37:29.825]  Their major developers would call me and want me to go do pilots for Fox News.
[02:37:29.825 --> 02:37:35.487]  And you notice sometimes my producers or my staff would be on Fox News and not me in these TV shows.
[02:37:35.487 --> 02:37:37.347]  Because I said, nope.
[02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:39.868]  But I said, if you want to interview one of my staff, you can.
[02:37:39.868 --> 02:37:42.089]  I'm not going to work for Fox News.
[02:37:42.089 --> 02:37:46.210]  They'd say, you really don't want to have a show on Fox News?
[02:37:46.210 --> 02:37:47.991]  And I'd say, no, I don't want to have a show on Fox News.
[02:37:53.328 --> 02:37:58.311]  I mean, for one thing, I already reach an audience worldwide in many respects.
[02:37:58.311 --> 02:38:08.677]  You have more shows than I do, so you're much bigger, but for just one show per capita, I reach as much as one of your top shows does, so why would I want to do that when I'm already reaching audiences as big or bigger?
[02:38:08.677 --> 02:38:14.700]  Oh, and the other part, I make more money than the average Fox News host.
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:17.221]  A lot more.
[02:38:17.221 --> 02:38:19.503]  And the difference is, I don't care about that money.
[02:38:19.503 --> 02:38:21.344]  That's money to then build an organization.
[02:38:22.651 --> 02:38:39.401]  I took the money that I made on over 160 plus radio stations, and I took that money that other hosts, again, would have jet airplanes and mansions and trophy wives, and I put that money not into luxury golf course memberships and stuff like that.
[02:38:39.401 --> 02:38:41.442]  Not that anything's wrong with that.
[02:38:41.442 --> 02:38:42.603]  That's what makes the economy go.
[02:38:42.603 --> 02:38:44.544]  I'm just saying I put it into news.
[02:38:44.544 --> 02:38:46.065]  I put it into trying to build something better.
[02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:50.672]  And I'm just digressing off into this.
[02:38:50.672 --> 02:39:03.472]  I'm going to go to your calls momentarily because to show how they spend things after I would never go up to Fox News and meet with these people.
[02:39:07.793 --> 02:39:23.263]  They then had national news pieces out about Alex Jones wants a show on Fox News and they had articles in Rolling Stone and articles in New York Daily News and all these articles about how I was refused a job at Fox News and I'm bitter and I'm unhappy.
[02:39:23.263 --> 02:39:35.070]  Think about the narcissistic mental illness of the executives at Fox News creating news articles that I later learned they had spurred to get written.
[02:39:36.976 --> 02:39:39.765]  In the New York Magazine, at least.
[02:39:39.765 --> 02:39:40.407]  That was another one.
[02:39:42.162 --> 02:39:46.224]  To make it look like I was a failure and they were winners.
[02:39:46.224 --> 02:40:06.934]  Can you imagine the delusional world where guys sit around in offices and people come in and kiss their butt all day and they've got teleprompter readers that just put out the same dribble to pacify conservatives and stall libertarians so we think we've got a voice and then they're out having articles written where they have simulated victories over me and simulated victories where I've been spurned
[02:40:07.654 --> 02:40:16.157]  Can you imagine being that type of egomaniac that you would waste your time on that?
[02:40:16.157 --> 02:40:29.881]  But that's who the globalists hire are these empty yes-men sellouts who would die and go to heaven to have all the opportunities I've had and the things I've turned down.
[02:40:29.881 --> 02:40:31.181]  And I'm not bragging.
[02:40:31.181 --> 02:40:33.542]  I'm just getting people into the nature of the sellouts.
[02:40:34.858 --> 02:40:40.100]  I mean, I get offered to be in big movies routinely, and just go, sorry, can't do it.
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:42.621]  I get offered to have my own TV shows routinely.
[02:40:42.621 --> 02:40:44.722]  Sorry, can't do it.
[02:40:44.722 --> 02:40:47.503]  And that just shows how the truth is what sells.
[02:40:47.503 --> 02:40:49.204]  The truth is what is popular.
[02:40:49.204 --> 02:41:01.049]  And the world can't stand the fact that we've been successful, because you're part of this, the viewers and listeners, just as much as I am, and that they don't run and control what we say and what we do.
[02:41:01.049 --> 02:41:04.570]  And they see us growing and growing and growing.
[02:41:10.945 --> 02:41:18.070]  And that's why I know they're so easy to beat the minute the general public realizes what a fraud they are.
[02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:19.551]  And I'm not singling out Fox News.
[02:41:19.551 --> 02:41:32.621]  I mean, Fox News is nothing compared to the mental institution that is MSNBC or the twisted, sycophantic joke that is CNN.
[02:41:32.621 --> 02:41:34.102]  I mean, these people are jokes.
[02:41:36.155 --> 02:41:39.696]  These people sold out the greatest country the world had ever seen.
[02:41:39.696 --> 02:41:45.757]  These people thought they were powerful because they were able to get control of America and run us in the ground.
[02:41:45.757 --> 02:42:00.179]  That's like taking control of a great, ancient, beautiful ship and running it onto the rocks and then dancing around on the deck, you know, peeing on the main sail, the main mast and going, I dominated this!
[02:42:00.179 --> 02:42:02.660]  You didn't dominate anything, you trash!
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.480]  You ran it on the rocks, you scum!
[02:42:05.814 --> 02:42:22.030]  Because it's existence and all the honor associated with it made you so upset and so nauseous that you couldn't, you couldn't be around it like a vampire can't be around the light of the midday sun.
[02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:24.433]  I don't mean to start ranting, I said I'd go to the calls, it's just...
[02:42:25.894 --> 02:42:31.581]  I just start thinking about the type of men and women we're up against that work for the system at the top.
[02:42:31.581 --> 02:42:45.998]  The type of delusional trash like Nancy Pelosi saying that the Planned Parenthood videos are all fake and she wants it investigated and they're a fraud and they're a hoax and they're manufactured and then going but I've never seen any of it.
[02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:58.296]  We have yes-men running things that don't care if 91% of the nuclear reactors, or is it 93, excuse me, are leaking.
[02:42:58.296 --> 02:43:00.017]  I mean 30 years ago they cared.
[02:43:00.017 --> 02:43:01.338]  They don't care anymore.
[02:43:01.338 --> 02:43:03.039]  They don't care about their kids.
[02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:05.621]  They're mentally ill.
[02:43:05.621 --> 02:43:08.223]  This world creates a type of artificial
[02:43:09.758 --> 02:43:18.186]  Borderline personality disorder that is now spreading like a disease to the general public as well, where they don't even care if they're being destroyed.
[02:43:18.186 --> 02:43:20.988]  They don't even care if things are falling apart around them.
[02:43:20.988 --> 02:43:23.110]  They don't even care if they're wrong.
[02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.911]  They don't care.
[02:43:23.911 --> 02:43:31.378]  They will continue to jibber and laugh and say they control reality while they sink the entire planet.
[02:43:34.121 --> 02:43:35.002]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:43:35.002 --> 02:43:38.204]  I apologize to Tim for saying I'd go to him and I didn't.
[02:43:38.204 --> 02:43:39.686]  Tim, you're on the air from Wyoming.
[02:43:39.686 --> 02:43:40.066]  Go ahead.
[02:43:40.066 --> 02:43:41.727]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:41.727 --> 02:43:42.328]  Yes, hi.
[02:43:42.328 --> 02:43:44.510]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:47.832]  You were talking earlier about Vladimir Putin.
[02:43:47.832 --> 02:43:51.375]  I think that he's just defending his country from tyranny.
[02:43:51.375 --> 02:43:58.982]  He doesn't appreciate worldwide tyranny and of course neither do you and neither do 99% of your listeners most likely.
[02:44:00.502 --> 02:44:04.144]  I'm pretty much a new listener to you.
[02:44:04.144 --> 02:44:08.367]  You actually said something that I said myself a few years ago.
[02:44:08.367 --> 02:44:11.089]  I had no idea that other people even thought that way.
[02:44:11.089 --> 02:44:15.713]  I said it to a woman with the League of Women Voters.
[02:44:15.713 --> 02:44:18.935]  She said, why do you think the parties are the same?
[02:44:18.935 --> 02:44:26.120]  And I took a quarter out of my pocket and I flipped it in the air and I said, look, both sides are attached to each other and they have the same core value.
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:28.662]  So you said the coin is attached to the coin.
[02:44:29.398 --> 02:44:32.441]  Absolutely.
[02:44:32.441 --> 02:44:33.322]  I appreciate that.
[02:44:33.322 --> 02:44:43.572]  I mean, I'm glad that people are waking up to the fact that our country is basically being destroyed from the inside and the outside.
[02:44:43.572 --> 02:44:47.716]  I'd say more from the inside than the outside, unfortunately.
[02:44:47.716 --> 02:44:50.739]  When I was a member of the John Birch Society years ago, I
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:53.422]  I started being woken up.
[02:44:53.422 --> 02:44:56.986]  Friends of mine told me, hey, this Alex Jones guy, you gotta listen to him.
[02:44:56.986 --> 02:44:58.067]  I didn't even know about you.
[02:44:58.067 --> 02:45:04.653]  This was about 15 years ago, and you were, I mean, fairly new, I guess, at the time, but I didn't even know about you.
[02:45:04.653 --> 02:45:06.515]  I had no idea, and I just started listening.
[02:45:06.515 --> 02:45:12.081]  Like I say, I appreciate everything you're doing and everything you're saying, and of course, I'm not trying to
[02:45:13.206 --> 02:45:14.728]  No, I hear you brother.
[02:45:14.728 --> 02:45:16.650]  I appreciate you too.
[02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:18.332]  And it's the power of word of mouth.
[02:45:18.332 --> 02:45:25.741]  It's the power of the people that will overthrow the establishment media, the establishment corporations, and all these globalists.
[02:45:25.741 --> 02:45:27.423]  Look at how McDonald's is in trouble.
[02:45:27.423 --> 02:45:31.288]  Look at how all these globalist corporations like Monsanto are in trouble.
[02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:32.729]  We the people do have the power.
[02:45:33.874 --> 02:45:47.441]  That's why the system wants to overthrow what's left of the free market and our power to vote with dollars and our purchases and replace it with a totally top-down command-and-control economy where there is no choice, then they've really got us.
[02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:48.401]  God bless you.
[02:45:48.401 --> 02:45:50.442]  Good to have you as part of the listenership, Tim.
[02:45:50.442 --> 02:45:50.802]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.802 --> 02:45:52.523]  Great points.
[02:45:52.523 --> 02:45:53.444]  Mitchell in Texas.
[02:45:53.444 --> 02:45:54.584]  Thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:45:54.584 --> 02:45:55.905]  Hello, brother.
[02:45:55.905 --> 02:45:58.846]  This is Mitchell from the Fort Worth area.
[02:45:58.846 --> 02:46:01.348]  I've been listening to politics for about a year now.
[02:46:02.403 --> 02:46:05.806]  Just four days ago, Alex, I made a Twitter and I came to this conclusion.
[02:46:05.806 --> 02:46:08.449]  What exactly is wrong with our society?
[02:46:08.449 --> 02:46:12.833]  If I could break it down into two reasons, I would say it's our loss of social cohesion.
[02:46:12.833 --> 02:46:15.936]  We no longer have this idea of loving thy neighbor.
[02:46:15.936 --> 02:46:18.839]  We have an asset forfeiture society.
[02:46:18.839 --> 02:46:27.087]  Reason number two, we've lost our strong local Christian morals and our passion has become strange and conservatives are now crazy.
[02:46:29.517 --> 02:46:30.438]  Brother, are you there?
[02:46:30.438 --> 02:46:31.418]  I'm listening, yes.
[02:46:31.418 --> 02:46:32.399]  Yeah, there's somebody on call.
[02:46:32.399 --> 02:46:34.020]  I didn't call you.
[02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:36.462]  Okay, if I could just tell you a real quick story.
[02:46:36.462 --> 02:46:44.808]  I've been going to a community college in my area, and I got kicked out the other day, and I was told I could never come back until I talked to a crisis counselor.
[02:46:44.808 --> 02:46:49.512]  I've been told by my teachers that I was not allowed to talk about libertarian ideas before and after class.
[02:46:50.339 --> 02:46:53.022]  Oh yeah, universities everywhere.
[02:46:53.022 --> 02:47:01.032]  If you even talk at lunch or in a courtyard to one person about freedom, you're being given academic suspension or probation.
[02:47:01.032 --> 02:47:03.696]  It's even happening to PhD students.
[02:47:03.696 --> 02:47:06.119]  At the University of Texas, we're doing kind of an undercover thing.
[02:47:06.119 --> 02:47:06.739]  We're about to start.
[02:47:06.739 --> 02:47:07.460]  I'm just going to let them know.
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:07.901]  They don't care.
[02:47:07.901 --> 02:47:08.522]  They're so arrogant.
[02:47:08.902 --> 02:47:09.362]  Absolutely.
[02:47:09.362 --> 02:47:16.444]  The day before it happened, I was in a conversation with a veteran next to me, and I was talking about how abortion was just about
[02:47:37.893 --> 02:47:38.593]  We're good to go.
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:00.361]  I tried to leave.
[02:48:00.361 --> 02:48:03.622]  I went to my professor and I told him I can't do this.
[02:48:03.622 --> 02:48:05.764]  You're trying to suppress my pursuit of happiness.
[02:48:05.764 --> 02:48:08.465]  I only want to talk about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:48:08.465 --> 02:48:11.467]  I'm just not mature enough to go a single day without talking about my passion.
[02:48:12.862 --> 02:48:15.024]  And they told me I couldn't do it.
[02:48:15.024 --> 02:48:17.405]  And I packed up my stuff and I tried to leave.
[02:48:17.405 --> 02:48:18.486]  Well, let me explain how this works.
[02:48:18.486 --> 02:48:19.607]  You shouldn't let them win.
[02:48:19.607 --> 02:48:24.150]  And I get once class starts you can't be disruptive.
[02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:26.251]  And it wasn't a political class.
[02:48:26.251 --> 02:48:31.595]  I would do it on the grounds, at lunch, in the parking lot, the folks you talk to.
[02:48:31.595 --> 02:48:36.739]  But it does show the mindset of people where in a group they get a thrill out of shutting speech down.
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.644]  And they're going to enjoy when their bank accounts are taken.
[02:48:39.644 --> 02:48:42.208]  They're going to enjoy when they're forcibly inoculated.
[02:48:42.208 --> 02:48:47.318]  But they've been taught groupthink and the power of hissing and shouting somebody down.
[02:48:47.318 --> 02:48:49.522]  Good to hear from you, but you know, I just...
[02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:51.640]  You can't be disruptive.
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:58.802]  I'm not saying you were disruptive, but you're saying you packed up yourself and left because of it.
[02:48:58.802 --> 02:48:59.882]  I'm not saying you're in the wrong.
[02:48:59.882 --> 02:49:05.924]  I think they're in the wrong, but you've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[02:49:05.924 --> 02:49:07.764]  Never count your money when you're sitting at the table.
[02:49:07.764 --> 02:49:10.585]  They'll be calm enough for counting when the dealing's done.
[02:49:10.585 --> 02:49:12.785]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:49:12.785 --> 02:49:13.385]  You're on the air.
[02:49:13.385 --> 02:49:14.866]  Go ahead.
[02:49:14.866 --> 02:49:15.666]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:15.666 --> 02:49:16.506]  Nice to talk to you again.
[02:49:17.573 --> 02:49:23.776]  I've spent some time researching this, and I've kind of written it out, so let me just spit it out real quick, and I want your opinion on it.
[02:49:23.776 --> 02:49:31.679]  If people think what's been done in this country under the current administration is bad, it's what is yet to come that we need to keep our eye on.
[02:49:31.679 --> 02:49:36.181]  Ultimately, it'll be the people as a whole that'll either stop or participate in the demise of this country.
[02:49:36.181 --> 02:49:41.583]  All the perversion and anti-American activity that's been pushed or displayed to the population is being done with a purpose.
[02:49:42.350 --> 02:49:45.591]  If we look back just 70 years ago, we can see why.
[02:49:45.591 --> 02:49:51.674]  In Germany, prior to the adoption of National Socialism, the country was comprised of two-thirds Protestants and one-third Catholic.
[02:49:51.674 --> 02:49:54.034]  They were essentially a Christian nation.
[02:49:54.034 --> 02:50:00.097]  Coming into the 1930s and before the rise of Hitler, Germany was considered the most socially progressive country in Europe.
[02:50:00.097 --> 02:50:05.899]  Open homosexuality, transgendered persons, the whole cabaret culture was adopted and thrust upon the population.
[02:50:05.899 --> 02:50:08.420]  The Roaring Twenties, it became Super Party Time.
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:10.361]  Correct.
[02:50:10.361 --> 02:50:12.582]  By the types of people that we would call liberals today.
[02:50:12.582 --> 02:50:18.767]  In fact, first recorded male-to-female gender reassignment surgery occurred in Berlin in 1931.
[02:50:18.767 --> 02:50:24.591]  This type of activity and behavior was hefted upon the average German who was tolerant because of their Christian foundations.
[02:50:24.591 --> 02:50:32.157]  True Christians are susceptible because we are so open and free, and then we are taken over by other cults.
[02:50:33.547 --> 02:50:34.548]  Correct.
[02:50:34.548 --> 02:50:43.152]  So, having this thrown in front of their face over and over and over again, they saw it as destroying their traditional value system, and were watching it being thrust upon their children.
[02:50:43.152 --> 02:50:48.935]  It was grinding on the psyche of the average German citizen, much like is happening in the United States today.
[02:50:48.935 --> 02:50:59.101]  Then suddenly a tough-talking guy comes on the scene, speaking in populist language about restoring the greatness of Germany, knowing exactly, this is exactly what the average citizen desired.
[02:50:59.941 --> 02:51:06.369]  One of the first actions taken to return Germany to greatness was the Reichstag Fire Decree, which I know you are totally familiar with.
[02:51:06.369 --> 02:51:08.031]  Yeah, false flag.
[02:51:08.031 --> 02:51:13.498]  Then Hitler had all the homosexuals in the SA rounded up and killed, and not the long knives.
[02:51:13.498 --> 02:51:14.299]  That pleased the public.
[02:51:15.786 --> 02:51:25.111]  I'll just fast forward ahead so we can skip a lot of it, but the Reichstag Fire Decree opened up all sorts of restrictions on personal liberty, rights of freedom of expression.
[02:51:25.111 --> 02:51:30.774]  It even allowed for postal, telephonic, and telegraphic communications to be eavesdropped on.
[02:51:30.774 --> 02:51:34.375]  I mean, it's a mirror of what happened with the Patriot Act.
[02:51:34.375 --> 02:51:42.019]  After that, they started with the book burning, which was literally the burning of pornography and associated materials and textbooks that were viewed as the source of the perversion in society.
[02:51:42.019 --> 02:51:45.081]  And once they set that precedent, then they could ban all other criticism.
[02:51:46.118 --> 02:51:47.579]  It got worse and worse and worse.
[02:51:47.579 --> 02:51:48.879]  Then the roundups began.
[02:51:48.879 --> 02:51:55.441]  And once they started concentrating people in ghettos and rounding people up, the browbeaten population was now effectively scared into submission.
[02:51:55.441 --> 02:52:00.963]  And they started having lockdowns of ghettos and checkpoints only in select areas to condition the public.
[02:52:00.963 --> 02:52:01.443]  Same thing now.
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:03.280]  Absolutely.
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:11.764]  At this point, their submission and worship of God was transformed into submission and worship of the state, and the groundwork was laid for all hell to break loose.
[02:52:11.764 --> 02:52:21.728]  So as scary as this shift under the current political leadership in America is, it's the rapid and extreme movement in the other direction that we should all be acutely aware of.
[02:52:21.728 --> 02:52:29.131]  The people are ready to support anyone who's willing to get the job done, and this is the point where, as Joseph Stalin said, decades can happen in weeks.
[02:52:29.711 --> 02:52:35.093]  Swinging this country so far in the other direction that we'll find ourselves quickly on the wrong side of history.
[02:52:35.093 --> 02:52:41.575]  We have a stunningly ignorant, browbeaten population crying out for a strong leader to restore the greatness of America.
[02:52:41.575 --> 02:52:43.795]  We have the legal framework of control in place.
[02:52:43.795 --> 02:52:52.558]  We have dozens of groups from preppers and patriots to transgendered persons who have arrogantly identified themselves thanks to pop culture encouragement through TV and whatnot.
[02:52:53.237 --> 02:52:58.961]  The surveillance structure that's in place to catalog everybody so they know who's a threat before they ever take a move.
[02:52:58.961 --> 02:53:01.802]  And that's Jade Helm.
[02:53:01.802 --> 02:53:04.064]  It's all sorts of things that have been going on.
[02:53:04.064 --> 02:53:10.047]  We have religious, ethnic, and other minorities that have been blamed for every ill possible proudly identifying themselves.
[02:53:10.047 --> 02:53:17.752]  We have leaders emerging who are pitching populist messages with a get-it-done attitude who will pledge to restore the greatness of the United States.
[02:53:17.752 --> 02:53:22.615]  Everything is in place, we just need the right leader in another catalyst event and we're going to be in deep trouble.
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:39.309]  One has to ask themselves if, for instance, the Republican tough guy candidate with the populist rhetoric, if he were to be elected and with his get-it-done attitude wanted to round up and deport ethnic or religious minorities like Hispanics and Muslims, how many people in today's society would really oppose it?
[02:53:39.309 --> 02:53:42.931]  A lot of folks would go for it and then he'd have the precedence to do it to everybody.
[02:53:44.073 --> 02:53:45.194]  Absolutely.
[02:53:45.194 --> 02:53:48.917]  So once that starts, how is the Voice of Reason ever going to stop it?
[02:53:48.917 --> 02:53:53.080]  The bottom line is one man is not going to fix the mess in this country.
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:56.143]  He will only act to lead us all to our own demise.
[02:53:56.143 --> 02:54:03.308]  The only way to fix this is for the people themselves to find it in their gut to stand up and speak out.
[02:54:03.308 --> 02:54:04.769]  Thank you for letting me get that out.
[02:54:04.769 --> 02:54:06.691]  Sure, let me say this, Mike.
[02:54:06.691 --> 02:54:07.812]  You wrote that, didn't you?
[02:54:07.812 --> 02:54:09.313]  Because, I mean, that was well written.
[02:54:09.313 --> 02:54:09.453]  Yeah.
[02:54:11.923 --> 02:54:13.689]  And what website is that on?
[02:54:13.689 --> 02:54:14.431]  What did you write that for?
[02:54:15.915 --> 02:54:17.195]  I wrote it last night.
[02:54:17.195 --> 02:54:18.876]  I emailed a rough copy to David Knight.
[02:54:18.876 --> 02:54:20.036]  I was busy when I wrote it.
[02:54:20.036 --> 02:54:21.496]  Well, I know this.
[02:54:21.496 --> 02:54:25.777]  I was sent some other great stuff from an investment banker I met in the Cayman Islands.
[02:54:25.777 --> 02:54:28.197]  I read it this morning, meant to give it to the webmaster to post.
[02:54:28.197 --> 02:54:28.577]  I didn't.
[02:54:28.577 --> 02:54:30.778]  I'm going to give that to some of the guys during the break.
[02:54:30.778 --> 02:54:33.078]  I just forget there's so much going on.
[02:54:33.078 --> 02:54:39.199]  What you wrote really sounds great, so why don't you send it to showtips at infowars.com and we'll post it.
[02:54:39.199 --> 02:54:40.199]  Absolutely.
[02:54:40.199 --> 02:54:43.580]  The danger of the extremist leftist takeover right now is real.
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:46.680]  So I'm fully opposing the Democrats.
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:52.802]  If the Republicans start acting fascist, and there's some guy on a white horse, I will then oppose them.
[02:54:52.802 --> 02:55:01.724]  It appears the globalists worldwide, though, are afraid of fascist movements, and they're going with liberal, socialist, communist-styled movements.
[02:55:01.724 --> 02:55:08.345]  But this is so outrageous that it makes me wonder if they're trying to condition us to accept a fascist curveball.
[02:55:09.065 --> 02:55:11.506]  And so I think what you're saying is very, very important.
[02:55:11.506 --> 02:55:14.307]  In fact, we'll take this five-minute call and put it up as its own video.
[02:55:14.307 --> 02:55:16.288]  I think it's very informative.
[02:55:16.288 --> 02:55:17.109]  What would you call it?
[02:55:17.109 --> 02:55:19.930]  Parallels from Nazi Germany to America?
[02:55:19.930 --> 02:55:22.091]  Or Beware the Man on a White Horse?
[02:55:22.091 --> 02:55:25.573]  What should we call this piece, Mike?
[02:55:25.573 --> 02:55:27.394]  I'm just honored that you would do it.
[02:55:27.394 --> 02:55:28.814]  No, sure, we'll put your article up.
[02:55:28.814 --> 02:55:32.936]  But what I'm asking is, what would you call this last five minutes?
[02:55:32.936 --> 02:55:36.378]  That the political climate is ready for fascism?
[02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:42.174]  I liked your first line better because the parallels, they're almost, you can't ignore them.
[02:55:42.174 --> 02:55:43.595]  They're so blatantly obvious.
[02:55:43.595 --> 02:55:49.021]  Well, the same British social engineers that set Germany up are setting the U.S.
[02:55:49.021 --> 02:55:49.241]  up.
[02:55:49.241 --> 02:55:55.307]  And I'm not saying Britain runs it, but their systems of control, the British Empire, are the most sophisticated.
[02:55:55.307 --> 02:55:56.568]  And it's all declassified.
[02:55:56.568 --> 02:56:00.052]  Man, they put Hitler in, they set him up, they had secret treaties.
[02:56:00.772 --> 02:56:03.176]  He was hanging out with the King of England.
[02:56:03.176 --> 02:56:05.699]  He thought that he was playing the bad cop for him.
[02:56:05.699 --> 02:56:09.303]  That England was going to come in with the US and go after the Russians.
[02:56:09.303 --> 02:56:11.887]  They double-crossed him, sort of giving weapons to Russia.
[02:56:11.887 --> 02:56:14.150]  He turned Operation Barbarossa.
[02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:15.712]  And so I'm not saying Hitler was a good guy.
[02:56:15.712 --> 02:56:18.455]  He was crazy and really bad, but he thought he was good.
[02:56:19.196 --> 02:56:20.777]  And man, look how he got set up.
[02:56:20.777 --> 02:56:31.484]  And the Germans were smart, but they just could not deal with the super, you know, fifth dimensional level, fourth dimensional level chess that British intelligence plays.
[02:56:31.484 --> 02:56:35.347]  I mean, it's nasty, it's sickening, it's filthy, it's evil.
[02:56:35.347 --> 02:56:40.971]  And it's what the British developed in a thousand years of war with their neighbors.
[02:56:40.971 --> 02:56:45.153]  And it's just a system of a map of false reality.
[02:56:45.153 --> 02:56:47.135]  And it's just it's a great crime.
[02:56:47.135 --> 02:56:48.776]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:56:49.937 --> 02:56:51.998]  We're going to go to break and do five minutes of Overdrive.
[02:56:51.998 --> 02:56:56.041]  Then the whole next hour is coming up with Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:56:56.041 --> 02:56:57.823]  Paul Watson has a sore throat today.
[02:56:57.823 --> 02:56:59.644]  He'll be in tomorrow.
[02:56:59.644 --> 02:57:04.548]  In the fourth hour of Overdrive, the wrap-up show where they cover what we cover on the show and the latest developments.
[02:57:04.548 --> 02:57:11.133]  Anthony Gucciardi will be hosting the fourth hour today, breaking down some breaking news, including new claims that ISIS could soon have nuclear capabilities.
[02:57:12.408 --> 02:57:15.750]  The Globals could set off a nuke and bring in Marshall Law and claim ISIS to it.
[02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:19.052]  The latest videos from today that we haven't gotten to and much more.
[02:57:19.052 --> 02:57:22.734]  Paul Watson will also be popping in to talk about what's coming up on tomorrow's show.
[02:57:22.734 --> 02:57:32.660]  Yes, Paul Watson is hosting tomorrow because my son is now 13 and I've only taken him hunting probably 15 times.
[02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:34.761]  I've been hunting 15, 20 times by the time I was 7.
[02:57:34.761 --> 02:57:37.683]  So I'm taking my son Dove hunting tomorrow.
[02:57:38.877 --> 02:57:51.832]  I do intend to shoot a report in the morning that will be part of the show with the latest, but I am taking my son hunting tomorrow outside Austin with my father and others, so it's just got to happen.
[02:57:51.832 --> 02:57:54.074]  I could say God's letter on my heart, but it's just in my gut.
[02:57:54.074 --> 02:57:57.438]  I need to spend more time with my children, and I'm going to be doing that.
[02:57:58.766 --> 02:58:08.071]  The Nightly News is tonight at 7 o'clock as well, but Paul Watson will be hosting the entire first three hours tomorrow, and then I'm not sure who's doing the fourth hour tomorrow.
[02:58:08.071 --> 02:58:11.473]  Before we end this hour, incredible Liver Shield.
[02:58:11.473 --> 02:58:14.395]  Sold out for months, but a limited supply came back in.
[02:58:14.395 --> 02:58:16.576]  The full shipment came in.
[02:58:16.576 --> 02:58:18.817]  It is one of the hottest items ever.
[02:58:18.817 --> 02:58:21.659]  You can learn about Liver Shield for daily use or Liver Shield
[02:58:22.810 --> 02:58:25.712]  With the Deep Cleanse, Deep Cleanse did sell out.
[02:58:25.712 --> 02:58:28.834]  We do have the Child-Ease, a lot of their products that are back in.
[02:58:28.834 --> 02:58:31.716]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:31.716 --> 02:58:36.279]  We can call and answer all your questions.
[02:58:36.279 --> 02:58:39.421]  And your purchases from the operation stay with us, fourth hour.
[02:58:39.421 --> 02:58:40.542]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:40.542 --> 02:58:43.144]  Infowars.com, 4's Life Show.
[02:58:43.144 --> 02:58:45.866]  On other stations, stay tuned for other broadcasts that are important as well.
[02:58:48.863 --> 02:58:50.244]  I want more candy!
[02:58:50.244 --> 02:58:51.124]  I want more video games!
[02:58:51.124 --> 02:58:52.084]  Why, why, why?
[02:58:52.084 --> 02:59:01.809]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:59:01.809 --> 02:59:04.510]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:59:04.510 --> 02:59:08.072]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:59:08.072 --> 02:59:10.813]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[02:59:11.033 --> 02:59:11.733]  We're good to go.
[02:59:33.641 --> 02:59:41.185]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[02:59:41.185 --> 02:59:44.787]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:44.787 --> 02:59:51.330]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:51.330 --> 02:59:53.972]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.542 --> 03:00:08.187]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.187 --> 03:00:11.449]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.449 --> 03:00:19.615]  That's right, I literally come from you, in deep in the heart of Texas, from FEMA Region 6, in Occupied Territory.
[03:00:19.615 --> 03:00:21.457]  Hey, we should come in with a Red Dawn intro.
[03:00:21.457 --> 03:00:25.300]  Anything gets you already in the next segment.
[03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:26.560]  Let's jam in some more calls.
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:28.782]  Denise in Texas, FEMA Region 6.
[03:00:28.782 --> 03:00:29.803]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:30.615 --> 03:00:34.136]  Hey, thanks Alex, thanks for taking my calls.
[03:00:34.136 --> 03:00:57.241]  Listen, the Pope, I wanted to talk about it because I was listening to your insider from Italy there, and he seemed a little over-the-top demonizing the Pope, and it makes me think, like, you know, this kind of worship that we saw that was scary and all the bright faces, millions of them out there, just for a little tiny glimpse of the Pope and the adulation and all this, and then him demonizing.
[03:00:57.719 --> 03:01:02.161]  And you have to go, okay, wait a minute, like, look at this from a PR perspective.
[03:01:02.161 --> 03:01:10.645]  Back in 2000, the Vatican published a study and they expected their major growth in the next millennia to be from Latin America.
[03:01:10.645 --> 03:01:19.570]  Now, they're putting all their Catholic Charities efforts pretty much towards building that population, including, yes, bringing them here, so it finances on our back.
[03:01:19.570 --> 03:01:23.972]  That also keeps their base here because, being conservative, they lost a lot of
[03:01:24.594 --> 03:01:33.578]  People with, you know, their stance against birth control... No, again, an acting liberal, they can... We need to educate Latin Americans that communism is a Ford Foundation weapon to keep them down.
[03:01:33.578 --> 03:01:40.782]  And look, I may have gone too far in some cases going after the Pope, because I feel guilty that I didn't criticize
[03:01:41.782 --> 03:01:49.145]  Some of the political aspects of Catholicism previously enough, and then now it's so naked that it's got to be exposed.
[03:01:49.145 --> 03:02:00.409]  I can see the temporal political things that the Pope's doing from the perspective of the Catholic Church, but if the Catholic Church continues on as a globalist organ, it really died.
[03:02:00.409 --> 03:02:01.369]  It doesn't survive.
[03:02:01.369 --> 03:02:02.009]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:02:02.009 --> 03:02:09.132]  I think what it's going to be doing, though, is looking to align itself with whoever is globalism out there, and right now I think that that's
[03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:19.437]  The fact that your insider from there is saying that Putin is casting Putin as the outsider against globalism, I think that's not so.
[03:02:19.437 --> 03:02:26.362]  I think that it's up for grabs and that's why Russia and Iran are aligning.
[03:02:26.362 --> 03:02:27.003]  Oh, you're right.
[03:02:27.003 --> 03:02:36.230]  There is a major global power struggle about who will dominate a new bipolar world moving from a unipolar world where the United States was the center of power.
[03:02:37.250 --> 03:02:44.213]  Well, the thing is, China never got packed it in, and now you see they're stepping up with Russia, and it's been going on for more than a decade, you know.
[03:02:44.213 --> 03:02:48.175]  Yeah, well it took hard work by the people running the U.S.
[03:02:48.175 --> 03:02:51.996]  to drive Russia and China into each other's arms and screw up the U.S.
[03:02:51.996 --> 03:02:55.958]  I mean, I'm saying this is sabotage, by design, what they're doing.
[03:02:56.218 --> 03:02:58.239]  I appreciate your call, God bless you.
[03:02:58.239 --> 03:03:03.682]  Our government is running Al-Qaeda and ISIS, the whole world's learning about it, to hurt the United States.
[03:03:03.682 --> 03:03:10.346]  The globalists want to bring this country down, and they're doing it from within and without, and it makes me want to throw up.
[03:03:10.346 --> 03:03:12.427]  What scum traitors!
[03:03:12.427 --> 03:03:15.969]  Randy in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:03:15.969 --> 03:03:25.295]  Yes, Alex, now that you've got a satellite uplink, are you going to try to get the show on DirecTV or Dish Network?
[03:03:25.666 --> 03:03:28.868]  Yes, I have just been resting since getting all this launched.
[03:03:28.868 --> 03:03:31.269]  We already have some TV stations and cable systems picking it up.
[03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:37.172]  Now I'm going to start to drive to promote that to the stations, to get it picked up, and then to reach other platforms.
[03:03:37.172 --> 03:03:39.093]  So, yes.
[03:03:39.093 --> 03:03:40.573]  Okay, that's all I wanted to know.
[03:03:40.573 --> 03:03:42.995]  Thank you very much, Alex, and keep up the good work.
[03:03:42.995 --> 03:03:43.955]  God bless you, Randy.
[03:03:43.955 --> 03:03:44.956]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[03:03:44.956 --> 03:03:50.699]  Believe me, half the time I sound like a babbling idiot up here because it's exhausting, but at least I mean well.
[03:03:50.699 --> 03:03:52.219]  Alex in Kentucky, last caller.
[03:03:52.219 --> 03:03:52.880]  Sorry to the others.
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:53.320]  Go ahead.
[03:03:54.295 --> 03:03:55.135]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:03:55.135 --> 03:04:11.603]  I wanted to say that I've seen, since I've been watching you, maybe the past four months, there's been more attacks about Alex Jones, about your website, about all these stupid things, that you're a Russian agent or a Zionist agent.
[03:04:11.603 --> 03:04:17.025]  People that get caught up in that, number one, they don't understand the full power structure.
[03:04:17.025 --> 03:04:21.367]  These people like Rockefeller, you know, who they think are Zionists,
[03:04:22.012 --> 03:04:25.035]  Or the people in charge of all the media and banks.
[03:04:25.035 --> 03:04:26.857]  They're not real Jews.
[03:04:26.857 --> 03:04:29.500]  Okay, just like the Pharisees weren't real Jews.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:31.902]  Just like the Pope's not a real Christian.
[03:04:31.902 --> 03:04:35.626]  You know, Alex, you can come back and finish this with Gucciardi if you want.
[03:04:35.626 --> 03:04:39.170]  Because it's an important subject and I can't cut you off.
[03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:42.573]  And Brian and Rich, if you guys want to hold, I'm sure Gucciardi will want to take your calls.
[03:04:43.194 --> 03:04:53.272]  The attacks on us are from all different quarters because most of it's stirred up by the establishment because we're bringing people together around free market and around family and around sovereignty.
[03:04:53.272 --> 03:04:55.475]  That's why they want to get us fighting in little subgroups.
[03:04:58.971 --> 03:05:02.074]  This article from Medical Express appeared on the Drudge Report.
[03:05:02.074 --> 03:05:05.477]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk.
[03:05:05.477 --> 03:05:12.923]  Emerging evidence ties endocrine disrupting chemical exposure to two of the biggest public health threats facing society, diabetes and obesity.
[03:05:12.923 --> 03:05:15.585]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[03:05:15.765 --> 03:05:25.691]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[03:05:25.691 --> 03:05:31.654]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[03:05:31.654 --> 03:05:39.499]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[03:05:39.739 --> 03:05:48.886]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.
[03:05:48.886 --> 03:05:51.628]  All things we've been telling you here at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:51.628 --> 03:05:54.550]  Check out InfoWarsLife.com for more information.
[03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:56.991]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:58.666 --> 03:06:02.169]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:02.169 --> 03:06:10.416]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:10.416 --> 03:06:15.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:15.840 --> 03:06:18.363]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:18.363 --> 03:06:20.484]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[03:06:20.484 --> 03:06:24.668]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:06:28.542 --> 03:06:29.643]  BrainForce is here.
[03:06:29.643 --> 03:06:31.864]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:31.864 --> 03:06:36.846]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:06:36.846 --> 03:06:40.148]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:06:40.148 --> 03:06:43.630]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:06:43.630 --> 03:06:45.611]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:06:45.611 --> 03:06:49.713]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[03:06:49.713 --> 03:06:55.316]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:58.277 --> 03:07:02.580]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:06.824]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:06.824 --> 03:07:14.109]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:24.959]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:07:24.959 --> 03:07:28.483]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:28.483 --> 03:07:29.604]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:29.604 --> 03:07:37.892]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty, and you're getting a high-quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:38.032 --> 03:07:41.336]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:41.336 --> 03:07:45.541]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:45.541 --> 03:07:47.843]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:47.843 --> 03:07:54.811]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:07.592 --> 03:08:12.596]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[03:08:12.596 --> 03:08:16.619]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[03:08:16.619 --> 03:08:18.681]  The chair is against the wall.
[03:08:18.681 --> 03:08:20.883]  The chair is against the wall.
[03:08:20.883 --> 03:08:22.884]  John has a long mustache.
[03:08:22.884 --> 03:08:24.926]  John has a long mustache.
[03:08:24.926 --> 03:08:27.628]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[03:08:27.628 --> 03:08:31.932]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[03:08:37.805 --> 03:08:39.686]  But they took a lot of people away.
[03:08:39.686 --> 03:08:41.808]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[03:08:41.808 --> 03:08:45.030]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:46.391]  Where?
[03:08:46.391 --> 03:08:48.612]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[03:08:48.612 --> 03:08:56.698]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:08:56.698 --> 03:09:00.601]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[03:09:02.321 --> 03:09:07.066]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[03:09:07.066 --> 03:09:07.927]  I mean, really.
[03:09:07.927 --> 03:09:11.310]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[03:09:11.310 --> 03:09:16.135]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[03:09:16.135 --> 03:09:18.537]  Come on, I'm a sovereign citizen.
[03:09:18.537 --> 03:09:20.119]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[03:09:20.379 --> 03:09:22.180]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:23.221]  would you see that happening?
[03:09:23.221 --> 03:09:28.024]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[03:09:28.024 --> 03:09:37.810]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[03:09:37.810 --> 03:09:43.814]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[03:09:43.814 --> 03:09:48.377]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[03:09:55.148 --> 03:09:57.711]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[03:09:57.711 --> 03:10:02.757]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[03:10:02.757 --> 03:10:05.960]  Put your gun down, really?
[03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:10.946]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:10:10.946 --> 03:10:12.788]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:10:12.788 --> 03:10:14.751]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[03:10:17.455 --> 03:10:22.999]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[03:10:22.999 --> 03:10:25.782]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[03:10:25.782 --> 03:10:29.665]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:10:44.362 --> 03:10:46.583]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:46.583 --> 03:10:49.524]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:10:49.524 --> 03:10:52.826]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I'll be your host for the rest of the show.
[03:10:52.826 --> 03:11:12.575]  We've got a lot of interesting news to cover including some news that Joe Biggs is going to come in and talk about from a first-hand experience as well about how ISIS could be gaining nuclear capabilities and they claim that they're going to wipe out millions through some type of religious cleansing ceremony by using nuclear weapons.
[03:11:12.995 --> 03:11:16.557]  We're also going to talk about how the mainstream media is dying.
[03:11:16.557 --> 03:11:25.141]  We have some victory stories, some good news, some inspirational news, some new Gallup polls that show that trust in Congress is completely decimated.
[03:11:25.141 --> 03:11:31.345]  The mainstream media is dying, alternative media is rising, and we're going to talk about how finally
[03:11:32.415 --> 03:11:43.324]  Scientists are admitting that obesity and diabetes and a number of other conditions are actually a result of the chemicals that you're being exposed to on a daily basis.
[03:11:43.324 --> 03:11:51.731]  First I'd like to get right into this new Gallup poll, which is exciting stuff, and we've seen this pretty much every single year they do one on this subject.
[03:11:51.731 --> 03:11:56.334]  Headline, America's trust in media remains at historic low.
[03:11:56.334 --> 03:11:57.776]  This is from Gallup directly.
[03:11:58.376 --> 03:11:59.717]  Just came out.
[03:11:59.717 --> 03:12:01.979]  4 in 10 Americans trust the mass media.
[03:12:01.979 --> 03:12:02.640]  Only 4.
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:07.283]  Ties 2014 and 2012 for the lowest trust level in Gallup's trend.
[03:12:07.283 --> 03:12:10.286]  Younger Americans less likely than older to trust the media.
[03:12:10.286 --> 03:12:19.874]  Says, 4 in 10 Americans say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust and confidence in the mass media to report on the news fully, accurately, and fairly.
[03:12:19.874 --> 03:12:22.696]  So it ties in with the past couple years.
[03:12:22.696 --> 03:12:25.719]  So about 4 in 10 Americans actually trust the mainstream media.
[03:12:25.719 --> 03:12:26.799]  And you know, I went to CNN.
[03:12:27.987 --> 03:12:35.576]  I read this Gallup poll and I decided, well, you know, I'm going to go to CNN and see how much I trust the mainstream media, which of course is not much.
[03:12:35.576 --> 03:12:46.669]  But I did discover key breaking news under their featured news section, such as Facts of Life star Kim Fields joins Real Housewives of Atlanta.
[03:12:47.645 --> 03:12:50.127]  That is, of course, essential breaking news.
[03:12:50.127 --> 03:12:56.974]  Don't worry about ISIS getting nuclear weapons, or some type of event inside the United States, or really anything that's important.
[03:12:56.974 --> 03:13:03.339]  You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and what you have are beloved sitcom schoolgirls and their house mother.
[03:13:03.339 --> 03:13:05.762]  Let's see what the ladies have been up to since the show.
[03:13:05.762 --> 03:13:05.782]  1988.
[03:13:05.782 --> 03:13:07.143]  Wow.
[03:13:07.143 --> 03:13:09.885]  Key news.
[03:13:09.885 --> 03:13:13.128]  Second piece of key news from the mainstream media, which no one trusts anymore.
[03:13:13.962 --> 03:13:16.906]  Again this is under featured news on CNN.com.
[03:13:16.906 --> 03:13:22.453]  LL Cool J's son Najee Smith arrested after a restaurant fight.
[03:13:22.453 --> 03:13:30.042]  LL Cool J's son was arrested early Tuesday in New York after a fight in a restaurant where two law enforcement sources blah blah blah.
[03:13:30.042 --> 03:13:30.223]  Wow.
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:32.461]  Really important news.
[03:13:32.461 --> 03:13:34.442]  Thank you, mainstream media.
[03:13:34.442 --> 03:13:41.929]  It's no surprise and no wonder that so many people are turning to real independent news media and tired of the mainstream media.
[03:13:41.929 --> 03:13:56.140]  Every single time we turn on the television or we go to websites like CNN, there's some important news mixed in, but it always seems like the celebrity culture and the gossip culture and whatever the weirdness of the day is, is mixed in with this top stuff.
[03:13:56.220 --> 03:14:04.786]  And there's nothing wrong with looking at the celebrity culture or the fun, weird, silly news or whatever that sometimes populates some of the websites that we all visit.
[03:14:04.786 --> 03:14:06.067]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[03:14:06.067 --> 03:14:15.994]  But when they mix in things like LL Cool J's son being arrested next to ISIS purportedly getting ready to kill millions of people, that's a little bit of a disconnect.
[03:14:15.994 --> 03:14:21.497]  And of course the fact that we all know the mainstream media is feeding us a bunch of horse manure.
[03:14:21.497 --> 03:14:23.379]  But Gallup didn't stop there.
[03:14:24.414 --> 03:14:27.922]  Here's another poll, and this seems to be the same thing over and over again.
[03:14:34.244 --> 03:14:44.872]  However likely drama over to fund the government passed September 30 unfolds, most Americans appear to have little faith in most lawmakers to do the right thing.
[03:14:44.872 --> 03:14:48.594]  Most lawmakers are corrupt, out of touch, and favor special interests, according to the poll.
[03:14:48.594 --> 03:14:51.857]  48% say their own representative is out of touch.
[03:14:51.857 --> 03:14:54.499]  32% say their own member is corrupt.
[03:14:54.499 --> 03:15:00.063]  And obviously, there is massive amounts of corruption, but that's admitted because insider trading is allowed.
[03:15:01.038 --> 03:15:05.761]  The fact of the matter is that we have lost faith in our so-called government.
[03:15:05.761 --> 03:15:09.223]  We have lost faith in our so-called electives.
[03:15:09.223 --> 03:15:16.867]  You know, our elected individuals that are supposed to represent us in all of our ways and our thoughts and our desires.
[03:15:16.867 --> 03:15:21.850]  There's no question that there is an ideological collapse of America that has already begun.
[03:15:22.338 --> 03:15:30.623]  Whether or not that will follow with a physical type of economic collapse or whatever, the ideology of America has already collapsed.
[03:15:30.623 --> 03:15:34.846]  And that's why so many of us are waiting for a catalyst to really begin.
[03:15:34.846 --> 03:15:41.010]  And speaking of catalysts, we're going to talk in the bottom of the hour with Joe Biggs about some of these articles.
[03:15:41.883 --> 03:15:50.189]  He has some insider information about when he was in Afghanistan and Iraq on interacting with some of these extremists, crazy people.
[03:15:50.189 --> 03:15:51.790]  ISIS nuclear weapons.
[03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:54.972]  This is from HNGN.
[03:15:54.972 --> 03:16:00.976]  Terrorist group plans to kill hundreds of millions in largest religious cleansing in history, says report.
[03:16:02.199 --> 03:16:23.629]  ISIS is planning to use nuclear weapons to launch a global assault on anyone who holds differing religious beliefs, all in the name of worshipping Allah, according to German journalist Jürgen Totenhofer, who in 2014 was the first Western reporter allowed to embed with a terrorist outfit and live to tell about it, spending 10 days in northern Iraq with its fighters.
[03:16:23.629 --> 03:16:25.270]  So we're going to talk about that, too.
[03:16:25.270 --> 03:16:29.292]  A Western journalist spent 10 days with ISIS, apparently.
[03:16:30.012 --> 03:16:34.934]  And he has some stories to tell about it and their plans to do all this madness.
[03:16:34.934 --> 03:16:39.977]  And we'll talk about how Putin says that's basically just American-backed BS.
[03:16:39.977 --> 03:16:43.198]  Another report from IBT, International Business Times.
[03:16:43.198 --> 03:16:44.639]  Islamic State nuclear weapons.
[03:16:44.639 --> 03:16:48.341]  ISIS claims it can smuggle devices through Nigeria, Mexico to the United States.
[03:16:48.341 --> 03:16:49.101]  And that was on June 3rd, 2015.
[03:16:51.132 --> 03:16:52.073]  ISIS nuclear weapon.
[03:16:52.073 --> 03:16:57.920]  Islamic State claims it can buy nukes from Pakistan within a year in Propaganda Magazine.
[03:16:57.920 --> 03:16:59.582]  That was from May 23, 2015.
[03:16:59.582 --> 03:17:02.084]  So this has been going on for a very long time.
[03:17:03.001 --> 03:17:19.926]  Later, towards the end of the hour, we're also going to speak to Paul Joseph Watson, who is sick today, so I decided to fill in for him, and he's going to come and host the show tomorrow, but he's also going to talk about some of the breaking-in exclusives that he's got tomorrow, and reveal a little bit of it today, at the end of the hour as well.
[03:17:19.926 --> 03:17:26.228]  So let's get into some more news, and also talk about, there was a caller that was on hold, unfortunately he dropped, I wanted to talk to him.
[03:17:27.148 --> 03:17:35.171]  He had called into Alex right before we jumped over to the Overdrive Hour and was talking about people that just attack everybody.
[03:17:35.171 --> 03:17:40.113]  And without getting into any specifics of who he was talking about or anything like that, he did it pretty cordially.
[03:17:40.113 --> 03:17:43.134]  He said, you know, there's people that will just attack anybody with a message.
[03:17:44.074 --> 03:17:49.278]  And I find that you make yourself a target when you decide to have an opinion.
[03:17:49.278 --> 03:18:06.230]  Because if you think about all the historical figures, all the powerful figures that we all know today, whether you believe in them or not, whether it's Jesus or Gandhi or Buddha or anyone that you believe to be, you know, have done amazing things and really stood for something, what happened to them?
[03:18:07.315 --> 03:18:16.260]  Well, they were harassed or tortured or killed or at least made fun of and insulted in numerous different ways and hated to this day.
[03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:25.045]  Because you will find that when you stand for something, others will, at the most base levels of their humanity for some reason, hate you.
[03:18:25.045 --> 03:18:25.846]  And there are people
[03:18:27.025 --> 03:18:39.895]  That all they want to do is kind of like if you were able to sprout wings and fly away and fly high and have an amazing life, they would just pull on those wings and pull you down to the ground just because they don't have wings.
[03:18:39.895 --> 03:18:50.403]  And when you decide to enter the so-called arena of information and talk about these kind of things, talk about the mainstream media dying and talk about the real information in the news and the life-saving stuff,
[03:18:51.164 --> 03:19:01.966]  Talking about avoiding the chemicals that give you cancer, talking about all that kind of stuff, there's always going to be a core group that will incessantly want to attack you and bring you down.
[03:19:01.966 --> 03:19:06.587]  And the caller was kind of touching on some of those things about total negativity and toxic people.
[03:19:06.587 --> 03:19:08.267]  I think it's in all branches.
[03:19:08.267 --> 03:19:15.489]  But really, when you make the decision to make yourself a figure of truth and a figure of anything, and we all make mistakes, we all have
[03:19:16.169 --> 03:19:16.810]  I don't think so.
[03:19:33.263 --> 03:19:35.624]  That, I think, is an important thing to consider.
[03:19:35.624 --> 03:19:36.264]  We'll be back.
[03:19:36.264 --> 03:19:46.248]  We're going to talk to Joe Biggs, not in this next segment, but in the next segment we're going to cover all the news, more about ISIS, bans on GMO crops in the EU, more victory news, more good news.
[03:19:46.248 --> 03:19:46.648]  Stay tuned.
[03:19:59.344 --> 03:20:10.435]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.

[03:20:20.145 --> 03:20:20.425]  I think so.
[03:20:42.705 --> 03:20:46.991]  Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[03:22:58.368 --> 03:23:02.793]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:02.793 --> 03:23:06.857]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:06.857 --> 03:23:11.061]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:14.204 --> 03:23:19.446]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:23:19.446 --> 03:23:28.150]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:24:07.870 --> 03:24:09.731]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:09.731 --> 03:24:12.192]  This is the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:12.192 --> 03:24:15.774]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, your host for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:15.774 --> 03:24:29.501]  And you know, if you think about life just 100 years ago and how different it is today and the ways that were inconceivable at the time and the predictions of flying cars and total insanity and how wrong they were...
[03:24:30.081 --> 03:24:35.024]  It really puts into perspective how we don't know what's going to happen even in the next few decades.
[03:24:35.024 --> 03:24:46.472]  Because of the time spiral system that we're all familiar with, technology has advanced in such a way that 2030 and 2040, I believe, would be similar to 1800 and 1900.
[03:24:46.472 --> 03:24:49.454]  Just because of the advancements in technology that we're now seeing.
[03:24:50.154 --> 03:24:52.976]  This article from The Telegraph caught my eye.
[03:24:52.976 --> 03:24:54.177]  Very interesting.
[03:24:54.177 --> 03:24:55.538]  Very demented.
[03:24:55.538 --> 03:25:00.882]  By 2050, human-on-robot sex will be more common than human-on-human sex, says report.
[03:25:00.882 --> 03:25:05.546]  A shocking new report from a futurologist reveals predictions about the future of sex in robots.
[03:25:05.546 --> 03:25:09.969]  Pretty graphic, so I don't want to get totally into it, but it says, can you imagine having sex with a humanoid robot?
[03:25:09.969 --> 03:25:12.651]  Apparently this will be the norm in a few short decades.
[03:25:12.651 --> 03:25:15.834]  Dr. Ian Pearson has released a report which he predicts the future of sex.
[03:25:16.892 --> 03:25:22.259]  I don't think it's possible to predict the future up to 2050 because of the massive advancements in technology.
[03:25:22.259 --> 03:25:35.155]  I remember there's a project, I think it's called the 2055 project, I could be wrong, and it says that by 2020 we'll start having artificial bodies and by about 2050 we'll hit complete singularity.
[03:25:35.936 --> 03:25:37.516]  I don't really see that as the case.
[03:25:37.516 --> 03:25:43.718]  I think it'll take a bit longer than that because of the political fight for, you know, against artificial intelligence.
[03:25:43.718 --> 03:25:45.038]  But it is pretty insane.
[03:25:45.038 --> 03:25:56.201]  It's like the movie Ex Machina, which is a great movie, where essentially a tech founder that's very similar to Google starts a sex robot company and starts taking over with these concepts.
[03:25:56.201 --> 03:25:58.262]  And basically he can't keep up with it.
[03:25:58.262 --> 03:26:03.083]  And the AI system he created becomes so intelligent that it eventually kills him.
[03:26:03.803 --> 03:26:05.065]  Some interesting stuff.
[03:26:05.065 --> 03:26:07.329]  But I want to open up the phone lines and take some calls.
[03:26:07.329 --> 03:26:11.357]  I also want to talk about some victory and some good news.
[03:26:11.357 --> 03:26:15.344]  Austria and Italy celebrate bans on GMO crops with EU opt-out.
[03:26:16.454 --> 03:26:29.844]  Austrian Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser and a number of Italian ministers have confirmed that both countries are officially requesting an opt-out from growing eight varieties of GMAs permitted or to be set permitted at the EU level.
[03:26:29.844 --> 03:26:34.727]  So they're basically opting out, saying we don't want to grow this, we don't want this, it's a huge victory.
[03:26:34.727 --> 03:26:40.732]  Even if you support GMOs, it's a huge victory because they're saying, hey, we're our own individual countries and we're going to do what we want.
[03:26:41.232 --> 03:26:50.598]  Let's jump into some calls for the next segment when Joe Biggs is going to talk about the latest developments of ISIS and how they apparently have nuclear weapons and want to kill millions of people in total insanity.
[03:26:50.598 --> 03:26:55.521]  And we're going to talk about his experience in Afghanistan and Iraq with some extremists.
[03:26:55.521 --> 03:26:58.703]  Let's jump right into Mike from Tennessee.
[03:26:58.703 --> 03:27:04.166]  He wants to talk about war with big media, which ties in with the Gallup poll earlier that mainstream media is dying.
[03:27:04.166 --> 03:27:06.488]  What's up, Mike?
[03:27:06.488 --> 03:27:07.889]  Hey, can you hear me?
[03:27:07.889 --> 03:27:09.430]  I absolutely can, loud and clear.
[03:27:10.936 --> 03:27:14.318]  Well, I got a small bone to pick with Alex Jones.
[03:27:14.318 --> 03:27:33.071]  I was hoping to get to talk to him because of this bone to pick, because the other day when he was talking about the war on mainstream media versus the media, the war versus the press, and he doesn't bring up the death of Michael Hastings.
[03:27:33.071 --> 03:27:37.234]  And I've always wanted to know more about that whole story.
[03:27:37.234 --> 03:27:38.395]  I mean, I know pretty much
[03:27:39.272 --> 03:27:45.097]  What is out there to know, but I don't understand, you know, I would like to know the Rolling Stones' point of view.
[03:27:45.097 --> 03:27:54.004]  How come they don't come to the defense of Michael Hastings and say anything about this battle that he lost?
[03:27:54.004 --> 03:28:01.230]  Well, wasn't Biggs, I'm going to ask the producer because I'm not 100% clear on this, wasn't Biggs pretty close, wasn't he pretty close to Michael Hastings?
[03:28:01.230 --> 03:28:06.774]  Well, it's funny you bring that up because Biggs is about to join us next segment and he was extremely close and I'm pretty sure he did
[03:28:07.665 --> 03:28:08.205]  Yeah, what's up, Gooch?
[03:28:32.273 --> 03:28:38.336]  I, uh, you know, Obama said, uh, we need a civilian, uh, you know, army as big as the one we have.
[03:28:38.336 --> 03:28:40.237]  He's right, but we need one.
[03:28:40.237 --> 03:28:44.960]  We, InfoWars, the Liberty Movement, this Dominant Man, we should, that should return.
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:52.224]  You know, we need some kind of force on the ground, the same way they have, you know, we need a little intimidation here.
[03:28:52.224 --> 03:28:52.764]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:28:52.764 --> 03:28:59.348]  Because just knowing is great, and just spreading the word is great, but we need boots on the ground, you know, to do things.
[03:28:59.348 --> 03:29:01.509]  We need, we need to be proactive in this more.
[03:29:02.714 --> 03:29:07.536]  So you mean like a team on the ground telling people what's going on, or are you talking about like an armed revolution?
[03:29:07.536 --> 03:29:16.238]  Because I think really the battle is, and I can see the statistics on social media with my pages and other pages and Alex's pages, there's such a massive reach.
[03:29:16.238 --> 03:29:20.060]  I mean Alex, his page alone I think reaches 1.6 billion.
[03:29:20.060 --> 03:29:21.760]  The fight is online.
[03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:23.301]  The fight is already there.
[03:29:23.301 --> 03:29:26.962]  People starting blogs, posting things, it's spreading the word, but it's also doing more than that.
[03:29:26.962 --> 03:29:29.643]  It really results and translates to real action.
[03:29:30.223 --> 03:29:31.144]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:29:31.144 --> 03:29:37.770]  We're going to come back with Joe Biggs, talk about ISIS, apparently going to wipe out millions of people with their stolen nukes and total insanity.
[03:29:37.770 --> 03:29:38.691]  We'll be back.
[03:29:38.691 --> 03:29:39.191]  Thanks a lot.
[03:29:39.191 --> 03:29:42.974]  We'll also take some more of your calls later in the show and premiere what's going to come out tomorrow.
[03:29:42.974 --> 03:29:48.239]  Thanks a lot.
[03:29:48.239 --> 03:29:49.620]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.620 --> 03:29:52.162]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.162 --> 03:29:54.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.982 --> 03:30:05.404]  In the wake of Pope Francis visiting the United States and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, we have this.
[03:30:05.404 --> 03:30:13.627]  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid $3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male.
[03:30:13.627 --> 03:30:21.350]  The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to someone identified only as Individual A to hide past misconduct.
[03:30:21.350 --> 03:30:25.531]  It has been claimed that Individual A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastert was attempting to silence.
[03:30:25.831 --> 03:30:33.317]  Citing anonymous sources, the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher.
[03:30:33.317 --> 03:30:37.901]  Before leaving Congress in 2007, Hastert was the longest ever serving Republican speaker.
[03:30:37.901 --> 03:30:41.204]  Because when you have skeletons in the closet, you are easy to control.
[03:30:41.204 --> 03:30:45.207]  Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[03:30:45.207 --> 03:30:49.211]  Hastert took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[03:30:49.451 --> 03:30:55.157]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet.
[03:30:55.157 --> 03:30:58.760]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:33:00.253 --> 03:33:05.660]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.660 --> 03:33:07.943]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:17.553]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
[03:33:17.553 --> 03:33:22.357]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, and we're about to talk about some really interesting news.
[03:33:22.357 --> 03:33:25.319]  And we've got Joe Biggs here, who's Staff Sergeant.
[03:33:25.319 --> 03:33:27.501]  He was in Afghanistan, Iraq.
[03:33:27.501 --> 03:33:30.984]  He's got some news to talk about on breaking news on ISIS.
[03:33:30.984 --> 03:33:37.409]  And I've got some stacks of news here too, but I want to hear his personal take on this and what he's really experienced firsthand when he was over there.
[03:33:38.089 --> 03:33:39.230]  But here's the headline.
[03:33:39.230 --> 03:33:46.457]  ISIS nuclear weapons terrorist group plans to kill hundreds of millions in largest religious cleansing in history, says report.
[03:33:46.457 --> 03:33:52.263]  And then previously we have ISIS claims it can smuggle devices through Nigeria, Mexico to the United States.
[03:33:52.263 --> 03:33:56.387]  ISIS nuclear weapon, Islamic State claims it can buy nukes from Pakistan within a year.
[03:33:57.128 --> 03:34:02.571]  And their propaganda magazine might just be completely contrived lies.
[03:34:02.571 --> 03:34:04.272]  But Joe Biggs, what do you think?
[03:34:04.272 --> 03:34:06.013]  I think it's definitely possible.
[03:34:06.013 --> 03:34:12.957]  You know, we definitely created these guys by going in and invading Iraq based off lies.
[03:34:12.957 --> 03:34:16.679]  We created a radical Islam to say, I mean, imagine your home.
[03:34:16.679 --> 03:34:18.480]  You've already got a problem with the Taliban.
[03:34:18.480 --> 03:34:23.363]  You know, these other groups out there that are very extreme, which really represent a one percent of Islam.
[03:34:24.123 --> 03:34:25.904]  And they can't stand those guys.
[03:34:25.904 --> 03:34:29.085]  But then you have Western allies come in and start bombing the hell out of your town.
[03:34:29.085 --> 03:34:30.565]  Who are you going to hate more?
[03:34:30.565 --> 03:34:35.127]  The fear of the boogeyman or the actual boogeyman who's dropping bombs and taking your family out?
[03:34:35.127 --> 03:34:37.528]  And that's how you create this radical Islam.
[03:34:37.528 --> 03:34:39.848]  These guys are sitting around like, man, I hate ISIS.
[03:34:39.848 --> 03:34:42.569]  Now all of a sudden they're getting bombed and they're losing their families.
[03:34:42.569 --> 03:34:43.490]  They're like, well, you know what?
[03:34:43.490 --> 03:34:44.870]  ISIS might not be as bad.
[03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:45.810]  Let's go join them.
[03:34:45.810 --> 03:34:47.471]  The West is really pissing me off.
[03:34:47.471 --> 03:34:48.431]  And that's kind of what's happened.
[03:34:48.431 --> 03:34:50.732]  So what I want to talk about is a book that Jurgen Todenhofer
[03:34:51.172 --> 03:34:51.533]  We're good to go.
[03:35:07.270 --> 03:35:12.992]  And basically what he said is, is the terrorist plan on killing several hundred million people.
[03:35:12.992 --> 03:35:16.153]  The West is drastically underestimating the power of ISIS.
[03:35:16.153 --> 03:35:19.254]  And I know anytime we post or say anything about ISIS, don't you mean the CIA?
[03:35:19.254 --> 03:35:19.934]  Don't you mean that?
[03:35:19.934 --> 03:35:22.555]  And they have to hear that same little story all the time by people.
[03:35:22.555 --> 03:35:23.435]  Yeah, we know it.
[03:35:23.435 --> 03:35:26.496]  It's just like if I'm a man, I have my wife, we have a kid.
[03:35:26.496 --> 03:35:30.798]  I can control what my kid does up until a certain age, but then as an adult, it can go do whatever it wants.
[03:35:31.258 --> 03:35:38.063]  Alright, we might have started ISIS, but it's now grown into this super powerhouse, and it can basically do whatever it wants.
[03:35:38.063 --> 03:35:44.367]  It's broken away, but at the same time, even though it's broken away, and we know that our kid's doing bad, so to say, the U.S.
[03:35:44.367 --> 03:35:48.149]  government's creation is doing bad, they're still arming these guys.
[03:35:48.149 --> 03:35:52.232]  Now, ISIS intends to get its hands on nuclear weapons, Todd Hoffer says.
[03:35:52.232 --> 03:36:00.738]  The group says that a nuclear tsunami will basically kill off a large population of people in this religious cleansing.
[03:36:01.518 --> 03:36:11.306]  And they now control a land greater in size than the United Kingdom and are supported by an almost ecstatic enthusiasm, the likes of which you've never seen in a combat zone.
[03:36:11.306 --> 03:36:12.547]  I've been in combat zones.
[03:36:12.547 --> 03:36:14.168]  I've seen the Afghan army operate.
[03:36:14.168 --> 03:36:15.089]  They're weak.
[03:36:15.089 --> 03:36:17.010]  They're not motivated.
[03:36:17.010 --> 03:36:18.011]  They get scared easily.
[03:36:18.011 --> 03:36:21.454]  The first time you have signs of someone who's bigger than them, they kind of back away.
[03:36:22.054 --> 03:36:23.795]  And they raid the bases and just take it all.
[03:36:44.147 --> 03:36:51.875]  But my question is, so this guy, he's a western journalist, did he fly over there with the intention of getting in with ISIS or what?
[03:36:51.875 --> 03:36:55.899]  Well this is the thing, he flew over there and he thought he was going to get killed.
[03:36:55.899 --> 03:36:59.143]  He thought he would get killed, but he was planning on writing this book.
[03:36:59.143 --> 03:37:04.549]  He's written many books before about Iraq, the invasion, going in after Saddam Hussein.
[03:37:05.249 --> 03:37:05.970]  I don't know.
[03:37:23.763 --> 03:37:33.375]  Under that time, I was surveilled by the Secret Service and had to hand over my mobile phone and laptops from time to time so they could look through the pictures he'd taken, the video and all that.
[03:37:33.375 --> 03:37:38.421]  And then he said ISIS also went through his pictures and deleted some to protect the relatives of foreign fighters.
[03:37:38.421 --> 03:37:40.203]  That's what censorship is.
[03:37:40.203 --> 03:37:41.445]  Now there's a copy in this...
[03:37:43.620 --> 03:37:51.804]  It almost sounds like a propaganda piece, though, to go over there, oh, I was accepted, I'm not saying this is untrue, it's just, you know, playing devil's advocate here.
[03:37:51.804 --> 03:38:07.712]  Go over there, get taken in by ISIS for 10 days and come back and talk about how they're way more powerful than we thought, they could wipe out hundreds of millions of people, this is what they want to do, you know, I mean, is he not slanting it towards they're much greater than we thought or what?
[03:38:07.992 --> 03:38:08.812]  I mean, it's possible.
[03:38:08.812 --> 03:38:15.814]  I mean, you gotta think, anytime that anyone's been held by them for some time, when they get on video, you hear them saying, oh, the Islamic State's great, this and that.
[03:38:15.814 --> 03:38:21.335]  He could have definitely been, you know, playing to their whole thing because he doesn't want to get killed, or they could have threatened his family.
[03:38:21.335 --> 03:38:21.655]  Who knows?
[03:38:21.655 --> 03:38:25.836]  At the same time, the Georgia guys don't say that they want to take out a large population of the people.
[03:38:25.836 --> 03:38:27.376]  Maybe at the end of the day, this is their endgame.
[03:38:27.376 --> 03:38:32.917]  They want to use this creation, ISIS, to wipe out a large population of people so they can do whatever it is they want to do.
[03:38:33.197 --> 03:38:37.761]  Right, and as Alex said, of course, ISIS could just be a way of just blaming things on the ISIS group.
[03:38:37.761 --> 03:38:39.803]  You know, something bad happens, oh, it's ISIS.
[03:38:39.803 --> 03:38:41.785]  You know, a nuclear weapon goes off, it was ISIS.
[03:38:41.785 --> 03:38:48.651]  Well, when you have something bad going on in the way that, you know, something's not working out the way you want it, you create another problem to take away from the other problem.
[03:38:48.651 --> 03:38:49.612]  And everyone hates ISIS.
[03:38:49.612 --> 03:38:52.395]  There's no one that's going to say, well, ISIS isn't that bad.
[03:38:52.395 --> 03:38:57.019]  You know, ISIS is literally the devil in terms of the political spectrum.
[03:38:57.179 --> 03:39:02.262]  You know, ISIS is just the worst, most concentrated evil that could possibly exist.
[03:39:02.262 --> 03:39:07.824]  And it's tainting everything, like you were talking about earlier, less than 1% of the Muslim community is actually radical, you know, etc, etc.
[03:39:07.824 --> 03:39:09.265]  But, sorry, go on with all this.
[03:39:09.265 --> 03:39:14.748]  Yeah, I mean, so, I've been over there before, and, like I said, I've seen how these people act.
[03:39:14.748 --> 03:39:21.051]  You know, a lot of people think that, you know, ISIS, these are a bunch of guys who are cave dwellers, they're idiots, they don't know what they're doing.
[03:39:21.051 --> 03:39:22.652]  No, they're usually pretty intelligent people.
[03:39:23.032 --> 03:39:35.402]  You know, the times that I was in the Kaus province in Afghanistan, I was between Fob, Salerno, which is a forward observation base, and Tehran's IEDC, and that's on the western part of Afghanistan on the Pakistan border.
[03:39:35.402 --> 03:39:38.745]  And we were doing a convoy from Salerno back to the D.C.
[03:39:38.745 --> 03:39:46.711]  where I live, and we caught three guys trying to emplace an IED, which is an improvised explosive device, like a bomb they put in a road, a roadside bomb.
[03:39:47.651 --> 03:39:54.956]  And the guys that we stopped, we found, these guys were professors, they had degrees, they were scientists, you know, chemists, all this stuff.
[03:39:54.956 --> 03:40:00.439]  These weren't just random, we're trying to take our jobs, you know, like, you know, farmers out there.
[03:40:00.439 --> 03:40:05.002]  Maybe the slant is that ISIS is these crazy losers that don't know what they're talking about.
[03:40:05.002 --> 03:40:07.203]  In reality, they might be a lot stronger than we think.
[03:40:07.203 --> 03:40:08.324]  I think it is possible.
[03:40:08.324 --> 03:40:10.745]  I mean, because I've seen how it happens over there.
[03:40:10.745 --> 03:40:14.508]  When you go in and you start bombing a group of people, just imagine if people here started bombing us.
[03:40:15.543 --> 03:40:16.864]  People that we never even thought about.
[03:40:16.864 --> 03:40:19.165]  All of a sudden, your hate for the U.S.
[03:40:19.165 --> 03:40:21.186]  government or distrust in the U.S.
[03:40:21.186 --> 03:40:22.947]  government is going to start to go away.
[03:40:22.947 --> 03:40:24.628]  And you're going to start not being mad at them anymore.
[03:40:24.628 --> 03:40:27.850]  You're going to be mad at the bombs coming overhead that just took out your family.
[03:40:27.850 --> 03:40:29.011]  And that's what's happening.
[03:40:29.011 --> 03:40:31.972]  We've taken this distraction away and we've created another.
[03:40:31.972 --> 03:40:35.054]  So there's a whole lot of craziness going on out there.
[03:40:35.054 --> 03:40:37.676]  But I mean, this guy wrote a really interesting piece talking about
[03:40:38.536 --> 03:40:44.179]  Like he said that he was able to spend two days in this ISIS reception camp close to the Turkish border.
[03:40:44.179 --> 03:40:47.800]  He said in those two days, each day there was about 50 plus people who came through.
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:52.242]  These people came from the US, England, Sweden, Russia, France, and Germany.
[03:40:52.242 --> 03:40:55.103]  So yeah, you're going to get a lot of young kids that come out there that see this.
[03:40:55.103 --> 03:40:58.765]  It's this new trendy cool thing to be part of the caliphate, apparently.
[03:40:58.765 --> 03:41:02.627]  And those are the ones that get killed off easy because most of those guys are probably idiots.
[03:41:02.627 --> 03:41:05.228]  But you're going to have a lot of people who have lived in those areas.
[03:41:05.808 --> 03:41:12.130]  Who are, you know, hardcore against ISIS, hardcore against the Taliban, insurgents, all that.
[03:41:12.130 --> 03:41:13.911]  And then all of a sudden they started getting bombed.
[03:41:13.911 --> 03:41:15.171]  And they're sitting there going, you know what?
[03:41:15.171 --> 03:41:15.791]  Screw this.
[03:41:15.791 --> 03:41:18.712]  I'm going to join these guys because at least I have a fighting chance.
[03:41:18.712 --> 03:41:19.553]  We already know the U.S.
[03:41:19.553 --> 03:41:20.733]  is giving them weapons.
[03:41:20.733 --> 03:41:26.375]  I'm going to have better weapons than the forces here in Iraq or the forces in Syria to fight against them.
[03:41:26.375 --> 03:41:27.835]  These guys are outnumbered.
[03:41:27.835 --> 03:41:30.236]  I mean, they've got more people.
[03:41:30.236 --> 03:41:31.316]  They're seizing oil fields.
[03:41:31.316 --> 03:41:32.537]  They're taking over airstrips.
[03:41:33.738 --> 03:41:36.841]  It seems like an attractive scenario.
[03:41:36.841 --> 03:41:46.931]  So what's your take on ISIS claiming it can smuggle devices through Nigeria and Mexico and nuclear weapons and saying that it could, you know, eventually bring them to the United States and start blasting them off?
[03:41:46.931 --> 03:41:49.133]  I mean, that's extremely possible.
[03:41:49.133 --> 03:41:51.215]  I mean, there's so many
[03:41:52.290 --> 03:41:55.212]  Canals and tunnels from the Mexico to U.S.
[03:41:55.212 --> 03:41:55.492]  side.
[03:41:55.492 --> 03:41:57.693]  That's what the cartels use to smuggle this stuff.
[03:41:57.693 --> 03:42:07.620]  And anyone who thinks that a group like ISIS doesn't have the money to pay off a cartel just to let them look the other way or to help them get them through a tunnel, they're out of their mind.
[03:42:07.620 --> 03:42:10.862]  I've walked across the border dressed as an ISIS jihadi.
[03:42:10.862 --> 03:42:13.563]  I've walked across dressed in civilian attire.
[03:42:13.563 --> 03:42:14.244]  It's wide open.
[03:42:15.004 --> 03:42:17.446]  Given there are a lot of places where there's fences, but guess what?
[03:42:17.446 --> 03:42:21.368]  That video is insane, of you dressing up like Osama Bin Laden, wasn't it?
[03:42:21.368 --> 03:42:23.089]  No, no, Osama Bin Laden was James O'Keefe.
[03:42:23.089 --> 03:42:24.550]  I dressed up like the ISIS jihad with the flag.
[03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:32.855]  You dressed up like ISIS, and you had like a fake beheading, and you walked across the Mexico border, screaming and everything, and no one said anything, huh?
[03:42:32.855 --> 03:42:33.636]  No one even cared.
[03:42:33.636 --> 03:42:37.698]  Nope, no helicopters coming in, no border patrol, no ICE agents, anything like that.
[03:42:37.698 --> 03:42:38.439]  Just walked across.
[03:42:39.241 --> 03:42:45.183]  Freely, didn't get bothered, actually sat out there for a long time and filmed some other videos where I burned an ISIS flag.
[03:42:45.183 --> 03:42:51.564]  And then you saw a bunch of presumably illegal smuggling drugs in a van, right?
[03:42:51.564 --> 03:42:52.684]  And that was Laredo, Texas.
[03:42:52.684 --> 03:42:55.545]  Yeah, so I went down there the day before Trump was supposed to speak.
[03:42:55.545 --> 03:43:02.547]  And I went out to do a stand-up to talk about Trump coming in and his immigration policy, so to say, and how he wants to build this wall.
[03:43:02.547 --> 03:43:05.848]  And over my shoulder there's seven guys coming across the Rio Grande.
[03:43:06.508 --> 03:43:13.751]  With these huge satchels and this red Suburban pulls up, trunk opens up, and these guys load in the drugs, jump back across.
[03:43:13.751 --> 03:43:16.252]  At that time, the Border Patrol had just driven away.
[03:43:16.252 --> 03:43:17.452]  By the way, I said illegals.
[03:43:17.452 --> 03:43:21.533]  That, according to South Park's PC Principle, I don't know if you've seen that.
[03:43:21.533 --> 03:43:22.014]  Oh yes.
[03:43:22.014 --> 03:43:25.135]  The great episode where it breaks down political correctness.
[03:43:25.135 --> 03:43:30.957]  I actually should not have said illegals, I should have said undocumented citizens, is what I should have said.
[03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:35.174]  And I apologize for that, I was not politically correct in that statement.
[03:43:35.174 --> 03:43:39.358]  And you can't say businessman or businesswoman because that singles out folksman.
[03:43:39.358 --> 03:43:51.390]  So you have to say spokesperson or businessperson because we live in a PC world now, just like the kid who had the confederate flag on his backpack and was kicked out because, it's offensive, let's lock the school down.
[03:43:51.890 --> 03:43:54.653]  So I guess you've seen that episode and I've seen the Trump episode too.
[03:43:54.653 --> 03:43:55.113]  Yes.
[03:43:55.113 --> 03:43:56.634]  I think the creators of that show are geniuses.
[03:43:56.634 --> 03:43:57.555]  Oh yeah.
[03:43:57.555 --> 03:44:05.161]  And basically PC Principal comes in, politically correct principal, and Cartman has said spokesman or something like that and PC Principal just beats him.
[03:44:05.161 --> 03:44:08.684]  It's actually inappropriate but a great episode.
[03:44:08.684 --> 03:44:13.548]  And then Kyle makes fun of Bruce Jenner and that's the reason he gets four days of attention.
[03:44:14.028 --> 03:44:16.773]  Because he didn't say Caitlyn Jenner was a hero.
[03:44:16.773 --> 03:44:18.495]  He didn't say Caitlyn Jenner was a hero.
[03:44:18.495 --> 03:44:20.498]  And because he said Bruce too as well.
[03:44:20.498 --> 03:44:20.879]  Absolutely.
[03:44:20.879 --> 03:44:27.109]  Because Bruce is homophobic, transphobic, misogynist, sexist.
[03:44:27.109 --> 03:44:28.972]  The Caitlyn Jenner formerly known as Bruce.
[03:44:29.492 --> 03:44:29.992]  Yeah.
[03:44:29.992 --> 03:44:32.094]  She should take a line from Prince.
[03:44:32.094 --> 03:44:41.258]  And it's funny because they're sitting down and they've got all the fathers in South Park and they're sitting there like, yeah, Caitlyn Jenner's a hero.
[03:44:41.258 --> 03:44:42.799]  Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.
[03:44:42.799 --> 03:44:44.540]  Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.
[03:44:44.540 --> 03:44:46.982]  Alright guys, I'm doing a live Facebook mentions.
[03:44:46.982 --> 03:44:47.962]  Oh look at that, it's Alex.
[03:44:47.962 --> 03:44:48.642]  He comes on in.
[03:44:48.642 --> 03:44:50.383]  He's doing Facebook mentions live.
[03:44:50.383 --> 03:44:51.304]  Hey everybody.
[03:44:51.304 --> 03:44:51.904]  Hello.
[03:44:51.904 --> 03:44:53.585]  Did I tell you guys I was coming in here?
[03:44:53.585 --> 03:44:54.646]  No.
[03:44:54.646 --> 03:44:57.948]  I saw what you were covering when I was in my office because I've got a TV on.
[03:44:58.908 --> 03:45:00.851]  Doing the fourth hour and I got mad at myself.
[03:45:00.851 --> 03:45:03.534]  This is something I preach at you guys all day about.
[03:45:03.534 --> 03:45:07.118]  But I tell you, when I preach at you, it's about me, too.
[03:45:07.118 --> 03:45:09.241]  I'm preaching to myself.
[03:45:09.241 --> 03:45:10.743]  We get this learned helplessness.
[03:45:10.743 --> 03:45:12.665]  We get this learned normalcy bias.
[03:45:13.706 --> 03:45:21.274]  Where we're around this news, this information so long, so intensely, that we get to where huge news doesn't even affect us.
[03:45:21.274 --> 03:45:24.937]  Like DARPA admitting this week, yeah, we put brain chips in people.
[03:45:24.937 --> 03:45:25.738]  Well, we've known that.
[03:45:25.738 --> 03:45:27.039]  You've heard the rumors.
[03:45:27.039 --> 03:45:28.040]  People called us kooks.
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:30.062]  Now it's confirmed.
[03:45:30.062 --> 03:45:33.586]  Or them coming out and admitting, okay, endocrine disruptors are causing massive cancer.
[03:45:33.586 --> 03:45:34.367]  That was in the news today.
[03:45:35.791 --> 03:45:42.133]  The fact that they're saying Armageddon, Holocaust, what was the other word Obama used?
[03:45:42.133 --> 03:45:44.673]  What was the word Obama used in his speech?
[03:45:44.673 --> 03:45:45.213]  Armageddon.
[03:45:45.213 --> 03:45:45.894]  Apocalyptic.
[03:45:45.894 --> 03:45:47.554]  Apocalyptic, that was it, apocalyptic.
[03:45:47.554 --> 03:45:50.115]  And now they're saying ISIS may have nuclear weapons.
[03:45:50.115 --> 03:45:52.395]  Now they're saying ISIS may have dirty bombs.
[03:45:52.395 --> 03:45:57.616]  Our criminal hijacked government, not our general government, but the people at the top, created this group on record.
[03:45:57.616 --> 03:45:59.617]  We now have the former head of defense intelligence, the general.
[03:46:01.038 --> 03:46:03.679]  Going public, all of this is happening.
[03:46:03.679 --> 03:46:06.600]  Oh, and of course you guys are on air, I should be talking into the mic, excuse me.
[03:46:06.600 --> 03:46:16.823]  The point is, is that I'm in there watching them, and like, there's Biggs and Gucciardi, because I'll let you guys pick whatever topic you want, covering what I should have been covering for three hours today.
[03:46:17.963 --> 03:46:26.809]  And it's the fact that American Jihad's top ISIS commander, Yazidi slave, reveals that she was beaten and held captive by a U.S.
[03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:31.413]  citizen who directs attacks and keeps a vial of poison to kill himself if caught.
[03:46:31.413 --> 03:46:33.954]  But the point is, they've allowed a major infiltration.
[03:46:33.954 --> 03:46:36.836]  They said six months ago the immigrant wave would be about that.
[03:46:36.836 --> 03:46:41.780]  Here they are openly saying they're getting ready to nuke us, and I'm not even making a big deal out of this.
[03:46:41.980 --> 03:46:43.961]  I'm not saying nukes are coming.
[03:46:43.961 --> 03:46:52.543]  I'm saying the globalists are fully able to let a group do something like this or do it and blame it on them to bring in martial law and all the preparations we've seen.
[03:46:52.543 --> 03:46:59.565]  ISIS nuclear weapons terrorist group plans to kill hundreds of millions in largest religious cleansing in history says report.
[03:46:59.565 --> 03:47:00.505]  And what's crazy is
[03:47:01.225 --> 03:47:06.449]  Everything ISIS keeps saying they're going to do, a hundred times bigger than Al Qaeda, literally, they're doing.
[03:47:06.449 --> 03:47:09.251]  They said six months ago, we're going to invade Europe in immigrant waves.
[03:47:09.251 --> 03:47:09.831]  It happened.
[03:47:09.831 --> 03:47:11.152]  They said we're going to attack Russia.
[03:47:11.152 --> 03:47:11.733]  It happened.
[03:47:11.733 --> 03:47:12.753]  We're going to attack France.
[03:47:12.753 --> 03:47:13.374]  It happened.
[03:47:13.374 --> 03:47:14.314]  We're going to attack America.
[03:47:14.314 --> 03:47:14.915]  It happened.
[03:47:14.915 --> 03:47:16.696]  So this isn't synthetic terror.
[03:47:16.696 --> 03:47:23.401]  These are real jihad groups funded and protected and nested in a nursery by the criminals that run our government.
[03:47:23.401 --> 03:47:25.662]  So I want to ask, what's their master plan?
[03:47:25.662 --> 03:47:27.264]  And you know, Facebook mentions this supposedly.
[03:47:28.404 --> 03:47:29.864]  A deal just about your own personal life.
[03:47:29.864 --> 03:47:31.645]  Well, it is my personal life, dammit.
[03:47:31.645 --> 03:47:33.585]  I've got three children.
[03:47:33.585 --> 03:47:35.146]  I don't want them getting hit with a nuke.
[03:47:35.146 --> 03:47:36.866]  I'm in a major target, all these military bases.
[03:47:36.866 --> 03:47:38.406]  You're in a major target here in Austin.
[03:47:38.406 --> 03:47:40.007]  Guarantee Austin's a major target.
[03:47:40.007 --> 03:47:44.147]  Probably about number three or four after DC, New York, or LA.
[03:47:44.147 --> 03:47:51.109]  And the globalists have absolutely set this group up, hundreds of thousands of operatives, left the borders open to let them infiltrate.
[03:47:51.994 --> 03:47:55.635]  We're getting contacted, in fact I forgot to tell you that, by high-level people.
[03:47:55.635 --> 03:48:01.176]  That's one reason they have the feds watching us, the bad feds, is they know a lot of good feds are aware of what's happening and have been exposing what's going on.
[03:48:01.176 --> 03:48:03.617]  This is a crazy time to be alive right now.
[03:48:03.617 --> 03:48:12.419]  I'm gonna go and finish a briefing for Facebook Mentions, folks, and the people can find this feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show with Joe Biggs and Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:48:12.419 --> 03:48:13.819]  I'm gonna throw it back to you, but I just
[03:48:14.199 --> 03:48:19.084]  Normally we'd run around and say, see I'm mad at myself, or you didn't cover something big, or why aren't we covering this?
[03:48:19.084 --> 03:48:21.266]  So I'll bitch at them, or I'll bitch at myself.
[03:48:21.266 --> 03:48:23.849]  I dropped the ball today, barely mentioning this.
[03:48:23.849 --> 03:48:25.450]  We can't drop the ball on this.
[03:48:25.450 --> 03:48:27.332]  We have to expose what's happening.
[03:48:27.332 --> 03:48:31.316]  Even Breitbart's reporting they're letting Syrian refugees come into the U.S.
[03:48:31.316 --> 03:48:32.337]  illegally out of Mexico.
[03:48:32.857 --> 03:48:35.500]  So that's gone from being a conspiracy theory to confirmed.
[03:48:35.500 --> 03:48:36.661]  Back to the live transmission.
[03:48:36.661 --> 03:48:37.582]  Great job, guys.
[03:48:37.582 --> 03:48:39.825]  Anything you want to say, Anthony Gucciardi, to the viewers?
[03:48:39.825 --> 03:48:40.966]  Well, I think it's really simple.
[03:48:40.966 --> 03:48:44.250]  Things are so insane that we forget the realistic grasp of where we are.
[03:48:44.250 --> 03:48:51.938]  I mean, when we have ISIS saying they're going to kill millions of people or hundreds of millions of people in a religious cleansing, that sounds so insane you don't even process it in your brain.
[03:48:51.938 --> 03:48:53.159]  And our government won't fight them.
[03:48:53.159 --> 03:48:53.840]  It makes no sense.
[03:48:54.741 --> 03:49:02.427]  Well, months ago they made fun of me for going into an opera Mexico to look for these bases the Judicial Watch reported on.
[03:49:02.427 --> 03:49:06.971]  The FBI even came out and said that that's a credible source of information, that that's very possible.
[03:49:06.971 --> 03:49:15.358]  They don't have the jurisdiction to go into Mexico and actually look, so they were counting on someone like me who could go in freely and look around and give them some intel.
[03:49:15.358 --> 03:49:16.999]  They're not even going to do it.
[03:49:17.299 --> 03:49:21.221]  And everyone's coming out saying it's possible, that you can come across the border, it's wide open.
[03:49:21.221 --> 03:49:24.443]  But you have the Democrats saying, oh, the border's fine, let everybody across.
[03:49:24.443 --> 03:49:25.703]  No, there is a serious problem.
[03:49:25.703 --> 03:49:28.905]  You're arresting people in Germany that criticize it.
[03:49:28.905 --> 03:49:29.485]  Yeah.
[03:49:29.485 --> 03:49:42.872]  And now you've got Facebook, you've got Zuckerberg, Merkel all sitting there saying, hey, yeah, we're going to start monitoring Facebook to make sure that people aren't saying anything that could be seen as racist against these migrants coming across because, you know, we don't need that.
[03:49:42.872 --> 03:49:43.512]  That's ridiculous.
[03:49:43.512 --> 03:49:45.693]  Political correctness is not a suicide pact.
[03:49:46.393 --> 03:49:51.976]  People don't believe this because in their daily lives nothing is being directly impacting them, so it's a cognitive dissonance of sorts.
[03:49:51.976 --> 03:49:55.018]  Like we're here freaking out, freaking out about this because we look at the news and read it.
[03:49:55.018 --> 03:50:00.961]  International Business Times, we have more International Business Times, CNN over there.
[03:50:00.961 --> 03:50:04.363]  All this stuff is real and being reported on and we're actually looking at it, reading it.
[03:50:04.363 --> 03:50:09.506]  The average person isn't, so they're not freaking out and they see people freaking out and they just don't get it because it's pure cognitive dissonance.
[03:50:10.199 --> 03:50:13.982]  And I mean, it literally says in there, ISIS has more capabilities than we think.
[03:50:13.982 --> 03:50:18.005]  This guy, this western journalist... Saudi Arabia's got nukes, it may be giving it to them.
[03:50:18.005 --> 03:50:19.646]  Saudi Arabia's going crazy right now.
[03:50:19.646 --> 03:50:20.787]  I mean, there's a million things.
[03:50:20.787 --> 03:50:24.950]  Meanwhile, on the Pakistan-India border, there's troops that are ready to nuke each other at any time.
[03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:26.050]  It could happen in five seconds.
[03:50:26.050 --> 03:50:29.193]  The South Korea-North Korean border, they're already firing missiles across.
[03:50:29.193 --> 03:50:31.054]  North Korea fired missiles towards South Korea.
[03:50:31.054 --> 03:50:33.356]  At any time, there could be an explosion, but people don't even think about it.
[03:50:33.356 --> 03:50:34.336]  Alright, you're going to break.
[03:50:34.336 --> 03:50:35.277]  I'm going to come finish up.
[03:50:35.277 --> 03:50:35.938]  Keep it up, guys.
[03:50:35.938 --> 03:50:36.298]  Great job.
[03:50:36.918 --> 03:50:38.960]  I was just coming in here to point out that's a big mistake.
[03:50:38.960 --> 03:50:44.965]  We will be back with more more craziness inside of the fourth hour of Overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:44.965 --> 03:50:50.630]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Joe Biggs and we're back with what's coming up later on today in the Nightly News and tomorrow on the show.
[03:51:04.901 --> 03:51:06.944]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:06.944 --> 03:51:08.666]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:08.666 --> 03:51:10.147]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.147 --> 03:51:12.070]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:13.632]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.632 --> 03:51:15.494]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:15.494 --> 03:51:17.236]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.236 --> 03:51:18.297]  Extendovite?
[03:51:18.297 --> 03:51:19.178]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:20.017 --> 03:51:21.378]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:21.378 --> 03:51:25.199]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.199 --> 03:51:25.840]  Herbal?
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:27.360]  How can that help?
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:31.942]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:31.942 --> 03:51:34.543]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:34.543 --> 03:51:38.125]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:38.425 --> 03:51:40.187]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:40.187 --> 03:51:41.348]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:41.348 --> 03:51:42.590]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:43.411]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.411 --> 03:51:45.813]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[03:51:58.745 --> 03:52:03.007]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:52:03.007 --> 03:52:07.248]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:52:07.248 --> 03:52:14.431]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:52:14.611 --> 03:52:25.276]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:52:25.276 --> 03:52:28.758]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:52:28.758 --> 03:52:29.878]  What do you have to lose?
[03:52:29.878 --> 03:52:38.162]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:52:38.322 --> 03:52:41.624]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:52:41.624 --> 03:52:45.766]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:52:45.766 --> 03:52:48.068]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.

[03:54:10.965 --> 03:54:12.787]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.787 --> 03:54:15.229]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:18.892]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and we're here with Joe Biggs.
[03:54:18.892 --> 03:54:25.959]  We just talked about some pretty insane news and Alex popped in while doing a live stream on his Facebook Mentions, which he's on Facebook.
[03:54:25.959 --> 03:54:29.121]  You can follow him, follow myself as well on my page.
[03:54:29.121 --> 03:54:34.366]  And he has something called Facebook Mentions, which is where you can live stream and it's a really cool function.
[03:54:34.366 --> 03:54:35.007]  You should check it out.
[03:54:35.507 --> 03:54:42.672]  Anyway, so we were talking about ISIS and their plan to use nuclear weapons to religiously cleanse millions and millions of people.
[03:54:42.672 --> 03:54:45.955]  And Joe just mentioned a new story came out and he wanted to highlight that.
[03:54:45.955 --> 03:54:46.736]  What's going on?
[03:54:46.736 --> 03:54:49.898]  Alright, so there's a new article out at Infowars.com by Mikhail Thelin.
[03:54:49.898 --> 03:54:53.321]  Obama gave over 1,500 terrorist asylum in U.S.
[03:54:53.321 --> 03:54:54.802]  documents revealed.
[03:54:54.802 --> 03:55:00.206]  Now documents obtained by Judicial Watch revealed that the Obama administration gave as many as 1,519 terrorist asylum in the U.S.
[03:55:00.206 --> 03:55:00.286]  in 2014.
[03:55:03.548 --> 03:55:07.753]  Now, according to the government watchdog, the administration let that many people in.
[03:55:07.753 --> 03:55:15.923]  Before the Obama administration tweaked the federal law last year, these four nationals would have been banned from the country for supporting terrorist causes, judicial watch rights.
[03:55:15.923 --> 03:55:21.529]  But under the changes, the Security of Homeland Security has discretionary authority to waive certain grounds.
[03:55:22.430 --> 03:55:25.592]  Of that, and to let people come in and stay and have asylum.
[03:55:25.592 --> 03:55:27.332]  So this fits in right with what we're talking about.
[03:55:27.332 --> 03:55:36.237]  The borders are open, and not only are the borders open, now we have the government allowing these terrorists to come in and gain asylum.
[03:55:36.237 --> 03:55:51.444]  And one of the things inside this book I'm reading by Jurgen Todenhofer, where he's talking about inside the IS, he says he thinks the greatest threat would be people who are already in the other countries, not the ones mainly in Syria and Iraq, but the ones who have already dispersed and are already in the US.
[03:55:52.024 --> 03:55:52.585]  We're good.
[03:56:14.125 --> 03:56:20.711]  This has reached a point of insanity where I believe our simple human brains can't understand it anymore.
[03:56:20.711 --> 03:56:21.311]  I mean, think about it.
[03:56:21.311 --> 03:56:30.219]  For thousands of years, not only have we not had the news hitting us with daily updates and the craziness of the world, we've really only had to focus on a small tribe.
[03:56:30.859 --> 03:56:35.920]  A tribe that has its own inner politics and infighting and kind of stupid stuff like that.
[03:56:35.920 --> 03:56:39.261]  But we've never had to think about, like, what's going on in Afghanistan?
[03:56:39.261 --> 03:56:40.381]  What's going on in Iraq?
[03:56:40.381 --> 03:56:42.222]  What's going on in the India-Pakistan border?
[03:56:42.222 --> 03:56:43.782]  What's going on in North-South Korea?
[03:56:43.782 --> 03:56:47.523]  What's going on in Texas, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Oklahoma?
[03:56:47.523 --> 03:56:52.264]  Just everywhere around the world, all the geolocations all converging onto one point.
[03:56:52.264 --> 03:56:59.446]  And there's so many different hot zones of all these things that we would have never been able to understand or know about before that our human brain is thinking,
[03:57:00.106 --> 03:57:01.987]  Gee, how do I possibly understand this?
[03:57:01.987 --> 03:57:04.648]  How do I understand ISIS taking nukes to kill hundreds of people?
[03:57:04.648 --> 03:57:06.209]  Well, most Americans are spoiled.
[03:57:06.209 --> 03:57:06.790]  You gotta think.
[03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:16.615]  Most Americans daily struggle in life is their coffee machine breaking or online or cyber bullying or, you know, someone fat shaming or something like that.
[03:57:16.615 --> 03:57:23.358]  We've got petty things like this feminism stuff and all these other little things that we create so we have something to bitch about and complain.
[03:57:23.358 --> 03:57:26.240]  These people live every day in guerrilla warfare.
[03:57:27.060 --> 03:57:38.226]  And at the same time, they're getting their doctorates and becoming physicists and chemists and things like that, while their homes are being bombed, while their families are being kidnapped, murdered, raped, beaten, tortured every day.
[03:57:38.226 --> 03:57:40.328]  People in America need to wake up and understand, guess what?
[03:57:40.328 --> 03:57:44.150]  There's a lot of bad things going on in this country, and you need to pull your head out of your butt.
[03:57:44.730 --> 03:57:52.973]  Because your daily struggle of trying to get a coffee and coming to work on time or your Volvo or your new set of rims on your car is BS.
[03:57:52.973 --> 03:57:53.853]  Who cares?
[03:57:53.853 --> 03:58:02.276]  There are people out there who have to fight every day, literally, and at the same time have to fight to wake up to get to school, to get a degree, to do something.
[03:58:02.276 --> 03:58:06.937]  So when we go over and do stuff like that, we're not fighting, you know, people who have no idea what's going on in the world.
[03:58:06.937 --> 03:58:09.798]  They have to deal with this every day and get an education.
[03:58:09.878 --> 03:58:10.899]  You've seen it firsthand.
[03:58:10.899 --> 03:58:12.019]  Very inspirational message.
[03:58:12.019 --> 03:58:13.100]  All our problems are relative.
[03:58:13.100 --> 03:58:15.161]  We really need to put it into perspective.
[03:58:15.161 --> 03:58:16.081]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:58:16.081 --> 03:58:19.563]  Thanks for watching the Alex Jones Show fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:58:19.563 --> 03:58:23.265]  Paul Watson is gonna host the show tomorrow and he's got some really exciting stuff.
[03:58:23.265 --> 03:58:27.327]  He wasn't able to join us in this live segment, but check it out tomorrow 11 a.m.
