[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:27.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  It is 2013.
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  We are here, at least on the Gregorian calendar.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  The Chinese New Year, I guess, starts in about a month.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  It'll be the fitting year of the snake.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  Year of the New World Order.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  And I guess the Age of Aquarius has kicked off as well.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  The Illuminati believes that they are about to ascend to power.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  Whether you believe in that or not, they believe in it.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  And that is why they are moving on every single front.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are live here.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  And we are going to be here for the next three hours on this New Year's Day.
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  The globalists are not just gonna try to strangle the Second Amendment.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Using the deaths of the poor children at Sandy Hook.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  They are going to annihilate publicly the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  And basically have a political orgy in the blood.
[01:27.000 --> 01:28.000]  And here is one of the headlines.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  Democrats crank up death panel talk following Obama win.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  That's a curtain, MOMfallwars.com headline.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Here's the actual slate headline by a George Soros operative.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  The case for death panels.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  Remember the headline in, what was it, Newsweek?
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  The case for killing Granny.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  While they, but that was after Obamacare passed.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  Before they said, conspiracy theory, we would never.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  That is preposterous.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  Wayne LaPierre comes out and says, we need to arm the school teachers like Israel.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  That stopped their mass shootings in schools.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  That's ridiculous.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  Israel doesn't have any guns.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  Guns are outlawed there.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  Talking to you like you've got a 55 IQ.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  And you know what, it works on people.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  Because the average person isn't even so much stupid as they're incredibly coddling and
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000]  lazy.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  And just get into, the hype, the soap opera, the cover of People Magazine, the dead children,
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  tuning in and lighting candles.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  But if you go, hey, they're killing kids with drones.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  Hey, thousands die a year from the inoculations in the US alone.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  Tens of thousands of kids per Asian country get paralyzed with a polio shot.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  Shut up, extremist.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  It doesn't exist.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  See if there's any inkling of responsibility for jellyfish people, they say it doesn't
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  exist.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  But if it's like the big mainstream media, time to get sad, time to get upset, time to
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  do something, let's do something right now.
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.500]  And so you've got the domesticated mass literally sucking their Prozac thumbs, sitting on their
[03:13.500 --> 03:16.600]  Prozac thumbs, looking at us.
[03:16.600 --> 03:20.920]  The people that at least know that we're in deep trouble and the society's in a very decadent
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.920]  downward spiral.
[03:21.920 --> 03:27.600]  And they're looking at us going, men with guns, go get their guns, they shouldn't have
[03:27.600 --> 03:28.600]  them.
[03:28.600 --> 03:31.600]  I'm scared of them with guns, but I like your black uniform.
[03:31.600 --> 03:38.000]  I like it, I like checkpoints, it makes me feel safe.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.680]  Hey, did you know government killed 260 plus million people?
[03:41.680 --> 03:47.560]  Measuring university studies like University of Hawaii?
[03:47.560 --> 03:54.400]  Whatever conspiracy there is, there's no death panels, but there are.
[03:54.400 --> 03:56.400]  So here it is, the case for death panels.
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.620]  There's a bunch of articles outgoing, you wanna fix the economy, kill old people.
[04:01.620 --> 04:08.160]  And so I wanna after a special guest, remember Susanna Hupp, who was one of the Luby's Massacre
[04:08.160 --> 04:10.520]  Survivors, former state rep after that.
[04:10.520 --> 04:14.760]  Old talk show host on our local affiliate 590 AM, and she's gonna be popping in later
[04:14.760 --> 04:16.840]  in the second hour of about 15, 20 minutes.
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.400]  Remember she testified to Congress, she said, we have our guns to protect us from you, they're
[04:21.400 --> 04:23.280]  not for duck hunting.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.320]  So yeah, that's the lady, she's gonna be joining us, a fellow Texan.
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.360]  But other than that, we're gonna have open phones today and I'm going to wait till later
[04:32.360 --> 04:38.040]  in the broadcast to get into agenda 21 and what it really means, how it means eugenics,
[04:38.040 --> 04:41.040]  how it means death panels.
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.880]  So that is all coming up today.
[04:45.880 --> 04:50.560]  And they're also declaring war on the Constitution, calling it evil.
[04:50.560 --> 04:56.080]  The Obama noise are so like a case of hemorrhoids, the Obama noise will be right back or worse
[04:56.080 --> 05:01.200]  than hemorrhoids, I actually.
[05:01.200 --> 05:05.880]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[05:05.880 --> 05:07.920]  immunity and health.
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.520]  With silver lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.680]  silver based products.
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.040]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.760]  ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.780]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[05:29.780 --> 05:34.400]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[05:34.400 --> 05:36.280]  leave the silver at the surface.
[05:36.280 --> 05:41.200]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[05:41.200 --> 05:46.440]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[05:46.440 --> 05:48.120]  effectively.

[06:01.840 --> 06:06.440]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[06:06.440 --> 06:07.440]  storm.
[06:07.440 --> 06:11.680]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[06:11.680 --> 06:16.560]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[06:16.560 --> 06:19.840]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[06:19.840 --> 06:24.120]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do
[06:24.120 --> 06:25.120]  the same.
[06:25.120 --> 06:27.800]  It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.
[06:27.800 --> 06:31.400]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[06:31.400 --> 06:35.800]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.840]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with
[06:39.840 --> 06:43.360]  a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[06:43.360 --> 06:50.120]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you, call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com
[06:50.120 --> 06:51.120]  forward slash Alex.
[06:51.120 --> 06:55.720]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[06:55.720 --> 07:02.720]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[07:25.720 --> 07:31.040]  E Foods can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity,
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.360]  purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[07:34.360 --> 07:37.520]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.120]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[07:42.120 --> 07:44.560]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.560]  It's what my family uses.
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.840]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code
[07:50.840 --> 07:55.240]  water at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[07:55.240 --> 08:05.760]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[08:05.760 --> 08:11.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:11.800 --> 08:20.240]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:20.240 --> 08:21.800]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:21.800 --> 08:22.800]  We are live.
[08:22.800 --> 08:30.680]  It is the first day of January, 2013.
[08:30.680 --> 08:38.400]  In the Chinese zodiac, the year of the snake kicks off on the 23rd, a fitting title.
[08:38.400 --> 08:42.280]  And for the globalist, it is to tyranny and beyond.
[08:42.280 --> 08:45.760]  You know, Buzz Lightyear says to infinity and beyond.
[08:45.760 --> 08:52.320]  For the globalist, tyranny is just the beginning of their absolute takeover and re-engineering
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.600]  of what's left of humanity in an ultimate act of complete domination.
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.960]  And the globalist in all their publications brag how they have generationally worked to
[09:01.960 --> 09:09.160]  take over much of the planet so that they can fully, irrevocably, savage humanity and
[09:09.160 --> 09:12.020]  reduce the population down to almost nothing.
[09:12.020 --> 09:17.220]  Show that they can take full control of human development and basically use those of us
[09:17.220 --> 09:23.400]  that are left as playthings or as test subjects for life extension technologies and other
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.960]  systems.
[09:25.960 --> 09:34.080]  And that is what we face in 2013 is the velvet glove being taken off of the iron fist.
[09:34.080 --> 09:40.440]  I had a caller yesterday who asked me, why do you sound so irritated sometimes when you
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.740]  are taking phone calls?
[09:43.740 --> 09:49.040]  And it's because of a lot of things, because sometimes I hear the rebroadcast and I sound
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.920]  friendly and nice and answer the questions and I'm congenial.
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.200]  Other times I hear rebroadcast occasionally when I can stomach listening to myself.
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.120]  And I sound pained, I sound rude.
[10:05.120 --> 10:13.840]  And it's really because I am exhausted at many core levels, but also energized at core
[10:13.840 --> 10:15.120]  levels.
[10:15.120 --> 10:21.280]  So I've got a big heart for the fight against the globalist, but physically, especially
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.720]  I don't get enough sleep or don't eat enough, or I get overly angry at the globalist.
[10:26.720 --> 10:34.800]  I tend to kind of overheat like a race car engine and well, explode.
[10:34.800 --> 10:38.240]  And so that's the answer to the fellow's question as I thought about that last night.
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.200]  And I've had this as a resolution many times because back when I was first on talk radio
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.040]  17 years ago, I was pretty much a call driven show.
[10:49.040 --> 10:55.280]  I would do a two, three hour radio show every day and 80% of it was phone calls because
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.800]  I enjoyed the phone calls.
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.240]  Now I've always got so many things on my mind and so much news that I'm frustrated that
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.200]  I'm not getting to all the news that I've researched and wanna cover.
[11:07.200 --> 11:14.240]  I'm frustrated because of the spoken words limitations to describe fully what an article
[11:14.240 --> 11:16.720]  or a piece of news signifies.
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.000]  And I'm frustrated that I wanna take a lot of your calls, but that I then tend to not
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  go to your calls.
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.760]  And when I do, they're complex questions or complex issues.
[11:27.760 --> 11:37.740]  And I basically throw little mini temper tantrums because it's almost like an interrogation.
[11:37.740 --> 11:39.600]  I love going out and meeting listeners.
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.040]  I love going out and doing events, but at the same time, I hate it because it's very
[11:43.040 --> 11:44.040]  exhausting.
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.720]  If I go out and talk to a couple thousand people after an event and shake hands for
[11:47.720 --> 11:54.020]  three hours and listen to their questions and listen to their comments, it's draining.
[11:54.020 --> 11:59.800]  Because I actually listen to you, I actually gauge you, I actually read you as a person.
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.560]  And that's very tiring.
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.840]  And it's the same thing with all this news.
[12:06.840 --> 12:09.800]  I mean, I researched news last night, I researched it this morning.
[12:09.800 --> 12:15.200]  I have stacks over 100 articles here I wanna get into, huge piles of video clips I wanna
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.300]  analyze.
[12:18.300 --> 12:23.120]  But each article, when I pick up one of these articles or I pick up one of these quotes,
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.800]  I have to summon the data in my mind associated with that information.
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.600]  And so that itself is a frustrating event.
[12:36.600 --> 12:45.800]  And I mean, just thinking about it right now is making me nauseated.
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.620]  I'm not like running on the air, happy I've got a clip of Dianne Feinstein saying her
[12:50.620 --> 12:54.840]  goal is to disarm the general population, quote, Mr. And Mrs. America.
[12:54.840 --> 13:00.080]  I already knew that was her goal and read her quotes over the years, but it's painful
[13:00.080 --> 13:02.240]  to look at, it's painful.
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.280]  And then it's painful to try to put all the evidence on display for you.
[13:08.280 --> 13:10.920]  But enough about that, I'm gonna give the number out here and I don't want people to
[13:10.920 --> 13:15.040]  call in and go, we appreciate you, you're great.
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.240]  That's not why I'm whining about this on air.
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.800]  I'm telling you about this so you'll understand where I come from, so you can put up with
[13:21.800 --> 13:22.800]  me.
[13:22.800 --> 13:26.600]  Some of you that get irritated by hearing the irritation of my voice, it's not with
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.860]  you.
[13:28.860 --> 13:34.420]  It's with that I know I'm right, I know that I understand the enemy.
[13:34.420 --> 13:37.900]  The enemy is so arrogant, they brag about their plans everywhere.
[13:37.900 --> 13:40.560]  And I am fundamentally upset.
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.860]  I'm upset with the globalist, I'm upset with the general public being weak minded.
[13:44.860 --> 13:50.600]  I'm upset with myself not being able to fully articulate what I know and understand.
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.240]  Because if you knew what I knew, if you could see what I see, our troubles would be over
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.780]  very, very quickly.
[13:58.780 --> 14:04.920]  But then I realized the general public is literally being swallowed by fraud.
[14:04.920 --> 14:12.400]  The alternative media, as bad as it is, because at least it's real and it's human.
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.420]  When the globalists try to inject cognitive infiltration that Cass Sunstein talked about
[14:18.420 --> 14:22.700]  at the White House in to create infighting and kind of a background noise to nullify
[14:22.700 --> 14:23.700]  us.
[14:23.700 --> 14:28.580]  But it still isn't working because there's an over driving human survival instinct that
[14:28.580 --> 14:38.900]  still beats in the most unconscious of people.
[14:38.900 --> 14:45.420]  But my goal is to really try to awaken humanity and to try to reverse our course.
[14:45.420 --> 14:48.980]  Because the course we're headed on is oblivion.
[14:48.980 --> 14:58.660]  It is anathema to everything good and wholesome.
[14:58.660 --> 15:02.820]  People say, why does evil always get in control throughout time?
[15:02.820 --> 15:07.900]  Because it has the desire for the power.
[15:07.900 --> 15:14.340]  And I study the scientific crafting of the system where they roll out certain technologies
[15:14.340 --> 15:15.940]  and certain systems.
[15:15.940 --> 15:24.020]  And then we beg and clamor and pay for them as status symbols when they are tools of control.
[15:24.020 --> 15:34.380]  But then to even reach in to the matrix, proto-matrix system that the general public has already
[15:34.380 --> 15:39.660]  fallen to, you must use the tools of the enemy.
[15:39.660 --> 15:44.980]  I am not against technology, but again to use a Lord of the Rings analogy because that
[15:44.980 --> 15:49.660]  seems to get through to people.
[15:49.660 --> 15:56.100]  Rings are made for all the races in Middle Earth, for the elves, for the dwarves, for
[15:56.100 --> 15:59.140]  the men.
[15:59.140 --> 16:09.260]  The rings are made by the older creations of the entity, the god that created the universe.
[16:09.260 --> 16:15.300]  So it basically has kind of a Christian timeline in Tolkien's writings.
[16:15.300 --> 16:19.820]  If you get deeper into it, it's an analogy, an allegory.
[16:19.820 --> 16:24.300]  And the rings are forged, and the nine rings are given to men, and a certain amount are
[16:24.300 --> 16:25.900]  given to the elves and the dwarves.
[16:25.900 --> 16:34.980]  And they have incredible power in them inherently, and it's given to them by an angelic creature.
[16:34.980 --> 16:47.420]  But the angelic creature has decided to become destructive, Lucifer, Morgoth against Mordor.
[16:47.420 --> 16:54.220]  And Morgoth falls and is reincarnated as Sauron, but the point is that the rings are given
[16:54.220 --> 16:58.500]  and you take the rings, you take the cell phone, you take the smart meter.
[16:58.500 --> 17:01.940]  You go into the gym and they go, discount if you thumbprint to sign up.
[17:01.940 --> 17:06.900]  And you do it all Pavlovianly set up like a chicken pecking a tic-tac-toe machine to
[17:06.900 --> 17:09.640]  get grain.
[17:09.640 --> 17:16.140]  And it is a system of total control designed to get you into an electronic straitjacket
[17:16.140 --> 17:21.060]  to cut off self-sufficiency, to shut down the family farms, to make you dependent, to
[17:21.060 --> 17:27.420]  bring you into model compact 2021 cities that are advertised again as cool and fun.
[17:27.420 --> 17:34.220]  To then have a controlled bioweapon attacks that are released as people go into more authoritarian
[17:34.220 --> 17:38.760]  control in the name of avoiding the biological warfare attacks that they claim terrorists
[17:38.760 --> 17:42.140]  are going to launch.
[17:42.140 --> 17:48.360]  As we sit there huddled in our compact cities, watching the general third world population
[17:48.360 --> 17:54.860]  wiped out in the future, you need to understand that it is the globalist orchestrating all
[17:54.860 --> 17:55.860]  of this.
[17:55.860 --> 18:01.340]  And anything they give you, anything we use, anything in our culture that has been rolled
[18:01.340 --> 18:10.460]  out and promoted by the system is a ring of power.
[18:10.460 --> 18:15.060]  You guys print me the intro to the Lord of the Rings book.
[18:15.060 --> 18:19.740]  It's one ring to bind them in the darkness, bind them.
[18:19.740 --> 18:22.360]  I want that full quote when we come back if we can.
[18:22.360 --> 18:26.360]  One ring to rule them all, because that's really what it is.
[18:26.360 --> 18:29.040]  And in the darkness bind them.
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.700]  We are fighting adherence of death and destruction and ugliness.
[18:33.700 --> 18:37.260]  It is what they resonate with, it is what they will create.
[18:37.260 --> 18:42.420]  And it's in their globalist literature, it's in everything they say, everything they do.
[18:42.420 --> 18:47.160]  And so later I'm gonna get into that, I'm gonna get into top professors demonizing the
[18:47.160 --> 18:50.920]  Constitution and calling it evil and saying get rid of it.
[18:50.920 --> 18:55.340]  They're openly saying yes, kill the old people now, all over the news.
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.940]  You see, they're not just gonna go after the guns.
[18:57.940 --> 19:03.180]  The fact that they're going after them and saying openly we want you to turn them in
[19:03.180 --> 19:10.380]  is the signal that the real third act has begun.
[19:10.380 --> 19:15.140]  And if you look at the arrogance and the fire in the enemy's eyes right now, they're on
[19:15.140 --> 19:16.940]  the march.
[19:16.940 --> 19:21.300]  They have decided to drop the hammer and I can tell you, along with that will be false
[19:21.300 --> 19:26.160]  flag stage terror attacks blamed on us.
[19:26.160 --> 19:28.880]  So you're thinking they'll never get away with this.
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.060]  They're going to attack themselves and blame it on us.
[19:33.060 --> 19:36.980]  A great time of evil is upon us, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:36.980 --> 19:39.440]  And you better decide which side you're on.
[19:39.440 --> 19:42.900]  My New Year's resolution is when I give the number out, I'm gonna take the calls.
[19:42.900 --> 19:46.600]  And if I don't get to them, we're gonna wipe the phones out till I do go to calls.
[19:46.600 --> 19:53.580]  We're gonna take your calls on any issue you wanna discuss straight ahead, 800-259-9231.
[19:53.580 --> 20:02.020]  It is January 1st, 2013, that'll take some getting used to, 800-259-9231.
[20:02.020 --> 20:06.860]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[20:06.860 --> 20:07.860]  storm.
[20:07.860 --> 20:11.700]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[20:11.700 --> 20:16.500]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[20:16.500 --> 20:19.740]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[20:19.740 --> 20:23.940]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do
[20:23.940 --> 20:24.940]  the same.
[20:24.940 --> 20:27.540]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[20:27.540 --> 20:31.060]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[20:31.060 --> 20:35.420]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[22:29.540 --> 22:31.100]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:31.100 --> 22:34.820]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[22:34.820 --> 22:35.820]  IRAs?
[22:35.820 --> 22:39.900]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[22:39.900 --> 22:41.580]  of gold for your retirement.
[22:41.580 --> 22:44.980]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[22:44.980 --> 22:50.060]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[22:50.060 --> 22:55.740]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[22:58.860 --> 23:00.900]  Hi there.
[23:00.900 --> 23:01.900]  My name is Frank Bates.
[23:01.900 --> 23:06.180]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[23:06.180 --> 23:12.420]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[23:12.420 --> 23:17.180]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that
[23:17.180 --> 23:22.260]  are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[23:22.260 --> 23:24.380]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[23:24.380 --> 23:29.100]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[23:29.100 --> 23:30.180]  goes.
[23:30.180 --> 23:35.820]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[23:35.820 --> 23:38.260]  and how you can beat them too.
[23:38.260 --> 23:41.980]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[23:41.980 --> 23:43.700]  in the last three months.
[23:43.700 --> 23:49.100]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[23:49.100 --> 23:50.220]  your home.
[23:50.220 --> 23:56.100]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[23:56.100 --> 23:57.660]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[23:57.660 --> 24:04.260]  It began with the forging of the great rings.
[24:04.260 --> 24:11.820]  Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
[24:11.820 --> 24:19.260]  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[24:19.260 --> 24:28.820]  And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire power.
[24:28.820 --> 24:35.580]  For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[24:35.580 --> 24:41.940]  But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.
[24:41.940 --> 24:48.960]  In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret
[24:48.960 --> 24:56.940]  a master ring to control all others, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice
[24:56.940 --> 25:02.300]  and his will to dominate all life.
[25:02.300 --> 25:09.060]  One ring to rule them all.
[25:09.060 --> 25:17.500]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[25:17.500 --> 25:25.220]  It is the first day of 2013, I've been a lot of soul searching and I want to commit to
[25:25.220 --> 25:30.380]  you in this year that I'm going to put out the greatest output of information and of
[25:30.380 --> 25:34.020]  the highest quality that we have ever produced.
[25:34.020 --> 25:39.460]  I am going to make a new official film this year, I've not announced that yet, I will
[25:39.460 --> 25:40.460]  on Friday.
[25:40.460 --> 25:46.420]  I meant to do it a few weeks ago but got behind, announced the biggest contest we've ever done.
[25:46.420 --> 25:52.860]  It'll be $100,000 contest and it is key to our Paul Revere operation, that's what I intend
[25:52.860 --> 25:56.100]  to call it, Operation Paul Revere.
[25:56.100 --> 26:04.260]  We are going to launch the TV show onto the satellites and I am going to create informational
[26:04.260 --> 26:10.580]  videos on certain key subjects explaining how things work.
[26:10.580 --> 26:17.360]  Only keys to unlocking the secrets of the New World Order and how to defeat them.
[26:17.360 --> 26:23.620]  Because I do understand their operations, I understand all of their operations.
[26:23.620 --> 26:28.340]  It does not mean that I could consciously at one time grasp the entire compendium of
[26:28.340 --> 26:29.340]  their system.
[26:29.340 --> 26:34.300]  But if I focus on particular sub sectors of it, I can see right down to the bone on what
[26:34.300 --> 26:35.760]  they're doing.
[26:35.760 --> 26:42.140]  Because they've published their operational manuals and only thinly veil and compartmentalize
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.380]  their true goals.
[26:43.380 --> 26:47.140]  In fact, in many cases they openly brag.
[26:47.140 --> 26:52.800]  Also many of the servants of total evil are very twisted and weak people.
[26:52.800 --> 27:00.060]  And they almost reflexively in the control systems are used to dealing with the zombified
[27:00.060 --> 27:02.200]  public that is in a trance state.
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.500]  So those of us that are in different degrees of awakening, it's like watching people in
[27:07.500 --> 27:09.620]  slow motion.
[27:09.620 --> 27:15.560]  And so don't ever forget how much power you've really got if by the grace of God, your consciousness
[27:15.560 --> 27:17.540]  has not been shuttered.
[27:17.540 --> 27:25.060]  Again, my friends, it is Tuesday, the first day of January 2013.
[27:25.060 --> 27:31.100]  We come back from break, I will go to your phone calls at 800-25-99231.
[27:31.100 --> 27:32.100]  And just be ready.
[27:32.100 --> 27:36.000]  I've said this over and over again, but it's my New Year's resolution.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.780]  To make your point, I'm gonna try to go to the next person.
[27:37.780 --> 27:42.220]  It's just sometimes the calls are so incredible or they're breaking such amazing news.
[27:42.220 --> 27:47.120]  Like the caller yesterday going, yeah, they've got hidden cameras in the VA in the smoke
[27:47.120 --> 27:49.060]  detectors in Tampa.
[27:49.060 --> 27:51.580]  And we search engine it, and there it is in the Tampa newspaper.
[27:51.580 --> 27:54.420]  And they're like, we're allowed to secretly watch you.
[27:54.420 --> 27:59.700]  Well, yeah, I mean, they got cameras in the bathrooms at public schools for 15 years.
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.740]  Government issued laptops, watch you at home.
[28:01.740 --> 28:06.140]  I mean, it's just all over the top.
[28:06.140 --> 28:09.300]  And that's just what you know about.
[28:09.300 --> 28:14.260]  I mean, I don't just get up here and say almost every vaccine they look at has cancer viruses
[28:14.260 --> 28:15.940]  in it on purpose.
[28:15.940 --> 28:18.940]  I've got the top scientist bragging.
[28:18.940 --> 28:23.820]  I've played the video clips of the polio developer going, yeah, we knew we gave 100 million Americans
[28:23.820 --> 28:28.780]  the first round cancer viruses and it's killed tens of millions and they laugh about it on
[28:28.780 --> 28:29.780]  PBS.
[28:29.780 --> 28:34.860]  On the PBS station in Boston, I mean, when you get these globalists together like on
[28:34.860 --> 28:39.260]  TED TV, Bill Gates gets up there and goes, we're gonna reduce the carbon output.
[28:39.260 --> 28:43.820]  That means reduce this down to zero and he puts an image of stick figures of a family
[28:43.820 --> 28:49.860]  up there and the TED TV conference elitist all laugh.
[28:49.860 --> 28:53.020]  They're not liberals, they're killers.
[28:53.020 --> 28:56.220]  You don't get in the club unless you go, yeah, I see the public as animals.
[28:56.220 --> 28:57.220]  I wanna kill them.
[28:57.220 --> 29:02.300]  They go, good, you're part of the team, you have the will to be cold blooded and understand
[29:02.300 --> 29:04.420]  survival of the fittest.
[29:04.420 --> 29:07.580]  Know what you are is going to be used and destroyed.
[29:07.580 --> 29:16.300]  I will assure you, I will assure all of you that you will be destroyed.
[29:16.300 --> 29:22.580]  You will not get a seat at this table, you understand that?
[29:22.580 --> 29:26.340]  One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.380]  darkness bind them.
[29:27.380 --> 29:33.860]  Is that not the technocratic surveillance smart grid tracking everything we do?
[29:33.860 --> 29:38.660]  One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the
[29:38.660 --> 29:43.540]  darkness bind them for taxation and control.
[29:43.540 --> 29:46.100]  They also kill you with the wireless systems as well.
[29:46.100 --> 29:49.940]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[29:49.940 --> 29:51.220]  We're on the march.
[29:51.220 --> 29:53.620]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.620 --> 30:00.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.940 --> 30:04.920]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.
[30:04.920 --> 30:06.300]  Don't be one of them.
[30:06.300 --> 30:11.420]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial
[30:11.420 --> 30:12.420]  solution.
[30:12.420 --> 30:15.800]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[30:15.800 --> 30:20.820]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning and help improve wound

[32:01.620 --> 32:06.100]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[32:06.100 --> 32:07.100]  storm.
[32:07.100 --> 32:11.440]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[32:11.440 --> 32:16.340]  in agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[32:16.340 --> 32:19.620]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[32:19.620 --> 32:23.900]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct and I recommend you do
[32:23.900 --> 32:24.900]  the same.
[32:24.900 --> 32:27.540]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[32:27.540 --> 32:31.140]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[32:31.140 --> 32:35.540]  I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[32:35.540 --> 32:39.580]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with

[32:58.020 --> 33:02.020]  forward slash Alex.
[33:02.020 --> 33:17.740]  You've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[33:17.740 --> 33:26.900]  Coming up, defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.900 --> 33:30.460]  That's right, coming up, the defense of the republic.
[33:30.460 --> 33:33.860]  Okay, I'm gonna go directly to your calls.
[33:33.860 --> 33:37.740]  And then Rick Perry has signed an order that's got no attention to bring in the Trans Texas
[33:37.740 --> 33:43.500]  Napa Superhighway even though our state representatives have voted it down twice.
[33:43.500 --> 33:50.100]  What Mordor wants, Mordor gets until the public awakens.
[33:50.100 --> 33:55.460]  And we have top Georgetown professors, advisors to Obama, saying the Constitution is just
[33:55.460 --> 33:56.820]  a criminal document.
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.580]  Those are some of the quotes.
[33:58.580 --> 34:00.240]  We're gonna be going over all that.
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.540]  They're openly announcing all over the place that we need to kill all people, get rid of
[34:04.540 --> 34:05.540]  them.
[34:05.540 --> 34:11.700]  I'm gonna explain to you how the collectivist model works, and there is no doubt that collectivism
[34:11.700 --> 34:12.700]  is a nightmare.
[34:12.700 --> 34:16.980]  It sounds good, it'll make you feel good up front at the beginning like the first time
[34:16.980 --> 34:27.020]  you inject heroin, but it leads to absolute ruination and domestication and dehumanization.
[34:27.020 --> 34:31.180]  But it's like the ring of power, people believe because they're good, they could have a big
[34:31.180 --> 34:33.860]  government that would redistribute wealth.
[34:33.860 --> 34:38.680]  My friends, the globalists that have set up collectivism and that run the world economy
[34:38.680 --> 34:46.140]  are absolutely cold-blooded, exterminist, ultra-Hitlerian eugenicist.
[34:46.140 --> 34:53.300]  And anything they do with taxes will be turned towards bad in the end.
[34:53.300 --> 34:57.740]  And we told you that once they got health care in, they would start the death panels
[34:57.740 --> 35:00.180]  because they've done it in dozens of other countries.
[35:00.180 --> 35:01.940]  They follow a program.
[35:01.940 --> 35:08.020]  We can look at scores of nations further down the line than we are.
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.020]  It's a blueprint.
[35:09.020 --> 35:13.280]  It's like a movie we've already seen over and over again, and that's what's so frustrating.
[35:13.280 --> 35:15.740]  They teach the general public that everything is your opinion.
[35:15.740 --> 35:18.940]  No, this is not my opinion.
[35:18.940 --> 35:23.220]  This is not my opinion.
[35:23.220 --> 35:28.100]  If you walk out on the top of a 50-story building without a parachute, and you jump off that
[35:28.100 --> 35:35.740]  thing and swan dive towards the concrete below, you are going to die.
[35:35.740 --> 35:39.020]  That is not my opinion.
[35:39.020 --> 35:45.500]  And if you let the globalists execute their plan, it's like steps downwards into hell.
[35:45.500 --> 35:51.380]  We know where each step goes, just like a detailed road map.
[35:51.380 --> 35:53.460]  There is no debate.
[35:53.460 --> 36:00.380]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[36:00.380 --> 36:02.820]  Justin in Missouri, you're on the air.
[36:02.820 --> 36:03.820]  Welcome.
[36:03.820 --> 36:05.900]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[36:05.900 --> 36:10.740]  I just wanted to ask you what you think they're going to sneak into that fiscal negotiation
[36:10.740 --> 36:12.540]  regarding the Second Amendment.
[36:12.540 --> 36:14.700]  Oh, that's a good point.
[36:14.700 --> 36:18.380]  They can have the government shut down, the welfare checks, or credits not be put on the
[36:18.380 --> 36:19.380]  cards.
[36:19.380 --> 36:27.500]  And then Feinstein, who is key on the committee to be able to control what bills can go in
[36:27.500 --> 36:34.180]  and out or what agreements, they're saying that her bill, she's the one that wrote it
[36:34.180 --> 36:38.580]  and got it rammed through with Biden in 1993, they're saying it's her bill.
[36:38.580 --> 36:44.620]  I mean, she's the person that Obama's going to hand the ball to, she's the running back.
[36:44.620 --> 36:51.340]  And they're running the play to try to engage in 100-yard drive against us, and they intend
[36:51.340 --> 36:52.340]  to do it.
[36:52.340 --> 36:56.100]  And again, the fiscal clip has been done in Iceland, everywhere else, we said this was
[36:56.100 --> 36:57.100]  coming.
[36:57.100 --> 37:00.340]  They say, my gosh, we're holding up the budget, everything will collapse, the street lights
[37:00.340 --> 37:02.420]  won't be on, the police won't get paid.
[37:02.420 --> 37:07.820]  It's all over, we'll lose our credit rating if we don't raise taxes and increase the national
[37:07.820 --> 37:08.820]  debt.
[37:08.820 --> 37:14.100]  And this is all maneuvering us into abject collapse, which is what a group of loan-sharking
[37:14.100 --> 37:18.420]  foreign banks who are loaning us our own money back would do.
[37:18.420 --> 37:24.880]  So it is rack and ruin, it is a direct course, and that's why I got so angry on the hike
[37:24.880 --> 37:25.880]  and bike trail.
[37:25.880 --> 37:34.060]  I had to start wearing earplugs or something last Friday because I'm sitting there, or
[37:34.060 --> 37:37.200]  was it Saturday, and I've run to the top of a hill and I'm stretching.
[37:37.200 --> 37:41.660]  And I hear these three guys who were obviously in state government cuz I could hear how they
[37:41.660 --> 37:43.380]  were talking, and they were manager level.
[37:43.380 --> 37:48.540]  They all thought they were really smart, their whole bearing, and they were just bragging
[37:48.540 --> 37:52.500]  that, don't worry, Obama knows how to deal with them.
[37:52.500 --> 38:00.100]  Boehner's on the team, once the third comes, he'll be elected to leadership and then he
[38:00.100 --> 38:07.220]  can do whatever he wants, Boehner can, and the economy isn't gonna go down.
[38:07.220 --> 38:12.020]  They actually believe Obama's their buddy, and they're supporting it, and they're trying
[38:12.020 --> 38:19.020]  to fix things, I mean, the government puts cancer viruses in shots and tries to get you
[38:19.020 --> 38:24.380]  to take them, you dumb idiot, they wanna kill you.
[38:24.380 --> 38:29.140]  And I just looked at the guys, and I turned on the charisma, not on purpose, a much more
[38:29.140 --> 38:31.180]  charismatic in person.
[38:31.180 --> 38:35.180]  And I just literally said, well, I mean, I already talked about it on air, I broke it
[38:35.180 --> 38:39.700]  down and at the end, those guys were shaking, and they should be cuz they just heard truth.
[38:39.700 --> 38:44.380]  And they went, yeah, like Greece, yeah, yeah, you're right, I was like, well, do something
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.380]  about it.
[38:45.380 --> 38:50.500]  I told them, I said, you know the truth, see, you just knew the truth, but you were up here
[38:50.500 --> 38:55.540]  having what you thought was a politically correct discussion, like children in dress
[38:55.540 --> 39:00.540]  up pretending they're the lone ranger in Tonto.
[39:00.540 --> 39:08.060]  You're a real human alive in 2013, this was 2012, there's a real war going on, wake up
[39:08.060 --> 39:11.700]  and get involved in it now, stop living a fantasy land.
[39:11.700 --> 39:13.700]  I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[39:13.700 --> 39:21.020]  Yeah, I thought it was gonna be another, gotta read it to see what's in it, like the health
[39:21.020 --> 39:22.020]  care bill.
[39:22.020 --> 39:25.940]  And it wouldn't shock me at all if they try to completely go after the Second Amendment
[39:25.940 --> 39:27.980]  in little sneaky ways in there.
[39:27.980 --> 39:31.820]  No, God bless you, sir, I appreciate your call.
[39:31.820 --> 39:39.700]  First caller of 2013, my friend, Chet in New York, Chet, you're on the air, welcome.
[39:39.700 --> 39:41.940]  Happy New Year's, Alex and Bunch.
[39:41.940 --> 39:46.780]  Hey, yeah, I'm up here in the new Rome, actually, now it was New York, but now that we have
[39:46.780 --> 39:54.740]  Emperor Cuomo involved with his new degree of gun confiscation, which he's right in line
[39:54.740 --> 39:57.180]  with Diane Frankenstein there.
[39:57.180 --> 40:02.940]  Yeah, he said he may issue a gubernatorial executive order and just have you hand them
[40:02.940 --> 40:03.940]  in.
[40:03.940 --> 40:04.940]  How's that sound?
[40:04.940 --> 40:08.540]  Shocking, the thing is, I think the rest of the country, they look at New York like that
[40:08.540 --> 40:11.820]  liberal part, New York City, Manhattan, you've been around there.
[40:11.820 --> 40:14.980]  A lot of nice people, but it's the politics.
[40:14.980 --> 40:21.500]  New York's got a lot of rural areas, hunters, etc., and people have been massing arms all
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.500]  over the country.
[40:22.500 --> 40:27.140]  No, I know, listen, upstate New York and rural areas of New York, I've been there many times,
[40:27.140 --> 40:35.340]  I know the culture absolutely is about as country boy can survive as Alabama or East
[40:35.340 --> 40:39.820]  Texas or same thing with Northern California.
[40:39.820 --> 40:43.500]  Anywhere where people actually live in the countryside, in the real world and actually
[40:43.500 --> 40:46.980]  work, they understand that you need guns to protect yourself.
[40:46.980 --> 40:53.860]  And we've got all the people in the city who are domesticated, who are delusional and really
[40:53.860 --> 40:56.540]  think the government's their friend.
[40:56.540 --> 41:01.500]  I agree 100%, like you said, I think you guys hit the point before where nobody's calling
[41:01.500 --> 41:07.700]  for violence on our end, but it looks like they're really pushing their little, I think
[41:07.700 --> 41:11.780]  their explosion button on themselves because there's a lot of people that are just not
[41:11.780 --> 41:14.580]  going to give their guns up because I've spoke with them.
[41:14.580 --> 41:19.540]  So I just figured I'd throw it at you, my friend, and hey, great work you're doing.
[41:19.540 --> 41:23.740]  A lot of other people get in on this New Year's, but I'm staying optimistic because there's
[41:23.740 --> 41:24.740]  so many of us now.
[41:24.740 --> 41:32.980]  I appreciate your call, my friend, look, I'll just say this, everybody needs to be involved
[41:32.980 --> 41:47.340]  in a maximum effort now to engage government and collaborator globalist occupation medium.
[41:47.340 --> 41:52.860]  And let them know, hey, we know you're authoritarian criminals that want to disarm us.
[41:52.860 --> 41:57.340]  You don't call up and say, hey, you know, guns actually protect people 80 plus times
[41:57.340 --> 42:00.500]  more often than they're using the commission of a crime.
[42:00.500 --> 42:06.300]  Hey, areas that have more guns have lower crime, hey, England's crime rate tripled,
[42:06.300 --> 42:10.140]  I kept saying doubled, it tripled, and is the highest in Europe since they took the
[42:10.140 --> 42:12.060]  guns 15, 16 years ago.
[42:12.060 --> 42:17.780]  Same thing with Australia and New Zealand, they know that, they're predators.
[42:17.780 --> 42:21.060]  All those media people getting paid millions of dollars a year have bodyguards, they lived
[42:21.060 --> 42:23.940]  in armed areas, their kids go to schools with armed guards.
[42:23.940 --> 42:28.860]  They know, they sit around and talk about how you're dumb and how you're scum.
[42:28.860 --> 42:33.180]  They can't even contain it on MSNBC, anyone that lives in the Southwest, anyone that lives
[42:33.180 --> 42:39.860]  in the South, Midwest, that's like 80% of the country, you are scum, you are filth.
[42:39.860 --> 42:44.860]  If you're a white person, they say you're dumb, you're ugly, you're scum, you're stupid.
[42:44.860 --> 42:47.620]  And that if you don't accept socialism, you're a racist.
[42:47.620 --> 42:51.380]  It is a total delusional elitist attitude.
[42:51.380 --> 42:59.420]  I've been behind the scenes at CNN, you name it, over the years, and these are cold blooded
[42:59.420 --> 43:04.900]  mercenaries, these are mercs.
[43:04.900 --> 43:11.880]  And their uniform is a camouflage of non-threatening hippieism, folks, they're not hippies, they
[43:11.880 --> 43:19.140]  are shock troops, stormtroopers, the army of death, okay?
[43:19.140 --> 43:24.380]  And they learned, as Margaret Sanger under the advisement of Eber Bernays and the Rockefeller
[43:24.380 --> 43:32.540]  Foundation, go read their quotes, to pose as non-threatening egalitarian philanthropist.
[43:32.540 --> 43:37.140]  They have the moral high ground, they care, well, there's no death panels, really the
[43:37.140 --> 43:38.220]  bill has it.
[43:38.220 --> 43:44.140]  The books written by Daschle that wrote it says it, wrote those provisions, no, no, no,
[43:44.140 --> 43:45.140]  that's not in the book.
[43:45.140 --> 43:48.060]  Don't listen to him knowing no one's gonna go read it and find out we're telling the
[43:48.060 --> 43:49.060]  truth.
[43:49.060 --> 43:51.620]  That the Israelis don't own guns, don't listen to him.
[43:51.620 --> 43:52.620]  There's no world government.
[43:52.620 --> 43:56.180]  Well, I have hundreds of announcements out of the Bilderberg and Davos of world government,
[43:56.180 --> 44:02.060]  world taxes, those don't exist, children, children, they talk, and they go, we talk
[44:02.060 --> 44:03.820]  with a soft NPR voice.
[44:03.820 --> 44:08.820]  You ever tune into NPR and every person on there?
[44:08.820 --> 44:13.260]  I was one time being interviewed by NPR and they said, can you talk softer?
[44:13.260 --> 44:14.260]  Can you settle down?
[44:14.260 --> 44:20.420]  During the interview, they taped it down at UT, that's down there where their local studios
[44:20.420 --> 44:24.020]  are, this is like 13 years ago or something.
[44:24.020 --> 44:27.540]  And they're coming over the ISDN line going, sir, can you try to talk in a softer voice?
[44:27.540 --> 44:28.540]  I wasn't even yelling.
[44:28.540 --> 44:29.860]  I go, well, this is what my voice sounds like.
[44:29.860 --> 44:32.600]  They're like, well, can you just sound softer?
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.020]  And the woman was on the line going, can you relax, relax?
[44:38.020 --> 44:43.500]  You know, I grew up around rural folks, many months out of the year being sent down to
[44:43.500 --> 44:46.360]  work on the ranch from the time I was about 11 on.
[44:46.360 --> 44:53.180]  And I've talked to people that deal with horses and what you deal when a horse gets old is
[44:53.180 --> 45:00.180]  you do have a trailer come pick it up to take it to the Elmer's Glue factory.
[45:00.180 --> 45:04.300]  And I was never there when they sold horses or got rid of them.
[45:04.300 --> 45:11.460]  But you sit there and the trailer pulls up and you walk over and you, because horses
[45:11.460 --> 45:12.460]  are real smart.
[45:12.460 --> 45:14.900]  They're just real instinctive, that's when people think they're stupid.
[45:14.900 --> 45:17.900]  No, they're real smart, but their instincts are really strong.
[45:17.900 --> 45:20.700]  So it's like they have a mind, but they can't use it.
[45:20.700 --> 45:25.020]  And they know, you may have loaded that horse in a trailer 10 times in that year, but you're
[45:25.020 --> 45:28.260]  loading them in a trailer to go butcher them.
[45:28.260 --> 45:30.260]  You're not gonna wanna get in the trailer.
[45:30.260 --> 45:36.020]  And you just come over and you shh, shh, shh, here's some range cubes, here's some apple.
[45:36.020 --> 45:44.500]  Come on, come on, let's get in the trailer, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, hi, this is NPR.
[45:44.500 --> 45:49.620]  Just get in the trailer, hey, little girl, hey, little boy, come get in the van, I got
[45:49.620 --> 45:50.620]  candy.
[45:50.620 --> 45:57.820]  Hi, little, I got a puppy, I got candy, I got some free healthcare for you.
[45:57.820 --> 46:03.260]  I'm gonna give you some more welfare, I got an Obama phone, get in the car, we got some
[46:03.260 --> 46:05.380]  shots for you, it's something you don't get sick.
[46:05.380 --> 46:10.820]  Come on, come on, get in the car, get in the van, yeah, but my mommy says don't, it's all
[46:10.820 --> 46:11.820]  right.
[46:11.820 --> 46:19.780]  Mommy's in the van, mommy's in the van, your government, it's nice, come on.
[46:19.780 --> 46:24.060]  We wouldn't stage Sandy Hook, no, no, get on in the van.
[46:24.060 --> 46:28.620]  Get on in, get on in, sweetie.
[46:28.620 --> 46:37.580]  Van door slams, eat the candy, well, I want my mommy, it's okay, eat the candy.
[46:37.580 --> 46:41.780]  And then the tape comes out around the head, and then they tie you up, tie the three year
[46:41.780 --> 46:46.720]  old up, yes, that's how it works.
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.620]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alice in Kansas, Alice, you're on the air, should I talk in
[46:51.620 --> 46:57.500]  an NPR voice, hi, Alice, good to have you on with us on All Things Considered, welcome.
[46:57.500 --> 47:02.860]  Hi, Alex, I've been listening to you for 15 years and I feel your exhaustion and your
[47:02.860 --> 47:08.540]  pain, I understand where you're coming from, and I just felt a leading of the Holy Spirit
[47:08.540 --> 47:11.620]  to give you something that might comfort you, it should take less than two minutes.
[47:11.620 --> 47:16.940]  There are five points, I just want you to maybe listen and consider in your prayer time.
[47:16.940 --> 47:22.900]  I wanted to tell you that you are a warrior of the Lord, He has chosen you, and in the
[47:22.900 --> 47:27.460]  end, you answer only to the Lord, it doesn't matter what any man thinks of you.
[47:27.460 --> 47:33.700]  Number two, you are the teacher, listeners are the students, it is a privilege for the
[47:33.700 --> 47:40.020]  student to come to your class, you give it out, and the wind blows where it will.
[47:40.020 --> 47:45.820]  They either get it or they don't, you have fulfilled your vow and responsibility to God,
[47:45.820 --> 47:48.220]  and that's who you answer to, period.
[47:48.220 --> 47:53.860]  Number three, you don't just justify yourself to any man anymore, if they don't like your
[47:53.860 --> 47:59.540]  class, they can leave it and turn it off, they can address the issues, but they cannot
[47:59.540 --> 48:07.420]  attack your character as soon as they attempt to assault you, that ends the call, no exceptions,
[48:07.420 --> 48:11.460]  and do not address it further, just go to the next call like you would if someone was
[48:11.460 --> 48:13.940]  using foul language, I'm nervous.
[48:13.940 --> 48:18.780]  Let me just add this, ma'am, your kind words, I think we're all teaching each other, life
[48:18.780 --> 48:28.020]  is a great college, and I have asked God, my prayer is, God, I'm weak, I'm evil, I'm
[48:28.020 --> 48:32.940]  a sinner, please help me be a good person, and in these desperate times, please use me
[48:32.940 --> 48:38.660]  to be a vessel to stand against people that wanna hurt innocents, I'm weak, will you please
[48:38.660 --> 48:41.500]  give me the strength to do what has to be done?
[48:41.500 --> 48:49.540]  That's my prayer, and that's what I stand for, and that's basically all I can do, and
[48:49.540 --> 48:53.500]  I think that's all anybody else can do, but my great calling, God's letter on my heart,
[48:53.500 --> 48:58.260]  is to get other people to stand up and be leaders as well, and I know there are people
[48:58.260 --> 49:05.180]  out there listening who feel the calling to stand against evil, but you're so humble,
[49:05.180 --> 49:09.500]  you're like, well, I'm not a leader, and I think what you're saying to me is I am a leader,
[49:09.500 --> 49:14.100]  I need to stop being not so much humble, humble's good, but not let that get in the way of standing
[49:14.100 --> 49:19.260]  up and really resisting, and I say that to others, we have a job to do, and it doesn't
[49:19.260 --> 49:25.300]  mean we're gonna do it perfect, we just gotta ask God, help us do the right thing, and then
[49:25.300 --> 49:29.540]  let God sort it out, we've gotta give it to God, but that doesn't mean just give it to
[49:29.540 --> 49:34.780]  God and then do nothing, it means God, lead me, and I'm telling you, folks, if you ask
[49:34.780 --> 49:39.100]  God for discernment, and if you ask God to open the universe up to you, it will happen.
[49:39.100 --> 49:45.420]  Now, I wanna warn people, though, when the universe really opens up, it is mind-blowing,
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.740]  and it only intensifies, do you see my point?
[49:47.740 --> 49:52.220]  Yes, I see your point, I have two more things to say.
[49:52.220 --> 49:53.220]  Go ahead.
[49:53.220 --> 49:59.180]  Okay, the fourth one is be aware of the wiles of the devil, Satan comes but to rob, kill,
[49:59.180 --> 50:03.780]  and destroy, and every time you allow a caller to assault your character, you waste the next
[50:03.780 --> 50:08.980]  20 minutes of valuable air time that God gave you, explaining your righteousness, it gets
[50:08.980 --> 50:14.100]  you all upset, it makes you physically ill, and it hurts your body, it exhausts you, what
[50:14.100 --> 50:20.380]  a great weapon he uses against you, and he uses it frequently, so draw your sword, put
[50:20.380 --> 50:26.420]  up your shield, and allow it no further, and then your peace will come back to you.
[50:26.420 --> 50:31.580]  Number five, don't allow the pressures, I mean, don't allow the praises of men, men
[50:31.580 --> 50:37.640]  betray but God will never betray, it too is a weapon of warfare and used against you,
[50:37.640 --> 50:41.260]  if you will let it, it can alter your ego, ego may the praise of God be with you.
[50:41.260 --> 50:45.980]  I agree, Allison, I'm out of time, great call, God bless you, and this new year's resolution
[50:45.980 --> 50:55.660]  to take more calls and to work harder is the way to go, what's the saying, duty is a mountain,
[50:55.660 --> 51:00.900]  death is a feather, we'll be back with more of your calls, stay with us.
[51:00.900 --> 51:05.540]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[51:05.540 --> 51:09.900]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[51:09.900 --> 51:14.540]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[51:14.540 --> 51:20.160]  you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[51:20.160 --> 51:21.240]  is coming.
[51:21.240 --> 51:25.540]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[51:25.540 --> 51:29.580]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[51:29.580 --> 51:33.900]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands
[51:33.900 --> 51:36.580]  of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[51:36.580 --> 51:41.340]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[51:41.340 --> 51:45.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[51:45.300 --> 51:46.660]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[53:57.660 --> 53:58.660]  Yeah, I've been watching.
[53:58.660 --> 53:59.660]  I've been waiting.
[53:59.660 --> 54:00.660]  Welcome back.
[54:00.660 --> 54:01.660]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[54:01.660 --> 54:25.060]  What is that, 9 to noon Pacific?
[54:25.060 --> 54:26.980]  We are here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:26.980 --> 54:28.620]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[54:28.620 --> 54:33.180]  This segment and the next, then Representative Susanna Hupp is scheduled to pop in with us.
[54:33.180 --> 54:38.540]  She's the one of the survivors of the Luby Massacre, who spoke out in Congress eloquently.
[54:38.540 --> 54:39.540]  Always good to have her pop in.
[54:39.540 --> 54:41.300]  She's been on a few times over the years.
[54:41.300 --> 54:45.100]  And then at the bottom of the next hour, we'll continue with calls and news.
[54:45.100 --> 54:51.460]  After I get into a breakdown, where I need to be calm and try to go over what is 21 really
[54:51.460 --> 54:56.420]  is, not just they're gonna make you live in a 250 square foot thing and double your taxes.
[54:56.420 --> 54:57.420]  It's more than that.
[54:57.420 --> 55:00.140]  It's designed to destroy civilization.
[55:00.140 --> 55:08.140]  It was Oliver Wendell Holmes that, to paraphrase, basically said that taxes are the cost of
[55:08.140 --> 55:09.140]  civilization.
[55:09.140 --> 55:15.980]  Well, what about when your taxes are used to create a Malthusian destructive civilization?
[55:15.980 --> 55:20.900]  So we're gonna be breaking that down here today.
[55:20.900 --> 55:25.140]  The exact quote is taxes are the price we pay for civilization.
[55:25.140 --> 55:29.180]  Briefly here, ladies and gentlemen, the new Infowars magazine is out.
[55:29.180 --> 55:32.980]  It's available to buy in bulk at cost in groups of 10 up to 100.
[55:32.980 --> 55:38.020]  Big color, the size of the old Rolling Stone, full of graphics, documents, articles.
[55:38.020 --> 55:40.340]  2013, the year America dies, you can buy them in bulk.
[55:40.340 --> 55:42.220]  So I give them something like a color book, basically.
[55:42.220 --> 55:45.660]  And as print goes out, we go into print.
[55:45.660 --> 55:46.660]  Because we should be balanced.
[55:46.660 --> 55:47.880]  We shouldn't just be Internet only.
[55:47.880 --> 55:50.020]  We should have hard copies of things.
[55:50.020 --> 55:53.620]  And so I've committed that we're going to always put out hard copies of whatever we
[55:53.620 --> 55:57.140]  produce, whether it's films or you name it.
[55:57.140 --> 55:58.460]  Very important.
[55:58.460 --> 56:02.860]  And so you can get the January issue, 2013, the year America dies, question mark.
[56:02.860 --> 56:04.780]  Very powerful issue.

[56:42.500 --> 56:43.500]  Al in Delaware.
[56:43.500 --> 56:44.500]  Al, you're on the air.
[56:44.500 --> 56:45.500]  Thanks for holding.
[56:45.500 --> 56:50.500]  Hey, Alex, congratulations on making it to 2013.
[56:50.500 --> 56:51.500]  You're a trooper, my man.
[56:51.500 --> 56:53.220]  You're the son I never had.
[56:53.220 --> 56:57.940]  You are the light at the end of the tunnel, haven't talked to you in a couple of years.
[56:57.940 --> 57:02.820]  I got to tell you, you're the reason I was able to take my home from the bank.
[57:02.820 --> 57:08.380]  You're the reason that I've been able to survive this long, preparing and getting ready.
[57:08.380 --> 57:12.940]  These people are bad-eared warlocks, rabid dogs off the leash.
[57:12.940 --> 57:17.220]  No such thing as a politician, as a politician, they're plotiticians.
[57:17.220 --> 57:21.100]  Alex, you've taken me places I could have never gone elsewhere.
[57:21.100 --> 57:27.220]  I've lost all my friends, but I've got you and three little dogs and I couldn't be happier.
[57:27.220 --> 57:28.220]  Thank you.
[57:28.220 --> 57:31.900]  Well, your friends are in the matrix and wearing an Infowars t-shirt, you'll find like-minded
[57:31.900 --> 57:33.660]  people in your area.
[57:33.660 --> 57:37.540]  But yeah, folks that bought gold when we said buy it at 300 have done well.
[57:37.540 --> 57:39.860]  We've taught folks how the banks run scams.
[57:39.860 --> 57:44.940]  I've had countless people show up at events where we just told them about mineral supplementation,
[57:44.940 --> 57:49.620]  where they're literally healthy now from death's doorstep.
[57:49.620 --> 57:51.220]  And none of it is a secret.
[57:51.220 --> 57:54.420]  The globalists know all this.
[57:54.420 --> 57:56.680]  That's what's so frustrating about it all.
[57:56.680 --> 57:57.680]  But you know what?
[57:57.680 --> 57:59.260]  Liberty is the light at the end of the tunnel.
[57:59.260 --> 58:02.300]  We are just a window into liberty and freedom, my friend.
[58:02.300 --> 58:04.100]  Anything else you'd like to add here?
[58:04.100 --> 58:07.980]  Yeah, the truth is driving people crazy.
[58:07.980 --> 58:09.300]  They just can't take it.
[58:09.300 --> 58:10.300]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[58:10.300 --> 58:15.740]  They called me a drug dealer at settlement and I said, oh, no, you don't after 30 years
[58:15.740 --> 58:16.740]  of a builder.
[58:16.740 --> 58:21.500]  I got a woman and a half an hour they gave me my house right after starting the Patriot
[58:21.500 --> 58:22.500]  Act.
[58:22.500 --> 58:24.500]  And I served in the military.
[58:24.500 --> 58:30.820]  These are corrupt, dangerous, hell on wheels, nightmarish people there.
[58:30.820 --> 58:32.460]  I tell you what, stay there.
[58:32.460 --> 58:33.460]  I want to come back to you.
[58:33.460 --> 58:34.460]  You're on fire.
[58:34.460 --> 58:35.460]  You're right.
[58:35.460 --> 58:39.460]  They are rabid dog warlocks in giant hordes like locusts.
[58:39.460 --> 58:50.660]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.660 --> 58:54.260]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[58:54.260 --> 58:58.700]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[58:58.700 --> 59:04.020]  at Infowars.com and out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is
[59:04.020 --> 59:06.780]  just so chillingly convincing.
[59:06.780 --> 59:12.500]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[59:12.500 --> 59:16.060]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[59:16.060 --> 59:20.240]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[59:20.240 --> 59:24.740]  Don't forget your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[59:24.740 --> 59:27.100]  You'll also find it in infowarshop.com.
[59:27.100 --> 59:30.860]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[59:30.860 --> 59:35.540]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, you in Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[59:35.540 --> 59:38.420]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[59:38.420 --> 59:43.300]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the
[59:43.300 --> 59:45.340]  scourge that is vaccines.
[59:45.340 --> 59:53.780]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[59:53.780 --> 01:00:05.460]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.220]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.220]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.580]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:28.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:36.780]  We have former state rep and Blue Beast Massacre survivor, Susanna Hough, joining us.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.940]  And then we're gonna continue with your phone calls, but right now we're talking to Allen,
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:40.940]  Delaware.
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.940]  He was talking about how they use the Patriot Act.
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.620]  Yeah, they'll just come in and foreclose on a house that's even paid for, where they don't
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.520]  even have a note in some cases.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.300]  And they'll just say, you're a drug dealer.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.500]  I mean, the cops pull you over now and just say, we're gonna search you.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.500]  We think you're a drug dealer.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.820]  The government ships it all in, they play all sorts of crazy games.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.100]  This whole Patriot Act, the whole Homeland Security system, it was always set up and
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.980]  designed and aimed at the American people.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.420]  That's always been the case.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.740]  And now they're just gonna let you know in the next four years, it's official.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.900]  They're announcing death panels to kill old people.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.580]  They're saying the Constitution is evil and must be overthrown.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.180]  I've got articles, that's coming up.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.300]  Add any other points, Al, you needed to make.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.460]  Well, the points I want to make is that every time we turn around, the government is hijacking
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.460]  industry.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.500]  They're hijacking every last one of us now.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.980]  They have literally shanghaied the Constitution.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:42.060]  They're coming at us in such an evil, evil and just utterly egregious, I call them fleas,
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.060]  Alex.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.860]  These are felonious litigators, egregiously attacking society.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.580]  And let me tell you something, you work your whole life to build up your wealth and you
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.300]  think for one minute they're not coming to get it?
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:58.180]  You think for one minute they're not gonna addict you to some bogus financial product
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.700]  and then you're gonna build your wealth, you're gonna renovate your homes, you're gonna put
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.660]  your children through college for what?
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:10.460]  Let me tell you what it's for, it's the shackles of debt and lies and this is where we're at.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:16.020]  They've not just done this country, Alex, they've done the whole world, the entire world.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.660]  No, they follow the blueprint.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:23.660]  That's what I'm telling the domesticated people that are in this delusion that the overall
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.120]  controllers of the system are their friends.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.600]  They are totally ruthless and just like Susanna Hupp said, 15, 16 years ago to Congress that
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.380]  she owns firearms to protect herself from government.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.060]  That's what the founding fathers said, and that's what it's all about.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.060]  And everywhere they've taken the guns, the crime rate explodes, they love it.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:48.240]  This is a criminal energy, a criminal force that, I mean, look at Congress involved in
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240]  insider trading.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.580]  When they got caught, they said, well, we'll pass a law to outlaw it, which actually legalized
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.300]  it where they can just get a waiver.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.700]  I mean, it is insane what we're dealing with.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.300]  The laws they create are lies, we know our documents.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.480]  Look, we're naked, we don't have a Justice Department, Alex.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:13.260]  We don't have, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is nothing but a crow's nest.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.780]  These people are so far gone plotting their next move on you.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.860]  And everybody's walking around like, everything's gonna be fine, the economy will turn around.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.060]  And socialism's not so bad.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.020]  I just about can't take another minute.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:33.460]  No, no, they sell them, they throw America in the water and then throw the life raft
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.020]  out of socialism when it's actually a bowling ball to take you to the bottom.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.700]  When you get to the bottom, they go, here's another bowling ball.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:47.340]  And again, the truth is that people are in two camps, they're either waking up or they're
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.340]  asleep.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:54.100]  And God help us because they are demonizing gun owners, calling them Nazis, Klan members,
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.100]  baby killers, scum of the earth.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.560]  They demonize a group before they come after you and they want a purge of gun owners.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.260]  We have former representative Susanna Hupp on the line with us.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.260]  We're gonna come back from break and talk to her and play that short clip of her from
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.860]  her longer testimony that's so famous before Congress telling Chuck Schumer and others,
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.100]  hey, we don't have these guns, I'm sick of hearing about how it's for duck hunting.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:22.300]  It's to protect us from you guys up there, aka Waco and events like that and the full
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.060]  testimony we've posted up at infowars.com.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:32.700]  But I wanted to get her take on the other side about this unprecedented Diane Feinstein,
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.140]  our video, still posted at drugsreport.com on the right hand side.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.780]  This video of Diane Feinstein saying, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn in your guns.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.300]  That's a quote.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.300]  Let's get that clip ready.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.700]  I want to play that for her.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.380]  She's also a talk show host on 590, one of my affiliates, one of our 140 plus.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.060]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:05:01.620]  We'll be back.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.300]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.340]  immunity and health.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.940]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.100]  silver based products.

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.860]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:40.020]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.580]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.580]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.900]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.300]  you get sick and die?

[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.100]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.460]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.020]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.500]  It doesn't require electricity.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.820]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.980]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:42.300]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.020]  ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.020]  It's what my family uses.

[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:06.380]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.380]  storm.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:11.620]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.500]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.780]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.060]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend you do
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.060]  the same.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.740]  It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.340]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:35.740]  I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.700]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:05.620]  400-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:10.420]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.420]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.540]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:26.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.340]  Representative Susanna Grasha Hupp, former representative.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.820]  She's a survivor of the Luby's massacre, some of her family was killed.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:39.420]  She famously testified before Congress to Chuck Schumer that, hey, our guns aren't for
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.540]  duck hunting.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:44.400]  The full testimony's up at infoawards.com right now.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.100]  We just reposted it up there.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.660]  She said it's to protect us from you guys up there.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:54.180]  And I wanted to get her on the air because she was instrumental nationwide testifying
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.420]  before legislatures everywhere.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.380]  Not just the Texas legislature that she later chaired committees on to get concealed carry-in.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:06.300]  And we've seen 25, 30% or more reductions in every state that's done it.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.780]  So she'll be joining us to the bottom of the hour here in just a moment.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.140]  Here is just a short excerpt of her testimony before Congress.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.980]  The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:22.860]  And I know I'm not gonna make very many friends saying this.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:28.380]  But it's about all right, all of our right to be able to protect ourselves from all of
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.460]  you guys up there.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.420]  Man, and boy, that was what back in the mid 1990s.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.820]  And here we are in 2013.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:43.000]  Great way to kick off the new year with a champion of liberty, who I've gotta say if
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.700]  any one person got concealed carry-in, you can say what you want about it turning a right
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.820]  into a privilege.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:54.300]  The point is, is that it put guns on the street in law abiding citizens' hands and the criminals
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.420]  are keeping their heads down.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.500]  Violent crime down over 20% nationwide on average since then.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.460]  We've shown the new FBI statistics, except in areas where they've taken the guns, crime
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.460]  is up.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:10.740]  Former representative, talk show host on 590 AM, you name it, best-selling author.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.300]  Mrs. Hupp, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.700]  Hey, happy new year to you, Alex.
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.580]  Wow, I am excited.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:22.380]  What's your take on everything that's happening and the open calls now and the Feinstein bill
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.980]  to physically make you turn guns in?
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.660]  It's a scary thing, isn't it?
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:33.340]  I've talked to a lot of friends of mine who, we all trying to talk big.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:39.460]  You hear the, from my cold dead fingers comments, but the truth of the matter is, if a bunch
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:45.860]  of jack-looted thugs show up at my door and put a gun to my child's head and says, turn
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:52.260]  over all your guns or else, I'm probably going to turn over my guns.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:59.460]  So I think it's really important and I think this is why so often revolutions are mostly
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.980]  about young people and young people without extended families.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.580]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:09.340]  It's a scary world right now.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:13.260]  It certainly is, but there's 160 plus million gun owners.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.020]  If 1% fight back, that's 1.5 million soldiers.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:21.460]  I agree, most people are going to turn them in, at least in the first wave, but the tyranny
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.580]  that follows is going to result in a civil war.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:28.900]  And if you notice all the branding of Obama as the new Lincoln and how he's going to kick
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.820]  the butt of the states, it's pretty creepy.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.420]  It is, it's very frightening.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.660]  And when I talk about people turning in their guns, I think there are an awful lot of people
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:43.780]  that are going out of their way to purchase guns that don't have a track record, that
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.500]  can't be traced to them.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.940]  And those guns are going to be hidden and buried all over the place.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:54.260]  And we might be some of those people, Alex.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:58.460]  You and I are going to be the first doors that they knock on.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.460]  You're right.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.260]  We're going to make examples of people.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.340]  Why do you think, for listeners that just joined us, we have the club, Diane Feinstein
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:12.140]  and others are saying, Mr. and Mrs. America, get ready to turn your guns in.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.140]  Why do I think she's doing that?
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:19.380]  I think because she's absolutely clear that she has the backing of the president.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:26.180]  And she now has, I would say, 70% of the media firmly behind her.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.700]  I was actually sitting, getting a manicure a few days ago, and there was a lady kind
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.820]  of across from me, somebody I didn't know at all.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.420]  And she got to talking about the guns and the shooting in Connecticut.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.500]  And she turned to me and said, well, I just think we should get rid of all the guns.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.500]  What do you think?
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.940]  Of course, that was a mistake, right?
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:48.420]  No, I took it very easy on her and I didn't tell her any of my background or anything.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.860]  And I simply said, well, you know, I've thought about it.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:57.460]  But it seems to me that not one single one of these mass shootings has ever occurred
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:00.060]  where guns were allowed.
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.380]  And she stopped and she kind of blinked.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.780]  And she got up and she went and washed her hands and then came back and sat down and
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.580]  looked at me and she said, you know, I never thought about that, but you're right.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:16.300]  So I think there are an awful lot of people out there that you can't grab with statistics.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.660]  You can't grab with logic.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.340]  I think there are a lot of people out there that you have to put them in the position
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:30.340]  of being, you know, as close as you can, put them mentally in the position of being completely
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:35.460]  helpless and then ask them if they would rather have somebody with them, even if they choose
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.100]  not to have a gun, if they would rather have somebody with them that knows how to use one
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.100]  or not.
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:48.060]  You know, even if they won't defend themselves, most people are willing to defend their child.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.980]  So I do my best to talk about that sort of thing.
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:55.480]  I know it's hard for you to talk about it, but you do to save other lives.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.860]  And I've got to commend you again, as you know, people can pull up the uniform crime
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]  statistics.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.500]  Since concealed carry became ubiquitous in most states, crime rates on average around
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.500]  24 to 25%.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.960]  National, it's only about 20 because of some of the gun-free zones like Chicago and New
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960]  York.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.100]  But the Luby's massacre was a mass murder that took place October 16, 1991 in Killeen,
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.300]  Texas, United States.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:24.180]  When George Hennard crashed his pickup truck through the front window, got to ban pickup
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:30.180]  trucks, on a Luby's cafeteria and shot 50 people, killing 23, exchanged shots with responding
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.820]  officers and then hid in a bathroom and fatally shot himself.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.100]  You were there, you lost your parents.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.460]  I know it's tough to talk about, but we've now seen fathers that lost children in the
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.060]  last few shootings come out and say, don't use this to take people's guns.
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.340]  But the media tries to ignore them.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:51.740]  You as a survivor, I mean, you more than anybody have a right to lay out the record.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.980]  Can you, for people that don't know, describe what happened and what would have happened
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.980]  if you would have had a firearm?
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:05.380]  Well, to try to keep it brief for you folks, my parents and I, I was about 31 I think at
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.500]  the time, where I just dated myself.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:13.580]  My parents and I had gone to a local cafeteria and we were actually eating with the manager
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:19.340]  of the cafeteria, the place was packed, it was bosses day, it was the day after payday,
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:25.380]  middle of the day, beautiful day, and this guy drove his truck through the window, it
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.820]  was a floor-to-ceiling window, and crashed into a number of tables and came to a jerking
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.220]  halt, pretty much in the middle of the restaurant.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.420]  And of course you think it's an accident.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:42.300]  And we began to rise up to go help people they had knocked over and we heard gunshots.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:48.300]  I was on the passenger side of the vehicle and it was maybe 15 feet away from me.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:52.300]  My father and I immediately got down on the floor and put the table, turned the table
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:57.700]  up on its side in front of us, my mom was down behind us, and the shooting continued.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:03.020]  I realized this was 1991 and these mass shootings weren't occurring back then, so it wasn't
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.380]  the first thing that comes to your mind.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:08.580]  We were waiting for him to say something like, alright, everybody put your wallets up on
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:13.180]  the table, or something like that.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:18.540]  But that didn't happen, he just kept shooting, and when he worked his way around the front
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:25.300]  of the truck and he was working toward us, a full, I'm gonna say 45 seconds had passed,
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:30.020]  and I realized he was just executing people.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:35.940]  And it just, 45 seconds, Alex, 45 seconds is an eternity.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:39.780]  And I did realize that I reached for my purse that had fallen on the floor next to me.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.740]  I thought, I've got it, I've got this guy.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:49.820]  I used to carry a gun in my purse illegally because an assistant VA out of Houston that
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.340]  was a patient of mine convinced me to carry it illegally.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.700]  But I did like most people, you know, you think, eh, what are the odds, if I need a
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.900]  gun it's gonna be if I break down on a back road somewhere.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:07.020]  It sure as heck not gonna be in a crowded restaurant in the middle of the day.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:13.180]  But my gun was 100 yards away in my car where I had begun dutifully leaving it.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:19.420]  So long story short, at that point, my dad started to break free from my grip and said,
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.180]  I've gotta do something, I've gotta do something, he's gonna kill everybody in here.
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:30.860]  And he made a run at the guy, and the guy just turned and shot my father in the chest,
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.580]  again, I apologize, I'm trying to make it a short story.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.420]  No, it's important, thank you for sharing it.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.660]  The good news with that, my dad was mortally wounded, I mean, he had covered maybe half
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.340]  the distance, he was seven, eight feet from me, but he was still alive.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.620]  The good thing about that was it made the gunman change directions and he had to go
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:55.940]  off to my left instead of continuing directly toward me.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.380]  Somebody way at the back of the restaurant broke out on one of the windows back there
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.220]  and began to escape through that window.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.940]  People were able to escape that way.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.460]  We were kind of up in the front corner and couldn't get out.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.260]  When I saw what I thought was the chance, the gunman had his back turned toward me,
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.860]  I stood up, I grabbed my mother by the shirt collar, I said, come on, come on, we gotta
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.860]  run, we gotta get out of here, and my feet grew wings.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:28.100]  And to circle it back around, my mom did not follow me out, and I didn't know that until
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.380]  after, literally, I was outside of the restaurant.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.260]  She was staying with your dad, wasn't she?
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:38.020]  The police officers later told me what happened to her, they said that, and a number of them
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.180]  were patients of mine, and they took me and my family to lunch about a week later and
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.180]  told us.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:52.000]  They said that when they got into the front, they saw a woman on her knees cradling a mortally
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.660]  wounded man, and they didn't know who the gunman was.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.980]  And they saw this 30-something-year-old man walk up to her, they said, he put a gun to
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:04.580]  her head, she looked up at him, put her head down, and he pulled the trigger.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:09.620]  And they said all they had to do was fire a shot into the ceiling, and this guy rabbited
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.340]  to a back bathroom alcove area, as he said, exchanged a little gunfire with him, and then
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.620]  put a bullet in his own head.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:21.180]  My parents had just had their 47th wedding anniversary a couple of weeks prior to this,
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.380]  and it just didn't occur to me while I was running, mom, mom wasn't going anywhere
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.780]  without dad.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:35.060]  So I was really angry, Alex, I was really, I was really angry, I felt very guilty.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.980]  I was very angry, and I know people think I made this up later, but you can check that
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.580]  the newspapers from the second day, I said I was angry at my legislators, because they
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:49.580]  had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.380]  And you can say, well, Susanna, you could have missed.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.380]  Yeah, I could have.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.380]  Your gun could have jammed.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:00.380]  Well, okay, it's possible, it was a revolver, not likely, but it's possible.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:05.380]  But the one thing you can't argue with is it would have changed the odds.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:12.380]  I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is to sit there and wait for it to be your
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.380]  turn, and having no way, no means of defending yourself.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:22.380]  I can't imagine being in that position again and having my children or my grandchildren
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.380]  with me and having no way of defending them makes me physically ill.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:31.780]  Well, we now have countless cases since you went public back in 91, 92, 93, where people
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:34.980]  have at churches and everywhere else stopped gunmen.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:40.260]  Just happened down in San Antonio, it's just happened other places just since the Sandy
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.820]  Hook shooting, and the media will not cover it nationally.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.980]  And we see these countless local news videos of gunmen coming in trying to shoot people
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:54.180]  for no reason at shops and concealed carry folks that know how to use them, take them
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.180]  out.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:59.460]  And I see the gun grabbers rushing in to try to ban guns right now, because they know the
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:04.820]  gun culture and the self-defense culture is taking over society, all the top rated TV
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.820]  shows.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:13.580]  Women out buying guns, liberal women's magazines show women with guns now, not because they
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:18.100]  want guns, the liberal owners, but because they realize women have woken up.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.740]  They're losing, that's why they're launching this offensive against the Second Amendment.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.740]  Would you like to elaborate on that statement, do you agree or disagree?
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:33.500]  I agree with you, but I do think that they see an opportunity here because of the Connecticut
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.500]  shooting.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:42.740]  It's so hard for any of us to imagine that all those little children being just executed
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:47.140]  like that, it's just, you want a way-
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.820]  And they put the guilt onto us.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:55.380]  Have you ever seen such demonization of gun owners where they say, we're Klan, we're Nazis,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.340]  we helped kill those children when it was a gun free zone and the media advertising
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.780]  crazies go to schools and kill people.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.340]  If anybody has blood on their hands, it's them.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.740]  Isn't that the truth?
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:11.140]  That's something that I've advocated for for years is for teachers to be able to carry.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:15.420]  And of course, here in Texas, individual schools can make that decision.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.780]  My school does not allow the teachers to carry, but I can tell you that I know a few that
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.780]  carry anyway.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.940]  They just keep their mouth shut and do it, thank God.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:30.640]  The bad guys, I don't know why people don't get this, bad guys like that want a high body
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640]  bag count.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.380]  They're gonna go where they think they can shoot as many people as possible without anybody
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.840]  shooting back at them.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:44.180]  Nobody knows these cowards like you, no doubt your father saved your life.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.380]  Nobody knows these evil people like you, Susanna Hupp, a survivor of the Luby's Massacre, are
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.380]  with us.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:55.100]  And really, the grandmother of the concealed carry movement, no doubt, not to use the term
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.740]  grandmother like she's old, but she's the person that really started it.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.840]  Thank God and saved countless lives.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.940]  Why do these cowards always commit suicide as soon as the cops show up?
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:11.780]  I mean, it just shows they really are ghoulish demons that they all act exactly the same.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:20.340]  You know, I'm trying to teach my children, I have two boys, 16 and 14, and I think society
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:27.780]  in general tries to teach people that these bad guys are just misunderstood, or they've
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:33.220]  had a hard life, or all the various of thundery excuses that you can come up with for them.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:38.180]  I mean, I've actually literally had people asking me, why didn't you try to talk the
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.180]  guy down?
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.180]  Like, really?
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.660]  I mean, I can't even argue with that, it's such a stupid statement.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.660]  Yeah, just shot your dad in the chest, and then you're gonna go talk to him.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.020]  Let me go talk to this guy about his childhood.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:57.140]  What I'm trying to teach my children is that there certainly are criminals, I would say
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:02.340]  the vast majority of criminals in the world that were created, they did have bad childhoods
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.340]  and whatnot.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.700]  But there's also evil.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:12.100]  I honestly believe there is absolute evil that exists in the world.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.100]  That's my next point.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:20.300]  Have you noticed that with Son of Sam, Ramirez, the Night Stalker, Harrison Kleibold, Lanza,
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.580]  and the guy that just shot the firefighters, they were all admitted devil worshipers.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.180]  Shouldn't we be profiling them?
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.580]  I did not know that, but I'm not even slightly surprised.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.700]  Okay, maybe mildly surprised, but not shocked, have I passed?
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.700]  It's incredible.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:46.420]  Evil exists, and I believe that you must do your best to stand between evil and innocent
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.420]  evil.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.220]  And it doesn't mean, again, I want to make this clear, because I'll tell you what one
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.380]  of my biggest fears is, Alex.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:58.580]  One of my biggest fears is that I'm gonna be in some position that I get shot and killed
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:05.780]  by a bad guy, and I'm not able to get a round off for some reason.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:11.340]  And I'm so afraid that the other side is gonna say, see, her gun didn't help her.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:18.500]  And I've said it a million times, it's not a guarantee, it changes the odds.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:24.140]  It means you're not a helpless prey animal to be fed upon by devil worshipers and psychopaths.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.580]  At least I'm not gonna be an easy target, I'm gonna do my best.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.620]  I'm gonna do my best to bloody them.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.300]  They might take me out, but I'm gonna do my best to put them in the hospital, at the very
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.300]  least.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:39.060]  Everybody's gonna know who the bad guy is.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.020]  Here's the headline, Daily Mail, it's also in AP.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:48.140]  I am the devil, former classmate reveals school gunman had online devil worshiping page as
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:53.700]  childhood barber recounts how he never spoke and just stared at floors.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:26:00.840]  And that's the shooter of the firefighters with Lanza, it's the same story.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.540]  So this just goes on and on.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:12.660]  So all of them, devil worshipers, here it is, Satan worship, the Sandy Hook, on and
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.660]  on and on.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:17.540]  Son of Sam, Night Stalker, list goes on and on, it's amazing.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:20.940]  In the time we have here, cuz I know you've gotta go, maybe you can do five more minutes
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:25.220]  after the break to talk about your book, which I need to carry at the Infowars online bookstore
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.980]  because I know it's so important.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:30.300]  We all need to reach out to the dumbed down people that really think turning their guns
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.180]  in is gonna protect them.
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:38.100]  But looking at Dianne Feinstein, have you seen the testimony in Congress where she admits
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:41.420]  she has a concealed carry but doesn't want you to be able?
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:46.820]  I have seen written quotes from it, but I have not actually seen it, no.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:47.820]  It's amazing, though.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.340]  I mean, how can they all have bodyguards and she can be worth 100 billion bucks, but then
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.220]  we're not supposed to have guns?
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:27:00.660]  I remember being on CNN or one of those shows when Rosie O'Donnell, there had been some
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:06.820]  incident with one of her adopted children and a bodyguard protected the child.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:13.580]  And I went on the air and said, she must be horribly, horribly, feel awfully silly at
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:17.980]  the moment because she's telling all of us to disarm and most of us don't have her kind
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:24.100]  of money that we can hire personal bodyguards for our kids and she must be terribly embarrassed.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:28.980]  But I feel that way pretty much about Feinstein and most of them, it's just an elitist attitude.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:33.020]  It's okay for me, but it's not for you because I don't trust you.
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.980]  Well if you notice, I've even got Christian Science Monitor admitting, I have an article
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:41.540]  that our government's trying to restrict free speech online and going the way of China.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:46.180]  I've got an article after you leave us, we're gonna go over where top Georgetown professors
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.300]  saying yeah, go ahead and kill old people, death panels.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.860]  I mean, they're not just going after the Second Amendment, do you see it as a big canary in
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:28:01.860]  the coal mine that they are this open and brazen right now?
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.340]  Here's what I really think, Alex.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:07.480]  I don't think Obama is the problem.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.200]  I don't think Feinstein is the problem.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:16.700]  I honestly believe that our public education system is the problem because those are the
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:22.020]  people that are growing up to run for office that think socialism and Marxism is a good
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.020]  thing.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.980]  They're the ones that grow up and vote for the Obamas and the Feinstein's.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:34.580]  So I truly believe, you know, you and I tend to attack this and a lot of partisans tend
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:38.780]  to attack this at the top, you know, when we have to get so and so out of office or
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.460]  into office.
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:46.980]  And I really hope that the problem is down in the school system.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.540]  Have we crossed the Rubicon of becoming a collectivist society where they've got so
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.660]  many people domesticated?
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.380]  You know, they're like squirrels you feed in your backyard after a while, they don't
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.380]  know how to go out and get their own food.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:03.060]  Yes, yes, and I was talking about this last night on the radio show, in fact, on the one
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.580]  that I was filling in on in Austin.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:12.020]  Yes, I, unfortunately, I, I think we have hit the tipping point.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:18.820]  I and I think that's evidenced in this last presidential run.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:24.100]  I just think there are now more, you know, we were a little bit sheltered here in Texas,
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:27.100]  because Texas is still a pretty Republican conservative.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:30.540]  I'll tell you what, I know you got to go, but we're gonna go to break, come back and
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.700]  do five more minutes with us, and then we'll let you get back to work because I want to
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:38.220]  finish up with the tipping point solutions and your book because there are ways to beat
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.220]  this.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.660]  But it's just like in Poland, it's called non-compliance, we've got to do everything
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.580]  we can before this becomes a shooting war.
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:50.340]  We'll be right back with Susanna Hupp.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:30:00.740]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.820]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:08.820]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:14.860]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.860]  to the global takeover.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:21.860]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.

[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:34.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and we're finishing up with an interview we're
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:40.780]  doing with Representative Susanna Hupp, former representative survivor of the Luby's Massacre.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:46.740]  Our book is from Luby's, the legislature, very highly rated at Amazon in the reviews
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:51.380]  and is really good for people out there who don't understand what's going on.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.020]  We either reach out to the domesticated Obama-noids or it's over.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.260]  And the collectivist are very arrogant.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:03.260]  She just said people in Texas or other more constitutional areas, where the economy by
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:07.420]  the way is still operating cuz we're not socialists completely, are in a bubble.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.580]  We think, they'll never have government run healthcare, they'll never make us pay for
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:11.580]  abortions.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:14.180]  They'll never take over the Catholic Church and make them pay for abortions.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.580]  It's all happening.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.260]  They'll never do this, they'll never do that.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.100]  Really they've done this in every other country.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.460]  They're following a model.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.000]  And they're powerful corporate interests that want monopolies.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.020]  They want a quasi-socialist system with a fascist system on top of it.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:32.780]  And there's also some hoaxing going on where they say this is a mandate for socialism cuz
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.220]  Obama won again.
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:40.940]  No, they ran a neo-con socialist Obamacare writing Mitt Romney.
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.060]  So the fix is in is the problem.
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.980]  Representative, I wanted to talk about your book some, but first, solutions.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:52.580]  If we have reached the tipping point of domestication, we know the solution is wait till it rots
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.700]  and collapses like the Soviet Union.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.140]  Well that's gonna be authoritarianism.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.620]  I don't wanna be sent to the Gulag Archipelago.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:04.140]  How do we short circuit it before it gets really, really bad?
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:08.540]  Well, you're not gonna like my answer.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.540]  I guess my answer is two-fold.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:18.620]  Number one, we truly, truly need to get into the school system and begin to re-teach what
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:22.860]  made America great because they're not teaching it now.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.060]  They're teaching that socialism and Marxism is good.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:27.100]  What do you mean I don't like your answer?
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.680]  I mean, I love, I mean, absolutely.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.340]  And look, the government's taken over.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.540]  It's time for us to do what the socialists did.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:39.020]  I think people should infiltrate government and do whatever you have to to get in there
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.660]  to report on these people and sabotage these people.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.660]  Yes, yes, that's very well put.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:49.660]  Well, I said that you wouldn't like it because unfortunately, it's not a glamorous answer
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:53.580]  and it's a slow task to make changes in the school system.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:59.140]  The second thing that you do brilliantly is teach people to be prepared.
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:05.780]  And it used to be only us crazies that would stockpile food or stockpile water or ammunition
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.780]  or whatever.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.220]  But now they actually have television shows about it.
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:13.860]  It's not just crazies, it's not just people that are living for their front teeth.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.060]  But our grandparents all did that.
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:17.060]  It's normal.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.460]  All mammals store some food.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:22.260]  I mean, even grasshoppers do it and they're insects.
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:28.620]  I mean, you're crazy to just live day to day in some supermax prison-style grid.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:31.380]  Let me ask you this, then we'll talk about the book and let you go and hopefully get
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:32.780]  you back soon.
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:37.020]  I have a clip in my film In Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:40.820]  And in it, it's you talking to the head of the psychiatry association.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:48.500]  And you say, why are 67% at that time of foster kids on psychotropics?
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.980]  And you were heading up the committee and it was a big investigation.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.820]  And he says, they come from bad gene pools.
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.980]  Well, A, that's what Hitler said.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:58.600]  B, they don't even do blood tests, quote, gene pools.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.100]  I mean, no, they grab kids from their parents and then drug them, as doctors have said.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.420]  What do you make of that?
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.860]  That's not liberal drugging kids.
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.860]  That's evil.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:14.780]  Yes, and in many, many, many cases, those children were on more than three psychotropic
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:15.780]  drugs.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:21.900]  And many of them weren't even okay for children of the age that they were giving them to.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.260]  I'm deeply concerned with the drug culture.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:28.700]  And I don't want to, look, I don't want a bad mouthful of drugs.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:32.140]  Look, I just got off a run of antibiotics for a sinus infection, but there are good
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.140]  drugs out there.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:40.300]  The problem is, this is one of the things that can be tricky in a free society.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:46.660]  We do have these enormous drug companies that push this stuff and actually get it wrapped
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:52.060]  into the government system, where the doctors that are working on the foster kids, for instance,
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:55.820]  have to follow a particular protocol in what drugs they use.
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:57.940]  They can't deviate from that protocol.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:04.340]  So it's very interconnected and very difficult to unravel, quite frankly.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:09.500]  Well, that's right, in the public schools, it turns out, get more federal funding, the
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:12.700]  more kids are, quote, special need on the drugs.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:17.860]  In fact, the WOAI investigation that spurred the state investigation, if you remember,
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:24.220]  found that the national average was 67% of foster children are on psychotropics, and
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:29.460]  the average child was on seven drugs.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.460]  Seven drugs.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.460]  Yeah, which is crazy.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.940]  I mean, that in and of itself is crazy.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:44.020]  And there is absolutely, my husband is a neuropsychologist, so I would go to him and use him for information
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.420]  on a regular basis.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:51.620]  And you're right, unfortunately, there is a financial benefit to not only the school
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.620]  system, but the parents.
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:39:01.900]  There was a kind of a negative, basically, they would go in and a lot of them, not all
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.340]  of them, but a lot of them would go in and say, well, this kid's creating a lot of problems
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:07.780]  for me, he really needs to be on medication.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:11.740]  Somebody would put him on medication, and the foster family would get more money per
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.220]  day because of it.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:17.180]  And then the medication makes them worse, so the answer is not get them off drugs, get
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.180]  them on more.
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:21.580]  They're eating Twinkies, they're drinking Cokes with caffeine, they're eating, I mean,
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.100]  my children, if they get red dye or something in a candy on vacation, we let them eat it
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:27.100]  or something.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.100]  They go nuts, don't they?
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]  They go crazy.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.460]  And then it turns out those dyes have a drug effect.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:37.420]  The kids are bouncing off the walls cuz they should be eating steak and potatoes and broccoli
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.300]  and exercising all day.
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:44.020]  Instead, I mean, if I drank Cokes and ate Twinkies, when I come down off of it, I've
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.420]  done it a few times, I wanna beat the hell out of people.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.420]  I mean, no wonder the-
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.420]  Particularly young boys.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:49.420]  Particularly young boys.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:54.620]  I mean, it used to amaze me to watch the teachers, they were taught to give the little boys time
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:55.620]  out.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.900]  Instead of what they should be doing is telling them to go outside and run around with schools
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:01.900]  five times.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:05.580]  Well, you know public schools first got rid of dodge ball, now most of them have banned
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.580]  running.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:11.980]  So I mean, of course, young mammals, I mean, that'd be like drugging a puppy because it
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.140]  runs around and chews on the other puppy.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:15.140]  Yes.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:17.020]  I mean, baby mammals all act the same.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.540]  Ma'am, you're amazing.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.540]  Thank you for your time and thank you for getting your testimony out there that the
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:25.940]  answer is more guns, less crime.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:29.100]  Tell us briefly about your book.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:37.020]  I wrote that book for the average person to read and be able to make the arguments with
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.020]  their neighbors and friends.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:41.540]  It's also a great book to pass on- You know who I really wrote that book for?
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:47.420]  I wrote that book for a housewife that just aren't sure how they feel about guns.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:52.180]  You know, they're not into going out and blasting Bambi and they're just uncomfortable
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.900]  with things that go make a loud bang.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.020]  And I understand that, I completely understand that.
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:02.180]  And I'm a mother and I've been there, I understand, I'm not into going out and blasting Bambi
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.180]  either.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:06.940]  But it's a quick, easy read and it's for those people.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:07.940]  Absolutely.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:11.780]  Well, you know, you've got two sons, I've got two daughters and a son and I love them
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.060]  like life itself or more.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.780]  But it is really a good feeling now that my eight year old is shooting and hitting bull's
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.460]  eye at 50 yards.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.420]  We haven't trained the four year old yet.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.980]  And it's such a good feeling that my girls are tough.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.620]  Because they punch me when we're playing and it really hurts.
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.660]  And that they're not putting up with anybody trying to rape them or attack them.
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:35.980]  And then I'm gonna defend the Second Amendment so when they go off to college or when they
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:40.160]  get married and they live, some guy bust into their apartment or into their house to try
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.760]  to beat them up or rape them, they're dead.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.360]  And that's real empowerment.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.140]  And it's not feminism, it's survival, it's basic common sense.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:55.180]  And as I said, our culture of liberty, the women's magazines, the Austin Chronicle's
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:57.380]  been having articles about women's shooting.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:03.220]  Not because the Socialist Anti-American Chronicle, run by a horrible guy who I know, wants to
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.220]  do that.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:07.840]  They're being forced to do that if people are gonna pick up their magazines.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.300]  And our culture of liberty and self empowerment is growing.
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.500]  And so that's why the empire is striking back.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.420]  And your book breaks that down and I hope everybody gets it and gives it to women who
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:21.300]  are anti-gun in their family or who are on the fence.
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.820]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:27.780]  All right, we'll have a great week coming up and I always enjoy getting to hear you
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:29.420]  on 590 AM when you're filling in.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:30.420]  God bless.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.420]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.420]  Happy New Year.
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.420]  You too.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.420]  There it goes.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.700]  Our representative, Susanna Hupp, survivor of the Luby's massacre.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.900]  We're gonna get her back on in a few months.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.940]  Maybe even sometime have her come in and fill in.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.580]  She lives on there, Austin.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.420]  She does that for our local affiliate, just an amazing lady.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:49.540]  Boy, I tell you.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:55.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, I said that I would get into agenda 21 because I was really brainstorming
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.220]  on it last night and this morning.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.640]  And how it ties into things, what the Obamacare means, what the death panels mean, what life
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640]  is really gonna be like.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.060]  Cuz I always mention this or that or say I'm gonna break it down and I've done some special
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.060]  reports.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:14.700]  But then I get an hour and 43 minutes into this and I'm not so much exhausted as that
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:19.100]  it's a feeling of I can't do this justice.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:20.400]  I can't do this justice.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:26.900]  So what I wanna do is I'm gonna go to your calls until eight after next hour, seven after.
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.740]  And then I'll cover this for a segment and continue with your calls, pardon my New Year's
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.740]  resolution.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:35.060]  And I want the crew in there cuz I don't have a quote producer that tells me what to do.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:40.020]  I kind of have radio bookers and a great crew that runs the TV and does research.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:45.820]  But I need you guys to make me that when I say I'm taking calls, get to them, get to
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.460]  them quick, cycle through them.
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.660]  Cuz it brings up a lot of really important angles and issues.
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.900]  And I like taking calls.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.820]  Whenever I'm listening to rebroadcast, I'm like, I wish you'd take calls, Alex.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:01.900]  But again, it's just that I've got so much information I wanna get to you.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:08.580]  Agenda 21 is taking civilization and militarizing it against the people.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:13.780]  And it is the strangulation of humanity.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:20.980]  It is the scientific exterminism, an ultra-Hitlerian, incremental, scientifically controlled kill
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:23.860]  grid.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:27.420]  And I'm gonna attempt to really talk about it and give you some examples and tell you
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:28.420]  where it's going.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:35.780]  And remember, I told you 15 years ago the printer ink was tracking everything you do.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.340]  And putting where you bought the printer, what you did, a whole record of it on there.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:43.420]  I told you that 10 years ago smart meters were going in that would control your temperature
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.980]  and track everything you do and be later used to charge you more.
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:52.060]  And interface with all your appliances that all have spy tech being built into them.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:55.020]  Now it's mainstream news because it's ubiquitous.
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:00.340]  See, they always say, that's crazy counting on you being ignorant when it's first going
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:03.700]  in cuz they don't want you to resist it at that point.
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:07.500]  But once it's ubiquitous, they go, yeah, we are listening to you with the NSA, all of
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.500]  you.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.180]  Yeah, the NSA is tracking everything you do.
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.780]  Yeah, we are reading what you say.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:20.980]  You know what, the post office is opening some of your letters.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:25.180]  You know what, yeah, okay, well, government apologizes for shooting kids up in Guatemala
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]  with live syphilis.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:29.900]  We're sorry, but we're gonna keep doing it.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:35.500]  I mean, I sit here looking at all the admissions, these are not my opinions.
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.500]  And then I go study, let me see who that bank chairman is.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.900]  Let's go see if he gives money to eugenics organizations.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:48.140]  You go look it up, population reduction funds, and Nature Conservancy, and Sierra Club, and
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.660]  all these anti-human groups that claim they care about the Earth.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:52.660]  It's always the same.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:46:00.220]  There's only a few thousand of them, and they're all, all into the same thing.
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.220]  All of them.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:05.680]  I can randomly pick some globalist calling for gun control and go find out they're calling
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:07.420]  for the end of the First Amendment authoritarianism.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:14.380]  I mean, these are monsters who have a mesmerized population watching television all day.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:20.620]  The television and the false culture is like a black hole destroying the real world.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.100]  It's sucking it in and wrecking minds.
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:26.420]  And there are people that really think television's their friends.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:29.140]  They're imaginary friends on their favorite show.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:33.540]  And they sit there and basically talk to the television, and they get sad when they give
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.260]  them the cue to about the dead kids.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.940]  It's Sandy Hook, but not sad when somebody protests and jumps up during a meeting about
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:44.220]  thousands of dead kids from military strikes.
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:46.900]  And they're just programmable biological androids.
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.340]  That's what the globalists call you.
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:52.940]  They call you human resources programmable, and I'm not a programmable.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:57.040]  Let me tell you something, you psychopaths are the most programmable.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.600]  You sit there and look at a regular folks who are weak minded and childlike because
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.540]  you got them when they were babies in front of the television.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:08.820]  And you think you're powerful because you're socially engineering people with subliminals
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.820]  and all the rest of it.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:15.380]  I've studied psychopaths and their servant sociopaths and their mercenaries and the different
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:18.860]  classes that serve them, different criminal classes that serve darkness because they get
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.540]  to engage in their particular poison.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.700]  You guys are totally obsessive compulsive, if you wanna use that limited term.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.340]  It doesn't fully describe it, but it's a term people can get.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.460]  It's similar to that.
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.140]  You guys are ritualistic.
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:34.620]  You guys aren't alive.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.700]  You're not really creating, you're twisting.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.380]  You are not creating literature, music.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.060]  You are not creating art.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.980]  You are not creating beauty.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:45.980]  You are not.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.260]  You guys are missing out.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:50.220]  And a lot of you, it is from inbreeding and things.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:53.900]  There is such a thing as genetic psychopaths.
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:57.140]  Most of them are genetic.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:01.620]  Royalty takes really aggressive, generally psychopaths are very manipulative dominance
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.220]  and breeds them into psychopaths.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:07.660]  That's why you get these robotic classes that are just ready to do anything.
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:13.260]  And they always like the same thing, black uniforms, burning cities, torturing children.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.340]  They all do it through, I mean, you studied history?
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:16.340]  Any of you?
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:21.940]  Every culture, black uniforms, burning children on fires, mass death.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:27.060]  Because good people don't have the sheepdog instinct to get in there and deal with these
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.060]  people.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:31.500]  And by the way, we're a lot stronger and more inventive and powerful.
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:35.740]  And by the way, we have levers that we don't enjoy crushing, we don't enjoy killing, but
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:38.500]  we can do it a lot better than they can.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.340]  That's the thing, a lot of people get into evil because they feel weak.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.500]  They're not really psychopaths or sociopaths.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.300]  They get into evil believing it will give them power.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.140]  And then by example and modeling, they're able to do outrageous things, which is kinda
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.140]  like building their self-confidence.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:55.500]  Honestly, just go take a Toastmasters, and I've never taken one of those, but I've read
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:59.900]  about them, course for something if you wanna be confident, instead of going out and doing
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.860]  evil things.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:05.700]  And those of us, see, evil people only have what they call evil.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:13.220]  And they do bad things and hurtful things for the power and the enjoyment.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:17.540]  The Bible says thou shalt not murder, and it's mistranslated as kill, cuz the whole
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:23.540]  Bible's about go out and defend yourself, go out and kill the enemy that's attacking
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.540]  you.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.620]  It's murder, premeditated, an innocent, knocking somebody on the head who's walking through
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:32.820]  the path who's got a bag of food you want 3,000 years ago.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.260]  That's murder.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:41.020]  But to kill, to defend yourself is what God demands.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:46.860]  Because if you don't, the wolves take over when you act like a sheep.
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:50.420]  So I'll come back, take a few calls in the next two segments, then get into agenda 21.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:56.080]  But you need to understand, folks, that you have innate power.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.740]  You have an entire electrochemical software system and all the instincts, and it's been
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:07.020]  proven scientifically, the racial memories that are more just like essence data.
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.960]  It's not like an actual exact memory.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.240]  You have all of this, you only have to access it.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.060]  You're not accessing your programming.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:21.180]  I mean, you ask God, the universe, whatever you believe it is, to help you be someone
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.120]  who stands up for good.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:31.940]  You're also asking your subconscious to activate.
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:39.120]  And then once you open the door, God can spiritually energize you, because you are a biological
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.860]  android with a spirit.
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:48.060]  This is an Earth suit, but you've got to open the door and say, okay, programming activated,
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:52.300]  and then ask the creator of the universe, because God's for free will.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.740]  You've got to say, I'm ready.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:55.740]  You understand?
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.740]  Give me the knowledge.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:57.740]  Please, for good.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:58.740]  I'm ready.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:50:59.740]  I'm ready.
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.900]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:05.900]  Box.
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.820]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:13.620]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:17.940]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:23.520]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.580]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:33.740]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:34.880]  normal cell.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.620]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:42.620]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:53.580]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:57.940]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:58.940]  Protect your immune system.
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.820]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.220]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:09.300]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:11.340]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:16.300]  Bates experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:20.600]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.780]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:27.140]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.040]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.700]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:39.500]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:45.360]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.900]  discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.820]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.820]  forever.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:57.820]  Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:04.580]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.940]  severe heart clashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:12.300]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.980]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:19.380]  After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:20.380]  again.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:22.500]  I feel energized and strong.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:23.820]  This is an amazing product.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:27.300]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce ten
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:33.400]  percent of its protein content as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.580]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:41.420]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.660]  organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:47.420]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.660]  To order One World Way, call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:54.380]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.380]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:54:01.980]  That's one world W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:08.300]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.820]  a war on for your mind.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:25.900]  By the way, the petition to deport Piers Morgan has reached 114,000 right now.
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:29.940]  I bet we can probably punch that up on screen for viewers.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:34.000]  It's also linked up at the drugsreport.com, or at least it was.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:40.700]  So now it's 100,139, since we printed this off a few minutes ago, another 100 or so signatures.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:44.020]  By the way, just to be clear, cuz my own crew thought this, they're all like, we didn't
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.780]  see you on Piers Morgan last night.
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:51.920]  I told the crew, I said, when Piers Morgan comes back from vacation, I'm supposedly on
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.660]  his show the 7th, but I said, don't hold your breath.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:58.340]  I said that on air as well, so people may not have heard that right on air.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:02.220]  It's the 7th on there, and I bet they check it out.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:05.620]  I really could care less, it's not that big of an audience, but it would be an Internet
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:09.180]  hit to go in there and obscure him.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:13.540]  And you'll hear him call me a pathetic person and stuff, that's just ridiculous.
[01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:18.940]  Let's go ahead and go to John in New Hampshire, welcome, sir, thanks for holding.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:22.340]  Okay, Alex, Temple Warrior from New Hampshire.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:28.660]  I listened to you from the start when you started, and I know you made a lot of good
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:37.340]  points with me, how I'm a former law enforcement official and now I'm a selectman in New Hampshire.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:45.020]  And the thing that got to me was we have to take back all these local town and city positions
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.180]  and get back, take back our government.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:55.020]  So I ran for selectman, I was elected, and they stuck in, tried to sneak in that UN Agenda
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.820]  21 into our town with a grant and all these promises, and I had been enlightened from
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:07.400]  your show, and then when it came up, I questioned it, and naturally when I brought up anything
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:14.100]  with the word UN Agenda 21, they thought I was crazy, but when it came down to the vote,
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.740]  it was a split vote and my vote was a deciding vote and-
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:22.360]  And by the way, you know that's all an act, they now say we're insane, Israeli citizens
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.820]  can't own guns and teachers aren't armed.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:30.060]  It's a known fact they are, they just go, no, because we'd win the debate that Israel
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:32.740]  ended its school shootings by arming the teachers.
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:37.800]  So they go, instead of debating us on that, they go, no, Israel doesn't have guns.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.780]  So it's the same thing, they put out talking point manuals, it's even come out in the New
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:46.720]  York Times on how to deal with you, to act like it doesn't exist.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.620]  That laughing at you and all that is part of the mind game, but again, you kept getting
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:58.700]  the word out and all these masters owning things are authoritarian, they're designed
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:04.260]  for any town, China and India and Mexico don't have these rules, the globalist all run those
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.220]  countries, it's forcing all our industry out, it's a takeover.
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.740]  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:14.980]  So I came down to a split vote and I was the deciding vote and I shut it down, and you
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:19.900]  would have thought I was Jack the Ripper, but I felt great that day and I told them
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:23.500]  they're not gonna get it back as long as I'm on the selectman's board.
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:26.540]  So did I hear you right that you were a police officer, now you've run and gotten into the
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:30.620]  selectmen or city council, what a beautiful story.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:35.300]  And patriots, now I'm never a person for deception, I think you should be honest that you're a
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:41.420]  libertarian or constitutionalist or whatever you call yourself, a liberty lover.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:47.980]  But I think it's good to get in, see they infiltrated us by acting like they were just
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:50.460]  liberals when they're really authoritarians.
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:55.620]  I think it's important to get our people in acting like we're not that threatening to
[01:57:55.620 --> 01:58:00.020]  get in and then it's a lot easier to stay in, what's your take on that?
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:05.540]  That's exactly what I did when I was first in town, some of the leftist organizations
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:10.020]  invited me to state who I was and what I had in mind.
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:16.920]  And I just yest them to death and let them believe I was a good person, which I am.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:23.900]  And then when the key votes came in town, we get a constitutional chief of police and
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:27.540]  we just put in a great town administrator and I'm sure they're-
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:29.660]  That's it, exactly, exactly.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:34.060]  And again, most of the mainline liberals are well-meaning, they're just helpless fools,
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:35.340]  but again, exactly.
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:40.700]  And then once you get in, you can educate them, we've got to use the enemy's tactics.

[01:59:54.060 --> 02:00:05.740]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.580]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:11.580]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:13.700]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:17.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:24.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:30.060]  And to quantify what I was just saying, I don't mean to use all their tactics, but you
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:32.740]  got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:33.740]  to run.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:39.540]  I would have never gotten into Bohemian Grove if when I was questioned by the feds and others,
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:42.960]  I didn't say, I'm with hillbillies.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:46.820]  And technically, that's the name of one of the clubs inside the Grove, and I guess I
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:51.140]  am kind of a hillbilly, I'm from a bunch of East Texas blood, I mean, that's pretty hillbilly.
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:56.740]  But the point is, it's all semantical, because this is a foreign occupying globalist force.
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:00.460]  I think running for office and being open about the New World Order is a great way to
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:04.980]  do it as well, just to educate people.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:12.020]  But knowing when to hold them, knowing when to fold them, when you're really trying to
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:15.980]  get in and defeat the enemy, it's a complex issue.
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:21.060]  Let's go to Brian in New Mexico, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:24.140]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call, and first of all, I want to wish you a Happy New Year
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:25.140]  for your family.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.900]  You too, brother, God bless you.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.460]  My biggest concern, I think, is with the media.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:37.300]  There's a lot of evil and crookedness, people, you know, with their backroom deals and such.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:43.660]  But the media who knows it and perpetuates it and misguides people, I think is the key
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:50.620]  problem that we're facing, not even the technical brainwave changing patterns of TV and such.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:56.220]  All the advertisements are there to make you feel fragmented, broken, weak, and if we don't
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:00.140]  use the right toothpaste, we're not going to be able to do whatever, you know, we want
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:01.140]  to do.
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:07.100]  We are incredibly powerful beings, and yes, we are being drugged and manipulated in order
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:10.700]  that we don't tap into our greatness and our power.
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:17.780]  But even in the most drug-down, mentally deficient person, there is a spark that the globalists,
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:23.300]  I think that's what they're ultimately afraid of, is a few thousand people have taken control
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:29.380]  over the whole population of this planet, and they do it subconsciously.
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:33.640]  They can't physically control us, at least not yet, so they do everything they can to
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:39.940]  make us feel, you know, like we're worthless, but we are incredible beings.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:45.580]  Just last year, I've been producing a television show, a public access TV show here in Albuquerque,
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:49.220]  and through backroom deals with the corrupt mayor and the city council, basically they
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:56.140]  gave control to a for-profit group that is now censoring all live things, and they're
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:02.400]  not allowing any controversial topics, so I'm basically out of a viewpoint, or an outlet
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:08.780]  to express my viewpoint, but still just talking to people day-to-day, you never know how just
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:12.380]  the simplest conversation will have huge ripples.
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:16.900]  Going back to the gun thing, I was at the dog park, and some guy was saying, well, we
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:20.460]  don't need guns, and he's going, brrr, you don't need that to hunt deer.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:24.660]  I said, first of all, you don't have a gun, or you would know that you can't hunt deer
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:28.980]  with it, you can't get an automatic weapon, but they're in this mindset of what they see
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:34.940]  on television, and really, I think the biggest thing that people need to do is get rid of
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:39.980]  their television, or if they do watch it for research or whatever, know how they're being
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:46.300]  manipulated, and really spend more time with your kids, talk radio, just more real life
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:47.980]  things is what I think this population really needs.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:53.180]  Yeah, that's why they ain't talk radio, is that it's not scripted, especially shows like
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:04:00.380]  this, but even mainline talk radio is not scripted compared to mainline globalist type
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:01.940]  propaganda.
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:06.680]  But all over the country, they're trying to shut down access TV, people should use it
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.820]  while it's still there, people should defend it.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:15.540]  They tried hard to keep me off of it, it's a great way to reach locals and organize things,
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:20.300]  but there's other ways, most AM and FM stations are begging for people that wanna come in
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:23.060]  into an hour or two on the weekend.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:30.140]  So do a YouTube channel first to show that you can talk, and then use that to say, hey,
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:36.340]  here's my local internet show, I do local news, and volunteer to come in and say, and
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:41.780]  I'll try to get sponsors, and then you can be a salesman as well, just on spec.
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:47.900]  And most stations, if you're well-spoken at all, will give you a weekend show, and then
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:51.300]  you're reaching a lot of people, then you start telling folks about your show, you get
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:55.980]  them tuning in, then there's a buzz, pretty soon you're filling in for the weekday show,
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:03.260]  pretty soon you got your own weekday show, pretty soon you're syndicated, pretty soon.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:09.580]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:11.180]  Ben Soap Company.

[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:08.860]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:14.900]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:15.900]  to the global takeover.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:21.860]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.

[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.040]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.420]  Don't be one of them.
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:11.180]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.180]  solution.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.980]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:20.980]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:21.980]  healing.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:26.180]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy
[02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:31.300]  the causes of many serious diseases, such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:32.860]  other harmful pathogens.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:37.740]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.860]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.540]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:49.380]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:13.300]  The councils of government, we must guard against the accusation of unwarranted influence,
[02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:18.180]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:23.180]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:24.180]  Dallas.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:30.140]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:38.260]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:44.260]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion, it just pancakes.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:09:01.220]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:05.740]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:06.740]  not in the hands of criminals.
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:15.060]  Guns will be caked and no one will be able to be armed, we're going to take all of them.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:19.420]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.420]  city.
[02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:24.420]  Global governance at last, is it one world the central bank is in charge, but aren't
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:28.020]  we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:34.060]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:49.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to break down just a snapshot of the premeditated evil that
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:52.860]  is Agenda 21 implemented.
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:10:03.020]  And then we'll go to your phone calls continuing on this live first day of January 2013 transmission.
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:10.580]  But I want to read a quote here of Oliver Wendell Holmes, a Supreme Court Justice, taxes
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:14.780]  of the price we pay for civilization.
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:24.020]  And that is what the collectivist will always put in your face when you come out and point
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:32.340]  out that we are having our basic liberties and freedoms eradicated.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:43.020]  Here is another headline, Georgetown Law Professor, scrap, archaic, idiosyncratic and downright
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:46.540]  evil, those are quotes, Constitution.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:57.900]  And that is a top Georgetown Law Professor in the New York Times saying that, Louis Michael
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:03.140]  Seidman, and of course, a big Obama supporter.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:11.180]  We have other articles up at infullwars.com that are just snapshots into how all of this
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:12.180]  works.
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:19.840]  Here's one by Kurt Nemo, Democratic operatives crank up death panel talk following Obama
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:25.660]  win and put out their twisted graphs showing how much US healthcare costs versus other
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:26.660]  countries.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:31.740]  And when you go read the article by George Soros operative at Slate, their headline is
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:35.540]  the case for death panels.
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.780]  You hear the same talking point, the case for killing Granny.
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:55.340]  And of course, we have the clip as well from people out there like the host of the HBO
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:01.420]  show Bill Maher, where he says more death is what we need, get rid of more people.
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.460]  But then he says turn your guns in for the poor 20 dead children.
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:11.660]  They can selectively turn it on and selectively turn it off.
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:13.420]  This is all agenda 21.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:19.860]  Let me explain how collectivism has worked in every country and why the true robber baron
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:27.100]  elites in the last 150 years or so have put their full weight behind it.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:34.660]  A, it makes people dependent, B, the globalist always exempt themselves internationally from
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:37.940]  the laws they put on people in subsectors.
[02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:49.100]  What national sovereignty they allow to continue, they play off against the other nation states.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:59.460]  And in the White House Science Czar's book, Ecoscience, you can read it online, it's free,
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.140]  close to 1,000 pages long.
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:18.620]  And in all of their other publications, they openly talk about how they're going to set
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.420]  up a government control system to make you dependent on government.
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:28.980]  And to quote, have a police state like China, that's Dr. Bianca at UT who calls for 90%
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:34.500]  of us to be exterminated by an airborne release of weaponized airborne Ebola.
[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:37.260]  They all say the same thing.
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:41.860]  In fact, guys, I don't see it over there on the bookshelf, Ecoscience is a big giant white
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:42.860]  book.
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:44.140]  It's always been over there.
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:45.140]  You guys go see what's there.
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:48.940]  I think Aaron's here today, if not, go back and get it, cuz the reason I'm staring is
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:51.580]  I'm wondering where's my book?
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:52.580]  It's always been over there.
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:56.420]  You guys can walk in front of the cameras, I don't care, I just don't see it.
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:59.980]  Very hard to get a physical copy of that nowadays.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:09.920]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is this is a fact we're talking about.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:17.700]  And Agenda 21 has to be dealt with because it is a system of turning off the society.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:25.260]  What do you do when the civilization and the government is a purely predatory group?
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:29.860]  And that's the norm throughout history, who have taken tyranny and codified it into a
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:36.900]  political system where they, with scientific expertise through insurance models and other
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:48.340]  systems, go after you and even actuary out the implosion of the society in orchestrated
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.940]  systems.
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:54.540]  Thank you, they found it, it was under my desk.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:15:00.980]  We did a video breakdown on this with Webster Tarpley, where he called the views in this
[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:08.220]  book ultra-Hitlerian, titled what the elites master plan for global extermination.
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.420]  It's free online, it's an emergency SOS to everyone.
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.940]  And here's the problem, we have over 100 books, we ought to do a review of these books sometime
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:20.420]  over an hour just reading quotes, where it's all the same thing basically plagiarized and
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:21.780]  repeated over and over again.
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:27.260]  I don't know who plagiarized too, but sometimes it's word for word.
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:30.700]  It's kind of like the Bible, there's a hundred different versions, but a lot of it's pretty
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:31.700]  much the same.
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:34.220]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:44.560]  And they set themselves up as the saviors of the world in the name of tyranny.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.060]  They're the saviors of the world, and now they're gonna kill you, they're gonna dumb
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:50.060]  you down, they're gonna cut off your resources.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:55.540]  When really it's the parasitic establishment saying, France will now go without lights
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:58.660]  at night because everything's collapsing.
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:02.540]  They're gonna turn the lights off in Australia at night.
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:07.300]  Major cities in the US aren't gonna have lights and your smart meters are gonna charge you
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.300]  more during the day for electricity.
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:17.460]  And then you go read their own books, they say, we use too much energy, we need to make
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:20.880]  people more frugal.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:26.860]  It's altruistic to be poor, it's beautiful to live under austerity, you go to Whole Foods
[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:31.720]  and half the magazines say it, how sexy it is to be poor.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:36.740]  And it's not being sold to make you get back to the earth and actually be self-sufficient,
[02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:37.740]  that's one thing.
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:38.740]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:42.660]  They put everything in to make you where you can't be self-sufficient, but then come and
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:44.720]  cut your resources off.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.100]  And then say you're gonna work even harder in a 250 square foot apartment with your whole
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:55.940]  family to where you can't take care of yourself even though you have two jobs, so you get
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:03.140]  a supplemental government card with big robotic farming and manufacturing operations with
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:06.240]  robots giving you goods you need to survive.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:13.700]  This is the plan, show that you're forced to take inoculations, I mean, they say in
[02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:17.540]  all their publications that they're going to put all of us that don't take the shots
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:20.420]  and don't do this in ghettos.
[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:26.580]  And then just like Malthus wrote 200 and something years ago, they're going to pump pathogens
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:29.220]  in to kill us in the ghettos.
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:35.380]  They say we're gonna put you in ghettos if you won't go along with all this and then
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:39.540]  there's gonna be some outbreaks and then you actually read deeper they go we're gonna release
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:40.540]  it on you.
[02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:45.340]  I mean, this is a nightmare where they're hunting us and that's what happens in corrupt
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:50.700]  psychopathic civilizations is that corrupt elites get into control who are ruthless and
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:55.700]  they make a sport and a game out of incrementally shutting down the society.
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.780]  But they take their time cuz they enjoy their work, but also so that you never struggle
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:03.300]  out of the net.
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:08.020]  And they're openly now saying if the IRS run by foreign banks says you haven't paid your
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:13.300]  taxes, no judge, no jury, no due process, your car is not gonna start.
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:16.540]  All the new cars with kill switches built into them electronically is basically a cell
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:20.220]  phone component, all the new cars.
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:24.380]  Not just the black boxes in them, but other kill switches that's on record.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.420]  All printers, they have a record of when you bought it, who you were, they just turned
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:29.420]  them off.
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:33.020]  Your printer will turn off, your computer will stop working, you're gonna be face scanned
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.060]  off the cameras.
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:39.820]  The computer won't turn on unless the camera is uncovered and unless the face scan authenticates
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:40.900]  when you turn it on.
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:45.380]  If you try to go to the store to buy food, even with cash, cash will still be there.
[02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:49.740]  It's just the face scan instant, this is already going in everywhere, by the way, told you
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:53.840]  this 15 years ago because MIT said it was the Pentagon plan for total control.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.060]  Now it's in, remember all that'll never happen, that's fair mongering.
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:02.980]  Face scanning to go to college, forced inoculations to go to college, no law, they just make you
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:03.980]  do it.
[02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:06.120]  They say it's policy.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:15.620]  Total control and then lots of mindless entertainment and peer pressure dumbing people down while
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:20.020]  your neighbors are dying of cancer and your kids brain damage from shots.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:23.480]  And you've got all these health problems even though you supposedly eat healthy and exercise
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:26.540]  all the time and everybody's got asthma and allergies.
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:31.940]  And the cancer rates gone up almost 3,000% for adults, it goes up 10,000% like it already
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:34.220]  is for kids and nobody asked why it's happening.
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:36.900]  And they all talk about how they're going to kill us with the cancer and how they put
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:37.900]  the stuff in the water.
[02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:42.640]  And you sit here and read stuff they wrote in the 70s and it's happening now.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.020]  And you're like, hey, you go up to the cops and say, hey, don't you want to fight the
[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:47.020]  new war?
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:48.020]  They're like, I got a uniform, I feel powerful.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:50.740]  I'm like, do you have any kids at home that are retarded?
[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:52.940]  Well, yeah, actually I do.
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:56.620]  Do you know they did that to you, chances are, I really don't care.
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:20:01.300]  See, it's learning how to love your own destruction, Saul.
[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:04.300]  You know what happens to your digestive health around the holidays?
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:05.300]  Right.
[02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:09.620]  Unusual schedules and foods you don't normally eat can cause upset stomach and indigestion.

[02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:00.420]  Terriganix, life's getting better.
[02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:01.980]  Hi there.
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:02.980]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:07.220]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:13.500]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:18.220]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:23.340]  are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:25.460]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:30.180]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.260]  goes.
[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:36.900]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:39.340]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:43.220]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:44.220]  the last three months.
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:50.180]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:51.180]  your home.
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:57.260]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:59.260]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:04.340]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.340]  Box.
[02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:08.260]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:13.060]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:17.380]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:33.160]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.300]  normal cell.

[02:23:00.140 --> 02:23:05.300]  Quantitative easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:07.400]  China getting out of U.S. Treasuries.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:12.420]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at 11 trillion gold trading
[02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:14.900]  around $850 per ounce.
[02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:21.420]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded 16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce.
[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:24.660]  The 20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:28.900]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.140]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:36.020]  100 years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:37.380]  own gold standard.
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:39.140]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:19.740]  You know a lot of people see videos produced in partnership with the British government,
[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:25.580]  the UK government, for plannedopolis and it's where everybody lives in the ghettos that
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:27.220]  won't accept total control.
[02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:29.740]  Everybody else is controlled by central computers.
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:33.680]  Nobody's allowed to have cars but the elites.
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:37.380]  And people would see these videos and think it was a joke.
[02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:41.100]  But this is what they really plan.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:46.300]  And when you've got over 100 books written by top globalist, talking about how they're
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:52.420]  soft killing us, and talking about how once they get us in the compact cities, they can
[02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:57.980]  then wipe out the third world, the people in the compact cities will then beg the government
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:25:01.820]  to give them even more control.
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:06.820]  And then they're planning to wipe out the people in the mega cities.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:12.460]  And they sit there and they brag about all this and you're sitting there reading psychopaths
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:17.940]  telling you what they're gonna do, in many cases not even veiled.
[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:22.740]  And then you go out to the public and you go, hey, Europe's got death panels.
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.020]  And people go, that doesn't exist.
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:25.020]  I heard you're a liar.
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:27.860]  You're like, no, let me show you a video clip or let me show you their own book.
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:29.940]  No, I don't believe that crazy.
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:32.940]  Now that they get healthcare in, government healthcare, they're like, yeah, of course
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:34.980]  there's death panels.
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:42.700]  And here's how the trap of collectivism works to get you into this system, okay?
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:46.060]  I was just looking at plannedopolis where the government decides the route of where
[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:48.740]  you're gonna go to allow you to leave your house.
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:51.900]  You have to get the computer to authorize it, that it's been approved.
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:57.180]  I mean, this is how totally sick these people are.
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:02.340]  And again, they think you're so rudderless now that they put out classic authoritarianism
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:06.420]  with a high-tech icing as if it's a good thing.
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.340]  But here's how collectivism works.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:11.900]  They say, okay, everybody pays for everybody else's healthcare now.
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:15.660]  So healthcare costs are too high, cuz when you put government money into something it
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:17.300]  drives up the price.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:23.260]  And so we're gonna say what you can eat and how much you've gotta exercise and that you
[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:27.860]  can only eat meat once a year, which they're openly announcing under the UN World Food
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:28.860]  Council.
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:31.620]  I'm showing their UN video right now on screen for TV viewers.
[02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:35.540]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:39.220]  It's just unbelievable, folks, to see how dumbed down the public is.
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:41.900]  They have no idea how much trouble they're in.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:47.940]  They're already jacking the food, the water, everything, and bragging about it.
[02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:51.540]  And the trap works that once they say, well, things are collectivized, well, I'm paying
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:54.380]  for it, so I say how much you're gonna weigh.
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:59.660]  And they use an example of a 700-pound woman on welfare and say there ought to be rules.
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:06.420]  But then you find the rules, say 860 calories for breakfast and lunch, and then another
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:08.940]  500 for dinner, which is basically starvation level.
[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:12.660]  And if you're 1% above their fat index, the state takes your kids.
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:17.240]  I mean, you read what they're gonna push, it's unbelievable.
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:20.980]  And parents can't pack school lunches, and that's already rolling out.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:24.740]  I mean, just three years ago, I was reporting on them not letting people pack their own
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.520]  lunches in Chicago and other areas.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.420]  People didn't believe me, and now it's going in everywhere.
[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:32.540]  I remember 15 years ago reporting on them banning dodgeball, people didn't believe it.
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:35.620]  Now schools everywhere don't even let you run at recess.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:38.580]  It's total prison control.
[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:43.940]  And so now, and I've got articles breaking this down, they come out in all these George
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:50.380]  Soros-connected outfits like Slate and have their operatives, in this one case, say the
[02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:52.580]  case for death panels in one chart.
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:54.980]  You guys punch this up on screen.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:28:00.740]  And it shows a skewed and manipulated chart to begin with, because they're showing end-of-life
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:06.820]  care, specifically not overall healthcare, percentage of GDP.
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:10.780]  And they don't have family in healthcare, they haven't researched it.
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:13.460]  They're here deceiving people.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.780]  And it's the same line Bill Gates puts out that will play after the break where he says,
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:21.580]  kill granny, hire ten teachers.
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:25.420]  They don't explain to you that the insurance companies owned by foreign banks have set
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:30.860]  this up, that when you've got insurance, it's three to four to five times more than if you
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:33.020]  didn't have insurance, depending on the hospital.
[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:35.780]  Sometimes if you don't, it's three or four or five times more.
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:37.660]  You see, it's all a scam.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:44.380]  I had a friend's mom get bit by a rattlesnake on Town Lake here in Austin, on the edge of
[02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:47.000]  Town Lake.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:54.140]  And because they had top of the line insurance, and because they knew that they were wealthy,
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:56.580]  they charged them $300,000.
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:29:00.700]  They negotiated it down, I think they said $170,000.
[02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:03.340]  And she went to the hospital, didn't have a problem, gave them antivenom that costs
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:05.060]  like $50.
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:09.380]  But because they didn't negotiate it, they tried to charge them $300,000 because they
[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:13.380]  had top of the line insurance and were worth just buku money.
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.660]  That's how this stuff operates.
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:19.980]  I have insurance, my fingers cut off, I go to the hospital, illegal aliens are going
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:23.300]  in front of me for an hour.
[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:27.500]  No insurance, no nothing, not even checking their names, your God, your God, your God,
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.180]  you're here to bankrupt the system.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:32.260]  You want to come and have a free baby, boom, it's paid for.
[02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:36.820]  But citizens, you can't get healthcare even when you have the insurance, and that's how
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:37.920]  it is in England.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:42.300]  I've watched the C-SPAN debates in British Parliament, where you wait 18 months for an
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:50.580]  operable brain tumor that isn't operable in one year, stay with us.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:30:01.580]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:02.580]  It's me.
[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:06.220]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:07.780]  you get sick and die?
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:09.980]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.

[02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:48.460]  It's what my family uses.

[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:52.500]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:53.500]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:54.500]  It's here.

[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:10.980]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:15.460]  parts of the world.
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:24.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:28.380]  So you've got these poor people out there, US citizens, they can be Hispanic, black,
[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:30.740]  white, you name it.
[02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:34.920]  They don't know under the Hippocratic Oath and the entire history of Western medicine
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:42.980]  that a third of the healthcare a doctor provides as an honorable profession was to be free.
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.800]  Free.
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:48.860]  And then the wealthy were supposed to give endowment and money to tax-free hospitals.
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:51.380]  This is just a window into agenda 21.
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:54.900]  The Rockefellers by the 20s start taking over medicine.
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:59.380]  They are the biggest owners and controllers in their tax-free foundations of the charity
[02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:00.380]  hospitals.
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:03.620]  They don't tell you it's charity hospital when you go in it.
[02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:08.440]  So they're tax-exempt, but they run a money-making operation.
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:12.940]  And we had a crew member, he was a contractor for me six, seven years ago, probably gonna
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:14.260]  die of Crohn's disease.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:17.780]  He'd been kicked off insurance, couldn't even get it.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:18.900]  And I had to argue with him.
[02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:23.020]  I said, I know you've been to 10 hospitals, 15 doctors.
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:27.500]  You're losing weight, basically go home and maybe die.
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:33.500]  I said, listen, I know that you have to go in and explain and show them your financials
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.380]  that you can't get insurance.
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:36.380]  And there's charity care.
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:39.660]  He said, I don't believe you that I've gone in and told them this and they tell me it
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:40.660]  doesn't exist.
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:43.740]  And I said, listen, you gotta keep doing it.
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:46.920]  And I was just talking to CJ out there about years ago.
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:51.460]  He looked into this to help somebody he knew for charity care with dental stuff.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:57.100]  And by the way, my dad manages 18 dental offices, okay, I happen to know about this.
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:02.300]  And now these big conglomerates will tell the dentists, don't tell people about this.
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:08.520]  They don't do the Hippocratic oath anymore for about 20 years, do no harm, Hippocrates.
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:12.260]  So under Obamacare, they're getting rid of charity care.
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:15.160]  And they're making everybody go buy insurance even if we can't afford it.
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:20.960]  And now it's gonna double the premiums this year, that's Bloomberg and AP reporting that.
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:25.700]  And then it lets the government control what health care you get through the death panels.
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:29.500]  And they use an example of an old lady who's gonna get a million dollars of care, and that's
[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:34.900]  all jacked up in a bad example, a cherry picked example, to say you're gonna lose your job
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.500]  as a teacher now cuz she's gonna get health care.
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:41.740]  Well, see next, you're gonna lose your job if we give this 65-year-old person an eye
[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:43.540]  surgery.
[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:49.360]  And it's all this idea of the pie is one size, cuz the globalists say within just ten years,
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:55.660]  they already have this, they'll have robot machines that for $100 can sit there and give
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:59.080]  you an eye surgery to correct your vision.
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:01.260]  Life extension is gonna be totally cheap.
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:06.100]  They've gotta bring us back into a dark age for the general population, except for what
[02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:12.760]  they call megacity or city-state reservations, high-tech reservations.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:13.760]  This is now being announced.
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:16.860]  People are like, how did you know this 15 years ago?
[02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:20.860]  They wrote books about it, non-fiction.
[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:21.860]  It's all planned.
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:25.060]  I don't know how else to explain this to you.
[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:29.060]  And you've got these fools waddling around going, I want my old on the phone, I want
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:31.560]  my free health care.
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:37.460]  And I was just talking to CJ about how, yeah, he found in Austin, the only places that advertise
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.620]  charity care were in Spanish.
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:44.780]  And they're getting endowment money, they're getting government grants, taxpayer money.
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:46.420]  It's not supposed to run like that.
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:49.740]  You got a hospital that has regular care, regular prices.
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:52.660]  They look at how much you make, and it goes on a scale.
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:56.640]  And then the doctors, like Ron Paul did for a decade, he would go two nights a week and
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:01.140]  work at the poor hospital for $2 a night.
[02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:05.860]  And that was customary, cuz that would pay for your food and gas, because he was a real
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:06.860]  servant.
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:11.940]  He got into it under the Hippocratic oath that you were taught as a physician, you're
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:18.760]  doing this to serve people the highest calling, to wash people's feet.
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.280]  It was Christian, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:26.940]  It was Christian, the first hospitals were the hospitallers, Christian sect.
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:34.440]  Before, just go die, or go to the local medicine woman.
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:42.540]  And so that's the issue, is that you are meant to provide the care.
[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:48.160]  You are meant to, let's say if you're having to get people crowns and stuff, you're supposed
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:51.540]  to call up companies and go, we'll give you all our business for crowns.
[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:57.640]  But are you gonna provide us a certain percentage of free stuff so we can give it to the poor?
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.500]  She used to, everybody just did that, understanding it's what you had to do.
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.900]  Now that's all gone, churches are gone.
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:07.460]  They're now 501c3, it's all gone.
[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:13.460]  So again, they come out and say, taxes are what you pay to have a civilization.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.020]  That's actually not true.
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:19.780]  Local taxes are what you do, you locally agree on some taxes if there's a big problem, a
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:20.780]  special problem.
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:26.460]  Or hey, we wanna build dikes to expand our shipping area, like the Dutch, and then locally
[02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:28.900]  you vote and you pay to do it.
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:36.600]  And then those jobs get paid locally to merchants and for people to expand the building of it.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.100]  But globalism is everything to these development zones.
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:43.980]  I mean, they all wrote books about it, Rollerball, James Caan in the 70s, there's a fiction movie
[02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:52.300]  about this where you've got Energy City, Manufacturing City, Computer City, Military City, all corporate
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:57.600]  cities run by the same guys where the corporate super elite land in these jet copters and
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.660]  they want the top Rollerball world champion's wife.
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:03.660]  And why?
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:07.220]  Because they're jealous of him and it's an exercise of power.
[02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:12.540]  This actually happened in Rome and other cultures, they would come to the top, sports heroes,
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:15.900]  you name it, say, I want your wife, and you had to give it to them.
[02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:20.400]  Folks, this stuff happens over and over and over again.
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:26.940]  What Prema Noctu, where they would in the Middle Ages come and demand your wife on the
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:29.460]  wedding night.
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:33.860]  This stuff has happened, that's what the TSA down your pants, all of it is an exact historical
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:36.580]  blueprint with a high tech overlay.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:40.360]  And so they get you into the cities, they do all this, and look at this commenter in
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:45.740]  our article, Democrats crank up death panel talk following Obama win.
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:50.140]  And I'm gonna play this clip here in a minute, but look at this commenter, he was commenter
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:54.580]  number 30, printed this this morning, it's a lot more comments now.
[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:59.140]  I have to agree with Bill Gates on this one, the American people cannot afford to spend
[02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:05.060]  1 million to keep a terminally ill patient alive in their later years.
[02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:10.740]  Someone who is 80 years old has lived a long life, and they also say kill babies up to
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:11.940]  age three now.
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:15.420]  We cannot print money forever, and music will stop sometimes.
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:21.540]  The analogy of laying off teachers is a good one, because we need to focus on the children
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:24.060]  which are the only hope that we have for the future.
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:30.180]  Man, that is a classic eugenic statement, that is carousel Logan's run, my mother's
[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:33.020]  in that movie, by the way.
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:39.100]  The point is, is that she never tried to be in a movie, one of her friends was going to
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:43.260]  be in Logan's run and she's in it a couple times, find those clips and play, it's pretty
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:44.260]  interesting.
[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:48.180]  The point is, is that when you hit 30, they kill you, they send you up in a gladiatorial
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:53.500]  event, a laser beam blows you to bits.
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:59.220]  All these things are in your face, Zardosh, where there's an elite that lives forever
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:01.060]  with high technology.
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:09.100]  And they have compact megacities where they then send out hunter killer drones to go out
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:12.660]  and kill the wild humans so their populations don't go up too high.
[02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:15.220]  I think you heard that, it's called Hunger Games.
[02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:21.020]  They're throwing it in your face over and over again, and it all has been written about
[02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:29.500]  200 years ago by Malthus, picked up 160 years ago by Galton, put out 100 years ago by HG
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:34.420]  Wells, who wrote scores of nonfiction books, I happen to have read them.
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:38.460]  In the movie Things to Come that came out what in the 30s, we guys find Things to Come,
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:46.020]  they've got B2 bombers, bat wing bombers of the world government flying around blowing
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:49.900]  up the holdout nation states and attacking gun owners.
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:42:00.180]  And it's clearly American gun owners being killed in the book and the movie.
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:02.220]  When do you write Things to Come in the 30s?
[02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:06.660]  Like in 1901, he wrote a book where they had atomic weapons.
[02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:12.780]  They already had the equations to build atomic weapons in the 1830s, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:17.180]  They are suppressing all of this stuff and they think they're God.
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:20.900]  And agenda 21 is not to help you.
[02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:26.740]  They take model cities, take the building restrictions off, take the taxes off to build
[02:42:26.740 --> 02:42:30.060]  all a bunch of high rises and make them beautiful and make them sexy.
[02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:32.460]  Austin is the world model of agenda 21.
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:37.140]  You already take a great first class city, great people, low taxes, everything, build
[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:43.260]  it all fancy and say this is agenda 21 like a piece of cheese on a rat trap to bring the
[02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:45.660]  rat in so it claps on his head.
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:47.780]  Cheese smells good, cheese looks good.
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:51.060]  And by the way, sometimes rats get really smart.
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:55.900]  An old trick, an old wives tale trick, and I've had to do it, drop a few other pieces
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:01.220]  of cheese on the ground lining up when they start seeing other rats get hit or mice get
[02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:04.360]  hit by the trap and get clapped.
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:07.180]  They stopped going and taking the cheese with the peanut butter.
[02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:09.540]  Well, you know what you do?
[02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:13.020]  You start putting other foods out because they associate the smell of that food with
[02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:14.020]  getting killed.
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:18.580]  Try this, does this, like the devil's always got this different sin.
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:19.580]  That didn't work?
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:20.580]  How about this?
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:22.700]  Is this the lever I find to move you?
[02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:26.140]  Well, if they stopped doing that, if you've killed 10 of the rats, you got to, they're
[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:28.900]  crapping in your attic, make stinking your house up.
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:29.900]  What do you do next?
[02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:31.940]  It happens to anybody who lives in the country.
[02:43:31.940 --> 02:43:36.720]  You dribble a few pieces of cheese out on the floor knowing they're gonna eat a couple
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.940]  pieces and think this is good.
[02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:40.260]  This is good.
[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:41.260]  This is good.
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:45.900]  I'm gonna get that last big piece, bam, you're dead.
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:49.780]  Boom, you're dead.
[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:54.060]  Kill you and your rat family.
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:55.780]  You don't buy his DVD.
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:44:00.020]  It's an inside joke, one of my favorite videos out there.
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:04.860]  All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, I said I'd go to your phone calls and I need
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:05.860]  to.
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:07.340]  See, I could talk for 10 hours about Gen 21.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.660]  I haven't even gotten into all the evidence.
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:13.460]  It's diabolical.
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:18.140]  And I mean, here's an example of the system and how evil it is.
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:21.700]  Did you know they're announcing in the United States if you are a sperm donor, they're going
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:29.460]  to give your information over and make you pay child support?
[02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:33.020]  That's a Gen 21, everything's a con game.
[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:36.900]  Sperm donor forced to pay child support to lesbian couple despite giving up parental
[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:42.380]  rights to the baby before she was born.
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:48.700]  It turns out the women broke up and the woman went into the state.
[02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:49.700]  And guess what?
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:50.700]  The woman don't have to pay.
[02:44:50.700 --> 02:44:53.500]  You gonna pay, Jack.
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:55.460]  You gonna pay, Jack.
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:45:00.740]  See, it's all about injustice.
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:01.740]  All about injustice.
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:06.180]  See, cuz he's a family man and produces and has some money.
[02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:09.740]  You gonna pay.
[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:14.780]  And that's why they're racing to shut everything down because once they shut it down, they've
[02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:15.780]  got you.
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:18.280]  And, my gosh, we're going bankrupt.
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:20.140]  We need to kill old people.
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:24.140]  And yeah, are there doctors that greedily know they've got a brain dead woman or man,
[02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:30.300]  79 years old, and they'll do double hip replacements and put 12 stints in their heart and do a
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:31.780]  brain surgery?
[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:38.780]  Yep, and it's up to the state board to prosecute those people, not the feds who are ten times
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:39.780]  more corrupt.
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:42.520]  See, they can always point at little local corruption.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:47.140]  There are million dollar cases where they go and take somebody who can't be saved and
[02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:48.140]  sit there and do this.
[02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:53.500]  But that's why you can't have a free country that's not moral.
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.420]  Rob Jacobson was talking to me during the last break.
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:46:00.540]  And he said, why can't we arm teachers, but we're gonna arm cops and trust them?
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:04.700]  And my example was, well, what about not arming pilots?
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:11.300]  You trust them to fly this giant, multi-ton, giant, 100-ton aircraft, giant missile, tens
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:14.860]  of thousands of times the power of a handgun or rifle, but you don't trust them to have
[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:16.340]  a gun in the cockpit.
[02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:22.060]  Cuz the message is you can't protect yourself and you can't take care of anything.
[02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:28.660]  And that's what a Gen 21 is, is the electronic kill grid, an attack on all civilization in
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:31.780]  the name of a new civilization.
[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:35.760]  Because the globalists can't let us chart the course of technology in a good direction
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.260]  because it will empower us to a level that will transcend the ancient psychopath guilds
[02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:46.220]  that set up predatory subunits and prey on their own species.
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:55.780]  We have decadent, degenerate, cancerous subspecies, homo sapiens psychopathicus, I don't know
[02:46:55.780 --> 02:46:58.540]  what you wanna call it.
[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:03.660]  We must transcend them by knowledge and teaching and understanding.
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:10.060]  Instead, we're letting these people play God because we don't crave being in charge, we
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:11.820]  give the world to them.
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:16.220]  You must first get over your fear and then you must move against the enemy or there's
[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:17.220]  no future.
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:21.580]  You think it's fun to get up on the nightly news last night and have Stuart Rhodes say
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:22.700]  the things he said on air?
[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:24.700]  It's very serious.
[02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:26.020]  He's a serious person and so am I.
[02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:33.540]  Now this isn't a game, this isn't a drill, this isn't a joke, this is the real deal.
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:34.920]  You're being targeted.
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:38.460]  They learned with Hitler, he moved too quick.
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:42.460]  They know how to kill you quietly and softly now and they've got all these little subsets
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:43.460]  of criminals.
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:48.940]  They even rate in computer systems, mid-level minions and what type they are and their psychological
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:49.940]  breakdown.
[02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:55.340]  It's all there in the giant globalist NSA data banks and they place the different psychology
[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:59.780]  types in different formations, all because they have the fruits of our labor.
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:03.340]  And soon they won't need the fruits of our labor because of robotics.
[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:08.140]  But they're gonna use the robotics in farming and manufacturing to first make us purely
[02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:15.300]  dependent where we'll do anything to get those bobbles and trinkets of rank and social standing
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:17.380]  but also survival.
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:21.020]  And then all the trinkets we're given will have a backdoor control to dehumanize us and
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:28.820]  track us and in the darkness bind us.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:32.660]  And so we must understand that they're gonna go, you're right, we can't trust pilots to
[02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:33.660]  fly planes.
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:37.220]  That's why they're robotic, who programs the robot.
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:42.900]  We're entering a psycho world run by technocrats, you're in a science fiction movie.
[02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:49.620]  And let me tell you, Gangnam style, I mean, all that stuff is rhythmically designed to
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:54.060]  distract you, to divert you, all the little goofy programmed world where everything's
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:55.060]  fun.
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:59.300]  Everything's funny, don't worry, it's all fun, it's all good, government loves me.
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:00.300]  It's a fraud.
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:04.060]  They're not gonna stop just killing the old people.
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:06.740]  They're gonna kill you and they're already killing you.
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:10.720]  And they're already introducing the idea of, all of Africa just died from that airborne
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:12.500]  Ebola or that mouse box.
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.260]  We've gotta lock down our cities, thank God we're safe.
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:21.660]  And yeah, yeah, well, you've retired now and we don't need you anymore, you're obsolete
[02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.060]  so we're gonna get rid of you.
[02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:25.340]  That's actually the plan.
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:29.380]  Let's go to Bill Gates talking about it, here it is.
[02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:37.460]  Bill Gates breaking it down, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:40.660]  We had a tricaster heart attack, all day we've been prepared to play this.
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:46.460]  This is a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs and a lack
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:51.180]  of willingness to say, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:58.620]  for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:49:59.800]  trade-off in medical costs?
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:04.180]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:05.180]  So you...
[02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:06.180]  Of course...
[02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:10.700]  Is it more interesting than you just said, would you just, the last three months in life
[02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:16.100]  for one person or something, because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that money,
[02:50:16.100 --> 02:50:18.620]  it means we lay off three teachers to do so.
[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:22.780]  I mean, in other words, we haven't had this type of allocation.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:28.400]  We're making that trade-off because of huge medical costs that are not examined to see
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  what...
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:30.400]  That's enough.
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:34.980]  And then you let a guy whose dad, it was the head of Planned Parenthood, an open eugenicist,
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:38.940]  so is Bill and his wife, you let a guy run your healthcare.
[02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:43.620]  The mistake we made was letting government and foreign corporations take over the healthcare
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:46.800]  and now they can totally engineer us.
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:50.540]  And I was talking to CJ during the last break, he'll come back and talk about it, about the
[02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:55.060]  illegal aliens are the only one that get charity care now because they're a client group meant
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:59.940]  to drive down the wages here domestically, just like prison labor.
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:02.860]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:06.820]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:08.460]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:12.500]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:13.500]  or gold?
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:16.860]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:19.040]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:23.220]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:24.220]  seeds.
[02:51:24.220 --> 02:51:29.500]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:31.380]  food for you and your family.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:35.260]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:39.180]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:44.860]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:53.380]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:58.240]  Remember in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:03.220]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:10.020]  Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:12.020]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:17.720]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:22.900]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:23.900]  tissues behave.
[02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:27.640]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:28.640]  to believe.
[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:34.460]  I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:36.620]  me with amazing health and joy.

[02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:07.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:14.300]  Today there's an article in the New York Times, no, not the one calling for us to turn all
[02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:21.460]  our guns in, literally, Georgetown law professor scrap archaic, idiosyncratic, and downright
[02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:22.460]  evil constitution.
[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:23.940]  That's a quote.
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:30.300]  Well, of course, a tyrant would call something that keeps separation of powers and checks
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:32.860]  and balances evil.
[02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:37.620]  As the nation teeters on the edge of fiscal chaos, observers are reaching the conclusion
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:40.180]  that the American system of government is broken.
[02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:45.260]  Cuz globalists have infiltrated it and maneuvered us towards being bankrupt, and the Republicans
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:49.940]  and Democrats are arguing over how much to increase taxes and how much to gut the country.
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:56.420]  Yeah, it's broken cuz you can't fully bankrupt us ten times over like you've done Greece.
[02:54:56.420 --> 02:55:01.620]  They wanna wreck us, folks, as the nation teeters on the edge of fiscal chaos.
[02:55:01.620 --> 02:55:06.020]  Yeah, by you people, observers are reaching the conclusion.
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:09.500]  And then the weak-minded go, yeah, I am, I'm mad about the Constitution.
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:15.060]  Darn it with property rights and juries and freedom and everything that made the country
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:16.060]  so wealthy.
[02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:17.900]  I want what they've got in North Korea.
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:22.500]  I want instant access with one hereditary dictator with big fat cheeks running everything.
[02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:25.680]  Hey, Hans, how you doing, Hans Blix?
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:27.700]  Come on in, Hans.
[02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:30.220]  We wanna resurrect Kim Jong-il, put him in charge.
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:32.780]  Yeah, he'll get things done.
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:35.420]  And this guy, it's not a dumb liberal.
[02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:38.300]  It's not a liberal saying get rid of our Constitution.
[02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:41.340]  They're pig tyrants.
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:43.300]  But they walk around with the NPR voice.
[02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:45.380]  Hi, I'm real friendly.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:46.380]  Get in the car, little kid.
[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:47.380]  It's the same thing.
[02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:50.620]  Shh, kid, no, get in the glue truck, little Orsi.
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:54.580]  I talk real soft and act non-threatening.
[02:55:54.580 --> 02:55:58.140]  Though we got the government arming against you, we want your guns.
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:56:01.460]  Yeah, we're real friendly.
[02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.460]  We're real liberal.
[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:03.460]  Yeah.
[02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:09.300]  You know, I get around these people and behind the scenes they're like, when we get you in
[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:14.460]  the feet of the cabs, we're gonna stomp your guts out and rape your wife.
[02:56:14.460 --> 02:56:16.820]  But in public, I'm liberal.
[02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:21.900]  I mean, just look at these people as the nation teeters.
[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:27.540]  Let me do it in the Ted Knight voice, as the nation teeters on the edge of financial chaos.
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:32.980]  Observers are reaching the conclusion that the American system of government is broken.
[02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:37.100]  Seidman wrote, but almost no one blames the culprit.
[02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:44.440]  Our insistence on obedience to the Constitution with all its archaic, idiosyncratic, and downright
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.220]  evil provisions.
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:47.820]  Time to scrap it.
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:51.600]  Time to scrap you, parasite.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:57.580]  Some nobody professor perched in there with Obama at Georgetown, perched in there like
[02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:05.020]  an elitist, seeing all of us like salami sandwiches in the coal case to be eaten off of and figuring
[02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:09.980]  out ways in the government empire that if we could just increase taxes and increase
[02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:18.300]  productivity, we would be able to have a higher standard of living for us, the governing class.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:23.620]  All I know how to do is sit around and act powerful and official all day.
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:29.820]  I mean, these people that run this government promote torture, murder, death, and then you
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:35.820]  see the lazy eyed Obama supporter, the average idiot, literally stumbling around half dead
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:37.580]  from vaccines and GMO.
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:41.780]  When they're 30 years old, they look like they're 50, they're killing us all.
[02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:47.340]  Just look at the kids look like dead slobs everywhere, rich neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods.
[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:49.780]  They're just killing all of us, just zombies.
[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:53.140]  And that's what I tell us were zombies always movies because we're turning into zombies
[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:57.340]  and it can be a simulation of there's always video games where you torture zombies now
[02:57:57.340 --> 02:58:00.260]  and the zombies are getting more and more human.
[02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:02.500]  And again, it's all stimulants to dehumanize us.
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:04.860]  They're telling us you're garbage, you're undead.
[02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:08.140]  We don't need you because see, they don't need biological androids anymore.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:10.300]  They've got machines now.
[02:58:10.300 --> 02:58:14.020]  Doesn't mean they won't take their time and have fun cutting off your resources and having
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:17.660]  your daughters, you know, get in the backs of their limousines to service them.
[02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:22.780]  All the elite literally defecate on them in many cases, you know, you know, see your daughter
[02:58:22.780 --> 02:58:23.780]  can get some money.
[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:24.780]  It won't matter.
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:29.860]  Oh, they're going to take their time psychopathically America and the world is one giant basement
[02:58:29.860 --> 02:58:33.900]  where a psychopath has all of us just having their way with us and they really want to
[02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:35.300]  have their way with us now.
[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:41.220]  But the second amendment stands on their way of gang raping and pulling our teeth out with
[02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:42.220]  pliers.
[02:58:42.220 --> 02:58:46.340]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:35.060]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

[02:59:55.980 --> 03:00:12.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:17.140]  By the way, I'm not joking and I've been in DC and other areas and I watched the cream.
[03:00:17.140 --> 03:00:19.500]  These women are more beautiful than Miss America.
[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:26.300]  Loading in to all the UN vehicles and ambassador vehicles to go to the different globalist
[03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:31.340]  facilities and literally, because you can read about statistically what the globalist
[03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:35.260]  are into, their art, everything, to absolutely desecrate beauty.
[03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:38.220]  That's what they live for.
[03:00:38.220 --> 03:00:45.380]  And because it's an act of domination because these are nasty demons and I for one am done
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:46.380]  with them.
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:51.580]  And I just wanna make sure that when the globalists implode our country, everybody knows who did
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:52.580]  it.
[03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:54.900]  Cuz what matters is who wins in the end.
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:00:57.900]  All's well that ends well, hmm?
[03:00:57.900 --> 03:00:58.900]  That's right.
[03:00:58.900 --> 03:01:04.780]  Did you think the universe would not organically generate things to resist you?
[03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:08.920]  You think your stupid computers that you can't even read are gonna be able to predict what
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:10.460]  humans are gonna do?
[03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:12.900]  You will destroy yourselves.
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:16.640]  Let me consciously tell you the truth.
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:20.140]  Your body is already ordering you dead.
[03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:25.580]  Because even though you're consciously a psychopath and inhabited by dark evil, your body, your
[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:30.300]  flesh even cries out against you.
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:33.900]  Because it was made by the creator and that's why you're so miserable and why you're so
[03:01:33.900 --> 03:01:35.700]  sick all you evil people.
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:39.660]  That's why you wanna make us sick cuz you're inherently spiritually sick.
[03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:42.980]  Well, let me tell you, the pit you've dug, you will fall into it.
[03:01:42.980 --> 03:01:43.980]  We will not.
[03:01:43.980 --> 03:01:47.420]  Feinstein and the militia, Jay, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:47.420 --> 03:01:50.380]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:52.380]  Thank you, sir, for holding my call.
[03:01:52.380 --> 03:01:58.780]  I wanted to mention a video on YouTube I saw a while back about the militia, the American
[03:01:58.780 --> 03:02:11.060]  militia movement in 1995 confronting the Senate subcommittee on terrorism with Dianne Feinstein.
[03:02:11.060 --> 03:02:16.500]  And they basically go up there a couple months after the Oklahoma City bombings-
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:18.580]  No, and they blame gun owners as terrorists.
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:20.420]  In fact, I saw those hearings live.
[03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:21.780]  What was the name of them?
[03:02:21.780 --> 03:02:24.340]  It was the Senate subcommittee on what?
[03:02:24.340 --> 03:02:28.900]  It was the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism.
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:32.020]  And I think it might have changed names a couple times or something.
[03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:44.320]  But anyway, it's just a perfect example of Mrs. Feinstein using race and demonizing the
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:47.260]  militia movement after this bombing happened.
[03:02:47.260 --> 03:02:48.260]  It's a really good video.
[03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:55.020]  You can see her, she asked them, each one to answer the question, do you think in any
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:58.180]  circumstance it is okay to bomb a building?
[03:02:58.180 --> 03:03:01.060]  And they get mad, and it's such a dumb question.
[03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.500]  I've seen those famous militia hearings.
[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:06.420]  We ought to re-air some of those tomorrow.
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:10.220]  It's Senate militia hearings, and there was a couple of them, but they're pretty powerful.
[03:03:10.220 --> 03:03:13.420]  And then there's a black militia guy, and they're asking if he hates black people, talking
[03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:14.420]  about that one?
[03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:15.420]  It's so stupid.
[03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:22.820]  Well, absolutely, no, no, no, I've seen the hearings, I will get to it.
[03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:25.180]  Thank you so much, God bless you, I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:28.780]  Heck, that's the hearing where she's talking about concealed carry.
[03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:33.220]  Sabra in Washington, last person we have time to get to, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:40.380]  Oh, Alex, Alex, this is Klingon from Washington State, Alex, I love you, Alex, you're Elijah,
[03:03:40.380 --> 03:03:41.380]  Alex.
[03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:44.420]  Alex, Alex, you're Elijah, you got the saints backing you up.
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:50.660]  Now listen to me, last night on George Norridge, 1247, Pacific time, he said his granddaughter,
[03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:55.780]  Rhianna, 18 years old, was run off the road yesterday, twirled around down an embankment.
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:56.780]  He was very upset.
[03:03:56.780 --> 03:03:57.780]  December 15th, Alex, are you listening, darling?
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:58.780]  Do you hear me?
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:03:59.780]  Yes.
[03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:00.780]  They wait for me, Alex.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.780]  They tried to rendition me, Alex.
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:02.780]  Do you remember me?
[03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:03.780]  I'm Klingon from Yahoo!
[03:04:03.780 --> 03:04:04.780]  Chat.
[03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:05.780]  I'm Sabra.
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:06.780]  I raise and train Rottweilers.
[03:04:06.780 --> 03:04:07.780]  Yeah, yeah, what happened to you?
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:08.780]  What happened to you?
[03:04:08.780 --> 03:04:16.780]  Oh, Alex, this was their technique, this was their technique.
[03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:20.460]  I only get off the property two or three times a year, we live on 30 acres, we're always
[03:04:20.460 --> 03:04:24.580]  working against the Satanists, always, trust me, we're really busy.
[03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:28.380]  Two or three years I get off the property, I went out for the first time in four months,
[03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:33.860]  they're on me, I'm coming back home, I'm at a stop sign, out of town, we live south of
[03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:34.860]  Bellingham, Washington.
[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:35.860]  And what happened?
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:41.820]  Yes, I'm at the light, it didn't turn red, I got a big one-ton van, sucks in behind me,
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:47.540]  an E-350 Mercedes is in front of me, I noticed right away, something was different.
[03:04:47.540 --> 03:04:48.540]  What'd they do?
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:49.540]  What'd they do to you?
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:50.540]  We're almost out of time.
[03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:54.780]  Oh, Alex, they tried to kill me, when they couldn't rendition me and stop me, they tried
[03:04:54.780 --> 03:04:56.940]  to run me into a pile of 20 cars.
[03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:06.700]  No, they got their black ops everywhere, everybody better be ready.
