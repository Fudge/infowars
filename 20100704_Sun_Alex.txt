[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:25.320]  Texas Alex Jones well we're into hour number two he's with us for 30 minutes
[00:25.320 --> 00:30.160]  running us from the Fox business studios he has the number one show on Fox
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.040]  business with its premiere the number one show because he's the hardest hitting
[00:36.040 --> 00:42.800]  contributor on Fox television he's the one guy that I can agree with 99% of the
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.440]  time I don't agree with myself hardly 99% of the time I'll tune into something I
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.200]  said a week ago and kind of go I didn't mean the way that sounded but Judge
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.240]  Andrew Napolitano is just amazing multi-time best-selling author former
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.440]  federal judge constitutional lawyer and he's with us for 30 minutes to talk
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.640]  about Elena Kagan the more we learn about her openly anti-gun she praises
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.080]  what Robert Bork called the worst judge in the world this Israeli judge who
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.480]  calls for judges to be activist to restrict free speech she calls for
[01:10.480 --> 01:14.840]  restricting free speech Obama using executive orders to try to ram through
[01:14.840 --> 01:19.640]  carbon taxes and on the coal plants now he wants to do it we've got eight
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.200]  senators telling us that's in Fox News and Reuters and other publications that
[01:24.200 --> 01:28.800]  he may use an executive order to legalize all the illegals which is
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.640]  pretty unconstitutional so we're gonna talk about it all with judge Andrew
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.080]  Napolitano judge good to have you here with us pleasure to be here Alex thank
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.240]  you for the kind things you said you actually promoted me I'm a former life
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.560]  tenured state judge state judge judge how about grand you in judge you know
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.120]  Kagan Kagan would like to have us under you in control she said so you know it's
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.920]  frightening to hear that she has said those things and one can only hope that
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.640]  they were the musings of a young lawyer because if she still holds those
[01:57.640 --> 02:02.440]  ideas that we should have judges like they do in Europe who can outlaw certain
[02:02.440 --> 02:08.200]  types of speech and compel compel certain types of economic activities that
[02:08.200 --> 02:11.960]  authority comes nowhere from the Constitution you and I have criticized
[02:11.960 --> 02:15.720]  George Bush who claimed that he got authority as president from some source
[02:15.720 --> 02:19.120]  he wouldn't say what the source was other than the Constitution it was
[02:19.120 --> 02:22.800]  absurd and almost every time he claimed that the court itself knocked him down
[02:22.800 --> 02:27.240]  now we have a would-be and probably will-be member of the court who is
[02:27.240 --> 02:30.600]  claiming that the court has authority from some source other than the
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.240]  Constitution and that they should use it according to their political
[02:34.240 --> 02:40.720]  predilections this and this alone is enough to to block her from being
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.160]  confirmed but the Democrats have 59 senators I'm sure she'll get in no
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.080]  matter what she said well what about the quote from her 93 law review where she
[02:50.080 --> 02:55.320]  publicly wrote that if we don't like speech we will quote disappear it and
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.800]  now Obama openly announces the internet electronic kill switch under
[02:59.800 --> 03:05.040]  cybersecurity the FCC proposes black boxes in our homes that filter what we
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.760]  can see and that tracks everything we're doing I mean you talk about the
[03:09.760 --> 03:12.640]  bottom falling out that you've always warned about as a constitutional law
[03:12.640 --> 03:17.440]  scholar that once you go over that threshold that there's nothing there
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.600]  underpinning it historically we always accelerate into tyranny what's your take
[03:22.600 --> 03:27.080]  on her confirmation and will she get confirmed we've seen national polls of
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.600]  less than 38% support her and and what do you say about Obama's move to openly
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.360]  take over the internet all right a couple things first of all the concept of a
[03:37.360 --> 03:43.040]  box in the house rings of the Chinese government and rings of George Orwell's
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.000]  1984 and it is inconceivable that that could be constitutional under the law
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.400]  because the the threshold of your house makes you the the king of your castle
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.520]  and if the Constitution is going to be followed the government can't enter
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.160]  directly physically or constructively without a search warrant from a judge
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.160]  that's the law I don't know that she would uphold it that way but I believe
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.640]  that a majority of the Supreme Court will secondly regrettably unfortunately I
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.880]  believe that she will be conferred simply confirmed simply because she is the
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.520]  nominee of a of a Democratic president and the Democrats have 59 votes in the
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.400]  Senate they don't care what she says she will of course tickle their ivories
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.960]  when she says progressive things that's with an uppercase T and progressive like
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.840]  you have just quoted her as having said because the Democrats don't believe in
[04:35.840 --> 04:38.720]  freedom and many Republicans are in the same boat the big government crap
[04:38.720 --> 04:44.360]  doesn't believe in freedom they believe in power and in conformity let's get
[04:44.360 --> 04:47.680]  back into that when we return and I want to talk more about your TV show
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.680]  because this is so important I mean liberty is what is most popular the
[04:52.680 --> 04:57.840]  message that Andrew Napolitano is putting out is winning in the court of
[04:57.840 --> 05:03.120]  ideas this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.480 --> 05:11.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.720]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.720 --> 05:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.280]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[05:43.640 --> 05:48.760]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.my
[05:48.760 --> 05:52.880]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[05:52.880 --> 06:01.280]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:01.280 --> 06:11.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[06:11.600 --> 06:19.120]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[06:19.120 --> 06:24.960]  alex jones we're gonna be skipping this network right coming up so judge
[06:24.960 --> 06:28.160]  andrew napolitano have plenty of time with us he's with us until the bottom of
[06:28.160 --> 06:35.200]  the hour he just finished taping in his show that will air Saturday on the fox
[06:35.200 --> 06:40.480]  business channel it premiered last week to the highest ratings of any show on
[06:40.480 --> 06:45.800]  the fox business network and my friends I mean I've said I can find no fault with
[06:45.800 --> 06:49.960]  judge andrew napolitano I mean he exposes the world government he exposes
[06:49.960 --> 06:53.920]  the false left-right paradigm he stands up for the bill of rights and the
[06:53.920 --> 07:01.120]  constitution no matter you know how politically incorrect it is and he is
[07:01.120 --> 07:05.320]  just such a great researcher and a fighter for liberty and the fact that
[07:05.320 --> 07:11.400]  out of the gates his show is number one what does that say chris mathews can't
[07:11.400 --> 07:15.360]  get any viewers you know why does fox news have conservatively five to ten
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.880]  times depending on the show the viewers of chris mathews on MSNBC it's because
[07:20.880 --> 07:25.760]  no one wants to hear establishment status socialist globalist lies and
[07:25.760 --> 07:31.160]  propaganda and you know compared to the rest of fox news I mean judge andrew
[07:31.160 --> 07:36.360]  napolitano is you know like glenn beck and the rest of fox is like chris
[07:36.360 --> 07:42.000]  mathews I mean I'm sorry if I had to use the analogy here and so that he's got
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.280]  top ratings but I knew it was gonna happen I mean I told him off air last
[07:45.280 --> 07:48.600]  one was on I said watch you're gonna be number one I said guaranteed because the
[07:48.600 --> 07:53.120]  people are hungry and so so talk about the success and then we're gonna get
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.240]  into Obama's increasingly imperial presidency that according to my
[07:58.240 --> 08:03.000]  research is is is exceeding anything we've ever seen in this country but
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.560]  first the second show coming up this Saturday tell people about it and what
[08:07.560 --> 08:12.720]  the success of your transmission means well the success of our transmission
[08:12.720 --> 08:16.080]  means a couple things it means that you can take a show from the internet and
[08:16.080 --> 08:23.680]  bring it to the TV screen it means that there is a thirst out there for a focus
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.800]  on the government that has a bias in favor of human liberty but believes that
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.960]  the individual is greater than the state that the individual has natural rights
[08:32.960 --> 08:37.560]  and an immortal soul and the government is just an artificial creation based on
[08:37.560 --> 08:42.400]  fear and force but the Constitution means what it says that that government is
[08:42.400 --> 08:46.240]  best which governs least that the people are entitled to a constitution to a
[08:46.240 --> 08:49.640]  government that stays within the confines of the Constitution and that the
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.040]  Constitution was written to keep the backs off the people now none of those
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.200]  is a radical argument those are words for the most part from founding fathers
[08:59.200 --> 09:03.320]  and statesmen throughout the country unfortunately they don't resonate to
[09:03.320 --> 09:07.200]  the government they resonate to people who watch the government which is why I
[09:07.200 --> 09:11.880]  refer to myself care seriously and half and chest on the show as a night
[09:11.880 --> 09:16.320]  watchman my job is to watch the government undercover of darkness and
[09:16.320 --> 09:21.000]  report to whoever wants to watch the show when the government steals liberty
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.320]  and when the government steals property and as you know Alex and you've been a
[09:24.320 --> 09:28.680]  pioneer here governments of both political parties I should say government
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.360]  of the one big government party whether it's Republican branch and its
[09:32.360 --> 09:38.040]  Democratic branch steal liberty and steal property every day when I attacked
[09:38.040 --> 09:43.080]  the Bush administration for this you know there are a lot of Republicans who
[09:43.080 --> 09:49.080]  kept their noses out of joint this morning when we taped our show for this
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.720]  weekend congressman Dana Rorobacker a right down the middle conservative
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.640]  Republican from Southern California former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan
[09:57.640 --> 10:03.440]  looked at me and said almost all Republicans in the House of Representatives
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.760]  now believe that the war in Iraq was a mistake that it was unlawful that it
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.000]  was immoral that it wasn't worth the lives lost or the trillions that will be
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.920]  spent now that is newsworthy that he would say it it is newsworthy that so
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.760]  many Republicans would change their mind it is newsworthy that people are
[10:24.760 --> 10:28.800]  starting to recognize that the government at almost all levels is out of
[10:28.800 --> 10:34.240]  control and there is a need for the Alex Jones show and for free to watch to
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.280]  remind people and when they know where to go they will go to listen to what the
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.880]  government is doing to them well there's no doubt that on a level playing
[10:43.880 --> 10:47.560]  field where the ideas of the Constitution the bill of rights are
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.120]  founders common sense when it's given a level playing field we win every time
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.560]  it's like you know last year's Super Bowl team playing a group of five-year-old
[10:59.560 --> 11:06.600]  Pee Wee you know football players and that's why Obama is openly coming out
[11:06.600 --> 11:10.600]  the FCC the Federal Trade Commission and this isn't just on Freedom Watch or
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.440]  info wars.com now ladies and gentlemen it's now in the AP in the financial
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.960]  times of London Obama to have kill switch government to have black box in
[11:19.960 --> 11:25.320]  house that watches everything you do and filters what you can see government to
[11:25.320 --> 11:28.880]  have megaphone government to have behavior placement I mean this is
[11:28.880 --> 11:34.520]  bonafide tyranny this is proposed by the Republicans favorite Democrat Joe
[11:34.520 --> 11:41.720]  Lieberman of Connecticut under the guise of well if we are attacked if the power
[11:41.720 --> 11:45.640]  grid is attacked if the internet is attacked the president has to have the
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.120]  power to turn it off before the attackers can get out the power is not
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.200]  hooked up to the internet precisely there's so much ill logic in there but
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.440]  put aside the illogic what about the Constitution what about if I want my
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.640]  laptop turned off I'll turn it off what about the fact that the laptop is just a
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.440]  modern way to exercise my freedom of speech and the whole purpose of the
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.160]  First Amendment according to Justice William Brennan one of the most liberal
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.600]  appointees of the 20th century is to keep the government out of the business
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.360]  of deciding what I read and what I watch and what I hear and presumes that the
[12:22.360 --> 12:27.240]  individual is competent to decide what to read watch here and say there is
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.160]  absolutely no authority under the Constitution whether under the under
[12:31.160 --> 12:36.360]  the guise of public safety or not and the government has always used public
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.680]  safety as the excuse to steal our liberties for the government to control
[12:40.680 --> 12:44.520]  the internet all how the government would love to have the power over the
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.680]  internet that the Chinese government has over the internet there the internet
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.680]  has been the greatest tool of the exchange of ideas and of the search for
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.640]  truth since the invention of the printing press they can't control the
[12:57.640 --> 13:03.480]  printing press so they want to control the internet and expanding on that they
[13:03.480 --> 13:07.120]  know they can't compete with our ideas that's why Cass Sunstein the regulations
[13:07.120 --> 13:12.480]  are that's why the FCC's diversity czar praises censorship of Hugo Chavez I
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.200]  mean I think Americans need to realize that we're dealing with bona fide
[13:17.200 --> 13:24.240]  despots and tyrants here and we see Obama you know as bad as Bush was as
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.160]  bad as Clinton was it's just a progression but now because they're no
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.000]  there's a wake a huge awakening happening they are accelerating their
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.080]  takeover and we see him federalizing the auto industry federalizing the banks
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.760]  we see him now according to eight senators and Fox News and others are
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.960]  reporting that Obama plans to sign an executive order legalizing all the
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.720]  illegal aliens for those that aren't a constitutional lawyer like yourself or a
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.880]  former top state judge the judge Andrew Napolitano will you explain to them
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.840]  because for my layman research the president executes law and the
[14:02.840 --> 14:10.320]  legislative passes it that is treason that is a act of sedition against our
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.960]  Republic to have the president say that I'm gonna launch a war without
[14:15.960 --> 14:21.200]  Congress's approval I'm gonna legalize foreigners I mean can you speak to that
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.320]  sure sure I can speak to it the president is taking a note to uphold the
[14:25.320 --> 14:30.120]  Constitution and the laws when the president does things like intimidate
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.120]  the bondholders of GM and Chrysler during their bankruptcies to break the
[14:34.120 --> 14:38.040]  law intimidate the banks to accept tarp monies that they don't want
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.440]  intimidate BP to cough up 58 20 billion dollar flush fund but his political
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.760]  appointee can distribute however he wants intimidate insurance company
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.600]  executives not to raise premiums until the law that prohibits the raise comes
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.960]  into effect he is effectively writing laws himself that is on its face
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.280]  unconstitutional because the Constitution says only the Congress can
[15:03.280 --> 15:08.960]  write laws and not the president the flip side of this is when he says we
[15:08.960 --> 15:11.960]  haven't heard this out of his mouth but we've heard it from people around him
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.880]  and they're not denying it which is why Fox and other outlets are reporting it
[15:16.880 --> 15:23.080]  he is considering a blanket amnesty of all illegals in the country the last time
[15:23.080 --> 15:26.400]  we had an amnesty was in the Reagan administration it was done by the
[15:26.400 --> 15:32.040]  Congress only the Congress can do this by changing the law does the Congress
[15:32.040 --> 15:35.640]  have the power to change the law yes does the president have the power to
[15:35.640 --> 15:40.760]  change the law no so what could he do well he could with the stroke of a pen
[15:40.760 --> 15:59.720]  stop arrest and stop all deportations

[20:07.360 --> 20:10.720]  network network
[20:10.720 --> 20:17.920]  i would imagine you're aware of this case but it's been in the salt lake
[20:17.920 --> 20:21.760]  city papers nat hentov has written about it
[20:21.760 --> 20:27.200]  for the redding eagle philadelphia man indicted for using right to free speech
[20:27.200 --> 20:29.920]  and i saw this a few months ago but now they're going ahead
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.680]  with the three felonies and the party's been charged for
[20:33.680 --> 20:37.680]  he was watching an unemployment debate about getting rid of his benefits
[20:37.680 --> 20:45.200]  and his quote is that are you crazy are you all insane
[20:45.200 --> 20:49.120]  no checks equals no food for me do you get it
[20:49.120 --> 20:56.160]  and he sent it as an email and under the telecommunications act of 1996
[20:56.160 --> 21:03.440]  under section 1934 he did utilize a telecommunications device
[21:03.440 --> 21:09.120]  um whether or not communication ensued without disclosing his identity it was
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.000]  his email and with the intent to annoy abuse
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.600]  threaten and harass any person who received the communication
[21:15.600 --> 21:18.560]  and it says he would serve the three counts concurrently
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.800]  as much as 30 years federally in prison for saying for calling
[21:22.800 --> 21:29.440]  the senator insane i would think that uh a federal judge would not permit such
[21:29.440 --> 21:32.720]  a prosecution i'm convinced absolutely that the third
[21:32.720 --> 21:36.240]  circuit court of appeals which is the federal appeals court that covers
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.320]  pennsylvania would invalidate that court particularly
[21:40.320 --> 21:45.600]  uh has a tradition uh of being very pro individual against the government when
[21:45.600 --> 21:49.520]  it comes to expressively sure but what does this say about the mindset
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.000]  of the people uh that are in these federal positions these federal
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.080]  prosecutors i mean now i mean that's an example of how they can
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.240]  pass a law and then not use it till 14 years later it's like well the law the
[22:02.240 --> 22:05.440]  law is unconstitutionally vague and quite frankly
[22:05.440 --> 22:08.480]  alex there are supreme court opinions that say
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.240]  the the congress cannot stop you from annoying
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.160]  or offensive speech because the first amendment protects annoying or offensive
[22:16.160 --> 22:21.120]  speech and the supreme court for all of all of the wacky things that it's done
[22:21.120 --> 22:23.920]  you know it's uh it allowed slavery it allowed
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.640]  abortion uh it allows prosecutions of uh of crimes that
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.840]  should exist today by a nine to nothing vote gave federal prosecutors
[22:33.840 --> 22:37.680]  the greatest rebuke that they have ever had
[22:37.680 --> 22:41.600]  in modern times when it found unconstitutional their favorite tool
[22:41.600 --> 22:46.000]  their favorite weapon which is the honest services law
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.720]  that law allowed federal prosecutors to prosecute even people who did the right
[22:50.720 --> 22:56.000]  thing if they harbored in their mind a desire to benefit from it
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.280]  themselves the mayor of newark new jersey
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.120]  went to jail because he had sex with a real estate agent
[23:03.120 --> 23:07.840]  that the city hired to sell city property did she sell the city property at
[23:07.840 --> 23:11.120]  market rates yes did the city lose a nickel
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.600]  yes but because the mayor had sex with her he was convicted by a federal
[23:15.600 --> 23:19.920]  prosecutor who's now the governor of new jersey and by a federal jury in newark
[23:19.920 --> 23:24.240]  for violating the honest services law he was more interested in sex than he was
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.360]  in a professional relationship well that's a thought crime i mean that's
[23:27.360 --> 23:30.720]  that's controlling who we can associate with the supreme court today with
[23:30.720 --> 23:34.000]  everybody from ruth bader kinsburg to anton and scalia and the other seven
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.080]  in between agreeing invalidated that and said to the feds you cannot use
[23:40.080 --> 23:45.680]  language creatively to prosecute people you must use statutory language
[23:45.680 --> 23:49.120]  narrowly now at the risk of getting too into the weeds
[23:49.120 --> 23:52.640]  i make this argument for you alex because i am convinced
[23:52.640 --> 23:55.760]  that this prosecution about which you have rightly complained
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.520]  and which you have wonderfully exposed in philadelphia what never to occur
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.600]  and if it does occur will be thrown out at the appellate level especially
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.080]  especially after this case came down today but we should not even have people
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.120]  in a position of power in a position to decide
[24:11.120 --> 24:15.040]  who gets indicted and who gets prosecuted who have a mindset that they
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.360]  can use the power of the government to punish
[24:17.360 --> 24:21.520]  speech because if anything is sacrosanct in this country is that you can say
[24:21.520 --> 24:25.200]  anything you want anytime you want anywhere you want about anybody in the
[24:25.200 --> 24:27.600]  government well that's what so that's what's so
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.000]  incredible about this is that we see countless videos of police beating
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.240]  somebody up and then charging the person they've beat up with assaulting them
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.720]  you see countless uh you know videos of police going to the wrong house and
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.640]  killing somebody's chihuahua we see countless videos of police all over
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.360]  the country pulling a motorcycler over who has a camera mounted on his head
[24:49.360 --> 24:52.560]  because he's he's videotaping him a youtube video
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.120]  and inditing him for wiretapping when there's no reasonable perception of
[24:57.120 --> 25:01.200]  privacy i mean more and more the government is
[25:01.200 --> 25:04.880]  really showing us that they want to be
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.880]  tyrants that this is real tyranny but the good news is
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.040]  and it's evidenced by your show being the number one show out of the gates
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.920]  on the fox business network with its first premiere
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.160]  is that the sleeping giant is awakening i cannot stress enough judge andrew
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.720]  depolitano and for all the listeners out there i want
[25:22.720 --> 25:24.720]  you to briefly comment on this because we're almost out of time
[25:24.720 --> 25:28.720]  that when we say there's an awakening happening i don't think the system even
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.720]  understands how big this is i think i think you're right
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.960]  and and i've been privileged to come along at the right time my show freedom
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.520]  watch which can be seen on the fox business network 10 a.m and
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.840]  8 p.m these are eastern times on saturday 7 p.m
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.960]  and 11 p.m eastern on sunday has sort of captured the crest of a wave if you
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.600]  ask people run folks hoping this and he's right
[25:53.600 --> 25:56.320]  do you want to take care of yourself or you want the government to take care of
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.040]  you do you want to make decisions on your own or do you want the government to
[25:59.040 --> 26:02.240]  make decisions for you do you want to be able to think as you please and say
[26:02.240 --> 26:04.880]  what you think and publish what you say or do you want the government to
[26:04.880 --> 26:07.920]  interfere with that when you put things to people like that
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.200]  almost everyone comes down on the side of freedom
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.240]  and that's what's made freedom watch successful that's what's made you
[26:14.240 --> 26:16.960]  successful and that's what's made the government
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.600]  fearful well there's nothing better the few times in my life when i've had a
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.880]  chance to go for a hike a week long hike where you got the
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.960]  backpack on you got your tent you've got your food and just to go out there and
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.400]  to rely on yourself and it's really an analogy of that
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.840]  i mean i don't want a bunch of distant bureaucrats who happen to be crooks
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.200]  nine times out of ten running my life it's so fundamental they've
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.400]  bankrupted our society they've launched all these illegal wars
[26:42.400 --> 26:45.920]  bush three weeks ago was out giving speeches about how he ordered torture
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.200]  meanwhile they sent people to prison who followed those orders
[26:49.200 --> 26:53.920]  i mean this is tyranny and i keep saying that i mean folks do you know where
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.400]  tyranny leads and i think god's given us a chance i think you know
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.760]  history is giving us a chance judge and i want you to speak to this
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.480]  we are at a crossroads and if good people like yourself and ron paul and many
[27:06.480 --> 27:10.800]  others but also just the rank and file folks out there stand up as leaders
[27:10.800 --> 27:14.400]  speak up point out the emperor is wearing no clothes
[27:14.400 --> 27:17.840]  and rebuke this evil like hitler should have been rebuked
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.760]  like stalin should have been rebuked or mousy tongue before they really got
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.280]  going we have a chance to avert a historical disaster
[27:25.280 --> 27:29.120]  because there's no doubt studying history that if we don't take america back
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.640]  right now america won't lead us into the 21st century
[27:32.640 --> 27:36.640]  worldwide for liberty america will lead the way into a new dark age
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.120]  of despotism that dwarfs anything ever seen in the history of man
[27:41.120 --> 27:44.480]  i am reading a terrific book it's the second time i've read it in my life
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.880]  it's hayek's h-a-y-e-k f-a hayek's the road to serfdom
[27:48.880 --> 27:55.200]  it was written in 1944 and it describes how europe descended into serfdom as
[27:55.200 --> 27:59.920]  people like musselini and hitler were popularly elected against legitimate
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.520]  opponents and the public and the and the government gave them all the power that
[28:03.520 --> 28:08.480]  they had it is eerily eerily reminiscent
[28:08.480 --> 28:11.840]  eerily predictive because it was written 65
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.240]  years ago of exactly what's happening today central planning
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.600]  by bureaucrats not even by profitably elected officials
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.600]  but by bureaucrats the decision that power is more in is more uh in the
[28:25.600 --> 28:28.960]  spotlight than liberty the decision that individuals
[28:28.960 --> 28:31.920]  should not be able to make choices for themselves
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.320]  look we have to be on the watch for the boss of liberty it doesn't happen
[28:36.320 --> 28:38.720]  overnight you'll take my life but i'll take
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.280]  yours too you fire musket but i'll run you through
[28:43.280 --> 28:48.080]  so when you're waiting for the next attack you better stand there's no turning
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.240]  back the fear will surge the times begins
[28:52.240 --> 28:58.480]  but on this battlefield no one wins the smell of earthly smoke and heartless breath

[31:08.000 --> 31:11.520]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[31:11.520 --> 31:15.520]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[31:15.520 --> 31:18.800]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[31:18.800 --> 31:22.240]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[31:22.240 --> 31:26.640]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[31:26.640 --> 31:30.240]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream

[32:02.480 --> 32:06.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[32:06.480 --> 32:08.960]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[32:08.960 --> 32:12.800]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:12.800 --> 32:16.800]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[32:16.800 --> 32:20.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[32:20.320 --> 32:23.920]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:23.920 --> 32:27.840]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:27.840 --> 32:31.360]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[32:31.360 --> 32:34.480]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[32:34.480 --> 32:37.600]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[32:37.600 --> 32:41.040]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[32:41.040 --> 32:43.600]  solar powered generators offered by solutions from science
[32:43.600 --> 32:49.280]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[33:01.120 --> 33:06.720]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones
[33:06.720 --> 33:23.200]  broadcasting network network
[33:25.600 --> 33:28.560]  well ladies and gentlemen i want to thank you for joining us
[33:28.560 --> 33:32.960]  we're named ron paul with us until about 55 after today unless
[33:32.960 --> 33:36.320]  the bell rings he's got to go vote we appreciate him joining us
[33:36.320 --> 33:40.000]  i'm just not going to mince words i'm going to go through a laundry list
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.240]  of issues congressman as you know the FCC
[33:44.240 --> 33:47.920]  has said they want to start taking over the internet the federal communications
[33:47.920 --> 33:50.800]  commission we also have the federal trade commission
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.040]  saying they want to start taxing the internet and literally funding old line
[33:55.040 --> 33:59.200]  media that sounds like it violates the first amendment and so many others
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.760]  we have a kagan with their anti first amendment statements about
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.920]  disappearing speech that the government finds to be hurtful
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.040]  as long as the government feels it's a moral reason they can restrict our
[34:11.040 --> 34:14.720]  speech and we've got the federal election commission
[34:14.720 --> 34:18.800]  coming after campaign for liberty as you put out your press release yesterday
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.680]  saying you can't put out letters telling people how members of
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.440]  congress have voted i mean this is 180 degrees
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.880]  the opposite of what our country was founded on i can't even believe this is
[34:30.880 --> 34:33.520]  happening can you speak to that and where this is going
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.520]  well it's going the wrong direction obviously and
[34:37.520 --> 34:41.360]  that is what i understand about campaign for liberty they've had
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.360]  somebody at least make a charge and file a complaint
[34:45.360 --> 34:51.360]  that there was a violation but it probably won't hold up hopefully but the
[34:51.360 --> 34:54.960]  whole idea that people think they can and harass you and you go through this
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.640]  legal maneuvering because that is the goal of many is to control us
[34:58.640 --> 35:02.240]  i think the main goal is also to control the internet they're very interested
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.120]  in that the other day we had a sound like a pretty
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.680]  benign vote it was under suspension and that was
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.720]  to praise the idea that government and private entities would study
[35:12.720 --> 35:16.640]  and work together on how to provide cyber security
[35:16.640 --> 35:20.000]  and i don't know if there's anybody else that voted against it i voted against it
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.840]  just on this principle that we don't need that we don't need
[35:23.840 --> 35:27.280]  this private sources cooperating with the federal reserve but you know the
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.280]  government forces in order to have cyber security i don't think
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.640]  the government's interested in our security they're interested in their
[35:34.640 --> 35:38.400]  security but yes i think everything is moving
[35:38.400 --> 35:41.360]  going especially with this administration is going the wrong direction
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.520]  and i've always been fearful of them uh wanting to take over the internet you
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.040]  know they've now made this announcement that you know if necessary
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.240]  they might even just close down the internet which would be
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.240]  devastating to all of us well that's what laborman said on sienna and he said
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.080]  china has this power we need it and i would imagine they'll shut it down a
[36:00.080 --> 36:03.360]  few times but turn it right back on and say see
[36:03.360 --> 36:11.040]  we saved it unfortunately i'm afraid that could very well happen
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.000]  well expanding on that uh two things and i want your specific take on this
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.640]  congressman ron paul we appreciate you joining us today
[36:18.640 --> 36:21.840]  this shows that we're really having an effect that they're harassing campaign
[36:21.840 --> 36:24.800]  for liberty that they're openly coming out and saying they
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.200]  want to restrict free speech put taxes quote on conspiracy theories and cast
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.240]  sunstein at the white house the regulations are said like
[36:32.240 --> 36:35.120]  anthropogenic global warming if you deny that
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.360]  maybe we should tax you or fine you i mean the fact that they want to shut us
[36:39.360 --> 36:45.120]  up shows that we're gaining ground a and b doesn't it reveal to everyone
[36:45.120 --> 36:48.240]  just how tyrannical these people really are
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.600]  yeah i think it does and uh it's a real job to sort all this out because
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.720]  sometimes people think that all we need are a couple more republicans and i
[36:56.720 --> 37:00.000]  will solve the problem but that's not necessarily the case
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.200]  but right now is the democrats who are in charge
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.120]  and they're the ones who are you know right wanting to radicalize
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.160]  this whole whole thing and uh we know that that is the agenda of
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.920]  many you know in the establishment and that is more government control and
[37:15.920 --> 37:18.960]  less personal freedom more taxes the whole mess
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.120]  that we've been fighting but uh i i still
[37:23.120 --> 37:28.400]  you know hold the hold out that the people people are waking up and uh
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.400]  and it may well be that the opposition that is the government is
[37:32.400 --> 37:35.520]  being very getting very concerned that the people
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.760]  are becoming alert from all that has been done in the freedom movement
[37:39.760 --> 37:45.360]  well senator uh demit reported that 94 percent of senate bills are not read
[37:45.360 --> 37:50.400]  out of the number in the house is similar uh and so 94 percent of the
[37:50.400 --> 37:53.360]  bills aren't even looked at special interest or writing and we've had a
[37:53.360 --> 37:58.240]  offshore corporate coup and then separately
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.760]  they passed the law in the house what two days ago to not let
[38:01.760 --> 38:04.960]  quote special interest tell you how someone is voted
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.800]  months before an election a restriction of free speech
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.480]  uh so they're not reading the bills and they don't want us to know
[38:12.480 --> 38:19.040]  how they voted and the fec uh is uh trying to keep campaigns from liberty
[38:19.040 --> 38:21.200]  for being able to tell people how folks voted
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.200]  i mean this really is tyranny well yes and they
[38:25.200 --> 38:29.280]  they want to make sure that independent organizations and corporations
[38:29.280 --> 38:32.080]  can't spend their money or tell people how they vote
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.680]  but you know there are corporations and this is where i think
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.560]  you can fall into the category because if you run a newspaper you have a tv show
[38:42.560 --> 38:45.520]  that's a corporation can be a corporation but they're not going to
[38:45.520 --> 38:48.560]  regulate them so if there is an organization or a
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.720]  political action committee or a private group or corporation who wants to tell
[38:52.720 --> 38:56.240]  people how they vote no you might be restricted but they never think for a
[38:56.240 --> 38:59.840]  minute they they should restrict the media assuming that the media is always
[38:59.840 --> 39:02.960]  going to be radical left and defend their candidates
[39:02.960 --> 39:08.000]  but you know there's just a few people on uh on cable and radio and other places
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.240]  that uh they you know the way i would understand what they're doing
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.840]  they still haven't come to uh trying to regulate
[39:15.840 --> 39:18.960]  what uh the tv stations are saying or what the
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.520]  radios are saying congressman going into another very important
[39:23.520 --> 39:26.480]  subject i almost fell off my chair last friday
[39:26.480 --> 39:29.440]  when the washington post admitted in an article
[39:29.440 --> 39:33.600]  uh that they're set to pass the financial reform bill
[39:33.600 --> 39:36.400]  they admitted their six hundred trillion into revatives
[39:36.400 --> 39:39.840]  they went on that was the first time i'd seen that in a mainstream publication
[39:39.840 --> 39:42.960]  just to admit that the federal reserve is going to have a new
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.600]  uh group with almost total autonomy that was their words
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.240]  to control all other financial institutions the texas banking association
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.840]  president has said that the very groups that gave us derivatives
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.280]  with an unfair trade advantage for themselves want to be able to take over
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.440]  all the smaller local banks and that really out of the crisis
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.120]  the big mega banks jp morgan chase goldman sachs and others created
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.960]  they are now going to get even more power over the rest of the economy
[40:10.960 --> 40:14.240]  and that this is an expanded federal reserve coup
[40:14.240 --> 40:17.600]  of america can you elaborate on that and give us
[40:17.600 --> 40:22.000]  yeah and i think you uh you've described it rather well but that's not the way
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.520]  they claim it is you know they claim well this is going to protect the
[40:25.520 --> 40:28.960]  consumers it's not run by the fed they don't have
[40:28.960 --> 40:32.400]  authority but it's going to be in the federal reserve
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.920]  they do not have control over the policy but guess what
[40:35.920 --> 40:41.760]  is who pays for it so it isn't even appropriation it isn't even you know
[40:41.760 --> 40:45.280]  part of the appropriation process so you have this new
[40:45.280 --> 40:48.240]  regulatory agency supposed to protect the consumer
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.560]  but i think it's going to protect uh the special interest is about all the
[40:52.560 --> 40:55.520]  benefits and then then got bailed out so
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.440]  it's uh this this package which passed the house yesterday
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.480]  um you know is very bad for for all of us and it does give more power to all
[41:04.480 --> 41:07.200]  the regulators especially the federal reserve
[41:07.200 --> 41:09.840]  i don't know whether you want to talk about it now but that's where i offered
[41:09.840 --> 41:12.560]  my motion to recommit dealing with the audit
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.400]  defense bill you read were you up on that no that that's exactly where i wanted
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.040]  to go next i wanted to illustrate for listeners that just joined us that
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.720]  congressman ron paul is here 20 something years ago in congress
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.840]  he couldn't get one co-sponsor and i wanted to make this point
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.680]  it seems the house and senator schizofrennik the house votes by two
[41:29.680 --> 41:33.520]  thirds uh to pass your bill to truly audit the
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.920]  quasi-governmental uh banking holding company the federal reserve that took
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.600]  over in 1913 but then which is the right thing to do but it never
[41:41.600 --> 41:44.560]  passed the senate properly uh and then now
[41:44.560 --> 41:47.680]  they're back giving the federal reserve even more power
[41:47.680 --> 41:51.440]  outside of government and congress uh to regulate themselves
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.840]  i mean this is amazing so break that oxymoron down for us and tell us about
[41:55.840 --> 41:58.960]  your new amendment well it tells you about the
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.120]  hypocrisy of this whole place and how it works and how powerful the fed is
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.000]  you're right we passed it in the financial services committee
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.280]  the audit the fed bill and uh it was part of the reform package then it
[42:11.280 --> 42:14.960]  came to the house floor and they kept it in so the house floor supported it
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.920]  we have 320 co-sponsors then it goes to the conference with the senate and they
[42:19.920 --> 42:22.720]  drop it they put some things in there to look at the
[42:22.720 --> 42:26.480]  fed which are slightly helpful but they get rid of the the true audit
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.320]  so when the bill comes back to the house guess what we don't we don't have the
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.560]  audit bill provision in there so i was able to offer an
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.040]  amendment which was a recommitment amendment to send it back to committee
[42:39.040 --> 43:04.400]  and put back in the true audit
[43:04.400 --> 43:10.240]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.880]  that the state is god the united states is now recognized globally is one of the

[47:01.120 --> 47:07.520]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[47:07.520 --> 47:13.440]  network network
[47:15.440 --> 47:18.560]  i don't like having concealed carry because that turns a right into a
[47:18.560 --> 47:21.840]  privilege in states where it's already legal to carry a gun holster
[47:21.840 --> 47:25.600]  but if you pass it in texas or florida and the crime rates
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.000]  drop by over 20 in both states the same numbers in other states
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.680]  even though it's a restriction to a certain extent it illustrates
[47:33.680 --> 47:38.160]  that more guns means less crime and so you win the overall intellectual war
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.320]  yeah that's a powerful message and uh and i think more and more people are
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.080]  coming around to that and i think politically we generally have won this
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.840]  they sort of come into some of these regulations through the back door you
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.360]  know that in their last several elections the democratic candidate
[47:53.360 --> 47:56.960]  usually doesn't go out preaching about how he's going to round up the guns and
[47:56.960 --> 47:59.840]  register guns they stay away from that they pretend that
[47:59.840 --> 48:02.480]  well we're not going to do that we're not going to do that but
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.800]  and backdoor legislation they generally are always trying to do that
[48:06.800 --> 48:12.880]  let's talk about the oil spill uh and again just to preface this uh bp gave
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.640]  orders that they knew would cause a problem it turns out two months before
[48:16.640 --> 48:19.760]  it was leaking bp is one of the biggest contributors to obama
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.880]  they funded the carbon tax they've got a global governance
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.040]  office with the vice president over it uh they've always
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.240]  wanted to nationalize oil so they get an inside deal
[48:30.240 --> 48:34.400]  i'm very suspicious of how this has been handled we're 70 plus days in obama
[48:34.400 --> 48:37.200]  has blocked a taiwanese ship they can get
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.600]  half a million barrels a day scooped up uh they've blocked
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.200]  over 30 other mega ships now the hurricanes are coming in
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.440]  he's saying he may look at letting them come in once that oil gets blown in
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.520]  they're going to have a major disaster the washington post is talking about
[48:53.520 --> 48:58.560]  forced evacuations obama's answer is give me the carbon tax
[48:58.560 --> 49:01.680]  rama manual said don't let a good crisis go to waste
[49:01.680 --> 49:05.440]  i don't see this as obama versus bp as the media
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.680]  has phrased it really this is obama working with bp
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.440]  to try to get his carbon tax uh congressman uh this is out in
[49:13.440 --> 49:16.480]  international water uh why don't we just have the salvagers in
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.640]  there to begin with how can obama tell people 50 miles out in the gulf what to
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.000]  do well you forgot he he can write executive orders
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.920]  all right executive orders orders to do anything they want um so it is a real
[49:29.920 --> 49:32.720]  mess you know if a state needs the manpower
[49:32.720 --> 49:35.760]  generally they don't have manpower that might be able to
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.040]  to help out that would be maybe their national guard units
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.480]  they're all over in in afghanistan in iraq i would say that you know if an
[49:44.480 --> 49:47.200]  emergency like this this might be an incentive to say hey
[49:47.200 --> 49:50.000]  why don't you bring these troops home and maybe even some different states
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.720]  would share some of their their people to help i mean they're practically like
[49:54.720 --> 50:00.160]  an invasion the way this oil is coming in but i i think that uh yes i'm very
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.880]  suspicious of what bp and our government is doing in the obama
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.040]  administration and that's why i've even challenged the
[50:09.040 --> 50:13.680]  the principle of this uh this agreement they have to set up uh
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.000]  you know this fund this 20 billion dollar fund sounds like a lot of money but
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.800]  it sounds like there could be a lot of mischief too
[50:20.800 --> 50:24.560]  and uh that was done by just executive order the president declared we're going
[50:24.560 --> 50:28.000]  to have this up and then he came to the congress and asked even for more
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.480]  authority to go anyplace asking questions and trying to figure out what
[50:32.480 --> 50:36.080]  to do yeah i saw a report that they're blocking i
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.600]  i'm sorry to interrupt uh i saw a report in the ap i said they're trying to block
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.440]  republican groups from going and looking at the gulf don't mean obama doesn't have
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.800]  that power yeah well he might take it he doesn't
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.920]  deserve that power but sometimes they assume power that
[50:49.920 --> 50:54.160]  they have but just uh you know no he doesn't that's not a proper power that
[50:54.160 --> 50:58.960]  he has so um i i'm not uh i'm not too
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.240]  pleased either and i think uh you know a bp
[51:02.240 --> 51:06.640]  corporation uh is in bed with government so you have to be suspect
[51:06.640 --> 51:11.520]  i just think of how much uh we spend protecting their oil well and their oil
[51:11.520 --> 51:14.160]  drawing what do you think we're over in the middle east for we're not over
[51:14.160 --> 51:19.520]  there to spread democracy we're over there to protect oil companies and uh
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.400]  bp just happens to be over there as well uh did you see the video you probably
[51:24.400 --> 51:27.600]  didn't two weeks ago but it was on drudge and info wars dot com everywhere
[51:27.600 --> 51:30.160]  else senator kyle said he was in a closed door
[51:30.160 --> 51:33.120]  meeting with obama and said look tens of thousands dead
[51:33.120 --> 51:36.960]  80 miles to 100 miles illegal aliens they're shutting down national parks
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.760]  the borders collapsing mexico's collapsed and obama said i'm not gonna fix the
[51:41.760 --> 51:46.000]  border till you pass amnesty i need to use that crisis this is a quote
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.080]  and and senator kyle said that this is basically
[51:50.080 --> 51:53.840]  holding us hostage in a form of terrorism i mean that sounds like an
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.200]  impeachable offense congressman and to have a senator say he was in a
[51:57.200 --> 52:01.440]  meeting with obama a what's your take on that and b
[52:01.440 --> 52:04.880]  uh i mean that is a false flag to let the crime
[52:04.880 --> 52:08.240]  continue and not protect our border when that's in the constitution
[52:08.240 --> 52:11.840]  one of the few duties of the feds what would you say to that well
[52:11.840 --> 52:15.440]  since i wasn't in that meeting and what exactly was said i don't know so it would
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.280]  have to be up to the senator decide what to do with it
[52:19.280 --> 52:23.520]  but uh he's they certainly don't act like they have an incentive to do much
[52:23.520 --> 52:27.600]  with the with the borders and uh that of course could eventually
[52:27.600 --> 52:30.640]  land to lead to a national security problem as well
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.040]  well okay congressman ron paul what about his executive order and now they
[52:35.040 --> 52:39.200]  say they're going to sue arizona uh and and they're saying arizona
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.840]  isn't allowed to protect itself when a third of the state is now being denied
[52:43.840 --> 52:47.040]  to the citizens i mean this is this is confirmed
[52:47.040 --> 52:51.520]  what's your view on the constitutionality of an executive order
[52:51.520 --> 52:55.040]  by the president to legalize the illegals
[52:55.040 --> 53:00.000]  well he can't do it laterally like that no congress would have to act and take a
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.880]  policy on that and and and write the rules
[53:02.880 --> 53:06.640]  the federal government has authority over our borders
[53:06.640 --> 53:10.400]  but you know it should be that the private land owner should have a lot of
[53:10.400 --> 53:14.400]  authority as along with the states of sales with jurisdiction
[53:14.400 --> 53:19.600]  um and yet uh instead of permitting them to exert their authority
[53:19.600 --> 53:23.760]  uh over their own land with its own private or the state
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.440]  uh the federal government comes in and says you can't do it so they're acting
[53:27.440 --> 53:31.600]  uh perversely to what i think the federal government ought to be doing
[53:31.600 --> 53:36.880]  congressman uh i know you're a busy man but have you had a chance to watch kagan
[53:36.880 --> 53:40.640]  and the hearings and then expanding on that all of her
[53:40.640 --> 53:44.160]  open statements about socialism being great and
[53:44.160 --> 53:48.240]  the government can disappear speech going back to that uh are are are you
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.800]  concerned about kagan well i am but uh i'm sure if he put
[53:52.800 --> 53:57.040]  ten new ones up in place of her i'd be very concerned too i haven't watched the
[53:57.040 --> 54:01.440]  hearings but i've read about her and uh she certainly
[54:01.440 --> 54:05.200]  is not going to be a great defender of the constitution although
[54:05.200 --> 54:09.120]  uh she's going to make it sound like she is so
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.360]  i i'm not too encouraged without a point for sure
[54:13.360 --> 54:17.440]  congressman what's your take on the russian spy situation it seems like
[54:17.440 --> 54:21.760]  they're trying to kick off a new cold war with that and my issue is
[54:21.760 --> 54:27.280]  globalization is treason globalization is corporations and megabanks
[54:27.280 --> 54:31.360]  taking over our government and so what is the difference between russian spies
[54:31.360 --> 54:34.960]  sneaking around and megacorporations coming in and openly
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.400]  buying off our politicians yeah i i think this is a little bit of hype i i
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.040]  think even the media the the mainstream media is sort of making fun of all
[54:45.040 --> 54:49.200]  this and i think rightfully so uh they just didn't look like a great threat
[54:49.200 --> 54:53.440]  uh to me and i had somebody in for a lunch at
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.560]  today that was sort of uh knowledgeable about this and he said that
[54:58.560 --> 55:01.920]  he said that there's so much spying going on in the world
[55:01.920 --> 55:05.840]  other countries come in here they're doing routinely and we're all over the
[55:05.840 --> 55:09.280]  place all over the world and and it's almost he
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.120]  described it almost like a game they play i mean it's really not
[55:13.120 --> 55:18.960]  serious intrigue and my guess is that uh people like to stir things up to scare
[55:18.960 --> 55:22.560]  the people and who knows i hope it doesn't lead to another cold war with
[55:22.560 --> 55:25.120]  the russians i don't think they're looking for trouble
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.480]  and uh we we certainly shouldn't be looking for it either
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.000]  all right congressman ron paul we appreciate your time in closing and i
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.360]  know you'll say well if i was president i would only have the powers of the
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.480]  president but what would you recommend what would you do if ron paul would
[55:38.480 --> 55:42.400]  have been elected back in 2008 as we all wish you would have
[55:42.400 --> 55:44.640]  been uh you know forecasting everything that's now
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.800]  happened if you would have been elected what would you have done with the oil
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.000]  spill and what would you be doing now
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.600]  i'd probably work at getting away getting the government out of the way i
[55:55.600 --> 55:58.720]  would have done everything possible to alleviate any
[55:58.720 --> 56:02.560]  federal restrictions on the states or property owners
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.560]  i would have accepted anybody who had an offer to come in
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.600]  and and help i would have worked to remove
[56:09.600 --> 56:18.320]  any uh liability limitations on uh on uh on bp and uh i would have uh of
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.640]  course and by that time be by the time we had the oil spill i would have had all
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.920]  the guard units back in individual states and
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.760]  they would have had the right to use their guard units as they as they please
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.280]  and i would actually encourage other guard units uh and not pretend the
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.280]  guard units belong to the president but they belong to the states and the
[56:37.280 --> 56:40.640]  government and i think they um they could have done a lot
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.600]  to alleviate some of the some of the damage i do not believe that there
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.840]  would have been any magic with any one individual who say oh i know how to cap
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.200]  this thing let me do it i actually do believe they're
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.080]  trying seriously to to stop this i don't think it serves anybody's benefit
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.200]  but uh i think right now the assumption is that the government
[57:03.200 --> 57:06.880]  you know didn't have a role to play and what they did was actually made this
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.720]  worse because of the rules of pushing them out into deep
[57:10.720 --> 57:13.520]  sea drilling that was part of the problem too
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.400]  but i would not have closed down drilling like uh obama wants to do that uh
[57:18.400 --> 57:21.920]  that's not going to help us that just makes the unemployment problem that much
[57:21.920 --> 57:26.480]  work well the russians and the chinese and the people in brazil all the
[57:26.480 --> 57:29.200]  they're not stopping drilling in the gulf we don't own the gulf
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.920]  he's just stopped any companies in the us i mean this is this is outrageous and
[57:33.920 --> 57:37.600]  they're going to use it to pass cap and trade congressman ron paul everybody's
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.640]  got to get behind campaign for liberty they got to get behind ran paul
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.080]  we're gonna win this and we appreciate your leadership and we know you're there
[57:44.080 --> 57:50.720]  working tirelessly for us in congress god bless you sir thank you
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.760]  they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new
[57:55.760 --> 58:01.040]  world order based upon collective action invisible empire is a damning indictment
[58:01.040 --> 58:04.640]  of the globalists through their own words and documents the new world order
[58:04.640 --> 58:08.240]  really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[58:08.240 --> 58:12.320]  it means all the world under their control the united nations would take
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.400]  over america the trilateral commission would control the world
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.480]  invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[58:20.480 --> 58:24.320]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.320]  i believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.080]  for the global financial system global governance with the establishment of the g
[58:32.080 --> 58:35.360]  20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then

[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.040]  talk about as much of it as he wants but it's been very interesting
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.480]  i'll tell you this i can't get emails uh to
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.880]  because i'm consulting some on it i from home from my employees emails
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.840]  to tyrell and other people working on the show so there's a lot of
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.160]  a lot of chicanery going on uh with the governor out there on the road because
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.160]  he's getting close to some really uh you know dangerous issues
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.760]  he'll talk about the oil spill we'll get into the economy uh the wars
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.920]  mccrystal all of it today of course his uh new book has been on the new

[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.040]  and he's not on the talk circuit right now you know a few times a year he comes
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.400]  out does interviews he's giving us this interview he gave larry king one a few
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  weeks ago and so i feel very honored to have the governor
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.560]  join us governor great to have you great to be here alex no i i only did the larry
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.200]  interview because they requested and that oliver stone was going to be on and i
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.160]  i i thoroughly enjoy oliver's movie making and his talent and
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.880]  and if we can go on that for a moment he he sent me a copy of his film i think
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.960]  it's called south of the border the documentary and i watched it
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.720]  and as i said i'm larry king i urge everyone to watch this film
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.000]  because it's on the fugo chauvin's and it's on south america and it also
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.560]  covers how how things that we're hearing here through our
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.000]  media are totally wrong from what the reality is down there
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.400]  well i know the media lied and said that chauvin's had said that
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.240]  a us weapon caused the Haitian earthquake and then it did get retracted
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.200]  later but a little bitty paragraph in the washington post
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.120]  the new york times he never said that well the thing is about it it's even
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.640]  bigger than that alex it's a case of this it's now clear to me
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.600]  and i don't get me wrong i'm not anti business i'm not anti anything really
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.400]  i'm a great believer in freedom but it seems that any country
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.480]  that nationalizes their oil and nationalizes their natural resources
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.200]  and doesn't let our corporations go in there and for lack of better terms
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.680]  rape and pillage them well we then call that person a
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.680]  communist a dictator and we start working to oust them
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.080]  i mean we attempted to cool against chauvin's back in o3
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.600]  but the people the guy's been voted into office so many times you can't imagine
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.880]  all the other south american leaders lost the guy
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.080]  he comes from a very modest background of being one of the people
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.880]  he truly is and let people be their own judge but
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.960]  when oliver and i were on the show here comes congressman uh what's his name
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.360]  from florida baseball connie back and
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.880]  he's advocating that this film should be banned
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.800]  and i ask him have you seen it he goes no
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.200]  that's the big picture alex is that we're supposed to be a free country
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.520]  you don't have to like you go chavez but you should at least have the ability
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.040]  to learn about the guy from alternative sources
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.160]  and not just what our government tells us about him
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.920]  well that's the renaissance way and i did watch the larry king episode and he
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.280]  did say basically ban it and what an amazing
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.560]  anti-american statement even if i disagree with something
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.520]  i think that uh you know it should be available ban things here
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.720]  you know banning things that's ridiculous
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.520]  if we learn because we learn all about things and then make proper judgments
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.040]  and we can all make them but you certainly can't make them if you're
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.800]  not getting necessarily the whole truth or can't see
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.480]  alternative methods of learning about stuff if we
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:51.040]  rely solely on our government alex and the and the mainstream soundbite media
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.080]  we will be the most ignorant nation in the world
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.000]  well in many respects we are stay there governor
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.400]  jessie ventura will be right back the question is where should
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.000]  the american people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.760]  monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.800]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.840]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.640]  land they think they're on our water children our
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.640]  education our money we have to define who we are
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.880]  and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.840]  during the patriot uprising you have the facts we have the constitution we have
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.480]  the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.760]  power ladies and gentlemen and i'm so excited to be able to offer you
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.960]  don't tread on me rise the republic tyranny is upon us

[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.800]  of this exclusive interview and we're going to get into the open
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.680]  announcements of the federalization of the internet
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.640]  uh the march towards war with iran we're going to cover Lieberman and
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.520]  mccain's bill to secretly arrest us citizens
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.040]  outside of judicial law and only an act of congress can
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.840]  order your release or even find out where you are we're going to discuss all of
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.360]  us today and he's also had some really spooky things happen
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.560]  uh i wish he could tell you more they'll tell you as much as he can
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.400]  with his contract with uh true tv he can't you know what
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.680]  ahead of the season uh tell you what's happening with the
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.920]  production but it is it is wild what is going on so that's coming up later in
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.120]  the hour but for folks that just joined as governor you were getting into
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.880]  a few weeks ago when you did larry king i want the only interviews you've done
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.240]  since you got back from mexico and they had this congress been on calling for
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.160]  the censorship of this oliver stone movie about
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.880]  uh latin american leaders hugo chavez and their systems of government
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.240]  and whether you agree with the film or hate the film you shouldn't call for
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.520]  censoring it but you've seen the film uh break down
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.200]  why you think it's viewing that everybody should see well everybody
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.880]  should see it because oliver shows clearly how
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.960]  what the truth is and then shows how our mainstream media completely lie to us
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.720]  they tell us a completely different story about the truth of what
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.840]  what's going on and the other thing that's huge is that
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.440]  uh the south american people all they want to do is control their own destiny
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.960]  they don't want us meddling and attempting to
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.000]  to you know do things down there that we've been doing for decades and decades
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.720]  like one of the leaders says i'll be happy to have a united states military
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:08.320]  base in my country if they'll give me one by miami
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.360]  now isn't that fair how does it that we can put military bases in all these
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.160]  foreign countries yet they can't put any here
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.400]  well on top of that we've got me it's it's just things like that and the other
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.480]  thing is alexis they're now banding together
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.400]  saturated the country's down there and they're not going to do business
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:37.200]  necessarily on foreign policy with the u.s unless cuba's included
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.200]  and i think that's a wonderful idea
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.840]  well the quickest way to bring more freedom to cuba would be to
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.640]  in the embargo absolutely the embargo is a miserable failure
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.840]  it doesn't hurt castrol or his brother a bit the only thing it harms is the cuban
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.040]  people and the only thing let's talk about that you have met fidel castro
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.320]  and then you actually got followed by the cia
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.280]  tell folks what happened when you were in cuba when you were governor and the
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.520]  aftermath of that well it was just uh you know i'm probably the only
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.840]  elected official who actually sat down with fidel castro and i had an hour
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.640]  with him and it was when he was in better health
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.360]  you know this was back in 2002 you know since then i've heard you know it's
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.400]  only what i've heard that he's had health problems but
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.720]  at the time i met him he was sharp as a whip i mean you couldn't get a thing
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.400]  by him in fact when i was sitting with him i only had an hour
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.560]  i wore a watch then i happened to just glance down at my watch to see that i
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.280]  had 20 minutes left castrol was so perceptive immediately and i just
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:48.800]  glanced and when i looked up he said i'm sorry am i keeping you from something
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.120]  and i of course was honest i said no sir i said but i know i only have an
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.800]  hour with you and i glanced at my watch and i see that i only have 20 minutes
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.360]  left and i'd like to ask you some personal
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.680]  questions if i could and he said to me ask me anything you want
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.080]  and so then i went in and asked him about the murder of john f kennedy because
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.480]  it was something that i had studied for the better part of my adult life
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.120]  and here i had a chance to talk to someone who was right in the middle of it
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.080]  and who in some scenarios he was attempted to be blamed for it
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.080]  and so i wanted to get his perception of what happened back then
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.360]  and you know if you're open minded like me
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  i realized that there to every story there's going to be three or four
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.680]  sides to that story and to fully understand the story you need to talk
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.760]  to three or four sides and that's the problem again getting
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.320]  back to our country today alex we're not getting three or four sides we're
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.400]  getting one well as you've said we have the two
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.440]  parties that are really almost identical twins
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.720]  and they give us basically different flavors of poison koolaid
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.920]  but at the end of the day there's really no difference no there's none
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.600]  whatsoever it's it's all the stuff that's coming out
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.120]  you know and then we're transition now you know
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.000]  let's go to the show we've been out shooting some episodes and uh
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.400]  last week i spent the whole two to three days
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.080]  basically under surveillance by homeland security
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.760]  and tailed by the coast guard they're all under sorts of stuff
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.840]  and we weren't doing anything illegal at all
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.400]  we were merely going somewhere to film something
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.320]  well they've got to know that governor jesse ventura isn't going to stage a
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.040]  terror attack well i would think they wouldn't i
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.000]  think that that my record speaks for itself that i love my country but that
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.800]  i'm a firm believer alex that before you go out and chastise someone like yugo
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.600]  chavez that you should make sure that your own
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.320]  backyard is clean and tidy and up to snuff
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.320]  can you even get people out about the united states of america today
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.240]  we have a lot of problems in our own backyard that we ought to take care of
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.960]  instead of meddling in everyone else's business
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.960]  can you give people a hint as to the type of
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.040]  thing you were trying to uh get a look at well we just wanted to
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.920]  we just wanted to film a certain location in the country
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:27.680]  and we were in the water we were in international water
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.480]  and we just wanted to photograph what was there
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.800]  and we were tailed by the coast guard and put under surveillance by homeland
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.280]  security
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.640]  well oh and and before we could even go out uh we had we had a whole
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:55.280]  harbor of boats that wouldn't take us because of fear of homeland security
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.600]  and now with alex isn't homeland security there supposed to be protecting us
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.120]  yes they are then why are they striking fear
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.560]  into united states citizens red white and blue people through and through
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.240]  like me and you and like a lot of these fishermen
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.840]  why are they spreading that type of fear to them
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.960]  well it's come out in homeland security documents that they wore the black
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.040]  uniforms too intimidating about all that but you know what i'm starting to call
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.000]  them the distopo
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.920]  and that's some pretty strong words alex it is elaborate on that governor well to
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.960]  me they seem to be some sort of security force that's getting control of
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.760]  everything in our country now and they supersede anything else
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.520]  because they're federal much the same as the federalese in mexico well they've
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.840]  also been caught breaking the law spying without warrants on american
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.640]  citizens that even in non-terror related cases and
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.920]  they don't want you showing the public what you were showing because there's
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.520]  36 of those they're building around the country
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.960]  and it's not defensive but i better be quiet at that
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.600]  no no and you're what you're talking about is not what i'm talking about
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.720]  oh i knew you guys were working on that other thing oh we're working on all
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.640]  sorts of different stuff right now we got eight to ten episodes to do and i'm
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.920]  already working on three to four right now as we speak
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.920]  some days i'm doing this episode other days i'm doing that one
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.600]  but uh no it's okay then then i also
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.800]  found it very interesting i went to a place where
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.160]  alex for the mere uh infraction of trespassing
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.840]  it's become a capital offense
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.160]  really they can shoot and kill you
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.800]  for trespassing and that's a place out in the desert
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.640]  well and it and just there's no fences or anything
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.880]  and if you make the mistake and cross this line
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:13.600]  out there uh they to authorize they can kill you without a trial or anything
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.760]  governor your phone was just breaking up i hate to add to the conspiracy
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.400]  atmosphere but i repeat what you just said because
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.640]  your phone was breaking up i'm sorry well they there's no the place that we
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.800]  were at has no fences or anything it's it's it's marked
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.880]  but there's nothing to stop anyone from going through
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.160]  and lethal force is authorized now imagine if you're out in the desert
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.840]  you're not paying attention and you ride the dirt bike or something
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.960]  and you pass by this particular boundary that's not very well marked
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:59.040]  and they they have the right to shoot you and kill you
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.960]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.960]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.400]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.280]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.400]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.960]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.080]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar

[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:19.520]  quite sometime i've been sitting it out
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.200]  didn't take no chance to say who was a prisoner of doubt
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.880]  well governor jessie ventura is our guest he's the best selling author of
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.200]  American conspiracy it's available at info wars.com along with his last best
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.560]  seller at info wars.com the online video bookstore
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.920]  this is a short segment long segment coming up with governor jessie ventura
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.920]  i've got a bunch of twitter questions i'm going to get to as well for the
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.480]  governor but continuing a lot of other things have
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.120]  happened with the tv show but we'll just leave it at that because
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.080]  you're still working on a lot of these stories and don't want to
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.720]  alert the establishment to what you're doing but
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.800]  before we get into afghanistan going back to you saying it appears homeland
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.200]  securities gestapo i mean you are intensifying
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:14.080]  your view of these people why? well because i find them in my dealings
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.880]  with them to be very uncooperative they seem to use a lot of
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.720]  scare tactics and you know excuse me we're united states citizens
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.960]  our police and our whatever should not be out there
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:35.680]  and using those types of behavior the bottom line is this alex a few months
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.440]  ago i signed a check for well into six big years
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.080]  to the united states government right yes you know what i'm talking about i
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:49.360]  paid my freaking taxes well i'm sure it's the same in austin
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.840]  texas is used in south minneapolis and that's this when you pay in the money
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.880]  doesn't that make you the boss that's our republic that's our form of
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.400]  government no i mean in life yes you pay in the money
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.160]  that makes you the boss the customer's always right well
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.800]  i'm paying the money and these people treat me like i'm some sort of
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.320]  the criminal i had one of them folks say to me
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.320]  you're not the governor anymore with his back turned to me
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.920]  wow now i found that completely disrespectful
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.520]  and i found it outrageous that these people that i pay their salaries with my
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.880]  taxes and they can they can speak and
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:39.520]  treat to me in that manner oh well let's come out that homeland
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.680]  security is surveilling members of congress same thing in england they're
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.520]  using mi6 and mi5 to spy on members of parliament when a
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.200]  member of parliament released the info they swat teamed his house
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.440]  in a quote search for intimidation so the bureaucracy has just run wild
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.360]  well you know i i can't answer any of that Alex because i make their
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.560]  intuit all i can you know i live in mexico half the
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.160]  year but all i can say is that's the results that i've gotten since i've
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.360]  been back to the u.s and it makes me want to go back to
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.760]  mexico because even the federalities aren't that bad
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:18.000]  well this is this is amazing i i sure wish you could tell people more but
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.600]  they'll see it on the television transmission when is that coming up in
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.960]  the fall again it should be uh just don't market him
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.160]  don't put it in stone but look forward around october
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.440]  you know just around i think around october hopefully
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.200]  and i guess it's hoping for anyway there's nothing you know i i don't know
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.760]  definitive time or anything at this point time but i would say mid through
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.120]  the fall that uh will be far enough along to where we could start another
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.360]  bearing another eight to ten episodes and it's too early to let people in on
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.240]  what some of the episodes are about i'll never do that
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.000]  sure if i do that they they they they don't know i understand
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.640]  learning when everyone else does same here i i i know the shows and i've got
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.520]  my mouth completely zipped but this season
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.480]  is going to be even more hardcore than the last i mean i think that's fair to
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.520]  say well it might be it's certainly it's
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.640]  starting off with a lot more resistance than the first season did
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.440]  and usually when you're getting more resistance that
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.240]  it means it could be more exciting what's what's the old world war two
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.040]  put it this way it's been more exciting for me so far
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.000]  but you're a fighter i mean that makes you only want to push harder
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.040]  well you know it did uh i i believe in my country and i believe that uh the
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.320]  citizens of the country are supposed to be number one
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.920]  and it seems that we're not anymore that uh and and so
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.920]  in light of that fact i'll always fight to try to make it that the citizens are
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.200]  number one because that's what i believe our forefathers
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.960]  had in mind when they created the country
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.080]  we're gonna go to break in a moment and i do want to come back and get into
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.640]  afghanistan and in the vp oil spill like i said
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.000]  Alex i now know why we're in afghanistan it's called lithium
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.480]  that's what every computer every cell phone everything that our modern
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.880]  technology must have it's as valuable as oil
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.320]  and and they've determined afghanistan is the
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.520]  the spot in the world that has it that makes things way more clear to me as to
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.160]  why the war on terror is a sidelight that's the cannon fodder
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.200]  that's the red herring well i wanted to bring that up
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.120]  uh national polls now show that obama is dipping below 40 points he's losing his
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.360]  democrat support uh he's now expanded more wars than george bush has
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.760]  statistically according to the washington post
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.720]  as well uh i mean this war situation just goes on and on and on what's your
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.600]  view on that well for me it's as simple as this
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.720]  Alex it's time to end this nonsense we're the only country in the world that
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.040]  is occupying other countries and invading other countries
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.680]  we're the only one nobody else out there's occupying anybody
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.360]  and my view is let's bring all let's let's not only bring the troops home
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.280]  let's bring our harmony 78 foreign bases or
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:18.080]  whatever ridiculous amount it is all throughout the world
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.800]  let's come home that day should be over with
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.160]  that's my opinion people may not agree with me
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.760]  but my opinion is enough of this well we wouldn't be
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.200]  bankrupt if we weren't trying to be an empire and the point i always try to
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.400]  point out is the american people pay for this empire
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.080]  but we're not getting any of the goods uh that are being
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.680]  extracted and and that would be immoral even if we were but
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.320]  this idea that we're going to get the money from the trillion dollars of
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.800]  lithium or we're going to get the oil no we fit the bill for these
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.160]  multinational corporations that use our nation as their muscle
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.160]  exactly exactly and it's not new
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.640]  go back and read about uh two-time congressional medal of honor winner
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.560]  general medley butler he wrote a great book
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.080]  waved back into in the early part of the last century
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.240]  talking about in the end of his fabulous military career
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.080]  he felt that they were nothing but the strong arms for corporate america down
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.480]  in central and south america that when they wouldn't cooperate they send
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.520]  medley in the marine quarry and that's what they we've been
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.640]  i got in trouble about a month and a half ago
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.400]  or whatever two months maybe longer now i don't know time flies when you're
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.080]  having fun but uh i went on fox news and stated
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.200]  unequivocally i said why is this country think that
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:46.240]  uh we're so shocked that we would get attacked by terrorists if indeed we did
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.080]  to the level we have and i said when we've been practicing
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:54.400]  terrorism for 50 years we just call it foreign policy
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.320]  well now they have over a thousand drones operated by the pentagon and the cia
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.240]  separately where people 10 000 miles away
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.640]  our 25 year olds are piloting drones and now the headline
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.640]  and the ap was cia to now kill with drones unnamed terrorists and if they
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.320]  just see someone with a gun in pakistan or afghanistan they drop a
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.720]  hellfire missile on them and they admit if we kill 150 people at a wedding
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.760]  to kill one bad guy that's okay since when is dropping a bomb on a wedding
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.360]  and killing a bunch of men women and children because they think one bad guy
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.080]  may be there since when is that not terror well and not only that but
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:50.000]  don't look what we've done to cuba for 50 years cuba has done nothing to us
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.920]  so

[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have

[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:26.400]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.000]  we have the abc news headline u.s government plan to terrorize
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.880]  the cities as pretext for war with cuba they had a 9-11 style attack plan
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.880]  to be blamed on cuba but kennedy said no exactly
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.880]  and that was way back in 61 called Operation Northwoods
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:48.080]  and the point of the matter is and why do you think k glibara grew to hate us so
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.200]  much here was a guy who was a medical doctor
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.320]  someone that took the oath of healing and he ended up a revolutionary that
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.200]  murdered people and all of that but the big question to ask is why did he feel
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  that way well he felt that way when he took the motorcycle ride
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.520]  in south america and he saw indigenous people that had lived on the land for
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.160]  two to three hundred years being forced off the land by united fruit
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.000]  and u.s corporations that's why we're hated so much throughout the world
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.960]  is because we inflict ourselves upon and another thing to where we inflict is in
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.040]  the so-called war on drugs that's just an excuse to give
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.240]  us a military presence in all these other countries
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.840]  well i mean the pentagon knows our own government knows that if they decriminalized
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.640]  drugs almost all the crime will disappear
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.000]  like a vapor uh and that mexico is collapsing
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.600]  because of the drug war down there the cartels battling each other
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.400]  uh and you've got the cartels they're allied with the government who pay the
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.120]  government off waging war on the other cartels that aren't
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.720]  laundering their money through us banks that's what the whole war is really
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.040]  about and now governor i know you've been out of the
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.480]  country and on the tv show fox news interviewed a marine corps colonel who
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.240]  admitted yes we grow the opium over there we have to or the
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.840]  taliban will get the market you know that's the excuse in the 1980s of
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.200]  shipping the crack cocaine in was well if we don't ship it in somebody
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.160]  else will i mean this is incredible so they're now
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.880]  admitting even in reuters and ap that our government is producing the opium in
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.400]  afghanistan well it doesn't surprise me because
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.080]  by everything that i've read when the taliban took over they put a lot of
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.040]  business that they they took these guys and started
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.000]  tossed them in jail and stuff and literally shut down the opium business
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.520]  and what's interesting is it coincides perfect with the collapse of the banks
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.760]  and now now the opium business is back up full throttle again and the banks are
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.120]  back doing good business aren't they 500 plus billion a year out of
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.960]  afghanistan alone laundered leverage that's uh you can leverage it 10
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.880]  times through the fractional reserve banking
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.520]  good point governor ventura governor jesse ventura joins us his new book is
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:00.640]  several months of the new york times bestseller list as high as number four
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.480]  jesse ventura american conspiracies it's also available
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.720]  at info wars dot com i think the good news here though is your show number one
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.680]  for a new show on tru tv your book a bestseller
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.840]  judge andrew depolitano is the best guy on fox anti-corruption
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.160]  his new show premiered on fox business highest ratings ever
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.000]  on that network anybody who tells it like it is
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  is successful and i think that's a mirror of the state of the country there
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.520]  is an awakening happening are you seeing that when you travel around america
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.840]  i'm starting to i'm starting to see the kindling starting again you know i've
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.280]  gotten some people have gotten in contact with me
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:45.680]  uh you know that that have said that the the tea party has been taken over by
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.240]  you know sarah paleon and then but there still is a core group of tea party people
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.480]  out there the ron pa people and uh they're out there
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.480]  and they're starting to grumble a little bit and we're starting to see more but
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.360]  i have to tell you something uh alex i no longer support the third party
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.840]  movement why is that well i know you'll find that
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.280]  shocking but here's why i believe so strongly that for any that the two
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.600]  parties make the rules and for any third party to play in the game
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.440]  they're gonna have to corrupt themselves just like the democrats and
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.840]  republicans do well we already have a two-headed monster
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.720]  why would we want a three-headed one instead this is my position now
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.360]  my position now is i want political parties banned
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:39.600]  get rid of them well the founders had a big debate about that
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.640]  because look at the parliamentary system in england you can have four five
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.040]  parties the same special interest is buy them all off well the thing is this
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.800]  the truth that we've already got two corrupt parties why do we need a third
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.880]  and for me it's mostly in the voting booth alex
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.480]  you can still have political parties they can still endorse
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.040]  but no one can officially be part of them we need to turn them into being
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.640]  nothing more than lobbyists too well that's an interesting idea because
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.080]  and that way wait let me finish and that way when you go into vote
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.280]  all you see is the name john smith it doesn't say john smith republican
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.320]  john smith democrat see people are given the scapegoat of being able to vote for
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.840]  the party rather than the person this forces you
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.200]  to go back voting for the person rather than the party
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.440]  wow that's a really good idea because then you also don't have the mafia
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.640]  of the parties who when new congressmen and women come in
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.760]  they tell them you're not going to have any authority or power unless you play
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:43.040]  ball and then the vote is negated exactly turn the parties into nothing
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.880]  more than lobbyists you have to run on your name
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.680]  no party can be listed on a ballot it also then makes an incumbent for you
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.960]  the voter to educate yourself which is also good
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.840]  well the problem with third parties is they can never build up the muscle of
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.240]  the other parties that are over 200 years old and that's because they have
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.440]  to corrupt themselves alex when the two parties make the rules to the game
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.480]  and control it as completely as they do the only way a third party can survive
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.880]  is by falling to the same corruption and then you've got a three-headed
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.400]  monster instead of a two-headed one well you've always said vote out
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.320]  incumbents and don't vote for democrats or republicans but the good news is
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.240]  every incumbent is being voted out in the off-year elections
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.320]  every pro establishment candidate be they republican or democrat
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.160]  whether it's a hell of a start i mean well this isn't just
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.080]  one party's in favor and other parties out of favor this is a real political
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.880]  realignment and the media ran a hoax a year and a half ago
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.160]  they ignored republicans being booed at town halls
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.760]  they only focused on democrats being booed and they lied and said
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.080]  the tea parties were republican that then became a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.440]  where democrats then wouldn't be involved with them
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.880]  and so that was msnbc and fox literally engaged
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.200]  in a stage tag team but going back to msnbc i had them
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.040]  demonized me a few weeks ago they came down here chris mathews
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.640]  uh you know interviewed me for about two hours and they used
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:20.240]  about three minutes of me took it all out of context edited it and basically
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:26.720]  said that i'm calling for violence uh and which i've never done in any way
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.920]  and that's the new talking point and i've just found that msnbc
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.400]  is the most deceptive and nasty group uh i've ever seen uh and what's your take
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:41.680]  on that because you experienced well i have a bit of a bias to bring you
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:45.120]  i guess because uh like i said they hired me
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.600]  a three-year contract and then when they learned i was opposed to the
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.200]  evade because remember when they hired me they were not left us
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.600]  the chief oberman was not a liberal then they were fox light
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.440]  they were attempting to compete with fox being and we laughingly called them
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.440]  fox light and when they found out that i and
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.480]  they had just hired phil donahue and phil was their number one rated show
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.720]  when they found out that phil and i both have opposed the invasion and the war in
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.680]  iraq before it happened uh we were phil was removed the number one show and i
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.600]  was the light on and that shows what political whores they are
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.360]  keith oberman will read whatever he's told off that teleprompter they all
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:33.040]  will hannity will you know i just glanced at a book i'm
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  glad back you know what his claim to fame is
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.560]  completely he's a top 40 disc jockey now why should he carry any credibility
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.760]  whatsoever he's never been an elected official
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.320]  he's never worked in government he never served his country in the military
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.760]  he hasn't done anything but be a top 40 disc jockey
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.720]  who found his dicks in what he's doing and he's becoming exceptionally wealthy
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.840]  over it well my issue with beck is he's
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.360]  flip-flopped so much and he just came out of nowhere
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.000]  in 2002 and for those of us that have been doing this for decades
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.120]  it's it's frustrating to see him turn the entire awakening movement into some
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.440]  type of corporate republican foxoid animal so it can be discredited and so
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.400]  the movement against tyranny can be basically co-opted
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.360]  that's my problem with glenn beck i mean i sent him
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.720]  where the fema camps are the civilian inmate labor camp program
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.720]  the houston chronicle the wall street journal about the fema camps
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.960]  i mean it's actually hidden in plain view uh and on his show
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.600]  he just came out and debunked straw man uh and and he's done that so i mean he
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.120]  said ron paul supporters may be violent terrorist
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.040]  and then now he says he loves ron paul so he's always followed that government
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:58.640]  talking point and so i know he's not for real

[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:26.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:27.200]  broadcasting network network
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:31.200]  i don't have to even agree with somebody 90 to like them
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.240]  i mean i disagree with some of your views but i know you're for real i know
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.000]  you can be counted on i know you really stand for something and are a good guy
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.680]  you know at your bottom but with with beck he is
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.440]  a uh you know they're all that way
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.360]  good you know every one of them they you know i learned that when i was doing
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:54.400]  my show one of the big fights i had with msnbc on a daily basis
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.240]  they would send you what topics you could talk about
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.920]  and for me at that time it was
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:08.720]  it was koby bryant and lacy peterson now those are good human interest stories
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.800]  if you're international inquirer stuff i'm not into that
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.400]  i'm into i'm into news that affects us on a general basis
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.520]  everyone in the country in some way they perform
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.720]  and those types of stories don't and so i would fight with them every day
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.400]  from on high saying i'm not doing lacy peterson i'm not doing koby bryant
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.920]  well i don't have i don't care to have an opinion on either
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.320]  yes the peterson thing was a tragic murder but it was but there were 10
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.160]  thousand other murders that took place well what it is governor is a feedback
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.640]  loop as you know they set the agenda with fluff and crap because if they
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.920]  ever gave us real issues and and then it would become a
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:53.680]  self-fulfilling process where the people would want to know
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.920]  about real issues instead of being distracted with uh you know what
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.480]  happened with a murder in the caribbean or what's going on with a congressman
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.480]  and his pages people would be talking about real issues but now that the
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.960]  alternative media has gotten so powerful hey you want to hear what the
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.000]  what one of the big stories up here in minnesota is
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  lately what there's a a state legislator who came out a number of years
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  ago that he was gay right which is fine and
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.960]  dandy i have no problem with electing gay people to office if they can do the
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.200]  job who cares well the big thing up here now is
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:39.680]  he was seen going out to dinner with supposedly some porno star
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.160]  well how does that affect any way he covered so there's nothing to do it's
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.320]  his private life well they feed us with his propaganda and and so the question
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.520]  i have for you and we're skipping the break uh here this is a network break
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.360]  so stay with us everyone uh here's politico Lieberman
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.000]  bill would strip citizenship secretly arrest you put you in a dungeon
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.560]  it's moving through the senate right now uh new bill gives obama kill switch to
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.320]  shut down the internet and the FCC announces new regulations they're
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.360]  proposing a box in your house uh they're already
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.280]  putting this in an australia software that blocks what you're allowed to look
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.920]  at and surveils uh what you're doing and so what's
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.400]  happening is uh they know the alternative media is kicking behind
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.000]  in of the corporate media that wants to force uh
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.720]  you know all of this fluff on us and so they are now moving as a perfect storm
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.280]  corporate media and government to try to block the alternative media governor
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:42.080]  you know if people aren't outraged over that if that doesn't cause a revolution
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.080]  what should i mean that's absurd and i can't believe
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:52.640]  Joe Lieberman's jewish isn't he yes of all people
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.120]  why would he support something like that
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.520]  it's insane it sounds like something ran out of Stalinist Russia or Nazi
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:05.200]  Germany it sounds right out of Nazi Germany to me
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:12.160]  exactly well and and that's what just baffles me him of our people
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.880]  would would be the signer and the carrier of this bill
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:22.160]  oh that would give government control over literally and make it defined
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.880]  who's considered good who's considered bad the the bill actually says for any
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:30.960]  intelligence person for any intelligence reason
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.040]  it's the violent belligerence act uh that a designate of the attorney general
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:39.200]  or the president or the pentagon uh that that they can literally snatch and
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.160]  grab you and use enhanced interrogation and
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.880]  that you can never be released never given a trial
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:48.240]  and only an act of congress uh can't even find out where you are
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:51.760]  and this is going to be inside the united states of america
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:55.360]  this is racing through the senate right now
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:59.440]  boy of john mccain's the co-sponsor and they have a bill
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:03.440]  that mirrors the bureaucracy of the FCC and federal trade commission
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.960]  they have a bill that puts in the black boxes and has cyber security takeover
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.840]  the internet they're already building the nsa hubs they've got one down at
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.280]  san antonio when reporters try to go take photos of the huge
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:16.800]  facility police come out and arrest them that's in the news i mean
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.600]  governor this you're right when you say gestapo this is a total takeover
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.400]  right now of our society well if you know
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.960]  what can you say if we allow them to do that then i guess we deserve what we
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.760]  allow them to do well god bless you you're fighting
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.400]  hard i mean you could have just retired and written off to the sunset i know
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.000]  that's what you want to do and but i mean here you are fighting the
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.560]  tyranny and now you're being surveilled and followed around by homeland
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:46.160]  security well you know what can you say it's
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.360]  nice to be popular well we've only got about five six
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.720]  minutes left governor i just can't thank you enough for giving us this exclusive
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.840]  interview outside of uh you know any other interviews you're doing this week
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.920]  or even i'm doing not alex in fact i'm playing a lot of golf right now on
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.320]  every day that i'm not working because i'm treating this whole summer as a
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.680]  full work summer so on days that i'm not working
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:14.320]  i'm doing what i i'm relaxing to the max no different than
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.880]  when somebody works monday through friday well on the weekend they relax and so
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.280]  when i'm home now i relax because i'm now out on the road again and
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:28.720]  you know i'm not getting any younger i'm doing all this stuff
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:32.240]  absolutely appreciate the exclusive interview and your and your time uh
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.320]  getting into some other subjects here the gulf oil spill i mean
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.600]  obama and his controllers really have blocked the states
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:45.360]  and others from creating this to me to me it's unconscionable
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:51.440]  how could an oil company not have a plan in place for a leak
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:55.520]  that's the bottom line to me alex they drill all these
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:59.520]  wells under the surface of the ocean all over the world
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:06.400]  and they don't have a clue how to cap one off if something goes wrong
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.240]  well looks like obama may get his carbon tax because of this though i mean what
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.400]  is putting a bunch of taxes on us have to do with fixing the oil well it doesn't
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.360]  but the point is how on earth can they i i'm just i'm speechless
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.040]  how could they not have some type of emergency
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.800]  standard operating procedure that is not in place
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.320]  if one of these things goes haywire i agree with you it's that's where the
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.840]  bottom line ends for me and yet now they want to build
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.280]  all of them and they still don't know how to cap them off
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:45.120]  shouldn't they learn how to cap them off if something goes wrong
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:49.120]  before we continue to drill all of them well they knew how and they ordered
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.320]  howlburton and anadarka who were running the rig
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.880]  uh to not follow those procedures and that's dead uh bp did that's actually
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.320]  i've called for criminal investigations wow that's outrageous
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:05.120]  you know uh like i said before any new drill
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.760]  is any new drilling done they better have a rock solid
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.880]  procedure that works to stop it if something goes wrong well yes sir
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.000]  governor they did and i've got the coast guard hearings they had three weeks
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.600]  ago it's gotten very little news Atlantic monthly and others have covered it
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.360]  and in those minutes they talked to the ship engineers the drilling rig
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.320]  engineers and they said that the the well was leaking
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.440]  two months before not two weeks before and that the whole thing happened
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.280]  because bp told them to do cost-saving measures that
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.520]  that in their words i told them and this is witnesses that
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.120]  i told them it would effing explode and catch on fire
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.640]  well then there's people that ought to go to jail then
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:53.680]  it's as cut dry and simple as that the people who did that should go to jail
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.640]  i agree with you i got to say i agree with you the first
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.240]  god but that's all i got to say about that we've only got about two three
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:03.760]  minutes left with you governor uh in closing the iran situation they're
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.120]  putting more sanctions on them they're talking about boarding iranian ships
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:12.160]  engage in regular commerce israel's got nuke subs off their coast
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.000]  iran is backed off trying to run through the israeli block blockade
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.520]  what's your view on what even the la times is saying today
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.240]  could shape up to be the start of world war three
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.920]  well i don't know if it'll shape up to world war three you're not
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.000]  but i i think it's been on the radar screen for a long long time
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.920]  let me finish your show by telling your listeners this
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.080]  i have become a huge fan of colonel elf ledger proudie
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.400]  i've i've reading i've read all his books he's written i now have eight hours of
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.280]  cd that i've become in contact with and for those that don't know who
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:53.920]  colonel proudie was he died in 2001 but he always said nothing just happens
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.880]  everything everything is planned and the point being is
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.240]  fletcher proudie was the mr x character in oliver stone's great movie jfk the
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:09.200]  character played by donald sutherland that's who he was in real life and when
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.880]  you read proudie's books you will get a total
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.640]  new history lesson from world war two to today and you'll understand clearly
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.000]  that each and every one of these wars is pre-planned
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.600]  that they're always planned for third world countries and that there's
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:31.040]  never anything that the military can achieve in which to declare victory
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.600]  and that's exactly what we've had in every war since world war two
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.240]  and sky horse publisher has not surprised me alex that we're going into iran
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.400]  i think it's been planned for for decades and sky horse publishing is
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.760]  republished the secret team available at info wars dot com
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:58:13.680]  governor jesse ventura thanks for spending time thanks
