[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.480 --> 00:28.400]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones is Monday April
[00:28.400 --> 00:35.120]  29th 2013 I'm jacari Jackson along with David Knight this is the Alex Jones radio show Alex
[00:35.120 --> 00:39.800]  Jones will be joining us at 1140 so stay tuned for that just at the bottom of the hour also
[00:39.800 --> 00:44.920]  we have guest host Gerald Salente and Alex will be interviewing William Jasper from the New
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.680]  American so definitely look forward to that David so you have a few articles there yeah jacari
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.720]  we've got a lot of information breaking about the CIA's connection to the Boston bombings there
[00:54.720 --> 01:01.080]  was one in particular Uncle Ruslan turns out and this was covered on info wars but actually I
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.480]  think the story was broken by C. Bell Edmonds I don't know she covered it on on Saturday but
[01:06.480 --> 01:12.360]  she's actually been covering the CIA guy that's been associated with Uncle Ruslan for a long time
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.360]  this is not news she was actually on he was actually on her rogue gallery that she had American
[01:18.360 --> 01:22.160]  deep state rogue gallery and there were some gag orders put on her but she's been writing about
[01:22.160 --> 01:29.640]  his connections to setting up Islamic false flag operations throughout Turkey and Chechnya and
[01:29.640 --> 01:35.160]  the the the chaos stand area essentially for a quite a long time we're gonna be having an
[01:35.160 --> 01:39.720]  interview with C. Bell on the nightly news tonight so I want everybody to tune into that because
[01:39.720 --> 01:43.800]  it's gonna connect a lot of dots a lot of things that are not being reported by the mainstream
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.880]  media but that all really kind of tie into this bombing and like I said this Graham Fuller the
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.760]  CIA guy that has connections to Uncle Ruslan is right at the center of all of that exactly so be
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.640]  sure to turn into the info wars nightly news 7 p.m. Central David Knight will be hosting now I just
[01:58.640 --> 02:03.400]  want to go over a few articles in this short segment this is available on info wars.com from
[02:03.400 --> 02:09.400]  Washington's blog multiple polls Americans are more afraid of the government than terrorists now
[02:09.400 --> 02:14.240]  since 9-11 we've seen people give up all kinds of liberties and in the promise and I just say the
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.800]  promise of security but we have this article right here it says according to a pair of recent
[02:18.800 --> 02:24.680]  polls for the first time since 9-11 the 9-11 terror terrorist hijackings Americans are more
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.320]  fearful of their government than the abuses of terrorists and you can see they want their
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.320]  constitutional liberties as well the polls suggest Americans are hesitant to give up any further
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.640]  freedoms in exchange for increased quote security and I like how the article says it right there
[02:39.640 --> 02:45.160]  that's all it is is the promise of security that's right so David I think it's interesting if you
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.320]  look at this article a little bit further down what it says is that right after the 9-11 it shot
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.480]  up to 71% people saying that they would give up their freedom for security oh yeah promise of
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.240]  security and then it kind of held there for a couple of years and then it started dropping and
[03:00.240 --> 03:06.280]  what's interesting about this poll is the timing this is one day after the bombing and it was
[03:06.280 --> 03:12.920]  pretty close but there were you know it's like 45 to 43% you know that that were 45% said no we
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.240]  don't want to give up any liberties for this so that was kind of interesting the other thing I find
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.760]  interesting is the way that poll broke down Democrats overwhelmingly still are buying the idea that
[03:22.760 --> 03:29.520]  government can make them safe okay 51% to 36% Republicans were essentially equally divided
[03:29.520 --> 03:36.040]  independence or so our hope lies yes now because the independence it was only 29% willing to
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.880]  sacrifice their freedom for the promise of security 58% said no and that's what we keep
[03:41.880 --> 03:47.480]  seeing people are waking up it's the the paradigm shift people are getting new information new
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.560]  sources of information they're turning away from the mainstream and going to alternative sources
[03:51.560 --> 03:56.160]  and even infowars don't believe what we say go and check things for yourself and speaking of
[03:56.160 --> 03:59.680]  people who took things into their own hands I want to do this quick article David we can come
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.920]  back with your thoughts 30 arrested in New York during rally against drones now this is at the
[04:04.920 --> 04:11.400]  Hancock Air Force and National Base and it says a group of people lying on the bases driveway
[04:11.400 --> 04:16.840]  were arrested charges include disorderly conduct obstructing a government administration and
[04:16.840 --> 04:23.240]  laudering so it just makes me laugh that you know the simple act of lying on the ground non
[04:23.240 --> 04:30.120]  combatively is now viewed as obstructing justice or disorderly conduct I should should say
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.280]  up to government administration look at what Bloomberg does and in New York I mean I remember
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.360]  stories about people who couldn't smoke guys had a barbershop they couldn't smoke in their shops
[04:40.360 --> 04:43.480]  they stood out in front of it smoke a cigarette then they got a ticket for watering for a couple
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.440]  hundred dollars so okay well this is the end of the first segment we'll be back right after this
[04:48.440 --> 05:04.120]  break with more news Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the

[08:18.760 --> 08:23.160]  all right welcome back to the alex jones radio show jacari jackson and david night sitting in
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.280]  alex will be joining us at 11 40 so stay tuned for that if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.280]  you see the article right there bill de berg sleuth jim tuckered dead at age 78 so our condolences
[08:34.280 --> 08:38.840]  go out to jim and his family alex talked about it yesterday on the sunday show i'm sure have
[08:38.840 --> 08:43.400]  more information coming up a little bit later on so i'll throw back to david david you had more
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.040]  points you wanted to make on our our last topic yeah you know we were talking about people waking
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.520]  up and realizing that uh government was actually a bigger threat to them than terrorism and the
[08:52.520 --> 08:58.200]  actuality of it is is very true when you go down and you look at the actual actuarian figures and
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.640]  see the likely cases of how people are going to die it's a little known fact but according to the
[09:03.640 --> 09:11.480]  us department of state only 17 u.s citizens were killed worldwide as a result of terrorism in 2011
[09:11.480 --> 09:17.480]  that's the year that we have most recent year we have statistics for that includes deaths in afghanistan
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.800]  in iraq right and everywhere we were at war only 17 people and people will use that as the
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.720]  as a talking point well that just shows tsa works well tsa isn't really catching anybody
[09:29.720 --> 09:34.200]  because even in situations like the underwear bomber tsa didn't stop that guy it was the passengers
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.600]  on the plane that's right that jumped to action not the tsa that's right and as alex has pointed
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.640]  out over and over again you know things like drowning is way up there i mean you have people
[09:43.640 --> 09:48.520]  that drown that's like 18 000 people okay thousand times more likely to drown than you are to get
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.640]  you know hit by a terrorist attack but of course we all know it's things diseases like heart disease
[09:53.640 --> 09:57.240]  cancer that sort of thing that's really what you need to worry about car accidents exactly
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.000]  but it is you know when it's the absurdity just like we saw in boston one teenager
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.440]  with no military training or experience and we find out he had no gun on him and yet look at
[10:08.440 --> 10:14.760]  what they did in terms of martial law in boston that was to establish a pattern that was to establish
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.000]  a pattern of the way the police can operate and we're already seeing them repeat that pattern
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.960]  in various other uh cities or two other places where they did it uh just this last week they're
[10:23.960 --> 10:28.280]  setting a pattern just like they did with swat teams and you know that that came in with a police
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.080]  chief in la and everybody said oh look at this and before you know it it spread all across the
[10:33.080 --> 10:37.720]  country we're going to see these types of tactics all across the country now is a time for people
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.080]  to get active at the state and local level get with find some uh representatives who are going to be
[10:43.080 --> 10:47.400]  on your side or elect some who are going to be on your side and start getting some accountability
[10:47.400 --> 10:52.360]  on police and stop this militarization and take it back another step and say we're going to hold
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.880]  police accountable when they use tasers as whips or they do other things violence that we see no
[10:57.880 --> 11:01.880]  accountability happening at the local level now but it's really going to get out of hand
[11:01.880 --> 11:07.560]  unless citizens get active and demand some accountability and some essentially an effective
[11:07.560 --> 11:12.520]  bill of rights uh you know from local police that is what we do really need to see happening now
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.160]  exactly because people don't want to get active they think well i mean people have the idea that
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.440]  you can work at the national level and you can i do encourage you to uh contact your national
[11:22.440 --> 11:25.640]  representatives and such but you have to get at the local level you have to go talk to your
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.880]  sheriff and your police chief and your city councilman and your mayor and if you're like us
[11:29.880 --> 11:35.480]  here in austin maybe they might not be the best representatives but i mean if you can vote about
[11:35.480 --> 11:40.600]  a different way get get some people there who will do the will of the people not the will of the feds
[11:40.600 --> 11:46.360]  or you know joe biden or whoever else so and speaking of joe biden this is the uptales over to
[11:46.360 --> 11:52.840]  the president obama report obama spent twice as much time on vacation and golf as the economy now
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.480]  this is out of bright part and you can see that he spent more time on the golf course than he did
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.960]  in any type of economic meeting you know i might say that might be a good thing chicory maybe it
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.160]  maybe is a good thing we don't get all the government that we pay for uh you know if
[12:09.160 --> 12:13.240]  i would hate to think if he was enacting a rigorous economic plan on us what that would
[12:13.240 --> 12:18.280]  look like so let's let's encourage him to go golfing more well in my deal is you know he spends
[12:18.280 --> 12:22.920]  all this tax money to go play golf with tiger woods and you know whoever else and i don't know
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.240]  what all he has going but then he sends his daughters on these million dollar spring break
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.640]  vacations to mexico and so forth and you know you got the secret service and you know guys
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.000]  hiding in trees trying to make sure nobody's trying to talk to him and all this stuff it's just
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.160]  it's over the top it's a waste of money meanwhile you can't take a tour of the white house yeah
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.440]  because of sequestration yeah well they're royalty you know that there are american royalty and they
[12:44.440 --> 12:49.960]  live a lifestyle the rich and famous and then some it's just pretty amazing you know like
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.080]  talking about money uh this is an article that's on info wars the more illegal immigrants they go on
[12:55.080 --> 13:00.040]  food stamps the more money jp morgan makes how about that it turns out they've made
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.200]  over a half a billion dollars just on processing fees for people who are getting uh food stamps
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.440]  that sort of thing so they get anywhere from 31 cents to two dollars and 30 cents for every
[13:10.440 --> 13:16.120]  single person on food stamps so they're making hundreds of millions of dollars off of this
[13:16.760 --> 13:22.040]  and when you see this kind of thing happening it's it's no wonder that you know we have a
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.240]  welfare state it's just like the welfare state just like the military industrial complex is
[13:27.240 --> 13:33.080]  being run largely for the benefit of the big corporations and banks at the very top right
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.280]  just like you see a half a billion dollar tank that the army doesn't want you see fighter jets
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.280]  that the air force doesn't want you see a vertical takeoff and landing plane that the marines don't
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.040]  want and yet you've got congressmen from both political parties pushing for these things that
[13:48.040 --> 13:53.640]  the military doesn't want why because it makes money for the true for the people who really
[13:53.640 --> 13:58.440]  run in this that's a military industrial complex you know the army doesn't want the tank the army
[13:58.440 --> 14:01.400]  doesn't want the war most of them right because they're going to be the ones who are going to be
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.720]  fighting and dying in it but the wars and the tanks are what make the money for the military
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.960]  industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about and people you know they can't see the
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.640]  connection that these people make huge sums of money off of war they don't make money in peacetime
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.200]  you know they have tanks and guns and bullets and other things that they profit off of and people
[14:20.200 --> 14:26.120]  just can't wrap their head around the concept that maybe we're starting wars unnecessarily to
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.440]  push that type of agenda well think about it it's it's a durable good right one of the problems
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.200]  that they have in the automobile industry is that they started making cars that were
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.200]  much more durable they wouldn't wear out in just a couple of years so they're not able to sell them
[14:38.200 --> 14:42.520]  that often you go back to the 70s it was only in switzerland that they were making not switzerland
[14:42.520 --> 14:47.800]  in sweden that they were making cars that would last for 11 years or whatever right but because
[14:47.800 --> 14:51.960]  of competition detroit started making cars that lasted longer so they're having some problems now
[14:51.960 --> 14:55.560]  if they were military industrial complex type of mentality what they would be doing they'd be
[14:55.560 --> 15:00.840]  sending out agents to sabotage traffic lights and traffic signs so they could create accidents so
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.400]  people would die or whatever but they'd have to replace those cars because that's what their
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.080]  that's what the military industrial complex is doing when they manipulate the foreign policy
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.960]  and in the same way we see the welfare state being manipulated for the benefit of bankers and big
[15:13.960 --> 15:21.400]  corporations in this situation where JP Morgan is making a half a billion dollars they have a flyer
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.840]  that they give to department of agriculture gives out to people on food stamps and in
[15:26.840 --> 15:33.080]  bullface underlined it says in spanish you need not divulge information regarding your immigration
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.360]  status and seeking this benefit for your children and we talked about that a little bit yesterday
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.680]  yeah and i gave the example you know i'm definitely against biometrics but in the state of texas you
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.440]  have to get your fingerprints taken to get a texas driver's license i don't like it but that's what
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.200]  i had to do but we saw we see in other states whether they're telling immigrants you don't
[15:50.200 --> 15:53.960]  have to give your fingerprints or whatever else just come get your driver's license and it's a
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.640]  similar thing with the with the entitlement programs exactly you cannot you cannot have an
[15:59.640 --> 16:06.280]  open and open borders and an open-ended welfare system right i remember years and years ago
[16:06.280 --> 16:09.480]  they used to have this thing called an ollen chart that they were doing the libertarian party
[16:09.480 --> 16:14.280]  see where people were trying to get them out of this left right paradigm so it basically changes
[16:14.280 --> 16:20.520]  this straight line into a two-dimensional space and they would have like 10 questions on personal
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.960]  liberty 10 questions on economic freedom and that sort of thing and one of the questions would be
[16:25.960 --> 16:31.560]  about open borders and my position was you cannot have open borders i mean you cannot have open
[16:31.560 --> 16:36.760]  immigration unless you first end the welfare state and it will bankrupt you and and that's
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.760]  basically what we have now though is that we have fully open borders they've essentially
[16:40.760 --> 16:47.560]  uh opened the borders but they are hyping up the welfare state to a new dimension and what that
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.240]  means is that it's just making people who are working legally in this country is burdening them
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.280]  and it's also keeping people who really do need some help from being able to get it because of the
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.960]  massive amount of money that's being wasted and misdirected oh yeah it's a huge huge amount
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.440]  misdirected and going to people who don't really need it people can't get the assistance that
[17:08.440 --> 17:13.320]  they need and you know it's like so say we talk about entitlement programs you know if you need
[17:13.320 --> 17:16.920]  something temporarily that's one thing but you're not supposed to be on it to the point where you
[17:16.920 --> 17:22.680]  become dependent lifelong lifelong recipient of this thing and it's definitely hurting people
[17:22.680 --> 17:26.360]  because they don't want to get out or they don't know how to work maybe i should say yeah they're
[17:26.360 --> 17:29.880]  they're so entitled to getting their their check in the mail every month that you know they don't
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.760]  know how to go out there and fill out job applications and you know work a 40 plus hour week and so
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.400]  forth well what's in it for the corporations like jp morgan is of course money but what's in
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.400]  it for the politicians the reason they push this is they want you to be dependent on them and just
[17:43.400 --> 17:50.040]  as we said before there's there's a left right division here and for the people on the right
[17:50.040 --> 17:56.280]  they want to get you afraid of islamic terrorism even though like we just said only 17 people
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.960]  worldwide including theaters of war were killed by terrorists they want you so afraid of terrorism
[18:01.960 --> 18:06.760]  and islamicists that you're going to come running to them for safety and for the people who are on
[18:06.760 --> 18:13.800]  the left they want you dependent on them economically right and so in both cases politicians push this
[18:13.800 --> 18:20.120]  agenda because it empowers them and it takes power away from the people exactly now i want to move
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.160]  to international news in our news blitz here now this article right here powerful blast
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.600]  injures up to 40 and praying a powerful explosion badly damaged an office building in the center
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.200]  of the check capital monday injuring up to 40 people authorities believe people still may be
[18:36.200 --> 18:41.000]  buried in the rubble so definitely our thoughts and prayers go out to the people in that location
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.760]  that's something that um it's amazing because um c bell admins was talking about how americans knew
[18:46.760 --> 18:53.800]  so little about chechnya that they were thinking that uh the chechen area was actually Czechoslovakia
[18:53.800 --> 18:59.400]  oh yeah and now we have a paris the vet and prog chechloslovakia so um that's going to even make
[18:59.400 --> 19:05.320]  the american public more confused i guess exactly get a map so let's take a look at some more
[19:06.040 --> 19:12.360]  israel points finger at iran over drone from lebanon and this is what we've been hearing that
[19:12.920 --> 19:16.680]  various drones are going to start popping up in various parts of the middle east or more drones i
[19:16.680 --> 19:22.360]  should say and we'll see israel believes that iran's revolutionary guard was responsible for the
[19:22.360 --> 19:28.680]  unmanned drone launch from lebanon that shot down that was shot down in israel's airspace on
[19:28.680 --> 19:32.520]  thursday so you can see the helicopter right there this doesn't show a drone that's a helicopter but
[19:33.240 --> 19:36.920]  it's something that's going on out there and you know drones aren't just international they're
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.720]  coming home they already are home they're on the us mexico border us kanda border they're flying
[19:41.720 --> 19:45.960]  around people say why don't you use them to shoot chris doner and shoot the the guys in boston but

[24:27.560 --> 24:31.240]  jackson and we're filling in for the first part of the show and alex is going to be joining us
[24:31.240 --> 24:35.560]  in a little bit he's going to have an interview with william jasper from the new american and
[24:35.560 --> 24:41.320]  last hour of the show we're going to have gerald salante so don't miss that now we were talking
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.280]  and we mentioned it just briefly before in the first segment about jim tucker passing away
[24:46.920 --> 24:52.360]  jim took her course as a person who was on the trail of bill de berg for decades pretty much
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.720]  single-handedly and you know jacari when i think about jim tucker and his struggle for decades and
[24:57.720 --> 25:03.240]  obscurity what it reminds me of is uh william wilberforce uh a guy who if you go back and
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.440]  look at history and look at uh it was it was chronicled in the movie amazing grace he had
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.560]  some connections to uh the fellow who who wrote that song but william wilberforce is somebody
[25:13.560 --> 25:19.560]  who for decades in parliament tried to educate people about slavery and he was pretty much by
[25:19.560 --> 25:24.840]  himself and he was up against huge economic interests of the day but he had to wake people up
[25:24.840 --> 25:31.800]  to the moral issues of slavery and he was successful just before he died and you know in a way jim
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.440]  tucker did the same thing not only was he laboring in obscurity but he was also trying to wake people
[25:36.440 --> 25:42.360]  up to slavery right but it was waking us up to our own slavery waking us up to the slavery that
[25:42.360 --> 25:47.160]  is in chain that has put us in chains out of ignorance and people don't think that they're
[25:47.160 --> 25:51.640]  slaves like i heard the the quote uh the only reason hered tubman didn't free more people
[25:51.640 --> 25:54.920]  because more people didn't know that they were slaves they're just used to living that way
[25:54.920 --> 25:59.960]  that's right it's the new it's the normalcy bias and so what jim tucker was trying to do
[25:59.960 --> 26:06.040]  was to wake up people to the powers behind what was going on and we know now from documents that
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.960]  were leaked just a couple years ago we know that all the way back in 1955 they had planned the euro
[26:11.960 --> 26:17.000]  as a way of controlling that entire area they had planned the unification of europe to control it
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.400]  and these are bankers and they weren't doing this for benign reasons they weren't doing this to make
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.960]  the area more efficient they were doing it to destroy it so they could take control of it and
[26:25.960 --> 26:30.600]  we see those plans coming out now and for decades he was the only one talking about that well he
[26:30.600 --> 26:37.640]  passed away this uh just a few days ago and alex did a tribute to him because alex knows him very
[26:37.640 --> 26:45.640]  well and uh let's cut to that tribute right now well it's sunday morning here at the end of april
[26:45.640 --> 26:52.840]  2013 and i just got the word that my old friend jim tucker passed away
[26:54.760 --> 27:01.080]  one of the last of the old gumshoe straw hat journalist who was a sports writer until the 70s
[27:01.080 --> 27:09.560]  when he discovered writings by a man named pegler for other newspapers who had exposed a private
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.000]  secret of cabal that had been meeting at jackall island georgia the same place they'd met in 1913
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.800]  to establish the private fellow reserve and jim over the next 30 plus years fought an uphill battle
[27:21.800 --> 27:26.520]  to expose the bill de berg group with the media saying it didn't exist just like jad your hoover
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.880]  tried to say that lakosa nostra didn't exist organized crime in the 50s we all now laugh at that
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.120]  but if it wasn't for trailblazers like jim tucker we wouldn't know about the real
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.800]  top of the pyramid global mafia the bill de berg group they've now released documents in italy and
[27:43.800 --> 27:48.200]  their supreme court where the bill de berg group has been caught being involved in stage terror
[27:48.200 --> 27:54.360]  attacks and other organized crime activities documents have been leaked by wiki leaks with
[27:54.360 --> 28:01.320]  henry kissinger saying we do illegal immediately unconstitutional is harder and thanks to jim
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.520]  being ridiculed and attacked but knowing he was right he forced this out in the open it's what one
[28:06.520 --> 28:14.920]  man can do in the beginning and then others began to join him and over time over time we were able
[28:14.920 --> 28:21.480]  to expose this cabal and now rollingstone magazine yesterday came out and said we owe the conspiracy
[28:21.480 --> 28:27.960]  theorists an apology there is a private corporate secret cabal one world government libor and beyond
[28:28.760 --> 28:35.480]  the entire world economy is manipulated for insiders it is fascism it is crony capitalism the
[28:35.480 --> 28:43.720]  opposite of liberty and we owe people like jim tucker a real debt of gratitude and that's why
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.200]  i'm here in the ozark mountains and i wanted to share the beauty of these woods with you out there
[28:48.200 --> 28:54.680]  as we remember jim tucker demonized by the media they said he was insane he was a liar but no he
[28:54.680 --> 29:00.360]  was proven right and now bill de berg is mainstream news and now the globalist can't operate in the
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.200]  dark see first they want to deny they exist because once you have a debate with them they
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.680]  will lose the debate because of the politics they're involved in their tyrants so they wanted to just
[29:10.680 --> 29:18.120]  hide and make the world think that they didn't exist but they can't do that anymore thanks to
[29:18.120 --> 29:25.240]  people like jim tucker and we continue to walk in his footsteps now we continue to stand with jim
[29:25.240 --> 29:32.360]  and continue his work and others work exposing the new world order because men and women come
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.920]  and go we're born to the world we grow up we die but what matters is our body of work
[29:37.560 --> 29:45.800]  and jim tucker's body of work will live on forever and so this is basically my short eulogy
[29:45.800 --> 29:52.360]  to jim tucker who was a great guy a funny guy we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:55.800 --> 34:02.120]  john carrey went to and uh this was covered in the article by william jasper and the title of the
[34:02.120 --> 34:08.600]  panel discussion was the g20 prospects and challenges for global governance and you know
[34:08.600 --> 34:12.760]  global governance when you look at this the perfect beard for it is climate change because
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.760]  i say so-called global problem right but it's also they can also use a manufactured liquidity
[34:18.760 --> 34:23.800]  crisis just like the federal reserve was created after the manufactured liquidity crisis of the
[34:23.800 --> 34:29.160]  1907 crash and we're coming up to the 100th anniversary of the federal reserve so we need
[34:29.160 --> 34:33.080]  to take a look at the roots of that but now we see the same sort of thing happening in europe and
[34:33.080 --> 34:39.160]  listen to this quote from this conference this is from uh ian bremer who's president of the eurasia
[34:39.160 --> 34:45.480]  group and they actually have this on video he says the eu is much more significant there is a real
[34:45.480 --> 34:53.560]  subversion of sovereignty by the eu that works there's a real subversion of sovereignty yeah yeah
[34:53.560 --> 34:58.040]  keep that phrase yeah repeat that to yourself over and over again that's a good thing from the
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.680]  standpoint of the council and foreign relationship and it's also a good thing from the perspective
[35:02.680 --> 35:09.560]  of the bildberg people right they're looking to they're open about their intentions to subvert national
[35:09.560 --> 35:14.200]  sovereignty and to create a global government now you can talk about the difference between
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.320]  global government and global governance i would argue that that's a distinction without a difference
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.120]  but we need to be aware of the fact that they have historically done this you know climate change is
[35:26.120 --> 35:33.880]  something that they've used to justify this but it's also a global governance but it's also been
[35:33.880 --> 35:40.200]  their mo to use liquidity price crises and that's what we see happening now in europe with a vengeance
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.840]  and climate change is one of those big deals because i believe obama talked about it in his
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.680]  inauguration recently climate change being one of the driving forces behind his new campaign
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.040]  besides you know taking your guns and other civil liberties and we see guys al gore many other people
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.640]  saying that you know polar bears can't swim alex is you know famously showing you those clips and
[36:01.640 --> 36:05.400]  and so on but that's the thing that they're going to push because remember it was his global cooling
[36:05.400 --> 36:09.560]  there was global warming and then it was global cooling and now somebody spits on the sidewalk
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.400]  that's climate change and you have to give all your money to al gore and my question to people
[36:13.400 --> 36:17.640]  when i meet when i meet people i got talked to somebody at uh south by southwest we went out
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.120]  there and i'm talking to this guy and he's all excited he's all pumped up you know i just came
[36:22.120 --> 36:27.080]  from seeing al gore you know talk about climate change and i say so you believe in climate change
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.960]  he's like oh yeah you can't deny it and he's like we we have uh we have pollution and we have all
[36:31.960 --> 36:36.760]  this stuff and i was like well sir we've always had uh hurricanes and tornadoes and earthquakes
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.760]  and so on then he said well we have all this pollution i was like yes we do have a pollution
[36:40.760 --> 36:46.040]  issue on this planet but saying you know because somebody goes away their pack of fries
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.360]  to cause a hurricane doesn't make any sense they need to understand that uh actually i was talking
[36:50.360 --> 36:55.080]  about how the bankers are using this you know creating liquidity crises in order to restructure
[36:55.080 --> 37:01.160]  sovereignty actually climate change is really kind of the same sort of thing when you look at these
[37:01.160 --> 37:07.160]  carbon credits and these carbon exchange systems everything it's got a lot of similarities to the
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.720]  federal reserve you know when you look at the private federal reserve we pay them for the privilege
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.920]  of them printing our paper money okay and we borrow money from them why should we borrow money
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.920]  why should we pay them to do this that's a function of government not a function of some
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.640]  private entity and what algor is looking to do on a global basis and these other people he's not
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.920]  the only one but he's heavily into this what they're looking to do is to set up some kind of a
[37:31.800 --> 37:38.040]  climate federal reserve if you will these carbon tax credit exchanges so that you will pay them
[37:38.040 --> 37:43.800]  for the privilege of anything that you do in your life that generates heat or carbon or anything
[37:43.800 --> 37:49.880]  anything that you do essentially you're going to pay a privilege fee to these private organizations
[37:50.520 --> 37:54.680]  and you know that's that's what they're looking to do they're essentially trying to set up a
[37:54.680 --> 38:01.080]  federal reserve that is climate based that is carbon credit carbon exchanges based so
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.000]  they're going to get very very very wealthy off of that if everybody that engages in any kind of
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.360]  activity has to pay them an indulgence fee to do so oh yeah and you tie that together very well
[38:12.360 --> 38:17.400]  david night i want to go on to something else before alex joins us in the next couple of minutes
[38:17.400 --> 38:25.560]  us spy quote spy held in venezuela is a filmmaker his lawyer says a u.s citizen detained by venezuela
[38:25.560 --> 38:31.320]  on accuses accusations of spying is a doc documentary filmmaker who had accreditation
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.600]  from the south american country's electoral council to observe elections this month his
[38:36.600 --> 38:43.640]  lawyer said today timothy tracy was arrested at uh car says i'm sorry i can't pronounce that
[38:43.640 --> 38:49.480]  simon bolvar airport on april 24th as he was leaving the country in charge yesterday with
[38:49.480 --> 38:55.880]  conspiracy the use of false documents and delinquent association so there's a guy who's out
[38:55.880 --> 38:59.480]  there just trying to get to the bottom of what's going on out there you know he's a documentary
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.960]  filmmaker we've seen this other places with uh journalists and other people being detained
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.680]  being killed and this is just just another guy you know who's just out there trying to expose
[39:08.680 --> 39:16.040]  what's going on well it's hard to say you know i you know i don't want to always say these things
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.440]  with a grain of salt this is you know one of the earlier reports so you know things may come out but
[39:20.440 --> 39:24.680]  thus far just going off this article you know we have to you know look into what this guy's
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.560]  doing out there but it is coming from bloomberg yeah yeah that's and that's another big yeah so we
[39:29.560 --> 39:34.120]  don't know i don't want to throw this kind of the bus he may be a genuinely a genuinely be a documentary
[39:34.120 --> 39:39.000]  filmmaker who knows i mean the more we look at all this like i said we've got an interview coming
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.600]  up with cbel edmunds on the nightly news tonight and the more we look at all the cia fingerprints
[39:44.600 --> 39:51.560]  all over this boston bombing and i tell you listening to her series of gladio part two and
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.480]  if anybody doesn't know what operation gladio was do yourself a favor and look it up even if you just
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.520]  take the time to read a wikipedia article it's absolutely amazing and it is very central to
[40:02.520 --> 40:08.040]  the idea of false flag terrorism and what we see is that uh the campaign of terror that was going on
[40:08.040 --> 40:15.240]  in idly in the 1970s was attributed to communist organizations but it was really an attempt to
[40:15.240 --> 40:19.640]  stop the political gains that communists were having in idly and it was really carried out by
[40:19.640 --> 40:27.320]  nato operatives pretending to be communists and she argues that gladio has been continuing in
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.040]  the middle east and turkey and in the chaos stan areas as gary north is called i believe it was
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.960]  gary north that gave it that name but she argues that that's been continuing on and she did this
[40:39.960 --> 40:48.360]  series back in january and it has a lot of ties now that we're seeing open up with this bombing
[40:48.360 --> 40:54.520]  narrative that just happened in boston so check out that interview tonight on the nightly news
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.800]  yeah i'm definitely excited for that and guys let me know when alex has joined us i believe he's
[40:59.800 --> 41:04.680]  about ready but in the meantime i'm going to go to this next article us navy experimenting with
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.360]  drones and blimps they're going back to blimps to fight caribbean drug smugglers in the wake of
[41:10.360 --> 41:15.640]  budget cuts the us navy is turning to older technology in the war on drugs and you can see
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.360]  it right there the the blimp i'm not sure if that's the current type of blimp that they're going to
[41:20.360 --> 41:25.880]  be using but there's an image of it so we see uh just more just more surveillance well when we
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.960]  talk about balance i think about bloated things right and if you want something that's bloated
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.760]  let's take a look at what the if they really want to stop drugs they could stop like 90 of the
[41:34.760 --> 41:41.640]  poppy based drugs by stopping the cia from growing them in afghanistan okay and yet we see an article
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.360]  here from the new york times where millions in cia ghost money has been paid afghan president's
[41:46.360 --> 41:52.120]  office they called it ghost money he said because it came in secret and it left in secret right
[41:52.120 --> 41:57.880]  it's ghost money but you know it's a known fact and it's been documented if you don't believe the
[41:57.880 --> 42:03.320]  alternative press you can look at the mainstream press the new york times they've documented it
[42:03.320 --> 42:10.200]  over and over and over again uh how the uh the production of poppy seeds and and of course from
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.560]  that you get uh cocaine heroin a lot of you know hashish a lot of different drugs are derived from
[42:15.560 --> 42:23.080]  poppies that had essentially uh dropped to very very low levels under the taliban when we came in
[42:23.080 --> 42:28.040]  we actually have the new york times actually has pictures of american soldiers uh assisting with the
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.680]  production and transportation that was on was on fox news heraldo was out there and and the guys
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.880]  were like we don't like growing this opium but that's what we have to do otherwise the farmers
[42:37.880 --> 42:44.040]  will come after us yeah right yeah our hands like yeah you guys can't take take a couple farmers
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.360]  but it's uh yeah we got to keep we got to prop up their economy and their economy is based on
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.600]  selling drugs to the united states so uh let's let's jump it up so it goes from like 10 percent
[42:52.600 --> 42:56.440]  of the world supply to like 90 percent of the world supply overnight all right and i do believe
[42:56.440 --> 43:02.680]  alex is ready alex can you hear us yes gentlemen i'm here listening to you uh talk about how our
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.840]  government controls the cocaine that comes from coca leaves down in central and south america
[43:06.840 --> 43:11.320]  and is on record shipping and then of course the opium that is then manufactured and turned into
[43:11.960 --> 43:17.000]  the stronger heroin and that's a fact another one of those stubborn things that just hangs out
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.840]  there in plain public view but for the ignorant they just say oh it's a conspiracy theory the
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.200]  government wouldn't be arresting us and putting us in their private prisons uh if they were
[43:28.200 --> 43:33.240]  shipping the drugs in well of course they make it illegal to make the market more lucrative
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.880]  so they can selectively arrest anybody that tries to compete with them and i know that most
[43:39.880 --> 43:47.240]  our listeners know this most of our listeners are aware of this uh but there are just so many
[43:47.240 --> 43:52.680]  examples of this throughout history and and for the the radio show and we've got a stack of special
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.600]  reports we haven't even gotten to yet from the last week that are on president planet dot tv
[43:56.600 --> 44:00.280]  that we should air here on the radio but there's just so much breaking news we should do a whole
[44:00.280 --> 44:08.520]  report on the opium wars that came at the end of a hundred years roughly of european occupation of
[44:08.520 --> 44:15.880]  china and how they use china's foolish decision to make opium illegal as a way to take over city by
[44:15.880 --> 44:20.120]  city the british with opium and take over the police the local constabulary because when you make
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.240]  something illegal that's highly addictive i mean think about this this is how they legalize slavery
[44:25.240 --> 44:29.880]  today they say if we catch you using a product that's highly addictive that we advertise in
[44:29.880 --> 44:36.680]  movies and tv that we sell uh via prescriptions as well the the the prescription version of
[44:36.680 --> 44:42.200]  if we catch you using it then we're going to put you in a prison but then in many of these cities
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.920]  the only jobs you've really got above mcdonald's if you're lucky is selling drugs where you can
[44:46.920 --> 44:51.960]  make large profits and then the police just kind of selectively when they need to fill the prisons
[44:51.960 --> 44:56.280]  go and arrest a few of the drug dealers i mean for the naive out there there's two different
[44:56.280 --> 45:01.080]  worlds more and more i realize there's those of us that are aware and those of us that aren't aware
[45:01.080 --> 45:06.120]  and then in between that are those that are predatory who are aware who try to attack and
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.600]  demonize those of us that are moral who are trying to stop what's happening and try to
[45:10.600 --> 45:16.200]  keep the other group in the dark they try to keep them in the dark for life and a great example of
[45:16.200 --> 45:22.200]  that is out of the washington examiner today upon info wars dot com i got it from judge report dot com
[45:22.200 --> 45:28.120]  com and it's national editorial no federal endorsement for southern prairie law center this
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.560]  is exactly what we should be talking about and it turns out that shooters and killers and people
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.480]  take the news of southern prairie law center demonizing libertarians and conservatives and
[45:39.480 --> 45:47.640]  then go and shoot and attack and kill people uh floyd corkins 28 learns his fate july 15th when
[45:47.640 --> 45:52.520]  he returns to federal court in the district of columbia for sentencing for his february 6th guilty
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.840]  plead for three felonies including interstate transportation of firearms and ammunition
[45:56.840 --> 46:00.680]  assault with a tit to kill while armed and committing an act of terrorism while armed he
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.760]  could be sentenced to 40 years in federal prison we have that clip last week up on the site where
[46:04.760 --> 46:11.080]  he said i did it i went and attacked uh because this was a group that criticized homosexuality
[46:11.080 --> 46:15.800]  now again whether you agree with that or don't agree or neutral on the subject the point is
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.960]  it's people's free speech they shouldn't be attacked i mean my god they're teaching kids you
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.800]  know how to masturbate at age five uh via the federal government i mean that's pedophilia
[46:25.800 --> 46:30.680]  whether it's heterosexual or homosexual but see you still don't say that anybody should go shoot
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.520]  jocelyn elders for pushing that years ago absolutely not we should shoot her down with the
[46:36.520 --> 46:44.280]  words with the truth not not not with a gun even if he gets only half that much jail time corkins
[46:44.280 --> 46:48.840]  will forever be known for entering the family research councils washington headquarters on
[46:48.840 --> 46:55.080]  august 15 2012 and firing three shots before being subdued by a wounded security guard and he
[46:55.080 --> 46:58.120]  went on to say he did it because of the southern prairie law center and there have been other
[46:58.680 --> 47:04.280]  other attacks and things that go on and you know my point is the southern prairie law center came
[47:04.280 --> 47:10.120]  out in federal court documents that jesse trying to do soon and got the different newspapers especially
[47:10.120 --> 47:16.680]  in salt lake i reported on this a few years ago he was able to get the documents in federal lawsuits
[47:16.680 --> 47:21.640]  over his brother's death um and also because of carol howe and other informers that blew the
[47:21.640 --> 47:27.160]  whistle that the southern prairie law center was running the command base that was in command of
[47:27.160 --> 47:33.800]  mcvey who himself was another pentagon infiltrator who they just set up and see what did i say watch
[47:33.800 --> 47:38.840]  the boston bombers be on cia payroll and being flown around and being protected by the state
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.800]  department in the stands august in other areas because they don't even let you go there and
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.520]  come back basically nowadays unless you're part of that it turns out sure enough they were that's
[47:48.520 --> 47:56.360]  the big elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about i mean bare minimum bare minimum they were
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.120]  allowed to attack and they knew that they were extremist nutballs they protected them that's
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.360]  now come out you know four different first it was one then two then three then four federal
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.080]  agencies knew and stood down boom false flag period you know somebody's gonna do something you open
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.200]  the door for them you help them you're involved it's a false flag to take liberty and freedom
[48:14.200 --> 48:20.120]  and distract the public but getting back to this southern prairie law center comes off like a bunch
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.880]  of you know dope smoking trendy hippies that's kind of their public face i even ran into one of
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.440]  their employees one time and he was like oh we're not that bad we're just hippies and i'm like don't
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.840]  give me that crap he goes well actually we do spend like 30 million a year in security alone they
[48:34.840 --> 48:38.920]  get hundreds of millions of dollars i forget the number it's in the hundreds of millions guys pull
[48:38.920 --> 48:44.280]  up annual but i think maybe in like five years they got something like 200 million dollars from
[48:44.280 --> 48:50.200]  the feds i forget the exact number the point is is that it's their job to go out and demonize anybody
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.840]  that's a liberty lover and then clearly they have sister organizations via the fbi like hal turner who
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.280]  i said for a decade was definitely an fbi asset because he would say kill judges kill people by
[49:02.280 --> 49:07.800]  the way go after alex jones almost every time he broadcast and some of the most vicious people coming
[49:07.800 --> 49:14.120]  after me were were mentally ill white supremacists wound up by hal turner who is now in federal
[49:14.120 --> 49:18.280]  prison because when hackers got into his email and released the fact that he was a quote national
[49:18.280 --> 49:25.800]  security asset above fbi speaking to a through the fbi to a group above fbi that's just department
[49:25.800 --> 49:32.760]  that's that's eric holder and his cutout group in in my research groups like the southern property
[49:32.760 --> 49:36.920]  law center that are at justice department and above because they use foundations that can act
[49:36.920 --> 49:44.040]  outside of oversight to basically get away with anything and so again when those hundreds of emails
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.120]  got released with him being handled by the fbi that's how lazy they are like like people wouldn't
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.280]  find out that he was you know he wasn't going to a park to get his orders in a satchel like you're
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.760]  supposed to have your you know one of these operatives historically used to it via email
[49:56.760 --> 50:02.840]  and there he was trying to wind up that's what they called it uh mentally ill extremist ex cons
[50:02.840 --> 50:08.600]  and people to do bad things and of course i knew he was a fed attacking me every day uh saying kill
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.040]  judges over and over again for years never getting in trouble uh i mean most people that attack us
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.200]  you go look them up and they're saying blow up the federal reserve i mean if i said that there'd be
[50:18.200 --> 50:24.360]  police cars in an hour wherever i was i mean police cars boom handcuffs gone because i'm not a
[50:24.360 --> 50:29.320]  globalist i'm not a fed and and they would know oh we don't control that alex isn't a fed but when
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.120]  they do this stuff they get away with it so it shouldn't just not get federal funding it shouldn't
[50:34.120 --> 50:40.760]  just not get federal funding in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the years they it should
[50:40.760 --> 50:46.360]  be investigated by congress because this is the group trying to radicalize politics and demonize

[54:13.160 --> 54:16.600]  hour they're kind of like houston and i'm appearing space capsule if there's any technical difficulties
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.400]  they'll pop in also have some news updates william f jasper i don't have his bio in front of me
[54:21.400 --> 54:26.920]  but he's been editor of the new america and from time to time uh he is going to be uh joining us
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.440]  coming up because we wrote an article last week for the new american magazine dealing with the
[54:30.440 --> 54:34.680]  e u and bankers bragging that they're an authoritarian system so i think it's important
[54:34.680 --> 54:39.400]  to get him on to talk about kind of the history of the john burt society too that's been so demonized
[54:39.400 --> 54:42.680]  they just count on you being dumbed down and oh that's that discredited group like
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.960]  how much is this credited we didn't buy any bullets or yeah we uh we bought a bunch of
[54:47.960 --> 54:53.160]  bullets but it's uh it's a no big deal yeah they're discredited because the bullets aren't to shoot
[54:53.160 --> 54:58.680]  you now getting back to the southern prairie law center they have the expanded definition of hate
[54:58.680 --> 55:06.920]  and and i went to source watch uh their assets are at 189 million point seven dollars and they've
[55:06.920 --> 55:13.400]  been known to raise over a hundred million dollars a year according to their 501c3 tax filings i'm
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.600]  looking at from source watch dot o r g so i knew those hundreds of millions numbers were accurate
[55:18.600 --> 55:24.200]  so it's 189 million and assets point seven they get fundraising but also federal funds and and
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.400]  just a few weeks ago we saw the fox news article showing the army manuals saying all christians
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.240]  catholics evangelicals you name it are next to al-qaeda and our extremist terror organizations
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.280]  that's fox news and i recognize the flyer graphics because i've seen so many federal
[55:40.280 --> 55:45.480]  documents at southern prairie law center about 80 percent of the time it's there just just you know
[55:45.480 --> 55:51.160]  them their documents with a new name on it and then about 15 20 percent of the time it's adl
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.400]  and i've learned how they look they're very lazy i mean i mean you just you just keep regurgitating
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.080]  the same lies and the and the expanded definition of hate is families are hateful being white in
[56:01.080 --> 56:06.360]  and of itself is hateful of course they're mainly white uh it's just all about divide and conquer
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.800]  they're the ones selling racial division and and now you've got uh billy grams son pushing their
[56:11.800 --> 56:16.440]  line you've got the southern baptist convention uh might as well just come out for the communist
[56:16.440 --> 56:22.200]  party usa this is the takeover they're all moving right now in their cultural revolution by the
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.800]  way it's not going too well for them the problem is they're they're in power so they're getting
[56:25.800 --> 56:31.480]  what they want done while waking everyone up and david you've done some reports on this specifically
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.040]  where they've then had army colonels come out and vomit a southern prairie law center trash
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.560]  all over everyone tell folks about that well just a couple of weeks ago we had a email that
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.120]  surfaced that attacked both the american family association and the family research council
[56:46.120 --> 56:50.760]  and the family research council is the organization that you let off with that this guy who was
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.760]  inspired by the southern poverty law center went in and started trying to shoot people up
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.680]  and this lieutenant colonel jack rich sent out an email to his subordinates it was quite a lengthy
[57:00.680 --> 57:05.480]  list of subordinates that he sent this out to warning them about specific groups and one of
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.360]  the first ones first couple ones he warned about where the family research council and the american
[57:10.360 --> 57:16.520]  family association he said they were hate groups he said they didn't share army values and what he
[57:16.520 --> 57:21.800]  was doing was linking them together with the westboro baptist people who truly i in my opinion
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.520]  is a very hateful group they they're the ones who show oh come on you know i i bet a lot of money
[57:26.520 --> 57:31.480]  those guys are federal funded yeah right but i mean i've seen long extended films of them
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.440]  and it's definitely big a big act but it's it's it's really crazy you know westboro uh
[57:36.440 --> 57:42.280]  uh baptist church what they're absolutely insane but the american family research the american
[57:42.280 --> 57:47.400]  family association the family research council are very mainstream uh evangelical protestant
[57:47.400 --> 57:53.160]  organizations and they are not hate organizations but they're labeled as such because they're also
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.480]  now more and more getting getting shot up and the people say they did it you know because
[57:57.480 --> 58:00.520]  of the southern poverty law center groups affiliated with that but here's the interesting
[58:00.520 --> 58:05.400]  thing is that they asked for and i don't believe they've gotten an apology from either that lieutenant
[58:05.400 --> 58:10.600]  colonel jack rich or from the pentagon disputing what he said because of course we've seen report
[58:10.600 --> 58:15.880]  after report sure what is the pentagon involved in rural affairs what is the pentagon in the
[58:15.880 --> 58:20.760]  rural council what is the pentagon doing saying christians are bad army don't look at it this is
[58:20.760 --> 58:27.400]  a domestic hardcore collectivist takeover communist funded by offshore banks that want to break this
[58:27.400 --> 58:34.360]  country and whether it's the army the fbi or local police they are all trained by open unamerican scum
[58:34.360 --> 58:37.400]  who now we're going after mainline christians will be right back

[1:00:53.960 --> 1:01:00.280]  george w bush suggests boston bombings were a conspiracy pretty powerful video i thought he
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:06.600]  said never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories us moves closer to military intervention in syria
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:10.760]  that's curtain emails article they're already doing military intervention with proxies they mean
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:16.760]  overt military bombing and you know after they do their deal with russia to like kind of stage an
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:22.280]  event blame their own assets let the russians clean out the cia zone people you give us syria
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:27.640]  we'll get our people out of doggastand i mean this is just amazing it's like it's like hitler and
[1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:32.360]  stall and dividing poland or something that's how government works i agree with um
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:37.800]  um see bell edmund's breakdown on that a few days ago uh mother of bombing suspects as it's all
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:42.680]  lies that's all up in info wars dot com multiple polls americans are more afraid of government
[1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:46.200]  than the terrorists that's right but the government has electronic voting in now so
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:51.240]  yes it doesn't matter what you want unless you enforce the constitution uh and that's just
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:56.280]  some of what's going to be coming up uh william f jasper is going to be joining us but but putting
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:00.600]  bookends on this day of the night we're talking about the southern prairie law center that harpers
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:08.680]  wrote about in 2007 and they got their tax returns 501c 3 189.7 million dollars a lot of it government
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:14.120]  funding uh approximately 60 percent of their total expenses were spent on program services they live
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:21.240]  like kings uh in 2009 that's the latest numbers and they still at every professional i know you
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:27.640]  know my dad's a dentist every lawyer he knows gets mailed uh the magazine which i'm always in
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:34.040]  or almost every time i've seen it it's a quarterly magazine where they put toothless clan members run
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:39.960]  by feds next to mainline christian groups some of the biggest in the country i mean they just say
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:44.840]  hey we shouldn't teach five-year-olds how to masturbate and they're like these people are evil
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:49.800]  and then the guy goes in and shoots them and it's like so what we're liberal i mean it's just it's
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:54.600]  just over the top uh and and again they're here for an authoritarian takeover i'm not just saying
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:59.080]  that david night the final comments on that before i come back and talk to jasper i think what you
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:04.840]  said earlier alex is is the key you got to ask yourself not only why would the army attack
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:08.760]  mainstream organizations like the family research council and the american family association
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:15.080]  but why is the army doing this why it's kind of like when you saw the wake-o when that was
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:19.800]  unfolding we were told that uh they had to do that to protect the children and that there were child
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:25.160]  abuse charges it's like that's not the jurisdiction of the federal atf to come in they could have
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:29.640]  arrested him in town every day they wanted the big fight they wanted to kick off the domestic
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:34.920]  purge they hate gun owning christians so they picked a weird group to set the precedent right
[1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:39.960]  these people these people just don't want power they hate us it's the figure this out it's the
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.680]  same sort of thing here you got to ask yourself why is the army weighing in on this why is the army
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:50.120]  telling people that uh the family research council and the american family association are hateful
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:54.360]  groups that are hate groups and they don't share army values why is by the way they're
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.080]  incredibly milk toast they're incredibly milk does i mean look the army document three weeks ago
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:04.600]  fox news says an evangelicals but by the way are worshiping the the southern barbie law center
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:10.440]  and all catholics are extremists next to al qaeda i mean where where are the where are the
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:15.560]  catholic groups up in arms about this right that's a big group to say all the catholics period
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:21.480]  yeah absolutely so i i guess that's the thing that along with and we've seen this happening
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.840]  over and over again we've seen army manuals where they're uh war gaming in south carolina
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:32.760]  against the tea party uh we see the myac report that was broken by info wars back in 2009
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.080]  we see this narrative coming over and over again and you have to ask yourself
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:42.680]  you know not only do we have a standing army now permanent professional standing army which
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:46.200]  is against article one section eight of the constitution but now they're definitely turning
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:51.400]  their sights on the american people that's right they're demonizing us saying we're the bad guys
[1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:55.560]  and then we say hey what are the armored vehicles and and and and machine guns and checkpoints and
[1:04:55.560 --> 1:05:01.560]  bullets for they go that's a conspiracy theory don't run we are your friends you prepare by

[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:03.000]  it about 1993 94 95 the john birch society films that were air on local access tv helped
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  expand my awakening i kind of grew up around history and things i just knew what they were
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.960]  saying was true because it was verifiable in the even by the time i was 20 years old hundreds of
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:17.720]  history books i read and the first time i met william f jasper personally i had him on as a guest a
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:27.240]  few times uh was at operation urban warrior where the military uh was openly training with role
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:32.120]  players to confiscate guns in california and i was there shooting video of the of the of the navy
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.000]  vessel coronado dumping out thousands of marines and troops from five nations and i'd go into
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.440]  that's a sure you can come in with the press and they would they would sit there and train and
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.200]  say where'd you get the guns and ammo in the helmet well i got it in san francisco and then
[1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:49.640]  they'd have a colonel jones run up and say jones can't film that get out of here they go but sir
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:54.760]  you said he could be here so and then colonel heart would run up on video and get very upset
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:59.720]  so they did not want people seeing what is in police day 2000 so the first time i met uh jasper
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:06.440]  them now the john birch society i want to get him on today just do a brief history of it uh i'm not
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:11.080]  a member of it never been part of it just because you know i i've read the material i guess i'm kind
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:16.520]  of a to use the communist term but in a joking way a fellow traveler i grew up with my dad having
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:21.480]  their publications and bobby vaughn a john birch society member in dallas coming over when i was
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:25.960]  a kid you know not hear him around the coffee table drinking coffee talking about the new world
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:31.000]  order the fellow reserve the plan to destroy the family the plan of the megabanks to create world
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.040]  communism that they're exempt from basically everything we see today and i want to get him
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:40.200]  on about an article he wrote last week that we linked to on info wars dot com dealing with the
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:46.280]  e u bragging that oh yes we're taking over an authoritarian way they've also done that the
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:51.400]  financial times of london bragged in an article called uh and now for world government where
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:55.640]  they said yes we've been secretive yes we're authoritarian yes we're taking over and yes
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:01.000]  there's nothing you can do uh so they've gone from denying all of this to saying okay you're
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.920]  discredited because you don't want world government it's kind of like a year ago when they
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:09.320]  only bought a billion bullets now it's over two billion oh there are no billion bullets there
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.000]  are no armored vehicles there are no manuals training to take on the american people and
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.320]  veterans and gun owners now they're like of course there are manuals to take you on and of course
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:22.360]  we have two billion bullets but they're not to kill you that was the new thing in congress last
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:27.880]  week we played clips on the sunday show so if you ever notice when you watch msnbc or cnn when
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:31.800]  somebody talks about freedom or somebody talks about sovereign here somebody talks about nafta
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:37.960]  and gat admitted things or the trans texas corridor they'll go ron paul is insane that nafta highway
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:42.440]  doesn't exist even though texans see it being built and saw the billboards they're playing to your
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.920]  ignorance but you'll always see them who they're really scared of saying oh that sounds like some
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:54.040]  of them the john birch society and then they'll laugh and that's an appeal to a motion for ignorant
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:59.000]  people watching to go well when i hear the word john birch i better laugh the truth is the john
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.160]  birch society if you watch the things that mr welsh said back in the 50s when it was founded
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:08.040]  when you watch the things they put in a little blue book that i read when i was about 18
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:14.760]  all of it has come true not because they were pressing it they had good patriots in the military
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:19.880]  in the fbi in the congress who were in the hearings where this was all being announced they tried to
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:25.320]  get this all done in the 50s and 60s when they thought the public would totally trust the government
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:30.360]  after world war two people did trust the government leave it to beaver this was all announced getting
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:35.160]  rid of our military creating a un military via nato so i want to give him the floor down for the
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:41.720]  rest of the hour to as best i can this stuff really gets me excited uh william f jasper to kind of
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:46.360]  this little five minute segment left talk about the john birch society talk about how right they've
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:51.720]  been and why they've been so demonized and it's almost put them on the defensive for a while
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:55.080]  you know i've had their director and studio kind of admit that need to get off the defense get on
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.640]  the offense show what when when traders sit there and attack you and say you're a liar they're the
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:04.680]  liars i mean that's a sign and and and now people don't believe the lies anymore and then get into
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:09.800]  what the eu's forming into what the new world order is from his deep research because this is
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:13.560]  you know the head honcho over there at the publication uh and just really does amazing
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.880]  research and has been at all these major ewin events or sent his sub correspondence to it
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:23.000]  and then how things are going after we talk about the history of jbs then talk about the
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.880]  current state of world government and then how it's going for them where he sees things going
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:34.040]  williams jasper of the new american dot com we salute you and we're honored to have you my friend
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:39.640]  well thank you alex pleasure being here with you uh you uh the setup you gave me here i'll just
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:45.800]  walk right into that uh probably a lot of your listeners are familiar at least to some degree
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:50.200]  with the john birch society john birch society publishes the new american magazine of which i
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:14:00.120]  am the senior editor and uncorrespondent and uh kind of chief cook bottle washer uh the my uh my
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:08.360]  entry into this uh is probably similar to a lot of members of the john birch society uh at least uh
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:16.520]  of my generation i graduated from college in 1975 but while i was in college my last
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:23.000]  couple of years uh my parents had become members of the john birch society and when i found out
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.880]  about that i was shocked i was dismayed i was uh uh completely uh perplexed how could this happen
[1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:35.720]  because uh i knew nothing about the john birch society uh except that somewhere in my deep
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:44.440]  subconscious i had this uh image of the john birch society as being a very evil fascist organization
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:49.640]  uh racist organization somehow connected with the klax clan or something like that
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:56.520]  and i found out that a lot of my other uh friends on campus colleagues uh had pretty
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:02.280]  much the same impression and so i thought well i better educate my parents they're good people
[1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:06.840]  they certainly aren't fascists they were both world war two veterans fought against the nazis over
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:13.480]  in germany and france etc my mother's an army nurse my dad 82nd airborne paratrooper uh good
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:21.640]  patriotic people my job is the college educated son to educate them and so i started discussing
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:27.000]  this with them they gave me a whole stack of literature at that time that the john birch
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:32.600]  society magazine was american opinion the monthly magazine the weekly magazine was a review of the
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:37.080]  news they gave me a stack of those so you thought you were going to straighten them up with all your
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:43.000]  rockefeller foundation funded college schooling and they actually straighten you up right i mean
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:50.360]  they gave me a whole uh stack of books by ludigron mesis and henry haslett and and uh fridtard hyac
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:54.440]  and and i started reading all those and i'd been studying economics and i thought my gosh how come
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:16:00.600]  i've never been exposed to this these are top notch world level economists uh free market
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:06.840]  economists and why haven't i been exposed to this and so i began uh doing a lot of research it was
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:14.280]  very hard for me to overcome the biases that i had uh built into me already uh but i spent a lot
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:21.400]  of time at the university library checking the footnotes making sure that that that that things
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:28.760]  weren't being quoted out of context and i found myself being reluctantly uh reeducated and i thought
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:35.720]  gee a lot of this makes sense they're they're calling for uh constitutional government they're
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:41.480]  calling for uh getting back to constitutional government for their calling for america that's
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:46.760]  right that's right and uh they are but they're not only opposed to communism and socialism but
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:53.240]  fascism uh nazism any of the collectivist uh ideological movements and parties and wasn't
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:59.160]  john birch society's big evil opposing the vietnam war rightly oh that's so fascist right and they
[1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:05.400]  were opposed to uh the john birch society opposed it not for the same reason that the the fds and
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.600]  the leftists were opposed i mean those of those people were calling for a vietcong victory uh the
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:17.000]  john birch society said uh no it's wrong for us to be over there supporting or rather pretending
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.600]  to fight communism there while we were allowing uh castro to build a dictatorship right here at our
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:26.920]  doorstep they rightly understood that it was a galleon dialectic with the globalist playing
[1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:31.240]  both sides of it talk about the name john birch society for people that don't know the story
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:37.800]  well uh john birch uh was a baptist missionary uh just proceeding world war two over in china
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:46.840]  and long story short uh he uh had had learned uh chinese and that various chinese dialects
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:51.880]  he could identify very well with the chinese people there when world war two broke out and
[1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:58.520]  the japanese invaded china all of the foreign missionaries left uh except for him uh he stayed
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:04.760]  behind disguised himself as chinese traveled all over china uh when we entered into the war
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:12.120]  uh he began uh and jimmy do little began doing his flights over uh china bombing the japanese thing
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:18.840]  american pilots were being shot down or were being forced to abandon their planes and he
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:25.400]  developed a network to have lent uh amongst the chinese there to build landing strips and to
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:33.080]  have smuggling operations to get the american pilots uh back out of china so that um they could
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:40.920]  fly again and uh so he was a hero all over china uh the japanese were after him trying to get uh
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:48.280]  trying to uh capture him uh he was highly decorated he was very brave incredible man
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:54.360]  credible story robert welch uh wrote a book about him the life of john birch which is available
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:01.800]  uh but after at the end of the war uh he was given one last uh commission he was a missionary but
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:10.040]  he was uh commissioned as captain in the in the u.s. army uh because of his uh intelligence
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:16.520]  capabilities there and uh he was given one last mission which was to go up northern china to
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:23.160]  escort out the japanese army uh so that they wouldn't be after the armistice so they wouldn't
[1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:27.800]  be molested and he was stopped by the chinese communists all right let's stop right there we've
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:31.880]  got to go to break i want to come back and finish that story so you understand where the john birch
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:36.520]  society came from when these enemies of liberty just demonize them and say lies about them with no
[1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:41.880]  proof understand why because they know it's a real organization trying to defend this republic
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:47.720]  and without them folks ron paul and myself we would not have known all this info i'm telling
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:52.680]  you they were the launchpad for the entire giant resistance today and everybody should be a part

[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:23.960]  flying tigers into there to fight the japanese and then of course at the end of the war it was
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:28.920]  the john birch society at first said in the 50s that now had been put in power by our government
[1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:33.160]  that was declassified about a decade ago i was watching discovery channel was a history channel
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:37.000]  they had the old cia section chief admitted and then i went and looked it up there'd been an
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.320]  announcement in the news that all the government thought now would be a stabilizing effect the
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:46.280]  greatest mass murder in history but we'll talk about what happened to old john birch when he
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:51.000]  tried to actually help the chinese people he loves so much against tyranny okay so he's helped
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.560]  defeat the japanese against the millions the japanese killed incredible war crimes there
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:25:00.520]  that dwarf what happened to the u.s or even the koreans for that matter the japanese viciously
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:06.600]  attacked them demonizing japanese now that's just imperial japan were like the nazis now expanding
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:11.080]  go ahead and finish it with what happened william f jasper editor in chief uh over there senior
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:18.360]  editor over there at the new american magazine well uh captain john birch was uh sent to escort out
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:28.200]  the japanese army out of northern china and on his way uh there he was stopped by chinese communist
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:37.000]  troops and was murdered by them and uh that is not surprising because that's what communists do but
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:46.840]  remember this is the end of world war two and uh americans uh or the triumphant victors uh could be
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:54.360]  very bad news to kill an american hero i mean john birch should have received numerous uh
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:59.000]  additional citations to which he did receive him probably would have gotten metal of honor
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:05.800]  thanks to that nature except for this murder was covered up uh why was it covered up our
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:12.280]  state department uh which was being run by communists at that time wasn't he also tortured
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:19.240]  terrified since then uh wasn't he also tortured yes he was he was tortured ban edit and and uh
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:27.000]  murdered and uh this wouldn't fly very well though with our state department and our government the
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:33.880]  rosevelt and truman administrations uh trying to convince the american people that the chinese
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:40.920]  communists under malice satong and chute were our um our allies going to be the uh people that we
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:49.080]  should be turning uh china over to which is what uh what we did they they began demonizing uh
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:54.600]  china shack and the nationalist uh government building up malice satong and so they had to
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:27:00.600]  keep this hidden and robert welch who is the founder of the john birch society uh who had
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:07.800]  was he was still uh in his manufacturing was a uh out of the uh candy making company uh
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:13.800]  uh you've had the sugar daddy or sugar babies or one of these guys that invented those and he
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:20.520]  had poured all of his money into um uh alerting the american people about the dangers of socialism
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:26.120]  and big government here at home and of communism abroad now for a younger generation's day who
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:34.840]  don't even know who stalin or mal or fidel castrow is or were and have no idea about the uh
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:43.080]  climate uh in the 1940s 50s and 60s 70s when communism was taking over one country after
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:47.800]  another that might be hard to to have them but americans at that time understood that there was
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:53.880]  something really bad in the world is this world revolution going on where uh totalitarianism
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:58.040]  was being fastened on one country after another millions of people were being slaughtered and
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:06.120]  tortured and imprisoned so robert welch um was uh founded an organization he named it after john
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:13.000]  birch because uh he saw that captain john birch was an exemplary american who embodied everything
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:21.640]  that this country was great about this country and had been uh as he said uh was the first victim
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:28.440]  of world war three after world war two the the big war for the world uh communist uh totalitarianism
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:34.840]  was underway and john birch was the first victim and uh so he by the way the globalist as you
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:41.560]  know decades later now call that world war three uh and and so again just so much that john birch
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:47.480]  envisioned has actually become even mainline nomenclature in the technocracy yes well what
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:55.000]  one of the things that robert welch recognized and this is the reason why he and uh the john
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:02.200]  birch society were so demonized by the same uh the mainstream media the msm controlled corporate
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:09.720]  media uh is that he was exposing the larger picture and that is that uh the communism
[1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:15.160]  wasn't succeeding and all these millions of deaths uh were not just the result of uh the
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:22.680]  communists being so powerful and cunning and and adept at that taking over they had uh indisputable
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:30.120]  absolutely necessary help in the highest positions of power in some of the free world
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:34.760]  countries particularly stay there i want to finish up with that and then leap forward to the the
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:39.960]  grandchildren and and sons of and went and daughters of these globalists what they're doing today now
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:43.880]  they're out in the open and what's currently happening and what you see happening in the

[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:18.600]  asia including all of china um and then that was uh that was happening at the same time
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:24.760]  that the united nations uh was being founded the incipient world government that was founded
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:31.560]  in 1945 now uh you and i were brought up in in schools i believe until i went away to college

[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:43.000]  the united nations was this glorious wonderful great big brotherhood of man that was uh founded
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.480]  on at the end of world war two because uh the people of the world decided we couldn't have
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:54.200]  war anymore because of the atonic bomb uh we had to find a way of getting getting past all
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:58.280]  our differences so we'd all join hands and think who by uh and we joined together at the united
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:03.880]  nations and we'd all live in peace harmony brotherhood uh at least that was the aspiration
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:12.120]  that or we are so we were told nothing of the kind uh as i began looking in into the first
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:17.160]  first big disillusionment for me was uh georg griffin's book uh the fearful master a second
[1:40:17.160 --> 1:40:24.200]  look at the united nations you've had yet on your program i'm sure uh but that just began a a big
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:29.320]  transformation for me and understanding that really right from the very beginning we had
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:37.000]  two major forces working together hand in hand to use to build this united nations into a world
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:43.080]  government which would be tyrannical and the two hands that were joined together were first of all
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:49.800]  the communists uh stalin's agent the since he was the main guy involved from the soviet union
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:55.320]  and putting together the charter of the united nations the guy on our side supposedly was
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:41:02.760]  alger hiss alger hiss of course was a soviet agent himself but he was also an agent for a member
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:09.720]  of the council on foreign relations he was in fact the protege of one of the founders of the
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:16.600]  council on foreign relations john foster dollars uh former secretary of state and so so we had the
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:23.000]  council on foreign relations and the communists working together to to put this organization
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:29.480]  into place which would eventually assume a global legislative executive and judicial powers it would
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:35.080]  be empowered with a police force and an army and that is under process right now but we saw right
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:40.840]  at the very beginning not only alger hiss but uh harry dexter white other another soviet agent
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.600]  and he he was there at the founding conference he became head of the international monetary fund
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  uh and then he was followed by virginius frank co another cfr member comment member of the communist
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:59.800]  party who finally left and went to live in uh china uh but the the international monetary fund
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  is still with us as is the united nations and in fact the international monetary fund this is
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:08.840]  one of the areas i've been writing extensively on for the last several years is the big push by
[1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:13.480]  the council on foreign relations that there are other adjuncts around the world to transform
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:19.240]  the international monetary fund into a federal reserve of the world to give it all of the powers
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:25.320]  that we now have have the federal reserve to control the monetary and fiscal policy of the world
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.920]  and you wrote that something like 25 years ago a correct me if i'm wrong and now it's
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:37.640]  mainstream news but we're still coox if we talk about it uh i mean it's just amazing what is it
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:42.680]  like for you i've got to ask this to now see everything that that that that welts talked about
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:48.520]  50 years ago actually come true exactly as he said i mean what incredible intelligence
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.920]  jbs had back then i mean i don't think we would have had any chance if it wasn't for you guys
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:43:00.200]  i hate to sit here the same frustration i know but uh for those that have been uh trying to inform
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:09.080]  the american people about this all along uh only to be uh chastised as uh coox any fear mongers etc
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:14.360]  i mean many many other people though are beginning to see through that because the tea party and every
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:20.360]  other uh conservative organization religious organization if you're opposed to any of the
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:25.320]  the agenda and it's sweeping across the agenda is to completely transform the united states to
[1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:34.680]  destroy uh all morality destroy our economy uh to force us uh into interdependence to destroy
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:39.880]  our national sovereignty and that's being stripped away from us right now as we see more and more
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:46.040]  of these united nations treaties the law of the sea the what they're trying to push through with the
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:55.000]  uh global arms uh treaty with all of the global environmental uh treaties and agreements i was
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  at the earth summit in uh 1992 and saw uh and reported on all of the things of agenda 21 the
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:11.480]  biodiversity treaty and the global warming uh back then and uh so it's it's uh frustrating to uh
[1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:21.960]  be uh the years or decades ahead of where most people uh see the the the danger on the horizon
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:29.880]  one of the other areas that uh we wrote about extensively and i covered extensively over the
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:37.880]  years and now it's becoming quite apparent is the european union our correspondent hillar duberier
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:42.920]  had been writing about that for 50 years since the beginning of what was then the european coal
[1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:47.640]  and steel community and he had written about all of the people who were the socialists and
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:55.400]  one worlders behind it right from the start and he was kind of a lone voice at that time he was a
[1:44:55.400 --> 1:45:05.160]  very close uh colleague of mine i uh regarded him as one of my teachers and i got very close to him
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:13.160]  and hillar duberier uh really wrote the whole book on the history of the european what we now
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:19.800]  know as the european union and this is very important because uh the european union destroy
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:25.960]  has destroyed the national sovereignty of its member states through deception uh through bribery
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:31.960]  through coercion uh but all all the while when it was being proposed in every step along the way
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:39.880]  as it as it uh gained new powers legislative executive and judicial powers uh the the designers
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:45.240]  the architects of it swore over and over again publicly this is not going to compromise our
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:49.720]  national sovereignty this is not going to uh not in any way going to overrule we're not going to
[1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:58.040]  have a central bureaucracy that's going to ruin home rule local rule now as you pointed out early
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:03.080]  now they come up well of course we have to do we can't have a federal state without uh without
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:10.600]  giving up uh national sovereignty and now they're trying to promote that uh with uh on a new level
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:17.160]  with this uh transatlantic uh trade and investment partnership uh with the united states uh which is
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:22.360]  now president obama has asked for fast track authority to push through congress and so that's
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:27.960]  going to be one of the that is one of the battles right uh before us now because if they can push
[1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:35.800]  that through uh then again uh we have no uh recourse will follow down the same road the
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:45.000]  nations of europe have gone in uh having uh transnational courts transnational legislatures
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:51.560]  parliament etc control every aspect of our lives there will be no recourse that people of europe
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:47:03.080]  are finding out william doesn't it come down to this doesn't it come down to the fact that big
[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:09.240]  mega wealthy love monopolies as they openly talk about because then there's no competition and and
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:14.120]  they just basically buy off the governments and then shut down their competition and then on top
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:18.360]  of it they're basically eugenicists who think there's too many people so you know why not cut the
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:22.520]  resources off i mean what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole if they get their world government
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:30.920]  what are they going to set up well i i think we can uh have his as patrick pennies that have no
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:37.320]  lamp to guide my my path except for the light of history and we know uh that absolute power
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:47.000]  corrupts absolutely and we've seen that in every communist nazi fascist uh dictatorship of of any
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:56.200]  kind and uh the fact that these uh folks who uh are promoting this now happen to be so called
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:05.080]  respectable bankers and presidents and secretaries of state and whatnot uh once they have total power
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:11.880]  they are human beings that flows automatically and when we know that they're their actual history
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:19.880]  many of these people are certifiable megalomaniacs they want to have total power and no one who has
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:26.280]  total power wants total power will use it uh beneficently i agree more and more we see an
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:31.320]  end game the billions of bullets the armored vehicles the army manual saying you know that
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:36.360]  mainline christian groups are bad uh i mean this is what you'd expect a weatherman to do if they
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:41.400]  were president uh do you agree with me that things are now moving at mock speed because
[1:48:41.400 --> 1:48:45.800]  they're behind on their timetable as brzezinski has said or where do you see the world right now
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:50.600]  it's very clear that they have missed quite a number of very important uh
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:57.320]  datelines along the way uh in terms of uh putting through for instance the free trade
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:03.320]  areas americas in terms of uh uh getting the declaration of interdependence all of these
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:10.520]  things which uh uh we've published numerous times where the carbon tax four years ago when
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:16.520]  that got leaked i mean we're having victories when we engage them absolutely and so uh there
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:23.960]  is seeming frenetic activity going on but you know if you go back to one of the signal
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:32.840]  manifestos of the one world there's the insiders in this regard we've coded a lot i'm sure you
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:40.600]  have as well uh 1974 foreign affairs richard and gardener uh cfr trilateralist uh columbia
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:46.760]  university professor emeritus of international law uh blah blah i mean he's served on a number of uh
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:52.120]  he wrote about he wrote a article called the hard road to world order and it's one of the most
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:58.280]  important ones there's many others like but yeah one of the phrases that he used in there is he said
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:04.440]  as this happens as we begin forming this world government through regional arrangements on
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:12.760]  environment on the economy on security etc uh it will look like a booming buzzing confusion
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:16.840]  in other words there's going to be all this activity it's be hard to for people to keep
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:22.360]  their eyes on it but uh out of this confusion uh they have a plan it's going to create this
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:28.200]  new world order in which uh through all these regional arrangements the national sovereignties
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:35.480]  are destroyed and and the the first the the world order as it was of nation states is
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:42.600]  disaggregated and then it is brought back together in this new aggregation of a new world order
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:49.480]  where that's right in new sub sub 10 region breakdowns 10 female regions 10 global regions
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:55.000]  three mega regions within that if this is all public so this is happening on on multiple levels
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.880]  and that's i was at the uh say what stay there say that we got to go to break i want to come back
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:04.280]  and talk about this on the other side with health threats on the rise such as west nile virus

[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:23.960]  okay if you go to drudgereport.com there's a daily mail article about misha the supposed
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:29.320]  redhead guy that nobody could find for a week uh who reportedly said it was all alex jones's you
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:33.880]  know fault that the guys basically did what they did and then no one could say who actually talked
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.600]  to him in the associated press and curtain emma put an article out today at m4wars.com saying
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:43.480]  nobody can find him uh and saying you know this looks like a perfect cut out to make this up and
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:49.240]  demonize the internet well sure enough the daily mail did find him in rhode island i want to send
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:53.960]  to embodondi over there to interview him and so this just confirms kurt's article that it's
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:57.720]  basically just made up because he says it's made up and he didn't say those things when you get
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:04.440]  that added to kurt's article misha the radicalizer story hits a speed bump the emerging narrative on
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:10.440]  the boston bombing and the role allegedly played by the now deceased tamerlin hinges on a shadow
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:15.000]  we figure the government calls misha it said the red bearded muslim lives in the boston area
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.760]  but could not be located by authorities or the corporate media well now he's been found daily
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:23.720]  mail drudge report dot com right hand side we need to add that to this article and just adds to what
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:28.920]  kurt was saying so there you go that story's been on drugs since this morning okay uh going back
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:34.920]  to our guests in this little segment the next and jerald solente uh is uh coming in
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:41.400]  william f jasper of the new american magazine uh again whether she were getting into being at
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:47.240]  these globalist meetings and how they operate go ahead well one of the very important ones uh
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:54.600]  where we see uh this convergence going on this is a very important term that i'm sure many of
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:58.360]  your listeners are familiar with but they should be more and more familiar with this convergence
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:04.200]  where this is the plan after world war two is first to build up the communist countries where
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:10.040]  the hegell and dialectic where they would be a credible force against the free world and then
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:16.120]  to have a well we can have this constant um uh threat of nuclear war we're going to have to
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:21.560]  have some kind of convergence where we'll all come together well we couldn't do that with
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:28.120]  communism being uh on what let him call war communism antagonistic or so we had to have
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:33.720]  uh peace communism and so that's what's happened over the last 20 years supposedly communism has
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:40.920]  collapsed uh now we can merge converge peacefully with the uh communist countries with china russia
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:46.600]  etc and uh i was at one of these i've been at a number of the big convergence uh conferences
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:52.600]  one of the big venues for this is uh gorbachev state of the world forum which i've been at
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:57.800]  virtually all of them the big one of the big ones was in san francisco in 1995 the anniversary of
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:02.440]  50th anniversary of the founding of the united nations in san francisco gorbachev was there
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:08.520]  had dead turner was a big new brzezinski all of the uh big names from around the world there
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:14.600]  and speaking brzezinski made his speech um which i reported on from there and we recorded it uh
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:20.760]  that's where he made his famous uh statement that we cannot leap into world government in one step
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  it has to uh occur through a gradual step by step regional uh developments and this of course is a
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:36.760]  restatement of what a number of other key one world new world order architects have stated which
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:43.320]  we've reported on which is that we have to have these regional arrangements which destroy the
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:50.680]  the national sovereignty by uh linking country to country in region to region and that's where we
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:59.720]  what we see happening through many of the different economic uh security uh military uh operations
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:05.400]  because they recognize that most americans particularly by the other people in other
[1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:12.440]  countries as well would be opposed to actually building at the united nations into to one
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:17.560]  globalized central government so they had to do a piecemeal and so that's what we see happening
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:24.280]  here with the trade agreements with environmental agreements with uh now the security agreements
[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:28.280]  and this is what we see but they all see the authority to unelected corporate boards who
[1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:32.600]  could even exempt themselves from taxes and give themselves government contracts and too big to
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:37.320]  fell money it is incredible five more minutes with william f jasper from the new american magazine

[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:06.440]  that's i cannot understate you know overstate anything i say is an understatement of the
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:13.160]  entire movement against the globalist the original battle prospectus breakdown on their plan is from
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:19.800]  mr welch and uh you over the last 37 years and others mr mcmanus i mean it's such a small group
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:26.520]  too uh and absolutely demonized but knowing you're right uh and and they're probably 10 to 15 years
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:32.920]  behind their own documents so god bless you i mean i just i salute everybody that that's been
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:37.160]  fighting the globalist jim tucker american free press just died he helped fight him as well
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:42.200]  but where do you see the future going is i don't we can get into nuts and bolts we'll have you back
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:45.720]  very soon i don't know why it's every few years it will come back we'll have you back in a month
[2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:49.320]  maybe you can guess though sometimes you get a good good skype and a good microphone but
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:54.920]  mr uh jasper how do they subscribe and where do you see this battle going in the future okay great
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:03.480]  uh easiest way is the new american dot com uh we have both the print magazine which you mentioned
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:09.640]  and it's actually biweekly and uh so 25 issues year that we take a break one one week so it's
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:17.480]  25 issues it's $39 for the print or you get 49 for $49 you get the print and you can get it by
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:24.040]  via email and pdf form as well and there's a lot of exclusive stuff in the print magazine we're
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:30.840]  we're uh while many of the major print magazines have folded or gone under in major uh newspapers
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:37.160]  we're still uh holding in there doing the actual hard copy print magazine please don't stop because
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:42.760]  people really pay attention to hard copy people really pay attention yeah but i have to stress
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:51.800]  also that the online edition we have uh ten uh two fifteen new articles a day uh that uh
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:56.200]  are going to be appearing in the in the print magazine so there's a there's some material
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:02.520]  that we include in both but uh there's exclusive material online and in print so it's a now i see
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:08.520]  you guys linked up on the drugs report uh the new world order's gotta hate that yeah well uh this is
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:13.400]  this is one of the encouraging things alex and that is that as it gets later and later in the game
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:21.560]  as the the lines uh begin to be drawn here and people see hey wait a second we're losing freedom
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:28.440]  uh every step of the way here uh let's uh let's find out about it more and more people are waking
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:33.560]  up the the big question is are we going to wake up enough people in enough time and get them uh going
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:40.360]  to getting us all shooting in the right direction uh figuratively of course uh uh but but i think
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:44.120]  we're going to win if everybody takes action well i mean i mean i really see us more and more
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:50.520]  gaining ground well one of the things you you mentioned is that uh there's so much happening
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:55.560]  there they're uh speeding up this whole thing on on a lot of different levels and that is true
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:00.920]  and i i see part of it as desperation they are uh in fact we've published a number of things showing
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:05.640]  that uh many of the people that are pushing this in congress but also in the think tanks
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:10.360]  with places like the council on foreign relations and whatnot they they are saying amongst themselves
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:15.560]  hey we can't let the the the crazy people out there know what's going on we can't let the
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:23.880]  american people know they'll all uh uh go berserk over this and uh so at at areas at venues like the
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:30.280]  world economic forum and uh other uh high globalist meeting places like this they are acknowledging
[2:04:30.280 --> 2:04:36.040]  that hey uh we've got to uh step things up here we've got to be more uh deceptive we've got to
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:42.040]  undermine uh opposition within uh political and that's what they're doing and it's only backfiring

[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:54.040]  for me to be here today alex and what i'd like to do during this segment is really what we do
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:00.280]  every day on trends in the news it's part of the subscription to the trends journal and their
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:06.200]  nightly broadcasts of course they're not as long as the one i'm going to do now but they average
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:14.440]  anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes so let's start off with today's trends in the news and the first
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:22.200]  one one of the ones you just mentioned is that white house correspondence dinner you know i was
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:31.560]  just listening to william jasper of new american magazine and say and you alex saying that yes we
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:40.040]  can change this it can be changed we don't have to go down this course and if you don't believe me
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:49.560]  look at the white house correspondence dinner and how lame it is and you think you're in a
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:58.280]  high school assembly just listen to some of this stuff i recognize that this job can take a toll on
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:06.440]  you i understand second term need a burst of new energy try some new things and then my team and
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:09.720]  i talked about it we were willing to try anything so we borrowed one of michelle's tricks
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:18.520]  listen to the festivities
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:29.960]  that's enough that's enough then you hear conan o brian you listen to the prostitutes
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:38.440]  clap on cue it's disgusting and what's more disgusting is how anybody could look up to this
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:46.520]  stuff and you look at all the media that came out oh obama hit him with a one two punch oh conan
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:54.040]  was fabulous the guys are reading like this from their notes and all the prostitutes laugh
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:12:01.640]  they should be it's a disgraceful spectacle of human beings acting at the lowest level
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:07.880]  so you take this information and this is what you're fighting this is what you're up against
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:15.080]  you're up against nothing you've heard me say this before i'll say it again all these politicians are
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:21.880]  are the same people you couldn't stand in high school in college that wanted to be class president
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:28.840]  and head of the student council the suck ups to brown noses the gladanders the overly ambitious
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:35.320]  and the insincere and who are the prostitutes the same clowns that were the journalists
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:41.080]  that ran the school newspapers it's like they're talking to the principal of the school or the
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:47.400]  or the president of the college when they interview the president so when i listen to mr jasper when
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:54.840]  i listen to alex jones the future is ours unless you think you're they're better than you are
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:13:03.880]  so to me it's very hopeful you look at these clown acts amateur hour for what it is let's move on
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:11.640]  gold well gold prices are up a little bit today and they're up about 12 percent since when they
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:17.080]  bought them down a few weeks ago and i've said this before for those of you who haven't heard it
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:30.760]  before my first buy of gold was in 1978 at $187.50 an ounce i also bought gold on january 20th 1980
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:39.000]  at the high during the day at 875 it closed at 850 i remember what it felt like back then
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:45.320]  when the market was diving very different sentiment now back then there was no russia
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:52.840]  back then there was no china russia was a soviet union everything east of berlin was locked behind
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:14:00.600]  the iron curtain the only thing people knew back then about china was mal india they do nothing
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:09.240]  about india it's a global world now you're seeing the people rushing in to buy gold as the prices
[2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:17.720]  are dropping because everyone knows that you cannot keep juicing the economy by printing more money
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:25.480]  so look at the news today oh on may 2nd they're going to meet over there in the european sensual
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:33.640]  bank and they're going to be lowering interest rates that's the word coming out from the experts
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  and then you look what's going on why is the market even going up a little bit today
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:49.800]  read the information they'll tell you why is bloomberg there's just a positive tone to the
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:59.080]  market in part because recent lackluster economic trends have reinforced investors belief that the
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:07.720]  federal reserve will continue to press on the gas pedal and that's from chad morganlander
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:16.600]  and his firm they uh they oversee 130 billion dollars gas on the pedal you know what kind of
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:23.720]  language that is i can't say this on this show but the first letter is b and the second letter is s
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:32.520]  in saying the two words because that's what that is gas to the pedal no it's pumping more worthless
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:42.120]  money into the economy and devaluing the currency and it's going on globally and that's why i believe
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:49.560]  in gold let's look at some of the headlines this is from the new york times the self-proclaimed
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:56.680]  paper a record of which i like to call it the toilet paper of record considering the wonderful
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:03.080]  job they've done to take us to war for fake reasons and to keep propping up the lies and
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:11.000]  keeping the propaganda going this is a great one car's eyes office gets beds full of cash
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:20.280]  cash from the cia a decade of paying for afghan influence can you imagine that don't have a job
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:27.320]  the one you have stinks can't pay your mortgage don't have any rent money can't make ends meet

[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:47.880]  as mr car's eyes chief of staff from 2002 to 2005 it came in secret and left in secret all told tens
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:57.880]  of millions of dollars and it goes on and on and on how this scam the cia's money it's your money
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:04.760]  hey cities are rotting alex is talking about our rundown little rock looks don't worry about it

[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:20.120]  wars going you read the quotes in this paper it is astounding the things they say here cia's money
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:27.480]  goes to paying off warlords nothing like a warlord oh they're wonderful you need a good warlord your
[2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:36.040]  community and politicians many of whom have ties to the drug trade and in some cases the taliban
[2:17:36.040 --> 2:17:42.200]  yeah one of go back to the car respond instead of look who's running this country look who's
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:48.200]  making these decisions if you were right to do anything like this so stupid in our jobs
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:56.680]  we would be fired but it's okay when the government does it the headlines here are astounding the
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:05.000]  cash does not appear to be subject to oversight and restrictions no hey it's their money the cia's
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:12.680]  money where they get it they got it from you this is where your tax dollars are going no more
[2:18:12.680 --> 2:18:20.280]  foreign intervention everything they do there's a loser and you can't see a bigger loser than right
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:30.680]  over here on the front page of the toilet paper of record so that's where it's all going that's
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:39.560]  where it's heading and it doesn't look very good yeah these quotes are brilliant huh much of it
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:47.480]  also goes to keeping all warlords in line check this line out this is from an old warlord mr.
[2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:56.200]  dostrom i asked for a year up front in cash so i could build my dream house he was quoted as saying
[2:18:56.200 --> 2:19:07.080]  in a 2009 interview in time magazine that's right he gets his hundred thousand dollars up front
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:14.040]  piles it up so he could build a home of his choice so this is what we do on trends in the news

[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:38.840]  hey them islamists are taken over there in syria that's okay they're everywhere and you know who
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:48.120]  built the islamist group don't you that was jimmy carter yeah you remember the proxy war that the
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:56.040]  united states started giving money to people like osama bin laden and all the rest of them to fight
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:25:05.160]  the russians when they were going into afghanistan to stop the russians yeah those islamists so now
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:13.960]  they want more money they want more intervention people like linsey graham calling for more action
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:23.960]  in syria because it appears they're all suffering from attention deficit disorder classes classes
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:35.400]  carry worries of a new civil war in iraq that's right a new civil war in iraq that's the word coming
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:46.360]  out but hey why believe me look at the papers oh 11 dead in another car bomb in iraq wonderful
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:54.840]  all yeah but listen to what happened over when president bush announced the opening of his new
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:26:04.120]  library you know president obama said that he's drawing a red line that syria can't cross i wonder
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:12.040]  if he got the crayon from bush to draw that red line what are we i love these land the language
[2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:17.320]  that they use we're taking this off the table that's the other that's the other lovely one
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:23.320]  they use we're taking it all off the table and we're drawing a red line islamist rebels create
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:31.320]  dilemma on syria policy nowhere in rebel controlled syria is there a secular fighting
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:40.040]  for us to speak of and this is from the toilet paper of record so following going back to
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:45.720]  how they keep screwing up and getting more opportunities to do so
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:57.160]  call rove you remember him that was bush's frontman backman sideman and man behind the scenes yeah
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:07.160]  the porky pig of politics call rove here call rove on bush legacy he got the big things right
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:15.160]  right i do believe that the iraq war was the right thing to do and the world is a safer place
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:25.400]  for having saddam hussein gone don't you all feel happy don't you feel safe having a nice day
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:32.840]  who cares about saddam hussein what a big lie and how come these guys aren't brought up
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:41.320]  on war criminal charges to see who knew what when regarding wmds of weapons and mass destruction
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:49.960]  so bush was interviewed by all of the prostitutes on all of the channels from the mainstream media
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:59.400]  and they all sucked up and all bush kept saying and all the mouthpieces are saying is let's let
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:07.320]  history decide oh yeah let history decide if bush messed up or not why let history decide
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:14.920]  let's decide now with the facts i'll tell you why they want history to decide here keeps going
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:24.200]  here he goes the porky pig of politics call rove the greats you know you can't touch George
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:30.760]  washington abraham link and fd are the greats but yeah i put george bush up there says rove
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:38.840]  who refers to a recent abc washington post poll that found 40 percent approve of bush
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:48.680]  as evidence that he will continue to be remembered more keenly as time goes by he'll be continue
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:56.040]  he'll be remembered more keenly as time goes by because everybody will forget what a screw up
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:04.280]  he was he didn't even show up on inauguration day that's right that's how much the people hated him
[2:29:04.280 --> 2:29:11.320]  they booed him they booed him though his chain it didn't show up they booed bush when he showed up
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:18.600]  with obama that they never booed a president a leaving president before lucillini could have
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:28.440]  got elected after having eight years of bush and guess what we got him fascism the merger of state
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:35.320]  and corporate powers and we're going to look at more of that when we come back with trends in the
[2:29:35.320 --> 2:29:43.960]  news and we're going to see why china is going to outbeat the united states as we keep going down

[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:46.840]  in the declaration of independence and i believe in the principles upon which this country was founded
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:55.720]  and when you see little cartoon characters like the clinton's and the bushes and the obamas doing
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:06.760]  their cheap routines and put them in a category with madison's and jefferson's and washington's
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:16.120]  who warned us not to become engaged in foreign entanglements who are these little weasels like

[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:33.160]  a couple of times couldn't land on the aircraft carrier and if his old man wasn't an admiral he
[2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:40.120]  would have been booted out and what's he a hero for oh he was flying over bombing innocent vietnamese
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:46.760]  and he shot down his plane that does not make you a hero and these are the people that keep yelling

[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:59.720]  garbage what these guys are talking and you know you're not going to get the truth because all you

[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:17.480]  white house correspondence dinner and you'll see the low level of human beings that call themselves

[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:50.680]  everywhere everywhere we have more wrong leaders leading us everywhere because these are the kind
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:57.320]  of people that want to get the jobs and you read about this clown that got in another guy
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:03.720]  another guy that never worked a day in his life what's his name over here
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:22.760]  Enrico Lada Enrico Letta yeah Enrico Letta let his uncle Gianni was burlesconi's chief
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:31.080]  political aide yeah and you look at the new cabinet the members of three card monty the
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:39.000]  technocrat they put in there one after another forget these labels that you hear on tv sent
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:48.520]  the left sent the right they're all they're all a part of the financial mafia that's all it is
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:55.880]  there are two mafias running the show the money changes mafia and the military industrial complex
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:40:04.680]  mafia it's a dictatorship of finance it's the merger of state and corporate powers one after
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:12.600]  another you go down the list and every one of these italian cats that are in high positions
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:23.480]  are eurocentric euro favored guys and women that want to take more pick power away from the people
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:34.440]  and centralize it under the money changes euro is a failure italy spain greece portugal ireland
[2:40:34.440 --> 2:40:42.120]  they're suffering the worst downturn since the great depression the euro is a failure
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:51.240]  it's only 12 years old it's finito they should bury it but they're going to prop it up because
[2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:58.360]  it's easy when you have a centralized currency a centralized bank to steal your money it makes it
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:07.160]  a lot easier to do a lot of smaller deals and a guy yesterday went berserk in italy mayhem
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:14.200]  greets italy's quote grand coalition grand coalition of mobsters here this is the guy
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:24.760]  luigi preti 46 unemployed and apparently driven to desperation open fire with a pistol wounding
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:33.880]  two police officers this is from the financial times unemployed apparently driven to desperation
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:44.760]  when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it and that's what we're
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:53.240]  seeing more and more of let's move on to some other news here what do we got here in the
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:42:00.760]  wall street journal oh more about those boston bombers there's a big there's a big story
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:10.600]  talk about the 19 year old is being treated for gunshot wounds in his throat head and legs that he
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:19.880]  received during confrontations with police days after the april 15th bombing i'd be hitting the bs
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:26.760]  button on that one you know why you remember this story this story was in the washington post the
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:33.080]  story was all over the media that's right there was a confrontation you heard the word there was a
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:38.520]  confrontation they found them in the boat remember the guy goes outside having a smoke sees the top
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:44.680]  on his boats miss not not put on right see some blood stains there's the kid lying there wounded
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:52.920]  and what did the cops do you remember the first story they exchanged gunfire yeah yeah that's right
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:58.760]  right they had what 9 000 troops there they could have you know they could have led the battle of
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:05.800]  the bulge they had enough equipment and men and armaments so no the gun battle never happened
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:12.200]  it was a lie just like the other lie or misinformation excuse me misinformation about
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.960]  how they also robbed a 7-11 that they never robbed so why would anybody believe anything but here's
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:23.080]  the way they wrote it again this is from the new from the wall street journal received during
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:31.080]  confrontations with police now they shot into the boat the kid was lying there could they say come
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:45.560]  out your hands up what ever happened to that one what else do we have iceland iceland votes out
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:56.200]  pro european leadership yay yay yay little iceland tiny little iceland they didn't pay back the
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:02.840]  bankers they're having a tough time over there but they're not robbing the people of their money
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:06.120]  to give it to the banking operations
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:15.160]  a little bit closer to home because again you know i was listening to the opening of the show
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:22.040]  with mr jasper and how things have to change and of course when alex jones show he always talks
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:30.040]  about you know stopping the corruption and and bringing the bringing the nation back to the people
[2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:39.320]  here's a little story in sunday's new york times many openings that state agency goes to ties
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:47.800]  goes to those with ties to governor qualmo i'm only mentioning this because it's the same thing
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:56.920]  everywhere if you read about the the guy they just arrested in bosnia the guy in france that was
[2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:02.920]  supposed to be cracking down on tax evaders you know that minister and then they found out he had
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:10.760]  a couple of million dollars in a swiss account it's the same thing everywhere and nothing is
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:19.320]  going to change nothing until the morality changes and the fish rots from the head up
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:30.680]  up so we we learned by our leaders we learned by those in power and the power is corrupt from
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:38.040]  the top down here new york states economic development agency economic development agencies
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:44.200]  by the way i got my master's degree in public administration they're a waste of money all they
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:50.600]  do is they give benefits to the very rich hey i'ma tell you what i'm gonna do i'm gonna open up a
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:57.560]  i'm gonna build a hotel in your uh you're dying town over here i want a uh 10 million dollar tax
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:04.680]  break i want loan guarantees and some infrastructure repairs and they do it which they should never do
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:11.960]  but anyway in new uh new york state economic development agency created a new position last
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:19.320]  year in a new position with paying taxes like crazy and they're creating a new position and they
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:24.760]  found a candidate to fill it a young man named willard younger yeah young willard younger
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:31.640]  who had just graduated from colgate university with a degree now check it out if you want a
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:37.960]  degree in worthlessness this guy couldn't do better but i have one better actually and you'll
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:45.640]  hear that one too a degree in classics and religion now you know what a degree in classics
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:51.400]  classics and religion gets you it gets you a job with the economic development agency
[2:46:53.080 --> 2:46:59.480]  a special projects assistant and a salary of 45 000 a year
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:06.360]  now wouldn't you think if they put an ad out
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:16.280]  for projects associate at a salary of 45 000 a year they could have actually gotten somebody
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:24.760]  qualified with experience or could it be i mean being you know there are several million people
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:33.160]  in new york his father steven p younger is a lawyer and power broker in legal circles
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:41.560]  who was a member of one of governor andrew m qualmos transitions team and he's also donated
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  26 000 dollars yeah to mr qualmos campaign over the years oh i'm nice oh donated campaign
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:58.280]  you know what these are called in real language now not a campaign donations they're called bribes
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:04.920]  and payoffs and you saw the payoff that's why i'm a believer in direct democracy the whole system is
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.760]  a rig and if you're not in it you don't get anything from it this story actually gets a lot better
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:18.280]  you know it's one one stupid thing after another and and and the jobs that these guys get there's
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:28.680]  this other guy and mr molas he was hired at 75 000 a year as a as a strategic planner associate
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:42.040]  he graduated with a degree in assy r i o l o g y a seriology the study of ancient mesopotamia
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:52.920]  yeah yeah his ties his father and his father's real estate firm have donated a total of 75 000
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:49:02.680]  to the qualmo campaign so i guess they broke even on that one huh 75 into the campaign 75 a year
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:13.000]  into his son's pocket the whole game is rigged all over the world so the stock market's going up a
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:21.720]  little bit today how come well as i said earlier good news good news the fed's gonna keep its foot
[2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:29.240]  on the pedal that's straight pumping more money that's boosting the market now this is important
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:38.600]  interest rates as we know are at historic lows so the other reason that the market's going up
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:49.400]  is pending home sales increased 1.5 percent after a revised 1 percent decline the prior month
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:57.400]  it was 0.4 percent when it came out with this but now remember
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:09.720]  1.5 percent this is after dumping trillions of dollars into the economy this is after
[2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:20.280]  keeping interest rates at record lows and this is after the FHA are giving out loans with people
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:31.080]  only putting down five percent so you can see even with all of this juice going in it's not
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:47.160]  gonna be a happy ending and again that's why i believe in gold gold is golden because they're
[2:50:47.160 --> 2:50:56.600]  gonna keep having to pump more money into it it ain't working not gonna work but don't worry
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:51:03.720]  they'll get us to war now get your mind off it in the last two years alone the us has seen huge
[2:51:03.720 --> 2:51:10.040]  losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the us costing us 20 billion and lost

[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:20.120]  think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected the fact is you are

[2:54:07.720 --> 2:54:13.720]  last segment last segment thank you alex jones this is the alex jones show and this is gerald
[2:54:13.720 --> 2:54:21.000]  salenti giving you an example of our trends and the news that we do every monday through friday
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:26.120]  as part of your subscription to the trends journal now i said i was going to give some positive
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:31.320]  elements say a little bit more about china china is going to do better than the united states
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:37.480]  i don't believe china is going to go to war they're building their internal economy they have 1.2
[2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:42.520]  billion people there and they have a lot of business to do with each other and that's where
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:48.440]  they're going to go in the future and that's the way america should go that's the way italy
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:55.320]  should go you know my saying think for yourself that's the way i see it i want my money staying
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:55:00.600]  in my country i don't want it going anywhere anywhere in foreign aid anywhere in foreign
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:07.240]  products i want to buy i want to buy shoes from new york from from america i want to buy my shirts
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:14.840]  made in america and i want to buy all my product local and boy do we have great local product
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:21.400]  up here in colonial kingston in the heart of the hudson valley i just had some copper cola
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:28.520]  that they made over here locally that was as good as i've had in italy the way we bring this back
[2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:35.400]  is we do business with each other just like the chinese are going to do and hey if it's good enough
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:42.360]  for the chinese why shouldn't it be good enough for us or maybe you want to buy that next shirt
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:51.000]  from another sweatshop that blows up burns down or is destroyed in bangladesh that just kill 400
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:59.480]  people so you could go shopping at a large self storage unit that they call walmart a target buy
[2:55:59.480 --> 2:56:08.360]  local and number one again think for yourself only what i'm saying break the chains if you're
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:16.440]  going to go out for a cup of coffee break the chains go local break the chains we have become
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:24.840]  corporate slaves unless of course you go to colgate and your old man gives qualmo money or
