[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:22.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.200 --> 00:31.760]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 26th of May 2014 can you believe we're
[00:31.760 --> 00:40.520]  about to be halfway in the middle of next month into 2015 I mean it's like
[00:40.520 --> 00:44.520]  we're in an acceleration machine into the future but I guess we are as we
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.400]  approach the singularity all right you're gonna hear lots of radio shows
[00:48.400 --> 00:55.360]  today just worshipping veterans worshipping wounded vets maybe even
[00:55.360 --> 00:58.880]  some charities to try to get them prosthesis and things but you're not
[00:58.880 --> 01:03.560]  going to hear a lot out there about how there's a long tradition in ancient Rome
[01:03.560 --> 01:08.080]  and continental Europe and then of course here in the United States of
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.480]  treating veterans like trash after you're done with them because the
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.480]  establishment wants troops to kill foreign enemies and take over land in
[01:18.480 --> 01:22.200]  imperial governments they don't want you around afterwards because they're
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.440]  scared of you you're like an old cannon that they've spiked because they don't
[01:26.440 --> 01:29.920]  want it being used and that's what's unfolding that's what's happening we're
[01:29.920 --> 01:33.360]  gonna premiere here on the radio on the next segment a seven-minute report by
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.360]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs Army veteran out at the VA outside Austin the new VA
[01:39.360 --> 01:45.080]  where they admitted on tape with a hidden camera sunglass camera the police
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.080]  said you can't be here as they have their cameras openly out you've got to go
[01:49.080 --> 01:54.600]  because of the VA scandal so that is going to be coming up here on the radio
[01:54.600 --> 02:00.000]  transmission the video of that today on this Monday edition will be posted up on
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.560]  info wars.com so if you're a radio listener you can go there and see it
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.280]  for yourself and follow along with the audio of that is coming up for radio
[02:10.280 --> 02:13.920]  listeners then Darren McBreen has another report on veterans of another
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.720]  type NFL veterans many of former NFL veterans calling it a cult but they
[02:18.720 --> 02:22.840]  were drugged with illegal drugs before many games and that's now coming out
[02:22.840 --> 02:26.440]  yeah when I played football I didn't take them but some of the other young
[02:26.440 --> 02:31.040]  people did in high school it was known that people were taking steroids and it
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.720]  was quietly being encouraged that's what it's all about in the culture of
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.000]  winning in a state like Texas where it's the religion so that's just some of the
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.720]  news coming up today will review the latest breaking news on the VA scandal
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.200]  and folks are asking why isn't anyone been fired yet well I'll break that down
[02:51.200 --> 02:54.720]  at the start of the next segment as well but I hope that you're all having a
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.120]  happy and safe Veterans Day I want to attempt today to get people to think
[02:59.120 --> 03:02.800]  about really taking care of our veterans and not sending them to illegal
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.880]  wars and unconstitutional actions and then taking care of them once they get
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.280]  back here not listing them as public enemy number one as the Department of
[03:12.280 --> 03:15.800]  Homeland Security has done and then of course I have solidarity with the vets
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.840]  not that I'm one but that then constitutionalist libertarians patriots
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.280]  myself by name Ron Paul and others are listed along with returning veterans as
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.000]  the number one enemy they're listed as number one but we're listed after that so
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.360]  so we're all in this together and we'd ask why well most veterans don't trust the
[03:36.360 --> 03:39.480]  system they know how they've been treated they know the corruption they saw
[03:39.480 --> 03:42.560]  in the military they know how corrupt these last wars were and that's why
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.960]  you're on the chopping block just like I am and everybody else is who promotes
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.560]  liberty and stands for justice and that's why we've got two in the words of
[03:50.560 --> 03:57.560]  Benjamin Franklin all hang together or we will surely hang separate and that is
[03:57.560 --> 04:03.320]  my message to you out there on this Memorial Day as we go to break I want
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.440]  to remind you last week we took a lot of phone calls from active duty and and
[04:07.440 --> 04:11.800]  retired military veterans and they said undoubtedly in the six years since
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.800]  Obama got in and the last two years since Obamacare began to be phased in the
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.280]  VA's gone from being a nightmare hit and miss situation to absolute death panel
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.920]  list absolute hell and I want to challenge all of those on MSNBC CNN all
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.000]  the White House run channels who were saying it's a conspiracy theory that
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.880]  there's any problems do you really want to sign on to something this evil
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.640]  throwing veterans in the trash can I guess we throw our babies in the trash
[04:39.640 --> 04:45.120]  can 53 million of them so I guess it makes sense it's all coming up as Jimmy
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.280]  Hendricks wouldn't he a veteran takes us out here ladies and gentlemen on
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.600]  Memorial Day 2014
[04:56.840 --> 05:02.720]  stand next to a mountain from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.280]  itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.120]  not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.640]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.840]  most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[05:18.840 --> 05:22.800]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[05:22.800 --> 05:27.200]  well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.400]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.880]  allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear
[05:33.880 --> 05:38.600]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.160]  environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against made with

[06:08.400 --> 06:13.600]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[06:13.600 --> 06:16.920]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare
[06:16.920 --> 06:21.360]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our
[06:21.360 --> 06:25.400]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[06:25.400 --> 06:28.400]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more

[09:04.480 --> 09:08.840]  transmission we've got some best of info coming up but here we are on Memorial
[09:08.840 --> 09:11.840]  Day want to thank the crew CJ and others for being here to run the
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.880]  transmission today we got a sergeant staff sergeant Joe Biggs report coming
[09:16.880 --> 09:20.640]  up in a minute that's pretty powerful investigating the Austin VA that's under
[09:20.640 --> 09:27.440]  investigation for the death panels and more but first off she and Ian who's
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.600]  right at the heart of all the White House cover-ups asked the question last
[09:31.600 --> 09:39.680]  week last Friday VA scandal why isn't anyone been fired yet or why hasn't
[09:39.680 --> 09:46.200]  anyone been fired yet well that's because the VA has always been bad and
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.960]  they've always tried to put people on list and always try to put people on
[09:48.960 --> 09:53.480]  medication instead of surgeries or rehab I have a lot of family that are vets I've
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.400]  interviewed countless veterans groups it's been a nightmare for a long time
[09:57.400 --> 10:00.640]  that's no secret but every vet that called in last week we did this three or
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.120]  four days to give us their report on the VA said since Obama's been in it has
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.600]  gone from horrible to absolutely atrocious many times worse and we've
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.320]  caught them with the death panel list that Newsweek promoted the case for
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.800]  killing granny we've had eyewitness reports on last week the interviews are
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.840]  up on info wars comm of senior whistleblowers that they talk about well
[10:22.840 --> 10:25.000]  we ought to just take all the old vets out and shoot them in the back of the
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.040]  head there's this governing attitude of socialists that if we kill old people or
[10:31.040 --> 10:35.080]  kill vets or don't take care of them or abort 53 million babies that that'll be
[10:35.080 --> 10:39.200]  more for us you know the more people we have the better a civilization we have
[10:39.200 --> 10:43.120]  you go live in compact cities because there's more people and more jobs more
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.680]  opportunity you go out in the country there's nobody around the truth is most
[10:47.680 --> 10:51.880]  countries are not overpopulated China and India are if you don't have 2.1
[10:51.880 --> 10:55.440]  children there's not enough people to pay social security America has 1.3
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.080]  children it's this culture of death so the reason no one's been fired is because
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.480]  this is the orders coming down by the bean counting socialists that are
[11:04.480 --> 11:10.400]  anti-human and if you don't have a use or if they don't have a use for you then
[11:10.400 --> 11:13.680]  you need to die we're gonna skip this network break coming up because it's so
[11:13.680 --> 11:22.840]  important on Veterans Day now let me go to Bill Gates in 2010 four years ago
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.680]  admitting that Obamacare has a death panel but you can't say that that's a
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.640]  trade-off society is making because of very very high medical costs and a lack
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.440]  of willingness to say you know is spending a million dollars on that last
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.520]  three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the
[11:42.520 --> 11:47.160]  those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs but that's
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.600]  called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion okay you
[11:51.600 --> 11:58.080]  of course now let's let's go to press what's the name bill press the washed
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.360]  up CNN crossfire guy on MSNBC the washed up MSNBC their normal shows a
[12:03.360 --> 12:06.440]  hundred thousand viewers top show half mill local radio shows a bigger
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.360]  audience this is that major cities like New York or Chicago or LA I mean this is
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.000]  joke level we have affiliates in the country that have shown 200,000 listeners
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.640]  over three hours places like Orlando okay so this is joke level folks this is a
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.800]  joke level network up there with the facade a facade promoting a hoax and a
[12:24.800 --> 12:32.600]  facade that it's a conspiracy theory there's no problem at the VA this guy's
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.640]  on a liberal he's a monster pig and and and Sharpton comes in and chimes in
[12:38.640 --> 12:45.920]  the grease these guys are fascist dirt bags in my view here it is you know let's
[12:45.920 --> 12:50.760]  remember Obamacare the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land and the
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.440]  people who are ignoring the law are the governors who won't put Medicaid in their
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.240]  states or these House Republicans who tried to repeal it 54 times this is
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.520]  this is just another big lie but you know on the conspiracies you're right
[13:04.520 --> 13:07.880]  they went after Obamacare they were going to run on that this year that ran
[13:07.880 --> 13:11.960]  out of gas because it's doing so well so now they turn to Benghazi this is soon
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.960]  going to run out of gas what's next the VA I'll bet you that's what they're
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.800]  gonna run on next well they're trying to make the VA its conspiracy is fear
[13:20.800 --> 13:27.200]  mongering and and and Joe when they bring up bar as a former vice president
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.600]  Cheney skirting the law the Affordable Care Act this bill say is the law upheld
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.320]  by the Supreme Court yeah the corrupt Supreme Court saying it's a tax
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.280]  yeah to private banks and on the insurance companies that wrote it as a
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.520]  giant screw job to line the pockets of government bureaucrats to give government
[13:45.520 --> 13:48.960]  control over health care to set up death panels increase your health care costs
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.320]  while cutting the quality of care that's why the Republican leadership is
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.480]  fighting to not repeal it and to quote only change it repeal it you crooks the
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.480]  Supreme Court Sharpton also ruled what a hundred and seventy something years ago
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.800]  that black people weren't human I say that's a fraud Hitler had courts that
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.320]  did a bunch of stuff I am if the Supreme Court says I don't have a right to
[14:11.320 --> 14:18.320]  keep guns they can go jump off a cliff they go fly a kite now before I go
[14:18.320 --> 14:20.800]  any further and all these articles were skipping this network break coming up a
[14:20.800 --> 14:27.120]  20 after on Veterans Day well to me it's Veterans Day I mean I always call it
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.080]  Veterans Day I know it's Memorial Day oh yeah Patriots day what is that the
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.280]  15th and then you have the other Patriots day on the 19th but they
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.200]  celebrate in the Northeast Patriots day on the 15th but then it's really the
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.960]  19th and there's Paul Revere day the point is it's Memorial Day for me that's
[14:41.960 --> 14:47.760]  Veterans Day but anyways Freudian slip there we're gonna get to this report by
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.880]  a veteran Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs of Iraq and Afghanistan multiple purple
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.200]  hearts here he is trying to go to the VA they see our cameras they see the flag
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.040]  on our microphone they say you can't be here you can't even get to your car
[14:59.040 --> 15:02.520]  that's in the parking lot you got to go because they've already been in and out
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.520]  with their cameras they were coming back and the police admit no media allowed
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.520]  here now that there's a scandal and an investigation so here is his report
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.360]  premiering here on the radio for Memorial Day aka Veterans Day the most
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.920]  humbling part of my job is serving as commander-in-chief to the world's
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.720]  finest military and there's nothing I take more seriously than my
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.600]  responsibility to those who sacrifice their own safety to defend ours that's
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.280]  why Michelle and I have made supporting veterans and military families a top
[15:33.280 --> 15:37.240]  priority from the start well as you can see the president's number one priority
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.920]  is a veteran care now a lot of people don't know this but President Obama back
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.240]  in 2007 was on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and he still is
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.400]  I mean the specific allegations that I think were reported first by your
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.320]  network out of Phoenix I believe we learned about them through the reports
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.920]  that's when we learned about them and that's when as I understand the
[15:56.920 --> 15:59.600]  Secretary Shinseki learned about them now I find it hard to believe that Jay
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.960]  Carney says a president just now found out about this when it came out on the
[16:02.960 --> 16:11.600]  news okay we're gonna get our vehicle then we'll leave we'll get our vehicle
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.800]  leave then we were just trying to we're doing I can't get my car
[16:16.800 --> 16:25.520]  they asked them sir with their they are with info wars magazine talk show we're
[16:25.520 --> 16:27.600]  doing a report that's what we're kind of saying ever we're doing stuff on
[16:27.600 --> 16:31.360]  veteran suicides and how people think that they can help kind of fix it that's
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.360]  all okay yeah but any media can't be done on property let me get your
[16:35.360 --> 16:39.600]  information if you don't mind sir I just got kicked off the VA and Austin Center
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.560]  by police and all I said I was gonna do was interview a few veterans walking
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.320]  through the park a lot and ask them a few questions about suicide awareness with
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.440]  veterans and they said I couldn't be there on property because of the scandal
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.720]  going on right now now this is a lot about our government instead of fixing
[16:55.720 --> 16:59.240]  the problem they'd rather just sweep it under the mat and forget all about it
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.520]  today I interviewed two soldiers who gave me their accounts of mistreatment of
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.960]  VA clinics you said while you were in the service you were you know drugged
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.600]  quite a bit by the military you know excessive amounts of painkillers it
[17:13.600 --> 17:17.280]  would get you you know over time you would be addicted to things like that you
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.480]  know give me a little background on that and what you experienced with the mass
[17:21.480 --> 17:29.200]  drugging oh the mass drugging one of my duty stations after 4 Campbell pretty
[17:29.200 --> 17:36.520]  much I mean you're in pain they wrote your prescription you're freaking going
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.400]  cuckoo or say you're feeling this way this way they wrote your prescription it
[17:40.400 --> 17:43.000]  pretty much was a cool rights prescription for this whole rights
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  prescription for that and there's people that I know that will test that I was
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.800]  pretty much in the zombie-like state they sent me the therapy when I was in
[17:51.800 --> 17:57.960]  Colorado but the therapy they sent me to there was a civilian-run contractor and
[17:57.960 --> 18:02.480]  at the civilian-run facility they pretty much drug me even more and more and more
[18:02.480 --> 18:05.760]  so that necessarily wasn't the military's fault that was just another
[18:05.760 --> 18:12.800]  facility's fault when I got out of the army my friends can test for this I was
[18:12.800 --> 18:18.000]  a train wreck I literally was a train wreck a zombie hated life hated
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.960]  everything didn't know what I was going to do and it was just awful I mean you
[18:21.960 --> 18:25.120]  thought people were kind of coming after you for a bit of time there though
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.080]  didn't you oh yeah I did it's normal with PTSD to have some paranoia which I
[18:30.080 --> 18:33.280]  still suffer with right now but the amount of paranoia I was having at the
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.280]  time when I first got out was a ridiculous I mean I had friends stop
[18:38.280 --> 18:46.320]  talking to me because they thought that I was going nuts the problem was that the
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.960]  medication doctors there they were they were all about some pills just here take
[18:51.960 --> 18:57.360]  this you know maybe make you feel better there's nothing with side effects all
[18:57.360 --> 19:01.640]  the time it drove me to do nothing but want to drink and pack on a bunch of
[19:01.640 --> 19:05.440]  weight and everything else just cuz I mean all the side effects one had over
[19:05.440 --> 19:08.240]  the other what kind of pills did they give you they give you anti-depressant
[19:08.240 --> 19:11.440]  you know pain pills things like that I first got out they were giving me
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.720]  tranquilizer I mean just sedatives basically it's supposed to make you
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.800]  happier but in essence for a lot of us it just kind of seems like it makes you
[19:20.800 --> 19:24.000]  more depressed you weren't even seeing like real doctors it took me I think four
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.720]  months before actually seeing that an actual psychologist and a counselor to
[19:29.720 --> 19:33.160]  help me with some of the you know the crap I was dealing with and I'm tired of
[19:33.160 --> 19:38.080]  it and I ended up moving from Florida to Texas so and San Antonio really isn't
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.520]  any better I I ended up going there from I didn't know I had type 2 diabetes and
[19:42.520 --> 19:47.760]  I ended up going there with a blood sugar like 890 something so the VA in
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.320]  Gainesville never even called on to the fact that you had diabetes and you've
[19:52.320 --> 19:57.440]  gone an extended amount of time without even getting that taken care of yep they
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.680]  told me you know you're like you're like a soda pop away from a coma I mean
[20:01.680 --> 20:05.440]  that's a prime example I mean you could have been on a secret list like the one
[20:05.440 --> 20:11.040]  in Phoenix Arizona I mean that's scary to know that these guys could have known
[20:11.040 --> 20:16.520]  or did know and decided just to kind of let that slide and just you know whatever
[20:16.520 --> 20:20.160]  you know sort itself out over time over the past few days I've had the
[20:20.160 --> 20:23.400]  opportunity to speak with four separate whistleblowers they'll work to VA
[20:23.400 --> 20:27.720]  clinics across the nation now they all had something interesting to add in
[20:27.720 --> 20:33.000]  made statements racial swirers against veterans have made statements that you
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.440]  know older veterans they should just be taken outside and shot in the head
[20:37.440 --> 20:42.920]  because they're worthless and this person still works there one of the
[20:42.920 --> 20:47.560]  biggest issues with the VA care is the fact that we all know there's a rise in
[20:47.560 --> 20:51.320]  suicides and anxiety and depression and instead of actually treating the
[20:51.320 --> 20:56.240]  underlying issues through new technologies they just hand out pills and
[20:56.240 --> 21:02.240]  they hand out so much medication at the VA that at the VA pills have become a
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.720]  currency and veterans get arrested or they get detained because of federal
[21:06.720 --> 21:11.200]  property because they're just handed out these pills I mean I could go I have a
[21:11.200 --> 21:13.840]  back problem I could go to the VA right now and probably get a three month
[21:13.840 --> 21:19.200]  supply of Vicodin in the private industry that won't happen and I really
[21:19.200 --> 21:23.400]  believe that they rely on veterans being addicted because they go to what's
[21:23.400 --> 21:27.160]  called the addiction clinic where they receive funding per head is there a
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.040]  reason that a lot of these VA clinics and I don't know if this trickles to you
[21:31.040 --> 21:34.480]  at all but I keep getting reports from a lot of the veterans saying that when
[21:34.480 --> 21:38.160]  they go in and they have problems they're being asked if they have weapons
[21:38.160 --> 21:42.600]  how much ammo they have and where they store them at now is that something that
[21:42.600 --> 21:48.240]  is a across-the-board type question not not specifically whether they have
[21:48.240 --> 21:54.520]  weapons in the house that sort of thing but you know not to open up another can
[21:54.520 --> 21:58.560]  of worms but you know there's been issues in the past where if a doctor
[21:58.560 --> 22:05.960]  feels that a veteran is rated incompetent without that due process you know we
[22:05.960 --> 22:09.520]  would send them a letter basically saying that yeah you're not allowed to
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.920]  own weapons or you know it against it's against the Brady Bill or the Brady law
[22:14.920 --> 22:17.800]  you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the
[22:17.800 --> 22:22.680]  ability and the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement
[22:22.680 --> 22:25.560]  techniques mainstream media is not going to do their job covering this story
[22:25.560 --> 22:29.680]  whatsoever so it's our job here at Info Wars to get the story out if you have
[22:29.680 --> 22:34.480]  any tips or anything like that please email them to vets at infowars.com and
[22:34.480 --> 22:38.400]  don't forget our oath to the Constitution has no expiration date
[22:38.400 --> 22:43.440]  all right good job staff sergeant Joe Biggs with that report and there was a
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.800]  little clip there from Fox News with a SWAT team commander in a small town in
[22:47.800 --> 22:52.240]  Indiana last week story a lot of attention Drudge Report link to it
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.720]  infowars.com had it Drudge Report.com had it and they just say no we need
[22:56.720 --> 23:00.440]  armored vehicles from Iraq to fight the vets because there's such a rash of crime
[23:00.440 --> 23:06.480]  from them when actually the crime's gone down violent crime has gone down 52%
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.320]  since 1992 just departments own numbers and the vets aren't doing anything really
[23:10.320 --> 23:14.800]  so it's just pure demonization with no facts so know that they've got all these
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.480]  ads join the military they've got all this oh let's thank the veterans of the
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.800]  football game everywhere that's all window dressing today make everybody feel
[23:23.800 --> 23:26.880]  good about themselves all the vets are being thrown in the trash can like
[23:26.880 --> 23:32.080]  aborted babies and B it's about sucking young people in to want to be honorable
[23:32.080 --> 23:35.680]  and serve in the military our country's been occupied by the globalist our
[23:35.680 --> 23:40.920]  military openly works for the New World Order and that's what's happening now
[23:40.920 --> 23:46.080]  the good news is the most await group I run into is the veterans so on Memorial
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.560]  Day I want to salute all the veterans and all the dead veterans the the fallen
[23:50.560 --> 23:54.920]  veterans people like my grandfathers and my uncle and great uncles and so many
[23:54.920 --> 23:58.560]  others who were good men and and who believed they were fighting for good
[23:58.560 --> 24:02.480]  certainly my grandfather's were fighting Hitler he was bad both of them in the
[24:02.480 --> 24:06.480]  Army Air Corps you know my uncle went to Vietnam and the communists were evil
[24:06.480 --> 24:10.360]  but so was the globalist running America but they fought because they thought
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.880]  they were doing a good job so we salute all of those veterans and we do think
[24:14.880 --> 24:18.600]  veterans for the service they've done because they believe they were doing
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.000]  the right thing but now the globalist are trying to put you on drugs list you
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.520]  as PTSD to take your rights away to institutionalize you to demonize you and
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.960]  we've got disgusting people like Al Sharpton and Bill Press on MSNBC who
[24:33.960 --> 24:37.160]  meant going to throw up seeing it's a conspiracy theory nothing's going on
[24:37.160 --> 24:40.920]  because they represent the bureaucrats and all the lazy people in the system
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.840]  that are trying to stop the good people on the system the whistleblowers that
[24:44.840 --> 24:48.160]  are trying to make sure our veterans aren't treated like crud there are death
[24:48.160 --> 24:53.200]  panels this is socialism they have death panels and waiting list a year and a
[24:53.200 --> 24:56.920]  half for brain surgery for tumors that will kill you in a month in England but
[24:56.920 --> 25:03.840]  are operable welcome to the new world order and we see this across the country
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.160]  70 plus percent of foster children are on more than seven psychotropic drugs
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.560]  that's been exposed any group that the government has clutches on is treated
[25:12.560 --> 25:18.280]  like crud look at the NFL its state run basically tax exempt sure the players
[25:18.280 --> 25:22.120]  get paid a lot some of the top ones do but on average the low-level ones are
[25:22.120 --> 25:25.880]  treated like total garbage and hung out to dry afterwards and give any legal
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.480]  drugs just like the veterans of our military at least they make millions of
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.920]  dollars here's Darren McBreen's report from info wars nightly news I thought was
[25:34.920 --> 25:40.920]  interesting NFL veterans treated like crud NFL New World Order conspiracy and
[25:40.920 --> 25:47.000]  then we'll be back with more after the break a group of more than 500 retired
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.600]  pro football players have filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL they're
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.320]  claiming that the league unethically supplied them with illegal prescription
[25:57.320 --> 26:02.000]  pain medications so they could play the game through serious injuries as a
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.400]  result these players now suffer from addiction and long-term health problems
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.040]  caused by the risky narcotics the abuse of practice by the NFL basically
[26:13.040 --> 26:17.920]  substituted pain medication for medical care thus keeping the league's tsunami
[26:17.920 --> 26:21.960]  of dollars flowing and it gets them addicted and controls a football field
[26:21.960 --> 26:27.160]  unaware they had serious injuries Super Bowl champion quarterback Jim McMahon
[26:27.160 --> 26:32.320]  says team doctors never told him he had a broken neck they just fed him more
[26:32.320 --> 26:37.360]  pain pills and his teammate Keith Van Horn says he played an entire season
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.520]  with a broken leg while on a steady diet of painkillers the class action
[26:42.520 --> 26:48.080]  lawsuit follows another NFL conspiracy to cover up the dangers of concussions
[26:48.080 --> 26:54.560]  which was the focus of league of denial a powerful PBS frontline documentary that
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.120]  details how the NFL covered up the concussion crisis what League of
[26:59.120 --> 27:06.280]  denial is about is about the invisible disease attacking the brains of football
[27:06.280 --> 27:13.520]  players according to the science we talked the cumulative effect maybe as
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.800]  many as 1500 hits a year likelihood that your brain has a lot of damage done to
[27:19.800 --> 27:26.360]  it is very high ESPN was so alarmed by the film that they ended their
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.720]  production partnership with PBS for running it meanwhile the NFL agreed to
[27:31.720 --> 27:36.200]  pay close to 800 million dollars in lawsuits accusing the league of
[27:36.200 --> 27:41.600]  concealing the risk of head injuries and as we've been reporting all along here
[27:41.600 --> 27:46.000]  at info wars the national football league has also emerged as an
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.320]  establishment political tool so it makes sense that they cover up scandals and
[27:51.320 --> 27:57.040]  deal drugs and get this the NFL is a nine billion dollar a year business and
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.800]  growing yet they are totally tax-free that's right they do not pay a dime in
[28:02.800 --> 28:08.240]  taxes the owners consist of a group of billionaires who buy politicians who
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.720]  agree to use your tax dollars to build lavish stadiums that are also set up as
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.760]  FEMA relocation camps in the event of an emergency or civil unrest and we're
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.960]  here in Denver Colorado and we're covering Operation Mountain Guardian now
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.160]  this is a large-scale terrorism drill and 100 different agencies actually took
[28:29.160 --> 28:34.280]  part in the exercise this was a test for Homeland Security and FEMA to test
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.200]  their capabilities and what they referred to as a catastrophic situation
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.880]  involving a terrorist attack one of the primary locations of the drill took
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.520]  place right behind me at the sports authority field where the exercise
[28:48.520 --> 28:53.400]  involved participants processing children in and out of the FEMA camp that
[28:53.400 --> 28:59.040]  they set up inside of the stadium we are partnering this year with the NFL the
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.080]  NFL has teamed up with the Department of Homeland Security sending TSA Viper
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.480]  teams to football stadiums they turn the Super Bowl into a police state
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.720]  complete with Illuminati rituals while at the same time banning pro-second
[29:13.720 --> 29:19.960]  amendment ads and promoting Obamacare they are the poster child for the New
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.160]  World Order and they play a heavy hand in conditioning the public and for those
[29:25.160 --> 29:29.120]  of you who think that it's completely harmless to be a die-hard football fan
[29:29.120 --> 29:33.400]  like I used to be and you honestly believe that you're not the subject of
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.200]  conditioning you have to ask yourselves what it would be like to live in a
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.720]  country where people were as passionate about football as they were for things
[29:41.720 --> 29:48.800]  that actually matter incredibly powerful report by Darren McBrain ladies and

[33:11.480 --> 33:32.080]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[33:32.080 --> 33:37.200]  tyranny is something that historically comes in a lot of different flavors and
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.400]  different packages but on the inside it's the same thing it's groups that want
[33:42.400 --> 33:48.000]  total control in the run society who use the structure of government or any major
[33:48.000 --> 33:56.560]  system to expand a larger system of control and it always targets the old
[33:56.560 --> 34:00.880]  government especially if it was a liberty based system by one degree if the old
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.320]  system was better in any way they will go after it and they will always go after
[34:05.320 --> 34:10.880]  and purge the veterans and they'll purge the police when they're done as well we
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.480]  have a particularly virulent type of takeover happening right now Thomas I'm
[34:14.480 --> 34:18.360]  gonna Casey Eric Allen and Michael I'm gonna hurry now finishing up your point
[34:18.360 --> 34:24.320]  look it's the vaccines they had the anthrax shots in the mid 90s and again in
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.360]  2000 they were given folks that were killing based doctors that took it so
[34:28.360 --> 34:32.800]  they had mutinies of doctors and it wasn't really mutinies the media called it
[34:32.800 --> 34:37.480]  that who said we're not giving this so it brought attention to Bioport and how
[34:37.480 --> 34:42.640]  deadly it was and it was killing people same thing with the smallpox shot that
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.520]  killed some reporters that took it so national reporters one of them was NBC
[34:48.520 --> 34:51.520]  had a heart attack that's what it can cause you to have as an autoimmune
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.200]  response in the heart valves this is stuff that is extremely experimental it
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.200]  doesn't protect you they admitted the anthrax shot didn't protect you and
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.360]  cause serious autoimmune disorders but it's everything else they're giving
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.040]  project shad the nerve-gassing of troops where they would kill troops
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.000]  British and us just in the even in the 80s and tell their families oh your
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.480]  husband died of the flu they would even dissect their body their bodies show
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.800]  this is what's going on you were seen a scum you were seen as trash because the
[35:29.800 --> 35:34.960]  ruling elite are you Genesis that's their attitude to begin with all right
[35:34.960 --> 35:41.240]  let's go ahead and go back to your calls Thomas do you think it's DU do you
[35:41.240 --> 35:44.320]  think it's the vaccines it's causing you to have all these health problems
[35:44.320 --> 35:47.640]  because you look statistically at the veterans I mean they are just in in
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.520]  desperate straits and then they can't get health care as you said used to be
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.000]  bad now it's really bad I guess you're supposed to go curl up and die do you
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.880]  have any idea what did it to you I personally think it has to do with the GMOs
[35:59.880 --> 36:03.680]  and Florida in the water see before I was ignorant to that nice I'm not gonna lie
[36:03.680 --> 36:08.280]  very unhealthy I lived at the jack in the box and since I've cut that out of my
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.680]  life I've slowed down a lot and I noticed if I'll go and eat some fast food or
[36:12.680 --> 36:20.040]  cheap GMO food I get sick right afterwards I feel it's an effective our
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.840]  environment and that's why yeah I mean I'll be on the road sometimes and all
[36:23.840 --> 36:28.000]  there is is a Wendy's or a jack-in-the-box and I gotta eat and I eat a
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.680]  jack-in-the-box and literally have what I call a panic attack an hour later I
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.480]  never have stuff like that unless I eat it then you read what they're allowed to
[36:35.480 --> 36:38.840]  put in it all these drugs that you know they call fillers they're really
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.040]  psychoactive drugs that a dick the general public but if you haven't done
[36:43.040 --> 36:46.880]  in a while you know it really hits you hard just like any drug and you're
[36:46.880 --> 36:52.480]  absolutely right that that that this is listen there's a London telegraph article
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.480]  the day about are you allergic to your cell phone because people are getting so
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.840]  sick around this stuff of course and the fact is most people are getting soft
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.960]  killed being sterilized by it and don't know because it takes 20 years you want
[37:05.960 --> 37:12.840]  to be glad you're so you know probably allergic to this GMO that you know your
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.040]  body's rejecting it so that's that's some good intel good information thank
[37:16.040 --> 37:19.880]  you for the call you know the body gets overwhelmed to it to be all the
[37:19.880 --> 37:26.240]  vaccines of the DU you name it then it shows that when you're maxed out then
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.320]  other stuff triggers allergies people didn't used to be allergic to cedar
[37:30.320 --> 37:34.240]  mountain cedar mountain Jennifer they didn't used to be allergic to peanuts
[37:34.240 --> 37:38.760]  strawberries I mean the schools are like medical facilities now with all the
[37:38.760 --> 37:43.720]  special diets and bubble kids because they're not being breastfed they're not
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.800]  being brought up with an environment they don't play outside anymore they have
[37:47.800 --> 37:54.200]  their normal buffers and then they're given all these vaccines one flu shot
[37:54.200 --> 37:59.200]  the Canadian government did the study five years ago during the H1N1 one flu
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.360]  shot cuts your immune system to the regular flu about 50% one three flu
[38:04.360 --> 38:07.200]  shots doubles your chances of Alzheimer's don't believe me just search
[38:07.200 --> 38:16.360]  engine that term how big a new story is that we are being murdered I've had
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.560]  multiple family members that got the Dalcon shield back in the 70s I'm not
[38:21.560 --> 38:27.160]  going to say names your family will get mad people very close to me but they
[38:27.160 --> 38:31.800]  call it an IED not a improvised closer device but an internal little device
[38:31.800 --> 38:38.640]  that goes around inside the uterus to keep you but an IUD that goes around
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.760]  and keeps you from ever forming and being able to have an egg attach creates
[38:42.760 --> 38:46.240]  continued inflammation turns out they knew when they approved that in the
[38:46.240 --> 38:51.320]  late 60s that they knew in clinical studies on humans or people approved to
[38:51.320 --> 38:55.480]  be part of the study that it caused endometriosis destroyed the interlining
[38:55.480 --> 39:00.560]  of the uterus and caused massive infertility and two people in my family
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.040]  that got that were sterilized by it
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.760]  turns out that Dow Chemical in association with Monsanto did not just
[39:11.760 --> 39:18.320]  have Agent Orange with what they called it weed killer deep defoliant they
[39:18.320 --> 39:23.560]  added a neurotoxin synthetic Cobra poison this was declassified about six
[39:23.560 --> 39:29.480]  years ago dr. Doug Rocky former head of the D program broke it here the document
[39:29.480 --> 39:32.120]  declassified no one was covering and he said if you've seen this we broke it
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.200]  here not bragging I'm saying it would break broke here the document from the
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.840]  mid 60s where they added it it was really a chemical weapon a chemical weapon
[39:42.840 --> 39:50.480]  to actually nerve gas the vietcong and call it call it just the dioxin
[39:50.480 --> 40:01.680]  defoliant which is bad enough it was neurotoxin they added neurotoxin and our
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.720]  troops were in it and they knew it I mean I the government is run by murdering
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.920]  total filth the average social workers not bad the average cops not bad the
[40:12.920 --> 40:20.680]  average FBI is not bad the average CIA person is not bad I can tell you but
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.000]  they're compartmentalized ladies and gentlemen and the people on top of this
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.440]  are pure evil and take real enjoyment in hurting our veterans especially because
[40:31.440 --> 40:33.760]  they're getting rid of you they don't need you anymore they're moving to
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.880]  robots and drones autonomous vehicles by 2025 there'll be no combat troops to
[40:39.880 --> 40:43.440]  speak of folks separate special operations and they'll be there with
[40:43.440 --> 40:48.960]  robots it's over if we don't stop them you've been warned this is real this
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.680]  isn't sensational reality is sensational the things I've seen the things I've
[40:54.680 --> 40:58.920]  done personally are sensational a lot of it I won't even tell you some of the
[40:58.920 --> 41:06.560]  stuff I know folks because people can't handle the truth you want answers the
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.120]  quote of what is that maybe a few good men and we can pull that up online you
[41:10.120 --> 41:16.520]  want answers you can't handle the truth and I'm telling you folks we're two
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.720]  minutes to midnight the globalists think they're God they're operating as an
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.480]  alien species and I'm not saying they're real aliens they call themselves a new
[41:25.480 --> 41:32.160]  breakaway species they consider themselves to be God and if you try to
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.280]  get in their way there will be warfare tell you something Hilary Clinton in God
[41:36.280 --> 41:40.760]  Barack Obama in God David Rockefeller in God I know about these people their
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.240]  lives what they stand for they are narcissistic scum and the very last
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.920]  people to lead humanity they are literally desecrating our human spirit
[41:50.920 --> 41:56.080]  and they are the filth of the earth Casey then Eric Allen Barbara Michael
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.800]  everybody Casey thanks for holding you're on the air an army vet what is
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.200]  your take on the VA what's your story well the VA takes about six months to
[42:05.200 --> 42:11.200]  lift a finger to pick their own nose so you can imagine what it takes them to do
[42:11.200 --> 42:20.080]  our files so and that's the guys that actually get care the guys that don't
[42:20.080 --> 42:29.000]  get care they're they're done and if we got time I'd actually like to try and
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.520]  wake you up
[42:32.800 --> 42:40.240]  yeah go ahead brother okay you're always talking about you know we've got to do
[42:40.240 --> 42:45.440]  this and do that you know get the right people in how can we do that in a corrupt
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.880]  system you're a chalkboard analogy would be perfect or a white whiteboard
[42:52.880 --> 43:00.120]  analogy for for the younger listeners at some point you have to erase it now
[43:00.120 --> 43:06.920]  just so just to cover your butt no but generally when you erase something the
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.080]  corruption is already there it gets even worse I'd like to work in the template
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.040]  of the Bill of Rights Constitution but don't worry they're probably gonna start
[43:14.040 --> 43:17.360]  a civil war and so everybody talking about violence you're gonna get your
[43:17.360 --> 43:22.680]  shot I mean it's gonna be hell go ahead I'm not talking about violence I don't
[43:22.680 --> 43:28.000]  want violence I've I'm an infantry veteran I've spent two tours in Iraq and
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.520]  it's no we don't want violence in the country but with as corrupt as the system
[43:34.520 --> 43:40.800]  is the absolute minimum I see that we're going to be able to do to get our
[43:40.800 --> 43:47.600]  country back is to march on Washington and arrest every politician in every
[43:47.600 --> 43:54.680]  single branch of government executive legislative and judicial branches of
[43:54.680 --> 44:05.160]  government and we need to start all over with new patriotic people do you
[44:05.160 --> 44:12.080]  think all of them are guilty because the issue is they need to have trials
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.120]  even yes I agree they all need to have trials but we need to arrest every
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.520]  single one of them first put them on trial and then if the evidence is there
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.440]  they need to be convicted if the evidence is not there then they need to
[44:26.440 --> 44:30.680]  be cleared of all charges and released well I think I mean I think the idea of
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.680]  an info war operation where we write up a treat is saying we know your criminal
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.400]  we know about the takeover listing the UN running our military listing the
[44:40.400 --> 44:45.480]  treaties and say you have you know three months till this date this is
[44:45.480 --> 44:48.640]  hypothetical folks I'm not saying do this I'm just brainstorming this war
[44:48.640 --> 44:52.840]  gaming it to either announce that you're with the Republic and want to be part of
[44:52.840 --> 44:58.160]  a plan to reorganize the country again and kick out the VG France
[44:58.160 --> 45:02.800]  collaborators basically is the analogy or you're going to be considered part of
[45:02.800 --> 45:07.160]  it you send them a notice letter and you have everybody with petitions with
[45:07.160 --> 45:10.960]  millions on the White House dot gov and everyone sending thousands of letters
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.880]  per congressperson over and over again a day and going to Congress and going to
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.840]  the local office and making it a movement to say traitor traitor traitor you
[45:19.840 --> 45:22.920]  either admit we've been taken over by the foreign fellow reserve you either
[45:22.920 --> 45:26.840]  denounce it and say you're going to kick the globalist out or you're going to be
[45:26.840 --> 45:30.920]  considered part of it I think that we put on notice that they are part of the
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.120]  criminal program and they needed to declare where they stand because I mean
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.000]  what are we gonna arrest Walter Jones we gonna arrest Rand Paul are we gonna
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.880]  arrest you know Ted Cruz Amash are we gonna I mean you know there's a lot of
[45:43.880 --> 45:47.760]  good people up there that are talking just like us saying the globalists are
[45:47.760 --> 45:53.320]  scary Obama's scary we're going into a dictatorship you know it's just that's
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.680]  the thing about revolutions the globalist are revolutionaries we're
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.640]  restorationist or counter revolutionaries that's what they call us
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.440]  actually they know we're the good guys and so the danger of a revolution is
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.800]  most the time you get something worse when you've overthrown the last system
[46:09.800 --> 46:15.640]  to see the last system is vestiges of the old republic that wasn't perfect but
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.880]  light years better than globalism with globalism overlaid so it's a very
[46:19.880 --> 46:25.480]  sophisticated situation and I'm glad we're debating it but go ahead yeah it's
[46:25.480 --> 46:32.400]  just you just said before you got me on what we're two minutes to midnight we
[46:32.400 --> 46:39.520]  are out of time we don't have time to you know go through the the bureaucratic
[46:39.520 --> 46:46.840]  red tape and get this done the way that it could be done I hear you I know it's
[46:46.840 --> 46:50.720]  it's really bad that's I mean they're on TV saying communism's good and our kids
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.040]  belong to them and every award show they're having satanic ceremonies and
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.080]  I'm living in a twilight zone movie I mean they're putting cancer viruses and
[46:57.080 --> 47:00.320]  all the major vaccines they put fluoride in the water that brain damages people on
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.680]  record they're just there's just it's total crazy land and and what do you do
[47:04.680 --> 47:08.960]  when you're faced with an elite that is so evil and the public so naive I think
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.480]  the biggest thing is all the yuppies and sitcom watchers we got to somehow reach
[47:13.480 --> 47:18.640]  out to them with banner hangs and stunts and calling in to talk radio and
[47:18.640 --> 47:20.960]  you know all the talk show hosts that make fun of me and I appreciate your
[47:20.960 --> 47:26.560]  call sir great points I mean I tune in some times to you want answers I think
[47:26.560 --> 47:33.320]  I'm entitled you want the truth you can't handle the truth that's what it
[47:33.320 --> 47:37.680]  comes down to maybe we should play that one more time because I think it says it
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.880]  all for the general public answer the question you want answers I think I'm
[47:42.880 --> 47:50.120]  entitled you want the truth you can't handle the truth son we live in a world
[47:50.120 --> 47:54.160]  that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns who's gonna
[47:54.160 --> 48:00.560]  do it you you lieutenant Weinberg I have a greater responsibility than you can
[48:00.560 --> 48:06.320]  possibly fathom you weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines you have that
[48:06.320 --> 48:10.640]  luxury you have the luxury of not knowing what I know that Santiago's
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.800]  death while tragic probably saved lives and my existence while grotesque and
[48:15.800 --> 48:24.360]  incomprehensible to you saves lives my issue is is the public ready for the
[48:24.360 --> 48:27.680]  truth I mean this show is the truth folks we really know what we're talking
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.480]  about we understand the enemy's operations we know what makes them tick
[48:31.480 --> 48:35.920]  and you either get what the enemy's saying and understand what we're facing
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.440]  or we're gonna lose everything the globalists come from different elites
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.120]  that have merged together for thousands of years that have manipulated humans
[48:46.120 --> 48:49.800]  and have disdain for the public you can't do the things they do to people
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.680]  and not have a hatred of the average man or woman that's why they see the
[48:54.680 --> 48:59.480]  veterans as total dogs as total scum and then they want to lure young people
[48:59.480 --> 49:06.560]  into joining so they can chew up the best and brightest and use them to create

[54:16.440 --> 54:19.960]  the VA and what they're doing and say we're not gonna let you just trot out
[54:19.960 --> 54:26.440]  the vets and act like America's great America's occupied by globalists and
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.960]  we're not gonna let you use them anymore when you hate their stinking guts I mean
[54:32.960 --> 54:35.440]  that's what it comes down to I mean it'd be one thing they were throwing the
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.360]  vets in the trash and treat them like crap that makes me mad but the grand
[54:40.360 --> 54:48.900]  standing and how much they love them and it's so sick and the VA are just hell
[54:48.900 --> 54:54.040]  pits it used to be bad now it is just I mean I talked to a lot of guys at work
[54:54.040 --> 54:58.040]  here veterans and they just talk about how badly they're treated and how
[54:58.040 --> 55:00.720]  they'll be an old man or something going I'm hurting I'm hurting all like big
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.360]  guys gonna watch it old man and I mean I'm not saying I'm a tough guy folks but
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.240]  I mean I would blow up if I saw stuff like that and then we were just talking
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.440]  to Alan in Georgia he was taught and we're gonna go to overdrive and talk to
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.200]  Michelle Kathy and Eric at least about how they ask about your guns yeah what
[55:17.200 --> 55:21.040]  about those guns you crazy what you planning and what they do to the vets
[55:21.040 --> 55:26.040]  they're gonna do to everybody else now what they do to people in their clutches
[55:26.040 --> 55:33.560]  is is a beta test for you and I and I am sick of it so finish up your points
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.840]  Alan well yeah a few more quick points and I know you got to take some other
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.560]  calls I wasn't gonna mention it I was mainly talking about when I got out but
[55:42.560 --> 55:50.560]  I went to Iraq in 2006 and also 2008 and I want to say that when I was on hold I
[55:50.560 --> 55:55.120]  was listening to your other callers and I'm also and you're right I'm very
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.400]  concerned about the number of shots that I had to take and particularly the
[56:01.400 --> 56:07.720]  anthrax I'm concerned about future possible you know health side effects
[56:07.720 --> 56:16.240]  from that it's pretty scary stuff but yeah going back to the VA basically if
[56:16.240 --> 56:21.640]  if you don't see the which I mean you called it too we you know we all kind
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.520]  of saw it coming when they first broke it but if you don't see of course they're
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.640]  gonna be all over the country but I almost guarantee the Atlanta VA was also
[56:30.640 --> 56:36.200]  a part of this and real quick you know the bigger picture I think you hit the
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.680]  nail on the head these past few days of course they're targeting veterans you
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.880]  know and the health care thing is bad enough sir but that if people really
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.720]  knew that they took it they were taking it a step further like you like you put
[56:51.720 --> 56:57.880]  on air and calling us domestic terrorists that's just even more of a slap in
[56:57.880 --> 57:04.080]  the face and I really appreciate you putting it out there because that you
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.720]  know the only reason the VA health care scandal is on any mainstream media now
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.920]  is no thanks to them it's thanks to you and then the other alternative media well
[57:12.920 --> 57:16.160]  yeah we weren't really on top of the VA thing like everybody else I've been on
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.400]  it for years but it was alternative and libertarian and conservative radio that
[57:19.400 --> 57:24.160]  forced it out there but to see Bill Press and Sharp to make jokes about it I
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.520]  mean I'm just sick of these people man just because they have a lispy voice and
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.440]  pink ties and an act trendy and an act of feminine doesn't mean that they're
[57:32.440 --> 57:37.160]  intellectual or good people and I'm just sick of all of them we're like ruled by a
[57:37.160 --> 57:41.200]  bunch of fake Nellies behind the scenes are just raving evil demons I
[57:41.200 --> 57:44.440]  appreciate you calling God bless you we're gonna come back and jam in as many
[57:44.440 --> 57:47.840]  calls as we can in this little bit of overdrive please don't forget I get so

[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:11.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:18.920]  he. Geese Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.120]  Alex Jones. Coming up Lee and McAdoo went on the streets of Austin and said
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.400]  should the word fiesta be banned should all Mexican food be banned. Universities
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.360]  are banning it everywhere having Mexican fiesta parties and tacos saying it's
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.640]  racist. I just thought it was a theme of a party like you have a Hawaiian luau
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.560]  party it's not because you hate Hawaiians it's because it sounds fun and you go
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.520]  out and get all the little tiki torches and a little Hawaiian stuff to put on
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.800]  the drinks and the little pool parties is that against I think we should ban it
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.280]  because if one person is offended that universities are having a fiesta parties
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.480]  we should ban fiesta food stores that are across the Southwest we should ban
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.680]  fiesta Texas that's obviously racist the word party is racist this is 1984
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.400]  where they're reducing the language down and I see people on info wars calm
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.080]  commenting this going look at these dumb liberals a they're not liberals they're
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:26.560]  authoritarian fascist control freaks want to control language and b they are
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.320]  just right in 1984 reducing everything down where you can't even communicate
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:37.640]  with anybody and and everything is a political faux pas so that you were
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.360]  just in a catatonic state of inaction unable to do anything against offensive
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.840]  and I've told the stories of hearing people so I said hey let's get Chinese
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.160]  food everybody shh at first it's you know you don't call it the Orient you
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.840]  call it Asia you don't call it Asia you call it the east you know you don't you
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:05.200]  don't say african-american now you say this it's just all how do I please you
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.520]  well you turn your guns in you pay more taxes the Warren Buffett that's how you
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.200]  prove you're not racist and you give money to Planned Parenthood to abort the
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:20.760]  minority babies to prove you're not racist okay and you know you also are a
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.320]  Nazi collaborator like George Soros the famous one and then you get awards from
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.240]  the ADL even if you fight the Nazis the ADL will list you okay and the government
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.920]  will send white supremacists that are government-controlled after you if you're
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.960]  Alex Jones and then the Southern Poverty Law Center will imply you're a racist
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.640]  while they send the white supremacists after you are proven to be government
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.040]  agents and Arnold Schwarzenegger will dress up a Nazi offense and wear
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.800]  death-said belts Nazi belts and say that he loves Hitler to Rolling Stone
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:56.600]  magazine and wants to be a dictator and he'll get ADL awards but but if you make
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.600]  a movie about Christ and make one comment you're baited into about Jews
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:08.760]  you'll be crucified that's all political correctness is ladies and gentlemen is a
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.360]  weapon to control people and to in speech and to shut down the society so
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.200]  that piece is coming up Leanne McAdoo did another report I think I'm gonna have
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.800]  time to air Leanne McAdoo child sacrifice goes mainstream we're gonna
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.120]  air that report we got Joel Gilbert coming up with a bunch of breaking news
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.960]  about his research across the true state of the country and what's happening
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:39.880]  with the economy but we are going to again come back to the next segment and
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.960]  get into the really big news of the continued attempted cover-up of what
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:52.240]  really happened in Connecticut with the Sandy Hook shooting now continuing here
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:01.000]  with the news of very important article from the Financial Times of London and
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.040]  and that's even more important on the Wall Street Journal in my opinion this
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.040]  is a real elitist publication that openly calls for world government but in
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:15.360]  this they say hedge fund titans are testing the quality of US democracy if
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.840]  branches of government bout a big business public policy will be decided

[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.040]  first amendment in this country if you look at the situation in Connecticut
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.360]  with the Sandy Hook shootings that were used to collectively put guilt on the
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.440]  American people and imply that gun owners collectively had murdered a
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:58.040]  bunch of little children in elementary school you could see it was a Psyop it's
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.800]  come out that Bloomberg put out emails the day before saying get ready with our
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.680]  Twitter with our media to have a big push against guns the next 24 hours very
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.680]  suspicious then you've got the local regional SWAT team people hiding out in
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.320]  the woods in the same outfits as the supposed shooter you've got the whole
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.720]  story changing the most incriminating is you got the helicopter footage of the
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.520]  of the people you know with their hands up coming out of the school in in the
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.840]  in the evacuation hours after it supposedly happened going in circles in
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.800]  and out of the school going in circles they've torn down the school now they've
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:45.000]  declared state secrets on the photos the video there's weird Anderson Cooper
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.880]  video where he claims he's there on the ground of the town square and he turns
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.800]  bigger than Dallas and it's a green screen he's shimmering around the edges
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.760]  nose disappears you can see flowers and things blowing in the wind and then they
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:06.720]  do it again it's the same footage being looped behind them I mean I don't know
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.360]  what happened there but I know Anderson Cooper is admittedly a member of the
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.120]  central intelligence agency and they send him out on the dis info pieces
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.800]  he's been caught three times the last couple years with fake massacre videos on
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.680]  CNN from Syria fake shootings where they'll have the feet going now I shoot
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:34.120]  now I stage it dragging dead bodies around this is the stuff they do so we
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.800]  know they've been caught running false flags the Turkish government's been
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.920]  caught staging a tax against itself that's BBC run by the same globalist so
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:48.200]  this is important well a former state police officer who's run one of the
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:54.560]  largest and and accredited school safety drill systems school safety training
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.960]  centers they go around consulting at universities you name it big ones right
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:03.040]  here in Texas but all over the country this guy's got a long career Wolfgang

[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.920]  State School Board Association Florida School Board Association I'm not going
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.600]  to go over the fact that he's consulted for 8,000 school districts worldwide been
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:07.640]  on Good Morning America NBC Dateline he's not a kooky guy and I haven't
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.560]  asked him this but I bet him asking questions the last year just looking at
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.560]  it and studying I bet he's lost a lot of business for the system but he didn't
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.880]  care I'm guessing that's I know how the system works I don't know that I'll ask
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.680]  him out in a minute but he's the exact type of expert witness you want who goes
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:29.720]  against his own interest monetarily to go out and tell the truth now here's the
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:35.480]  bombshell news this is in discovery.com Newtown School Board shuts down
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.040]  conspiracy theorist that's people that don't believe the official story of
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.080]  known liars if you believe you built your own business and Obama says you're
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.800]  conspiracy theorist if you believe Obamacare is increasing premiums you're
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.560]  conspiracy theorist even though it is people including myself that complained
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.480]  to TSA about being groped when you say hey your own study say you haven't stopped
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.360]  on terrorist they'll say oh a conspiracy theorist being informed knowing how to
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.880]  read a book knowing how to tie your shoelaces as a conspiracy theory if you
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.960]  know that mother's milk helps grow children's brains much better all the
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.720]  studies show it you're a conspiracy theorist if you think cell phones are
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.200]  increasing brain cancer and all the studies show it you're a conspiracy
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.360]  theorist if you're concerned you're a conspiracy theorist well no I'm not a
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:29.000]  conspiracy theorist ladies and gentlemen I am a skeptic of known liars but in a
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.680]  world of universal deception the universal lies telling the truth is a
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:40.480]  revolutionary act to quote George Arwell aka George Arwell Eric Blair so
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.400]  here's the headline school board shuts down conspiracy theorist now they've
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.040]  shot footage of this and Wolfgang's making a documentary but he said he'll
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.760]  send us the raw footage as soon as it gets here make copies on memory stick
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.400]  or whatever we will get a special report out because this needs to be seen of
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.840]  them being shut down the school board then trying to go to United Way and
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.000]  others that famously suck up the Oklahoma City money the 9-11 money for
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.320]  themselves give it to anti-gun groups that's how this whole scam works United
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.200]  Way Red Cross I mean they're just vicious organizations a lot of good
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.800]  people work for them and do good work but back when I first covered this like
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.400]  15 years ago then nobody believed me they're well-known scamsters basically
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:25.080]  Democratic Party operations but the bottom line here is that then the
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.960]  police blocked him from going in a public building that by law he's supposed
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.240]  to be allowed into so Wolfgang joins us to cover what's happened to him
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.160]  currently and now he's being blocked from investigating he's been visited
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.280]  repeatedly by quote law enforcement telling me better back off they're
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.040]  acting scared to death folks okay they're acting scared to death about this big
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:52.280]  production they put on there and the good news is the majority of people I
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.360]  see across the board and I meet do not believe any of this stuff anymore now
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.320]  we'll get back in after he recaps what just happened we will get back into his
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.080]  biggest questions concerning it but Wolfgang thanks for coming on
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.960]  Alex I really appreciate it well thank you I appreciate you coming on go ahead
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:16.040]  well you know I really wish you could have gone on this trip and I think it's
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:22.000]  important that every listener clearly understands that do I want to be doing
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.840]  this absolutely not I'm retired I mean I got my AAP card had these police officers
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.440]  had the homicide investigators not come to my home the week before Christmas
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.760]  Newtown would have never heard of Wolfgang Albie nobody would have ever
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.880]  heard of me because you know as a national school safety consultant I
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.480]  simply was sending the FOIA request Connecticut Freedom of Information
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:51.160]  request asking simple questions that's not offensive to any of those parents
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.400]  who supposedly lost a child not offensive to Danbury police or the
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:01.240]  Connecticut State Police and to this day they don't return phone calls they
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:07.000]  refuse to respond to any any Connecticut Freedom of Information Act and when
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.720]  we're at the school board you know I had three minutes I had a chance to talk to
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.680]  them and I said you know chairman you talk about honesty that everybody's
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:20.320]  supposed to be honest here in this room where's the honesty why don't you return
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.480]  phone calls why can't you respond to simple FOIA request I mean you're an
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.000]  educational institution you're supposed to know how to communicate and what
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.720]  really was important is that in March Alex in March the Freedom of Information
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.320]  Commission out of Hartford Connecticut actually sent an instructor to Newtown
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.880]  to Sandy Hook to teach them on how to respond to FOIA request that they cannot
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.720]  ignore them that if they are public documents they need to be presented I
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.440]  mean they actually had somebody there before I got there to teach them how to
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.440]  do it and what they must do and guess what they're in defiance of him they're
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:12.160]  not even listening to their own freedom commissioner and it is
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.640]  unbelievable and we actually aired a few nights ago on the Info Wars Nightly
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.280]  News the video of that transpiring you're gonna send us the video of going to
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.800]  the United Way and being blocked which you were telling us is illegal we're
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.560]  gonna get to that in a moment but we do have that video and that special report
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.960]  we will play your three minutes coming up but why do you think they're acting
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.880]  so desperate to block you and tell folks what happened at the United Way
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.320]  I think the reason they're not answering those questions because I think it's
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:48.120]  gonna expose their whole scam I mean the questions you know they come from my
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.600]  background as a law enforcement officer and customs agent I think you need to
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.080]  know when you have a security system you should know who installed the security
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.880]  system how much did you pay for it what did you put in I mean you ought to have
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.440]  emails between the principal and the school district talking about work
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.760]  orders talking about finance transportation I mean it actually will
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.720]  tell you whether there's no history there's no history there's no nothing
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.880]  there's they don't want to respond see that's the whole thing when you don't
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:26.080]  respond it raises the red flag and this has been going on for 11 months and they
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:31.280]  don't even return the phone call me as a principal Alex I may not like you as a
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.040]  parent but if you call me I have a responsibility I've got to call you back
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:43.520]  this district they just do whatever they want very suspicious and when we come
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.200]  back I want you to recap for folks as an investigator and as a school safety

[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.920]  money and I think when you look at the amount of money that has been poured in
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.760]  the Sandy Hook in Newtown because of this incident it all starts at the United
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.040]  Way Western Connecticut who actually I mean you saw it advertised three days
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.320]  before the shooting they were looking to solicit money three days before the
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.160]  shooting and I think the big red flag is the Connecticut Attorney General's

[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.960]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.280]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:18.800]  out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for

[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.040]  hard-working American men and women it is rare to find companies who practice

[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:12.960]  Alex Jones here back live school safety expert former state trooper Wolfgang W.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.520]  Halbig has done what he's had to do he's gone to Connecticut to investigate
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.800]  Sandy Hook and all of the weird anomalies and just the clear fraud here
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.280]  and now the massive cover-up so break down sir just to a late person out there
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.440]  the smoking guns of this and why you started investigating and why they're
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:38.360]  so desperate to try to intimidate you well it goes it goes back as we ended
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:43.480]  the break is that this is all about the money I think it's all about the money
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:49.120]  and what really caught my attention was the letters that were drafted that were
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.760]  actually written to two nonprofits called the United Way Western Connecticut
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:00.000]  and the Sandy Hook Promise Fund which is a pass-through from the United Way
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.200]  Western Connecticut and the Connecticut Attorney General's name is George
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.840]  Jespin I mean I'm looking at his letter and he really really told them that you
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.000]  know as fiduciaries that they are reputable to the public and it must be
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.240]  transparent in every way since they're soliciting and they're recruiting funds
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:29.080]  from major corporations that they must be open transparent and also he made a
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:35.040]  big note that if they are selected if they are soliciting money under false
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.880]  pretenses that they need to be very very careful I understand we'll get into all
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.600]  the minutiae of an investigator trying to get in but why are you saying United
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.360]  Way is so important I mean what are the big smoking guns because I know you're
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.000]  inside this investigation but for folks out there what are the red flags
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.280]  well the red flag is that you're looking at twenty nine million dollars you got
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.000]  the United Way Sandy Hook Promise and there are thirty nine other community
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.160]  nonprofit organizations within Newtown which received a lot of funds for an
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:14.280]  example the animal shelter in Newtown Sandy Hook Alex they got $450,000 from
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:19.120]  the Sandy Hook shooting now what does an animal shelter have to do with this
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.600]  understand you're saying a motive for the locals to go along with the fraud is
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:29.120]  money I get that I'm talking about the the crime scene itself recap that the
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:36.800]  crime scene itself is you know it's not the way we in law enforcement respond to
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:43.440]  any type of a shots fired or 911 calls it just does not make sense and I go back
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.600]  to the very beginning any listener I think the only way I think your listeners
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.240]  will understand whether their grandparents parents guardians you have
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.520]  to actually actually close your eyes and pretend that you had a child at Sandy
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.800]  Hook that morning on December 14th 2012 you really have to pretend that you
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.120]  heard on the news they're shots fired and all of a sudden your heart starts
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.600]  racing and you get to that school and all of a sudden you know that somebody
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.480]  says who I think your little girl a little boy was shot and they might be
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.200]  seriously injured and then you all of a sudden learn that nobody somebody at
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.160]  that school did not bother to even order the trauma helicopters I mean that is
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.400]  unheard of I don't care where you go in this country around the world you get
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.800]  the medical help you get the best in here as quick as bottom line there was a
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.560]  stand down and that and you've blueprinted all that out on your
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.200]  website but I saw it happen what about the kids going in circles back and
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.920]  forth the same people into the school for the helicopters it looked like a
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.280]  fake drill what about the guy in the woods that got picked up in the same
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.240]  outfit it was part of the anti-terror team what about me just go through those
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:01.360]  points well you know okay I'm trying to stay focused just on the kids and not
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.880]  having trauma helicopters and I cannot believe didn't let paramedics or EMTs in
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:10.160]  but you talked about the people they actually caught in the woods and you can
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.520]  hear the words even in the police recordings they've got him pruned out
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:19.080]  Alex they got him handcuffed one of the people actually carrying a firearm he's
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.680]  got a firearm that they caught in the woods but do you think they would have
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:26.840]  run his name to the computer database do you think they would have run a 1028
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.360]  1029 check them through the NCIC computers to see if there's any
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.080]  outstanding warrants Alex we don't even see their names every person that was
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:41.760]  apprehended can't take it into place the cover-up is the prima facia proof of the
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.240]  larger crime and that we're being lied to absolutely I you know what I don't
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.440]  see it I wanted to say that at the board meeting that if you go home tonight you
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.000]  turn those lights out when you're about to go to sleep how in the world can you
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.600]  live with this there are so many lies there it's not just by the school board
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.400]  members by the it's by the Danbury Police Department Connecticut State Trooper
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.520]  you know when you read the police reports that's not how we write police
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.560]  reports remember each one of those reports Alex are taken under oath they
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.800]  swore that this information they so you're a top school safety expert and

[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.640]  whole thing and then you've got him jumping the gun I mean I think that's
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.720]  really big that Bloomberg was saying get ready the day before you're ready to

[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:35.920]  resistance it's Alex Jones I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:42.840]  live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self-evident
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:50.880]  that all men are created each other I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:59.240]  of Georgia sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will they be
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:05.360]  able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood I have a dream my four
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:11.520]  little children one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:20.200]  color of their skin but by the content of that character well I share that dream
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.520]  that we judge people on what they stand for and who they are not a color they
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.120]  are where they came from and also have a dream that we not abort another 53
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.240]  million 54 million babies since Roe v. Wade and that we not kill 52 percent of
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:40.440]  black people and especially because that is a genocide going on for every black
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:46.840]  person that is aborted and you've only you know got half the as many white or
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.160]  Hispanic blacks are being targeted and Dr. Alveda C. King joins us she's got a
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:55.680]  new book coming out King's Rules she's gonna come back on with us for a longer
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.360]  interview in late June to get into her book that look forward to reading but in
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.880]  the 10 minutes we've got thank you so much for coming on with us Dr.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.720]  Well you've got 10 minutes let's get into the black genocide that's going on
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.600]  with abortion and you know where Dr. King would have stood on that and where
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:23.120]  all this is going and how we hopefully awaken America well we know here in the
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:52.320]  21st century it's written on for a long time but it was more of a secret in the 20th century and the 19th century during the time of slavery when slavery was a violent in America that became a big question of what to do with the former slave because they read as a people have been oppressed not allowed to read not to be well educated and we were free labor for America and so the abolitionists after
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:36:07.640]  the President of Lincoln signed the emancipation the abolitionists would say that these are human beings and they should be treated fairly and so there's been that ongoing struggle you know because you have Jim Crow laws you know because you have my uncle Dr. Martin Luther King
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:15.240]  Jr. the 20th century civil rights movement well the eugenics movement led by people like Margaret Sanger who founded
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:35.960]  the plan power to choose an affiliate of Adolf Hitler who created that horrible movement against the Jews that Holocaust so they were from patriarchy working together and their plan was to reduce the Negro population which is now the American population and one of the plans included
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:56.480]  is sterilization and what we call birth control which today is shots and shields and things like death row for Vera the HHS mandate in America saying that you have to give free birth control who's the needy and of course with the African Americans being at the top of that to eliminate the birth of
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:14.800]  African Americans and when African Americans do concede Planned Parenthood as a leader the largest abortion provider is saying help them to abort those babies so that's the short version of what eugenics and genocide has come to be in America
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:30.160]  I've worked for priests for life as director of African American outreach and it is my mission to educate Americans and really people around the globe that eugenics and genocide still exist in America in the 20th century
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:47.880]  well Obamacare funds abortion and tries to force churches to pay for it and Obama's been a great poster child for increasing African basically forced abortions in Africa where they won't let people on their own land unless they have abortions in China they have forced abortions inside the
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:38:04.880]  boxcom factories but as long as they dress it up as liberal it's okay as long as they say it's the Democratic Party it's okay again I don't romanticize the Republican Party but the truth is they were the ones that created the NRA to arm newly freed black slaves to protect themselves from the clan
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:15.440]  it was the Republicans that helped get the civil rights act passed I don't get how the Democrats have flipped history on its head and call anybody who's against black genocide racist
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:33.000]  well that is really the country that we have in calling evil good and calling good evil and that is happening and as you say I don't really promote party politics I say that you should have people in both parties insisting that all the leaders do the right thing
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:47.240]  I am a conservative and I'm happy to be one but I believe that liberals should also be enlightened and know the truth when you say that it is okay to kill a little person in the room it used to be you said you didn't know that was a human being but the
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:39:02.560]  other things that have been proven that those are babies are human beings I thought that last when I was a young woman and I ended up having two abortions and a miscarriage due to the harm to my body from the abortions and the harmful
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:20.240]  facility blockers that they call birth control and so today I know that abortion killed babies and women we've got Laquisha Reeves, Laquisha Wilson kind of many African American women who've been killed by abortion Jennifer Morabelli
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:43.360]  that's occasionally there's a long list the growing list of women who've been killed by abortion bothers in abortion meals and millions and millions of babies have been killed about one third of those babies even though African Americans make up about 30% of the population but we are tricked into having about one third of those abortions
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:40:02.320]  and then we want the politicians to say this is women's rights and reproductive rights and there's a war on women that's trying to keep women from exercising our reproductive rights no there is a war on women and we see that war on women even most recently with the 300 little girls in Nigeria who were kidnapped
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:18.880]  Christian girls and things like that the war on women are as you mentioned in China forcing the women to have abortions after one child but we see that here on the war of our women, on the wombs of our women with these women being slaughtered in their abortion meals and Obama said
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:46.880]  insisting that we give to women free birth control or access to birth control through our insulin policies that birth control that is linked to breast cancer, cervical cancer, depression, high blood pressure, stroke, all of the chemical procedures that are either surgical or oral or shot that birth control that you're insisting is not health care
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  it's death care to give women these products that make the wombs body feel as though it is sick so it cannot conceive and it's going to be linked to blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, heart attack
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:12.880]  and they're not telling anybody about this did you see the woman who's an actress who's an abortion counselor selling women on it in New Jersey taking a picture of the baby and saying how much she gave birth it was wonderful to like kill the baby
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.880]  so what did you think of that I've never seen anything that's satanic
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:52.880]  it remains for the babies to be burned at the energy plant you know there's so much that's not being told to us and it is satanic
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:58.880]  there are many actresses though who have come for it and said that they really did reject their abortions
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:14.880]  we have an actress somewhere recently that committed suicide because she could not get over her abortions
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:30.880]  she's got a new book coming out in just about 2-3 weeks Kings Rules that I hope to read and maybe even carry in our online store and get her back on in the 3 or 4 minutes we've got left with you
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:46.880]  at least when I've read that MLK again I'm not saying Republicans are great but he was more Republican than Democrat from what I knew he was pro-life from what I knew but then when I watched CNN or MSNBC they used his image to act like he would be for socialism and abortion
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:58.880]  being his niece being very close to the family can you say what you believe Martin Luther King would be saying today if MLK Jr. was alive
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:08.880]  well in my book it's Kings Rules, A.I.M.D. and it's 10 rules, R.L.E.S, 10 rules that will help you, your family and our nation to prosper
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.880]  and there's a whole chapter on life in that book by the thanks of the bones of the afterwards
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:20.880]  so it's about what Martin Luther King would say today
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:31.880]  well there's a whole chapter on his uncle ML, his uncle ML sweet, there's a whole chapter on sweet, 140 characters of things that he would say if he were here today
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:38.880]  absolutely now he was not a Republican, he was not a Democrat, his dad was a Republican and today I'm a Republican
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:46.880]  but Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words said I don't need to join either party because I might need to speak to people in those parties
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:57.880]  so he was more like Billy Graham or different characters and preachers, we don't know what their political persuasion is because when they go to their white house
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:05.880]  when they counsel these leaders they want to do it from a position of the Bible which is higher than any political party
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:11.880]  so Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words was an independent, he wrote that himself
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:18.880]  well listen in the time we've got left tell us about the new book when it's coming out and just your take on Obama
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:25.880]  I mean I think of him as the opposite of Martin Luther King the way MSNBC and Al Sharpton try to invoke racial division
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:33.880]  because they're busy stealing all of our futures, Obamacare raising taxes on poor people, what's your take on Obama?
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:42.880]  I just think it's amazing that people wanted to say that Obama was the realization of the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wanted a preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ, President Obama has actually said that America is no longer a Christian nation
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:59.880]  and I know that my uncle would be very upset because that my uncle was a man of God and he loved the Lord and he was a preacher of the gospel
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:05.880]  he wasn't a civil rights leader yet but definitely a preacher, he was not a politician so we have to be different
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:13.880]  but President Obama is a politician, Martin Luther King Jr. was a man of God and you can know more as compared
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:20.880]  President Obama to Martin Luther King Jr. than you can to Moses, Martin Luther King Jr. was more like Moses
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.880]  and of course President Obama is not so I just hope that people will read them in history
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.880]  because they know that Martin Luther King Jr. was a pro-life, his wife, for that he was pro-choice
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:38.880]  just like Mrs. Barbara Bush and Mrs. Lara Bush are pro-choice and think a woman should have the right to choose a abortion
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.880]  but their husbands do not, that was the truth of Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:51.880]  he did not even go to the Martin Luther King's award program when he was offered that award, his wife went and accepted the award
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.880]  because he was pro-choice.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:59.880]  People weren't as informed, and people weren't as informed obviously back in the 60's and things
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:03.880]  we understand the large eugenics program now and you're a great voice exposing that
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.880]  I've seen you on TV and heard you on radio and now you've been here
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.880]  Dr. Elvita C. King, thank you so much for coming on
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:15.880]  I look forward to talking to you coming up in late June to do a full interview on your book
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.880]  Alright, thank you
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.880]  Thank you guys, thank you God bless you guys get her set up right now
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:27.880]  Well there she goes ladies and gentlemen, very very exciting to be getting that lined up for a full 30 minute interview with her
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  Now I'm going to go back to your phone calls on the subject of the police departments nationwide
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.880]  This is in the documents, we have the articles in FullWars.com
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.880]  Training that veterans are what Homeland Security is for
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:45.880]  Number one enemy veterans, number two gun owners, number three Christian conservatives
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.880]  Number four, it just moves down from there
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.880]  Pro-life advocates, you name it
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.880]  And then Al Qaeda is not even on that list
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.880]  That is sensational news, so I've been harping on that a lot
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:06.880]  We'll take your phone calls for the rest of this hour, then the next hour I've got to get to the latest Benghazi news, the latest Holder news
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:10.880]  The latest China massing on the Vietnam border news
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.880]  GOP rollback school lunch programs
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:16.880]  We're going to get to a ton of news, new NSA news
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:26.880]  It's all coming up, but let's go out to break with this soylent green break down that dovetails with what Mrs. King was just talking about
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.880]  Here it is
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:32.880]  And then we will come back after the break
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.880]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat in UK hospitals
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.880]  Soylent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:51.880]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.880]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:01.880]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.880]  The powdered flesh from dead babies, some people believe they can cure disease
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.880]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:14.880]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:17.880]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.880]  You must evacuate the area
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.880]  The fact that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:34.880]  Are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.880]  So enjoy the flavor
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.880]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.880]  I'm consistently pro-death, I'm for assisted suicide, I'm for regular suicide
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.880]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.880]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:59.880]  Would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.880]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:10.880]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:20.880]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.880]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  It will do it to its dissidents
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.880]  On the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.880]  This is nothing but a suicide cult
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.880]  The scoops are on their way, the scoops are on their way
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.880]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.880]  You will find out why Soylent Green needs life
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.880]  You will find out why Soylent Green needs death
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.880]  We've got to stop them, come on
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.880]  That is the secret of Soylent Green
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:07.880]  Soylent Green is people
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  Each thing they'll be breeding is like cattle
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.880]  For food, you've got to tell them
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:20.880]  Well, we are telling them Chuck, Carlton Heston was a pro-gun, pro-life activist
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.880]  And of course, he was a civil rights activist
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.880]  About 10 years before it was cool, he was doing it in the late 40s, early 50s
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.880]  Going to places in Alabama and Oklahoma where he was being death-threaded
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:36.880]  That's why he's hated by Michael Moore because he was a real liberal
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.880]  Charlton Heston, a guy that I got a chance to talk to a few times on air but also on the phone privately
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  He was so cool, man
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  I'm not a star-struck person, but Charlton Heston would spend like 25-30 minutes on the phone with me
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.880]  Giving me pep talks
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:55.880]  And I learned that he did that to a lot of other people
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.880]  He cared so much
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:00.880]  Well, they're right back with your phone calls
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.880]  So my elementary school-aged child is begging me for a cell phone
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.880]  Please, mom, please, all the kids have them
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.880]  But I've seen the research and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.880]  That close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.880]  Harmful wireless radiation is real

[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:18.880]  Alex Jones here back live from Austin, Texas, our reporters are at the AP, AP Hill Base, Army Base and what looks like FEMA Camp
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.880]  Where they have a mock US city in Bowling Green, Virginia outside Bowling Green
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:30.880]  Look, the globalists want to build this police state, infraguard, clergy response team, secret police
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.880]  Obama globalist army, whose main enemy is the American people, in silence
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:42.880]  They want to just build it with no debate, deny it's there, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:48.880]  The civilian inmate labor camp program, all of this is real and public now
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.880]  They just don't give you the details on the specifics of each facility
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:55:00.880]  And I knew this one was special so the guys have confidently wandered right in and we may have snuck underneath the giant's nose
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:04.880]  My gut tells me they're watching the live feed obviously right now
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  As even admitted the White House students into the show, foreign governments do
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:16.880]  And they're leaving you alone because they realize making a scene and arresting you and making stuff up will only draw attention to the facility
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:24.880]  So they are making the right move in their siop, that's what the deputy secretary of the defense said a few months ago
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.880]  They said we've got to stop lying and be more, oh my gosh, there's the entrance it looks like to the underground facility
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.880]  Okay, let's go to Biggs right now, Biggs go ahead
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:40.880]  Alright, we just walked over the overpass, as you can see there's a train track right here and it's starting to lead into an underground area
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  So we're going to try to approach this and see what we can see from there
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:53.880]  Yeah, that looks, well I don't really know how to describe it until we know exactly what's going on
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:59.880]  It's very dark and it goes deep down in here so we're going to walk under here, we'll quick and see what we can see
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  We'll probably lose our feet, but we'll try
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:09.880]  This looks like the beginning of a zombie movie, you're about to find a bunch of canisters in there with a bunch of Hillary Clinton clones
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.880]  God, I hope not
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  I don't know if I can handle that today
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:21.880]  Here we go, they're about to go into the subterranean area, we don't know
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:27.880]  That looks like a real train track that they've directed in there, but it looks like they've cut some of the tracks and they just run into a wall
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:39.880]  Yeah, look down, I mean this has got an actual, this is real, I mean this is legit, this is an actual switchboards and everything on here to be able to maneuver the train
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:42.880]  And is that tunnel open?
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.880]  Yeah, it's wide open, I'm going to walk in here
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:51.880]  As long as I can hear you guys talking, I know you'll be able to see everything so we're going to go as far as we can
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  You guys do whatever you think's best if it disconnects, but just go ahead and go down into that tunnel and find out what's there
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:06.880]  They could be walking directly into an underground base right now ladies and gentlemen, there goes Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs with David Knight in down the tunnel
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.880]  That was a gasoline
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.880]  Alright, well don't worry if it cuts out about coming back out, go in and find out what's in there, get HD video, we'll find out
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:17.880]  Alright, their feed cut, we'll come back to them in the next hour
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.880]  That's pretty good radio, huh?
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.880]  And again, I'm going to get even more great reporters like this than our cowards
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.880]  And then we're going to go out and just start covering everything folks
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.880]  Our team is awesome, thank God for them, thank you

[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:09.880]  My friends, Water Filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.880]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:16.880]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.880]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.880]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:30.880]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and water and breads and toothpaste
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:33.880]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:35.880]  The establishment's not going to do it
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.880]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water

[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:20.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.880]  This is a political voting block
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  I want to get baggage to take on that, go ahead and make your point
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:54.880]  Yeah, I just want to say something, Alex, this is the country where you're done
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:01.880]  The thing I don't understand is I grew up in this country and you couldn't go to Japan to become Japanese
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.880]  You couldn't go to China to be Chinese
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:06.880]  But you could become an American
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.880]  And all these people, I'm going to go back to what C.L. Bryant said about
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.880]  You know, give somebody their comfort, they don't want free and they want their comfort
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.880]  And they're taking all these things for always not letting the Alaska youth
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:20.880]  the resources there or the oils or whatever in this country
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.880]  Why aren't we not back harder on these people?
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  Not our baggage?
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.880]  Yeah, you know this idea of no borders
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.880]  The fact is the cultures of the world are too different to erase borders
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:44.880]  You know, we've got a couple hundred years to go before people are really on the same page
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  I just don't see that as a practical solution to anything
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.880]  In fact, if you really, it's easy for someone to come in comparably into the United States
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.880]  Go look into what it takes to give up your U.S. citizenship if you ever wanted to do it
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:00.880]  You can't without the government's permission
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:03.880]  And now they're saying they'll still take your after-tax money even if you do
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:06.880]  They're kind of saying you can't
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:10.880]  20% on your way out the door in capital gains of everything you own
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:14.880]  They will not let you leave for tax reasons, only for political reasons
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.880]  And that way they can deny you entry in the future for those very political reasons
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:22.880]  That might cause you to rethink your citizenship
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.880]  The fact is it's not, you know, the U.S. owns us in that sense
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:30.880]  No, that's what I was saying in the last hour
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:35.880]  It is that I don't even, our family ranch, we don't really own that
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:41.880]  No, no, I have some property outside of tax jurisdictions here in Alaska
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.880]  In fact, outside of our organized boroughs
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.880]  So it's property I really own, you know, because I'm not taxed on it every year
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:49.880]  Wow, that's so rare
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:54.880]  It is so rare in Alaska, it's one of the few places where there are still unorganized
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.880]  Regions of the state where you can actually achieve that
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:01.880]  You know, and otherwise you're really just on the lifetime payment plan
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.880]  Because when you're done paying the bank, you're still paying the government
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:07.880]  For land that you theoretically own
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.880]  And then they can raise the property tax where you can't pay it
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:13.880]  It's so sick, caller, great points, thanks for holding
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:17.880]  Kerry and Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead, thank you
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:18.880]  Alex
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:19.880]  Hey
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.880]  I've been trying to reach you for about a year
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.880]  I've sent you about 100 emails
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:27.880]  Well, brother, you're on the air right now
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:34.880]  This seems to always happen when somebody says they've been waiting a long time
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.880]  I automatically know they're not going to talk
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:37.880]  Sir, do you have something to say?
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.880]  Here, I'm here
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.880]  Go ahead
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.880]  You can look back through the emails, okay
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.880]  We are all moving right now through a magnetic field
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:51.880]  And leaving a trail, a traceable trail
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  And have been for at least the last thousand years
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:57.880]  I know that sounds wild, this sounds crazy
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.880]  No, no, no, you're talking to the guy that can answer that
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:02.880]  I had a big former bank capital analyst on
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.880]  He said sunspots are what control economic cycles
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:07.880]  Because like the moon, it affects the brain
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.880]  I'll hold you over so you can finish your comment caller
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  You say you've been waiting for years to get this out
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.880]  But just say it, you don't have to like, people always call it
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:14.880]  And want to be screened on air
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  But what do you think about this talk of this magnetic field in the galaxy?
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.880]  Is that true?
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:22.880]  You have tremendous impact by these fields
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.880]  That are usually pretty subtle
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  I mean, the word lunatic comes from the lunar cycle
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.880]  Which was observed hundreds of years ago
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:32.880]  Because at the full moon people recognized there was a change in behaviors
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.880]  When you look at the sunspot cycle
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.880]  It correlates to the economic cycles
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  It correlates to wars, it also correlates to major economic swings
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.880]  That's what Harry Dent was saying
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  Yeah, and that's absolutely true
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.880]  I mean, you can look historically at the record
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.880]  You can make the correlations are really easy to make
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:53.880]  The same thing is true when you look at global warming
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.880]  It's actually, if you look at the sunspot cycle
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:57.880]  It parallels...
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.880]  Stay there sir, I'm going to come back and...
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.880]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.880]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:09.880]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:12.880]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.880]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:18.880]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:19.880]  Within their homes
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.880]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.880]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.880]  Link to numerous conditions
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.880]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:31.880]  They're allergic to as well
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:33.880]  When I began to research these statistics
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:34.880]  It was clear to me
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.880]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.880]  In order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:41.880]  But that we can fight back against
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.880]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.880]  And manufactured in the USA
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:48.880]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleans is here

[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.880]  The football, the basketball
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.880]  Security alert, this is Homeland Security

[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:21.880]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:24.880]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.880]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.880]  I don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theory
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.880]  Targeting of patriots engaged
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.880]  They are never going to stop

[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:55.880]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:05.880]  Electrally, it's for God you can fail it
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:29.880]  Okay, if you just joined us
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:32.880]  We're taking calls, wildcard calls
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:34.880]  There's some different issues from Sue and Chad
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:37.880]  And Chris and Kerry, and that's it for the calls
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:40.880]  We're talking about some more solutions
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:43.880]  A really important solution that's verifiable
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:46.880]  To absolutely make the United States
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:49.880]  But also the rest of the world incredibly wealthy
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:51.880]  So that's coming up
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.880]  Dealing with energy in just a few minutes
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.880]  After these calls with Dr. Nick Beggage
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:58.880]  A scientist, best-selling author
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:01.880]  One of the main land experts up in Alaska
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:03.880]  And consults with Native tribes all over the United States
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.880]  His brother, obviously a U.S. Senator
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:07.880]  His dad, a famous congressman
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:10.880]  Who got a lot of reforms in for Native Americans in Alaska
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  But also in other areas
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.880]  And he joins us right now, but the caller
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:18.880]  Said, Alex, I've been trying to hold you for a year
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:20.880]  And people just joined us, I'm recapping it
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.880]  It's the magnetic waves we're going through in space
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.880]  The last thousand years, it's different
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:28.880]  He didn't finish his point, he just kept pausing
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.880]  And I said, no, we had, you know, Harry Denon
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.880]  Top analyst saying that sunspot cycles
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:36.880]  With war's economy
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.880]  We're going out of one of the peaks right now
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  I'm supposed to bring us down
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:42.880]  We got the chart on screen for TV viewers
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  And Beggage was like, well, of course that's a big part of it
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:46.880]  This is known by police departments
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:48.880]  The lunar cycle
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.880]  It's just known by hospitals
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.880]  It's a reality
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  Because, you know, the moon changes the tides
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:56.880]  Changes hormones
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.880]  Really affects women more in some studies I've seen
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.880]  So finishing up with that
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.880]  Caller, what is your point, though
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:04.880]  Or a specific question for Beggage
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:06.880]  Because he's a perfect guest to have on
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.880]  With the question, what specifically
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:11.880]  Are you talking about an ion field?
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.880]  What are you getting at, sir?
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.880]  Okay, in short
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.880]  We are all moving through a magnetic field
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.880]  On an atom by atom basis
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.880]  It's not wrapping around the earth
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.880]  We're moving through it point by point
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.880]  Atom by atom
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.880]  And we have been for a thousand years
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.880]  And with the right software
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.880]  And the right equipment
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.880]  You can go back and you can see
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.880]  What really happened
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.880]  And hear what really happened
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:42.880]  That's what I'm saying
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.880]  That's why I'm writing you
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.880]  I definitely didn't want to talk to you online
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.880]  I'm scared to death
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  But I'm telling you that
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:52.880]  I mean, what are you an electro
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.880]  I mean, you're some type of electrical engineer
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.880]  Or physicist because that's the argument
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:58.880]  Is that you can hear echoes of everything
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.880]  Throughout
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:02.880]  Time and space
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.880]  And read energy fields like electric
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.880]  You know, currents
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:08.880]  That have already passed through
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.880]  Or radio telescopes
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.880]  I mean, are you specifically working, say
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.880]  DARPA in research of this
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.880]  Because I know they're looking at that
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.880]  Or are you theoretically coming up with this in your mind
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:20.880]  And it's so exciting that you're freaking out
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:22.880]  No, it explains everything
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.880]  It explains everything
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.880]  I asked you, sir, are you a scientist
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.880]  Specifically that has equations
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.880]  Or tests showing what you're saying
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.880]  I will send me some information
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.880]  I appreciate your call
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.880]  Dr. Nick Beggis has an interesting topic he brought up
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:42.880]  And so bring it up
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.880]  To speed with what you know
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.880]  With this whole idea of being able
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:48.880]  To go back and read energy fields
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.880]  I think that is an area that's
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:52.880]  Certainly expanding in research and people's
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.880]  Interest
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.880]  Think about how information is transmitted
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.880]  Through wireless and reconfigured
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.880]  In television sets as an example
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.880]  The idea of
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.880]  Capturing that information
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.880]  Long, long after it's passed
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:08.880]  Yeah, absolutely
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.880]  In this sense, it's not a thousand years
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:12.880]  It's for eternity
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:14.880]  We are in an electromagnetic soup
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.880]  Produced by all kinds of natural
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.880]  And now man-made phenomena
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:20.880]  Radio frequency energy alone is
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:22.880]  200 million times more now
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.880]  In the last hundred years
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.880]  Because of what man's introduced on the planet earth
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:28.880]  Versus what nature normally
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  Was making available to us
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.880]  But the difference between nature
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.880]  And man is man can create
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.880]  The situation where they can direct
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.880]  The situation which gets back to that earlier
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:40.880]  Subject of manipulating the human brain
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  And human mind and human emotions
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.880]  This is where the science is going
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  And this is a very dangerous area
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.880]  Exactly, if sunspots
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:50.880]  Control wars and
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.880]  Irrational exuberance and everything
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.880]  And increase them
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.880]  Then imagine what artificial systems are doing
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.880]  Oh yeah, and this idea
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:00.880]  Of the cell phone towers or any other
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:02.880]  Electromagnetic system being used
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:04.880]  Is extremely well known
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:06.880]  For supporting on it
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:08.880]  Since the first major articles
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.880]  The one the mind has no firewalls
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:12.880]  1998 perimeters
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.880]  U.S. Army War College
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.880]  Great document, everything in it
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.880]  Is proving itself out
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:20.880]  It's taken from an earlier Russian report
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.880]  I know one of the best
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.880]  In fact, the top biophysicist in Russia
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.880]  Alex Kaveranen
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:28.880]  And his ideas on this
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.880]  Perfectly correlate with what the caller
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.880]  Is suggesting in the sense that
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.880]  There are many things to electromagnetic
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.880]  Feed
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:38.880]  We just lost his Skype
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.880]  Adam's molecules
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.880]  And eventually body
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:44.880]  Alright, your Skype came back in
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:46.880]  And again, none of this technology
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.880]  Is bad in and of itself
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.880]  But it's that the technocrats
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.880]  Are clearly
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.880]  Anti-human
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.880]  When I look at federalization
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.880]  Globalization of curriculum
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.880]  And they literally teach 2 plus 2 equals 5
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:02.880]  To attempt to really screw kids up
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:04.880]  And to make them dysfunctional
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:06.880]  And for me, that's really a real
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.880]  Benchmark
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.880]  It shows that the ruling elite
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:12.880]  Are really bad people
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.880]  And there's a mix of good people in the system
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.880]  As well, but the higher up you get
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:18.880]  The more psychopathic, kleptocratic
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.880]  Disconnected
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.880]  From humanity they are
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:24.880]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.880]  I agree 100%
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.880]  The thing is, we don't need to teach kids
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:30.880]  What to think
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.880]  We need to teach them how to think
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.880]  Math, reading, basic skills
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:36.880]  And then give them the tools to use their mind
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:38.880]  Independent
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.880]  Of the propaganda being packed in it
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.880]  And organized curriculum
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.880]  Exactly, I look at textbooks now
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:46.880]  They are designed
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.880]  To not work and screw people up
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.880]  And then it turns out we have the documents
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.880]  That that's on purpose
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.880]  What type of elite wants to screw people up?
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.880]  People who want factory work and slaves
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.880]  People who want people to lay down
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  In the street and give up
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:02.880]  People who don't want us to think
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.880]  For ourselves
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:06.880]  That's the whole essence of what we are
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.880]  As human beings
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.880]  We are independent souls
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.880]  Created in the image of a creator
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:14.880]  That means a lot
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.880]  That means every one of us has incredible potency
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.880]  As individuals when we activate
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.880]  The mind to be controlled by ourselves
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:22.880]  This is the essence
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.880]  That they resist the most
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:26.880]  All the mind control work that the government did
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.880]  The thing they found out that scared the heck out of them
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:30.880]  Is when they realized
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.880]  That every single human being
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:34.880]  Had this innate potential
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  And the way to suppress that potential
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.880]  Is to keep people in an environment of fear
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.880]  Confusion and worry
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:42.880]  And feeling weak, feeling hopeless
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:44.880]  And insecure, that's what Madison Avenue does
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.880]  I had Bruce Fine, top constitutional lawyer
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:48.880]  Former head lawyer for the FCC
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.880]  On who got rid of the fairness doctrine
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.880]  And he said, look Alex
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.880]  What you got to understand is
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.880]  When they attack us, and I've always known this
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.880]  But when they try to suppress us
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:00.880]  That causes innovation
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.880]  And I was realizing
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.880]  The enemy attacking us
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.880]  And doing this mind control
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.880]  That's what my dad has always said
[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.880]  But it's only clicking now how right these men are
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.880]  That are older than me
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:14.880]  That it's going to go in ways they don't know
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:16.880]  It's going to trigger us to be even greater
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.880]  Now for the general public it's going to annihilate them
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:20.880]  And hurt a lot of people and we don't like that
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.880]  But for some of us
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.880]  It's going to trigger the type of historical
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:26.880]  Physical but also cultural
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:28.880]  Mutations that the establishment
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.880]  Is not going to be able to deal with
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:32.880]  Oh that's exactly it
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.880]  We did a mind effects
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:36.880]  Close conference on this in Dallas
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:38.880]  Some years ago with the best in the world
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.880]  And what they said is we are on the edge
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.880]  Of the next evolution of the human mind
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:44.880]  Where we're going to have these anomalous
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.880]  Capabilities and the elite
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.880]  The new world order
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:50.880]  They are not going to be able to touch us
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.880]  That's coming
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:54.880]  That's the real revolution and that's what they're fighting against
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.880]  That's what mind control is really about
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.880]  Is shutting down our capacity
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.880]  To reach our higher capacities
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:02.880]  I've interviewed General Stubble behind the head
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.880]  Of men who stare at goats
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:06.880]  They made a joke out of it
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.880]  But on record what's been declassified
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:10.880]  Is the problem was they would boost all these people
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:12.880]  And get them to this higher level
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.880]  And then they automatically wanted to fight the system
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:16.880]  I mean that's the issue
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:18.880]  They're going to boost somebody
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:20.880]  Like they're going to boost their own people to fight us
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:22.880]  Once they boost them they're going to be at our level
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:24.880]  Or higher and be more human
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:26.880]  And not want to hurt people
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.880]  That's exactly right and I think this is
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.880]  Again when you start to look at these programs
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:32.880]  Now drifting towards how do you wipe out memory
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.880]  How do you really start to refine
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:36.880]  What the feed is and that's really what's going on
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.880]  It's a control of the feed
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:40.880]  And to try and suppress these
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:42.880]  Higher ordered capacities
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:44.880]  At the same time as exploit them
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:46.880]  That's a challenge for DARPA
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:48.880]  And it's really
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:50.880]  We need to let go of fear and worry
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.880]  Be confident human beings, recognize what we are
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:54.880]  We live eternally
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.880]  This is a stop between short interviews
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.880]  We need to move forward
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:00.880]  As sovereign individuals doing the things
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.880]  That we believe are right and true
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.880]  To the extent that we each individually can
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:06.880]  That's what changes the world
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.880]  That's why talk radio is powerful
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.880]  It reminds us that we are not
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  In this alone
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.880]  Together we can make a difference
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:16.880]  Wow powerful interview amazing
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:18.880]  I'm going to skip this network break
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.880]  It's so important
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:22.880]  We have this clip of this physicist
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.880]  Snead
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:26.880]  And a seed
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.880]  And what's his full name I forget it
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.880]  That's right Richard Seed
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.880]  And this was on Discovery Channel
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.880]  And this is the attitude of Ray Kurzweil
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:36.880]  And so many others
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.880]  And they're really smart men and I admire much of their work
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:40.880]  And their inventions but the compendium
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.880]  Of the future as they put on TV
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.880]  That they make the head of Google
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.880]  Technology and future programs
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.880]  They have this attitude that you're not even people
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:50.880]  We're going to become gods
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.880]  We're going to brush you aside
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.880]  Well I don't think they're ever going to become
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.880]  Even super human or advance
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:58.880]  To the next level while having an attitude
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.880]  Of shutting off other people
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:02.880]  I mean you reap what you sow it's a universal law
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.880]  Karma whatever you want to call it
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:06.880]  I don't know how these guys are so smart
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:08.880]  Then they have this real anti-human
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.880]  Attitude
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:12.880]  Of me, me, me, mine, mine, mine
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:14.880]  Let's go ahead and play this clip
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.880]  We are going to become gods
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:18.880]  Period
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:20.880]  If you don't like it, get off
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.880]  You don't have to contribute
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:24.880]  You don't have to participate
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:26.880]  If you're going to interfere
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.880]  With me
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.880]  Becoming god
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:32.880]  Then we'll have big trouble
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.880]  Then we'll have more fear
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.880]  So there's the attitude Dave sees the future
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.880]  They're deciding what to do
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:42.880]  We don't even count
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.880]  If we will
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.880]  Don't they know that that is at a fundamental level
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:48.880]  A universal crime in the universe
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.880]  You know I think there's ego
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.880]  Is so big on the part of some of these players
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.880]  And that's what I see
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:56.880]  Is I meet many, many people
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:58.880]  In leadership
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:00.880]  They either have a very humble heart
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:02.880]  Or just the opposite
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:04.880]  And you know what I think eventually
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:06.880]  This all catches up
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:08.880]  And I think we're in that phase of history
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.880]  There's a lot of unrest in the country
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.880]  Right now
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.880]  That's actually feeding I think the changes
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:16.880]  That are coming too
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.880]  And the necessity
[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:20.880]  Of another jump in human thinking
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.880]  And our ability to think
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:24.880]  Is certainly there
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.880]  Consider what we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:28.880]  As human beings
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:30.880]  It's the inevitable next step
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:32.880]  I think we're going to open the door
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:34.880]  To a lot of possibilities in the course of this
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.880]  But it's going to be a rough road
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.880]  These elitists that think it belongs
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.880]  To them, that's been the problem
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.880]  For at least a couple thousand years
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.880]  Suppressing the population
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:46.880]  So that we don't recognize what we truly are
[02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.880]  If we could just recognize
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:50.880]  And remember
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.880]  The gifts that we have
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.880]  Within us and believe
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.880]  That we can manifest those gifts
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:58.880]  And I believe the technology will lay
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:00.880]  The blueprint where our belief systems
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:02.880]  Will change and we'll see these things
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:04.880]  Naturally manifest in the minds of man
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.880]  And instead of trying to
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:08.880]  Suppress the general population
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:10.880]  Where there's guaranteed individuals
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:12.880]  That would take us to the next level
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.880]  I mean, the elite should see the entire population
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:16.880]  As a treasure trove
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.880]  Instead of a detriment
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.880]  And then the self-fulfilling prophecy that we're junk
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.880]  They program us with junk
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:24.880]  So they can point at us and say, see, we're better than them
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.880]  That's not elitist
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:28.880]  That's not what a real elite would think
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.880]  It just makes no sense
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.880]  Well, you know, again
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:34.880]  As they fail to recognize
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.880]  The value of each human being
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:38.880]  And, you know, some countries
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.880]  Don't put any value
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.880]  On humankind and what we're seeing
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:44.880]  Is more and more that drifting into western
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.880]  Governments to the point
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:48.880]  Where we're just numbers on a
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:50.880]  Tax record, you know, where it's
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:52.880]  Chattel on so many levels
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.880]  But that is not who we are
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.880]  We are way more than that
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:58.880]  We are powerful individuals
[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:00.880]  Capable of creating change within our neighborhoods
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.880]  In our communities
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.880]  We're what you can
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:06.880]  Don't take on some impossible task as individuals
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:08.880]  Take on the one that you absolutely know
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.880]  You can do, whether it's these issues
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:12.880]  Or other issues, and that's how change happens
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:14.880]  Put people's feet to the fire
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.880]  Confront the issues
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:18.880]  Provide the information
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:20.880]  That's the only way we're going to see
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:22.880]  The mindset change
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:24.880]  From this defeatist attitude
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:26.880]  We need to rise up out of the ashes of our apathy
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:28.880]  Claim our birthright
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:30.880]  And change the world
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:32.880]  That's what we're each called to do
[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:34.880]  That's what we're here to do
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.880]  And we can do it in every way
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.880]  In every which way with every small and large thing
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:40.880]  That each of us engage in
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:42.880]  We don't have to wait for a group to form
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:44.880]  That's right, and if you read the three or four books
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.880]  Written by Brzezinski on this
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:48.880]  Who is one of the top global strategists
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:50.880]  He's in the top five that we know of
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:52.880]  That's all they talk about
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.880]  Openly knowing the public doesn't read their books is
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:56.880]  You know, the human potential is too powerful
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.880]  They're going to take over and then we won't control
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.880]  Hurry, let's dumb them all down
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:02.880]  Obviously, these are not the people
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.880]  To lead us that they would act like this
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.880]  Absolutely
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.880]  And again, good leaders keep getting taken out
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.880]  They either die in plane crashes
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:12.880]  They get taken out in political scandal
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.880]  You know, this is the way it's done
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:16.880]  You know, you either play ball
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:18.880]  Or they try and bury you
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:20.880]  This is the way it happens
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:22.880]  You know, here in Alaska they're going to spend
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:24.880]  Probably $20 million on a senate race
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:26.880]  You know, there's only a couple hundred thousand
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:28.880]  Boats that are going to decide that race here
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:30.880]  There's only 700,000 people
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:32.880]  Even live in this state
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:34.880]  But they're going to spend $20 million
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.880]  You know where that money's coming from?
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:38.880]  It's not coming from citizens who live here
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:40.880]  It's coming from big multinational special interests
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.880]  That want to drive the truck
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:44.880]  They don't want to control politics
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:46.880]  They want to own senators
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:48.880]  They want to own this country
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:50.880]  And own the very soul of the nation
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.880]  That's what needs to be stripped away
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:54.880]  Don't listen to the media ads
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:56.880]  They don't want to see garbage
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.880]  Dig into who these people are
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:00.880]  Make your decisions based on real records
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.880]  And the things that are important to you
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:04.880]  Whether you support the R's or the D's
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:06.880]  Or the independents
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:08.880]  Find at least people that you can believe in
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:10.880]  And do something for them
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:12.880]  That's the only way anything ever changes
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:14.880]  And then hope they rotate out
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:16.880]  Before they get corrupted
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.880]  Because unfortunately over time
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.880]  That's inevitable with so many politicians
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:22.880]  They value the power
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.880]  And the opportunity to start
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.880]  And the elite know how to scare you slowly
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:28.880]  And then basically you get
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:30.880]  Support and safety from joining
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:32.880]  One of the combines
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:34.880]  That's what's happening on so many levels
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:36.880]  That's what's happening
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:38.880]  Absolutely, let's go ahead and go to Chad in Tennessee
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.880]  Thanks for holding, you're on the air with Dr. Nick Baggich
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.880]  Of EarthPulse.com
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:44.880]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  Good, thank you for calling
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.880]  Good, hey yes, first I'm calling
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.880]  You're about six months now
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:52.880]  You put out and I want to thank you
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.880]  And the other patriots that do
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:56.880]  Do what you do
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:58.880]  And it's a shame
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.880]  I posted a comment on Facebook a couple of weeks ago
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.880]  About how the United States
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.880]  Has fallen under tyranny
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:06.880]  Once again after
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.880]  Almost 200 and some odd years ago
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.880]  I got called a fool for this
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.880]  Well there's a lot of weak minded people
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:14.880]  That are scared so they just said that to make them feel big
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.880]  They also have on record bots
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:18.880]  That respond now
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:20.880]  They already have the CIA
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.880]  Already has major publications writing fake news with computers
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.880]  So sir, don't listen
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:26.880]  Don't even listen to the bots
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:28.880]  They're getting rid of comments on most big news sites
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:30.880]  Because usually the comments are pro-liberty
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.880]  So they're trying to create a synthetic
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.880]  Artificial group
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:36.880]  Think, Dr. Baggich do you want to comment on that?
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:38.880]  That's exactly it
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:40.880]  You know, it again
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.880]  Is about manipulation
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.880]  So screening out
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:46.880]  And controlling the dialogue
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:48.880]  What all that is about
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.880]  I mean, it's the whole nature of our society right now
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:52.880]  It's control the dialogue
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:54.880]  Control the debate
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.880]  Control the discussion
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.880]  And every way the technology can support that
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:00.880]  That's what's happening
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.880]  The idea that people are giving up their private information
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:04.880]  Through internet, through all the electronic
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:06.880]  Forms of information
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:08.880]  That's our digital doorway
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:10.880]  That's a doorway to our home
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.880]  That's what should be protected
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:14.880]  We should own all of that information
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:16.880]  Yeah, I'm thinking we're going to start going to people's doors
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:18.880]  And not going to go on
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:20.880]  Mind if we come in and put cameras in your bathroom and watch you
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.880]  They're going to like, get off my porch
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:24.880]  We're going to say, hey, we apologize
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.880]  It's for TV to illustrate that the NSA
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:28.880]  Incorporations are watching everything you do
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:30.880]  Why are you mad at me but not them
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:32.880]  When I'm being honest
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:34.880]  Right, that's exactly right
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.880]  I've taken a lot of criticism
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:38.880]  Believe me, I know Alex has too
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:40.880]  The fact is we all take a lot of criticism
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:42.880]  When you're doing what you believe in
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:44.880]  We respectfully do it kindly
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.880]  Do it with an honest heart
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:48.880]  And if you're wrong, somewhere along the line
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:50.880]  Admit it and move on
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.880]  But exactly, don't you get empowered actually
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:54.880]  When the establishment attacks you
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.880]  It means you're doing good
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.880]  When you know you're doing the right thing
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:00.880]  People need to stop worrying about
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.880]  Getting made fun of or attacked
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.880]  That's what life's all about
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:06.880]  Being raised in a political family
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:08.880]  You get pretty thick skin
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:10.880]  I could care less what they say
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:12.880]  I'm speaking my truth
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:14.880]  And all of us can do the same
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.880]  Don't be in fear, that's where they want you
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:18.880]  That's when everything shuts down
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.880]  Know what you are, who you are
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:22.880]  And take that forward
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:24.880]  Into the world around you
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:26.880]  Your sphere of influence may be your friends
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:28.880]  Maybe your family, maybe bigger than that
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.880]  Exercise it, do something
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.880]  All of us are doing a little bit
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:34.880]  It adds up in the long run
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:36.880]  The country is not lost
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:38.880]  We wouldn't be doing this
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:40.880]  I'm from Texas and I've had a big effect
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:42.880]  And I've got my problems
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:44.880]  But I'm real so it's had an effect
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:46.880]  I want to, I know you've got to go
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:48.880]  I'm going to come back and do five minutes on the big
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:50.880]  Resource issue and really how to
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:52.880]  Supercharge this country and the world
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:54.880]  Just using Alaska by itself
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.880]  On record as the model with Dr. Nick Baggage
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:27:58.880]  We've got two minutes to break though
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:00.880]  Let's jam in a few more calls
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.880]  Chris and Nevada, you're on the air with Dr. Nick Baggage
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:04.880]  Go ahead
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:06.880]  Yes sir, go ahead
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:08.880]  Okay, Chris is gone
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:10.880]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.880]  Jay, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:14.880]  Good afternoon, Alex
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:16.880]  Doctor, I'm Jay Morrow
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:18.880]  From a great dogwood state in North Carolina
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:20.880]  Tried contacting you
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:22.880]  A couple of days ago by contact form
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:24.880]  I wanted to touch on basically
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.880]  What the doctor was talking about
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.880]  As far as consciousness being upgraded
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:32.880]  I'm just going to hit it on the head
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.880]  Like a, you know, hit it on the head
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  Like a nail being hit with a hammer
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:38.880]  Basically right now there exists some technology
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.880]  That has been
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:42.880]  Used for
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.880]  I say the early 90s
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:46.880]  And it has basically
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.880]  Been used to
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:50.880]  Elevate those
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.880]  Beneath the scenes behind closed doors
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:54.880]  But now it's a point
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:56.880]  Where it needs to be known
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:58.880]  That this technology exists
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.880]  That can reverse the DNA manipulation
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:02.880]  That the government and the powers
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.880]  Have been
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:06.880]  Well, I know there's a lot of suppressed technology
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:08.880]  But there's also a lot of people out there claiming
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:10.880]  They have things that they don't
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.880]  I'm not saying you're doing that, but specifically
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.880]  What is this?
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:16.880]  Basically, I
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:18.880]  Have found myself to become a targeted individual
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.880]  After being discharged from the United States Navy
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:22.880]  2011
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:24.880]  With all types of harassment secret agents
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:26.880]  Showing up at myself
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:28.880]  There's no doubt they're harassing veterans
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:30.880]  That's in the news today
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:32.880]  So I'm going to come back and get Dr. Begich's take on that
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:34.880]  Thank you for the call, sir
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:36.880]  And then we're going to get into some of the solutions
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:38.880]  Just on a resource-based front
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.880]  Okay, with Dr. Nick Begich
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:42.880]  Of earthpulse.com
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:44.880]  His books and videos are all available
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:46.880]  At infowarstore.com
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:48.880]  Or follow the links at infowarstore.com
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:30:00.880]  We're on the march, the empires on the run
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:02.880]  This is scottishjohnforinfowars.com
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.880]  I know that most of you here in this commercial
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.880]  Already know about the New World Order
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:08.880]  Eugenics, and all the other issues covered
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:10.880]  Here at Infowars
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:12.880]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:14.880]  If not, then I want to know why
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.880]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:18.880]  They might call you names
[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:20.880]  Or they just want to talk about sports
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:22.880]  Are so poppers, I say so what?
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.880]  There's a battle going on out there right now
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:26.880]  The ammunition is information
[02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:28.880]  And the soldiers are you
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.880]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:32.880]  To active participant
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.880]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:36.880]  For the greater part of the last thousand years
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.880]  And I'm still fighting
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:40.880]  If we don't all stand up right now
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:42.880]  We're going to lose everything
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:44.880]  The Infowar is worldwide
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:46.880]  And let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:48.880]  It's real journalism
[02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:50.880]  And news backed up by documented fact
[02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:52.880]  Step up and take your friends and family
[02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:54.880]  To infowars.com
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.880]  Prisonplanet.tv
[02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:58.880]  And planetinfowars.com
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:00.880]  The truth will set them free
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:02.880]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:04.880]  In nine West Virginia counties
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:06.880]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:08.880]  Had their drinking water contaminate
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.880]  What are the health effects of having
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:12.880]  These drugs in our drinking water
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:14.880]  Forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:16.880]  My friends, water filtration
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:18.880]  Is one of the most basic actions you can take
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:20.880]  To protect you and your family
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:22.880]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:24.880]  On average the county said it sprays with the glyphosate
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.880]  At least once a week
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:28.880]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:30.880]  That is found in water supplies worldwide
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:32.880]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:34.880]  Hydrofluorosalic acid
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.880]  Sodium hexafluorosilicate
[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:38.880]  Fluoride is in teeth
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:40.880]  And coffee and water and breads and toothpaste
[02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:42.880]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:44.880]  The establishment is not going to do it
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:46.880]  It's time to take action
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:48.880]  It's time to filter our water
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:50.880]  Visit infowarsthor.com
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:52.880]  And use promo code WATER

[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:56.880]  Of incredible products
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:58.880]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.880]  From the water table
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:02.880]  To our soils
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:04.880]  To the atmosphere itself
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:06.880]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:08.880]  Each and every day
[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.880]  There is an outside that's toxic
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:12.880]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2-5 times higher concentrations
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.880]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:16.880]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:18.880]  Inside using toxic chemicals
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:20.880]  Within their homes
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.880]  There are more than 42 million smokers
[02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:24.880]  In the United States
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:26.880]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:28.880]  Link to numerous conditions
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:30.880]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:32.880]  Live with pets they're allergic to as well
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:34.880]  When I began to research these statistics
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.880]  It was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.880]  My lungs in order to combat
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.880]  The toxic environment that we cannot escape
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:42.880]  But that we can fight back against
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:44.880]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:46.880]  And manufactured in the USA
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.880]  The new Infowars Life Lung Cleanse
[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:50.880]  Is here in a convenient spray bottle
[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.880]  That can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:54.880]  Now available exclusively
[02:32:54.880 --> 02:32:56.880]  At infowarslife.com
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:12.880]  Until 3-888-253-3139
[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:14.880]  For those who can hear me I say
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:16.880]  Do not despair
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:19.880]  The misery that is now upon us is for the passing of greed
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:23.880]  The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:26.880]  The fate of men will pass and dictators die
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:28.880]  And the power they took from the people
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:30.880]  Will return to the people
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.880]  And so long as men die
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:34.880]  Liberty will never perish
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:37.880]  The answer to 1984
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:40.880]  Is 1776
[02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:43.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:48.880]  There's a couple of articles
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:50.880]  That's from Charlie Chaplin's famous speech
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:52.880]  At the end of the dictator
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:54.880]  When Adolf Hitler
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:56.880]  Hitler reportedly had a hit put out on him
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:58.880]  But it didn't come to fruition
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:01.880]  Leaked document reveals Marine Corps Urban Training Center
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.880]  Based on U.S. Town
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:05.880]  Where they trained to take on the American people
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.880]  Another article, police now arm for war
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:09.880]  Against returning veterans
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.880]  In fact I'm going to be covering that some on the Sunday show
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:16.880]  With
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:18.880]  Our returning reporters
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:20.880]  Sergeant Joe Biggs
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:22.880]  And David Knight
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.880]  Who just got back from an army training facility
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.880]  Which looked like it was set up for torture
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.880]  That's what Biggs had seen in Afghanistan
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:30.880]  He would deliver people for torture
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:32.880]  Really a serious hardcore issue
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:35.880]  Obviously war turns people into countries into monsters
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.880]  Dr. Baggich, in closing here
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:40.880]  Spend about five minutes
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:42.880]  On what you tried to get into earlier
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:44.880]  About freeing up federal lands
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:46.880]  Freeing up lands for natives
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.880]  Freeing up lands for states
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:50.880]  The amount of minerals alone
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.880]  That can be easily and cleanly
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:55.880]  From what I've seen extracted from Alaska
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.880]  But is not being allowed
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:00.880]  A, why do you think it's being suppressed
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:03.880]  And then B, break down what this could do for our country
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:06.880]  And I know we'll get emails or comments by different
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:09.880]  Alternative energy websites going
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:11.880]  Alex, we thought you were for alternative energy
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:13.880]  And you're a horrible person
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:15.880]  Look, they're not letting us get those systems
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:17.880]  We're trying to develop them
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:20.880]  Everything the government pushes is kind of a patch
[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:22.880]  Or an act like they're doing it
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.880]  To actually control the industry
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.880]  But we are based on minerals
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:28.880]  We are based on oil and gas
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:30.880]  And all these other things we have
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:33.880]  And this could be a boom for our country
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:36.880]  So talk about it as a leading expert
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:39.880]  Well, first of all, we're not going to convert
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.880]  From oil-based energy overnight
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:44.880]  It's going to take decades
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:46.880]  So these things are going to move forward
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:49.880]  The United States has increased its oil and gas
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.880]  Production dramatically from fracking
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:54.880]  And now it's going to be happening here in Alaska
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:56.880]  To the point where in a few years
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.880]  We're going to be a net exporter
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:01.880]  Energy imports used to be about 50% of our trade deficit
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:03.880]  With the other half pretty much China
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:06.880]  That's changing because of energy production locally
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.880]  Within the U.S.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:10.880]  But taking it from the minerals perspective
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:13.880]  Alaska has a project
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:16.880]  The Red Dog Mine, which is actually a native-owned property
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:19.880]  And a joint venture of private industry
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:23.880]  It produces 6% of the zinc concentrate in the world
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:25.880]  We have one of the 10 top silver mines
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.880]  In Southeast Alaska
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.880]  But we also have major finds of rare earth minerals
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:33.880]  Which are presently primarily controlled by the Chinese
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:35.880]  But not in Alaska
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:37.880]  We have resources that are being drilled out
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:39.880]  And found throughout Southeast Alaska
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:41.880]  And some of the interior locations
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:43.880]  That could make America free
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:45.880]  In terms of rare earth
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:48.880]  Something we absolutely need to maintain competitiveness globally
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:51.880]  We have no railroad link to Alaska
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.880]  To the rest of the United States
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:56.880]  We could hook up to the trans-Canadian railroad
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:59.880]  And start moving these bulk commodities out of Alaska
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.880]  For value added in the United States
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:04.880]  We need the railroad links established
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:06.880]  To get these minerals to market
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.880]  We can't just use ports
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:10.880]  We have some of the largest mining projects in the country
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:13.880]  Coming online in the next 10 years up here
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:15.880]  We have the Donlan Creek Mine
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:18.880]  We have the biggest one was Pebble
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:22.880]  Which has recently been sort of slowed down dramatically
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:24.880]  Anglo-American pulled out
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:26.880]  That's a half a trillion dollar mine
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.880]  And they still don't know the perimeters of it
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:30.880]  And that's gold and molybdenum
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:33.880]  Again, important minerals going forward
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:36.880]  But Alaska has every strategic mineral
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:37.880]  In mineable quantities
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:39.880]  And strategically large quantities
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.880]  World-class sizes here in Alaska
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:43.880]  And they are not being developed
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.880]  For lack of infrastructure
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:47.880]  You know, they're talking about
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:49.880]  We need roads to the wilderness
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:51.880]  We need roads to the mining areas
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:53.880]  And we need infrastructure built
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.880]  In the same way that we built the western United States
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:58.880]  That kind of initiative would not only create domestic jobs
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:00.880]  But actual jobs that result
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:02.880]  In private industry developments
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:05.880]  And the export of value added minerals
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:08.880]  This is where we can gain our independence again
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:10.880]  We have trillions and trillions
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:12.880]  Of cubic feet of natural gas
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:16.880]  Not including the other forms of hydrocarbons
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:18.880]  Frozen methane on the North Slope
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:21.880]  We have enough to run the country on energy
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:25.880]  In coal alone we have 51% of all the known resources
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:29.880]  In the United States and 25% of the world's coal resources
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:32.880]  We have enough coal to run the energy needs of the U.S.
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:35.880]  For two millennium, 2,000 years
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:36.880]  Let me stop you right there
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:38.880]  Because you're giving the solution
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:39.880]  I've researched it
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:41.880]  What you're saying is all publicly available
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:42.880]  Your brother's the U.S. senator
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.880]  You've managed massive amounts of land there
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:46.880]  Dad, a congressman
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:48.880]  You know what you're talking about
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:50.880]  But it's the same thing
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:51.880]  America can't have jobs
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:52.880]  We can't have factories
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:55.880]  We can't even have service jobs
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:57.880]  It's agenda 21
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:38:59.880]  Same thing in western Europe and the U.S.
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:01.880]  We're not allowed to develop
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:03.880]  We're only allowed to have government
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:05.880]  Or corporate institutional jobs
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:07.880]  To capture us and enslave us
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.880]  Under the UNESCO treaty
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.880]  My issue is
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.880]  Why does the elite want to shut down
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:16.880]  The United States and western Europe?
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.880]  Why is the elite putting in policies
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.880]  Where the west is committing suicide
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:22.880]  Not having children?
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:25.880]  Why does the elite themselves
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:27.880]  Pretty racist people
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:29.880]  Want to destroy the west?
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:31.880]  Well, I think there's really two reasons
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.880]  One is the biggest money is being made
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:35.880]  In the developing world
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:37.880]  I mean, think about a developed stock
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:39.880]  As selling at $100 and it jumps to $110
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.880]  You make 10% on it
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:43.880]  Think of a penny stock going from a penny
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:44.880]  To a dollar
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:45.880]  That's the third world
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:46.880]  That's where they want
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:48.880]  So they want to shut down development here
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:50.880]  Because they already totally have enslaved the third world
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.880]  Right, and if you look at it
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:54.880]  They look at the U.S. mineral resource
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:57.880]  And base as a safety deposit box
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:00.880]  Because they can leave this stuff undevelopable
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:02.880]  They exploit everyone else in the world
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:04.880]  While they get thrown out or nationalized
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:06.880]  And then pull back into the United States
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:08.880]  And develop those resources
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:10.880]  At the point in which we're dumbed down and numbed down
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:12.880]  And then they can continue to
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:14.880]  I was told that by a high level elitist
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:16.880]  I've never heard that before except from you
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:18.880]  Were you given that from your high level sources?
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:19.880]  You know, that's the reality
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.880]  I mean, just look at how it unfolds
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:23.880]  Yeah, that's what everyone sees
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:25.880]  If you really look at the bigger picture
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:27.880]  It's just a shift in the market
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:29.880]  They're just going to go and exploit
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:31.880]  Where they make the biggest margins
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.880]  With the least regulations
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:35.880]  Where they can corrupt government
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:36.880]  That's openly corrupt
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.880]  I mean, every one of these governments
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:40.880]  Even our own government, think about it
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:43.880]  We have a government that takes money around the world
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.880]  And pallets and plane loads to bribe people
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:47.880]  It's well known
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.880]  Kidnap people, torture people
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:52.880]  Invade your mail, kick down your doors
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:54.880]  You don't even know people like this
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:56.880]  Unless you're listening to this broadcast in prison
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.880]  You know, the fact of the matter is
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:00.880]  This is a criminal government
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.880]  Everything that the elite wants
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.880]  To restrict us, restrain us
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:06.880]  And keep us down
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:08.880]  Because we can make the difference
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:10.880]  We can make the difference in being the light
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:12.880]  That our founding fathers expected of us
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:14.880]  Not to be a dominant force in the world
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:16.880]  But to be a light where people want to emulate
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.880]  What we have here, what we do here
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:20.880]  In their own self-interest
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:23.880]  Not imposed upon them by some external force
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:24.880]  And I want to quantify this
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:26.880]  You know, one shipment was 12 million
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:28.880]  Another 30-something million to Iraq
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:30.880]  Not just to buy off local officials
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.880]  But to buy off our own military
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:34.880]  Where they would give a sergeant a hundred grand
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:36.880]  Or somebody else a million, a general
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:38.880]  And then say, by the way, you stole that money
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.880]  You better do what we say and ship these drugs back
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:42.880]  This is a corrupting
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.880]  So instead of building something to rise in society
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:46.880]  That raises the whole society
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:48.880]  If you're part of the criminal gang
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:50.880]  You get ahead
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:52.880]  And it creates
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.880]  Dark ages, folks
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:56.880]  We need to be going the opposite direction
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:58.880]  Let me ask you this
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:00.880]  Are we turning the tide?
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:02.880]  I know there's a big awakening. Is it enough?
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:04.880]  What does your gut tell you the timeline is?
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:06.880]  What's going to happen? You're probably one of the smartest guys
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:08.880]  In general knowledge, Dr. Begich
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.880]  What do you see happening?
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:12.880]  I think the tide is rising
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:14.880]  I don't think it takes 51%
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:16.880]  The American Revolution started with 6% of the people
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.880]  They say we're in favor of that when it began
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:20.880]  And thank God there was that 6%
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.880]  Today, with the ability
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:24.880]  To communicate globally, all of us
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:26.880]  Even in this broadcast right now
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:28.880]  We can make a bigger difference
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:30.880]  If only 1% of us wake up
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:32.880]  And begin to act in what we believe to be right
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:34.880]  And true, it doesn't take
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:36.880]  A mass, it takes a few
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.880]  There is way more
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:40.880]  Engaged right now
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:42.880]  Than is necessary to create
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:44.880]  The next revolution, the next evolution
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:46.880]  In human thinking
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:48.880]  That's what's going on right now
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:50.880]  The tide will turn, we're not going to give up the fight
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:52.880]  There are too many of us in it for too long
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:54.880]  And there's too many of us coming up
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:56.880]  And being from behind
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:42:58.880]  And I think that's the fifth column
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:00.880]  Is the fifth column of freedom
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:02.880]  It's those of us that still engage this process
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:04.880]  And refuse to lay down
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:06.880]  In front of the tank and get run over
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:08.880]  We're going to take control of those tanks again
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.880]  We're going to take control of this country
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:12.880]  And all of our countries
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.880]  Because corruption is what needs to be snuffed out
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:16.880]  The elite needs to be recognized
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:18.880]  For who they are and what they are
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:20.880]  And recognize that the change
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:22.880]  Has to come and it is coming
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.880]  I believe the tide is turning
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:26.880]  Just keep in the fight, don't give up
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:28.880]  Even in the worst circumstances
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:30.880]  Those are the things that give us the scar
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:32.880]  Tissue to continue and the strength
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:34.880]  To carry on
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:36.880]  That's right, beautifully said
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:38.880]  Again, we carry most of your books and videos
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:40.880]  Most can also find them on your site
[02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:42.880]  Which I'll give people, are you working on anything new?
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:44.880]  What do you focus on this day
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:46.880]  Over at earthpulse.com
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:48.880]  Dr. Nick Baggage
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:50.880]  A few things
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:52.880]  A few of our electronic devices
[02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:54.880]  Are coming out in the next few years
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:56.880]  We've got some really interesting things
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:43:58.880]  For mineral and
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:00.880]  Vitamin deficiencies
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:02.880]  Diagnoses, we have some great things
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:04.880]  Coming in the field of health
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:06.880]  Which is an area that I'm very interested in
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:08.880]  Because strong bodies, strong minds
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:10.880]  And I want to work with you on that
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:12.880]  You bet, in fact
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.880]  I'm hoping to get down to Austin at some point
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:16.880]  And spend a little time with you personally
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:18.880]  I'm hoping to get down there sometime this fall
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:20.880]  Come on down, you're welcome
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:22.880]  We'll pay for your hotel, my friend
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:24.880]  All right, well, bottom line
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:26.880]  Look at Obama, a false messiah
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.880]  But it doesn't work anymore
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:30.880]  People wake up to these puppets faster and faster
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.880]  And I can play as the public's dumbed down
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:34.880]  Congress has as low as a 6% approval rating
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:36.880]  Now, that's really got to worry the establishment
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:38.880]  Oh, I think so too
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:40.880]  You're talking about the establishment
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:42.880]  I gotta leave on one point
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:44.880]  It's a Federal Reserve
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:46.880]  My brother's the only Democrat
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:48.880]  That signed on to audit the Federal Reserve
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:50.880]  And when Bernanke called him
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:52.880]  And screamed at him over it, he said
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:54.880]  Hey, you internally audit yourself all the time
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:56.880]  What are you worried about?
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:58.880]  They're worried, people are looking
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:00.880]  It's not just about what's happening
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.880]  In the open media, people are paying
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:04.880]  By the way, it's great your brother did that
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:06.880]  Tell folks, I remember seeing that briefly
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:08.880]  In the news, give us the inside scoop
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:10.880]  On that Federal Reserve situation
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:12.880]  Well, you know, he doesn't trust them
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:14.880]  It's not trustworthy
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.880]  This 300 banks are a private organization
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:18.880]  They haven't been externally audited
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:20.880]  They need to be held accountable
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:22.880]  They are jeopardizing
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:24.880]  Everything in this country
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:26.880]  And they're an outside institution
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:28.880]  With no audit, and over 100 years
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:30.880]  It's time
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:32.880]  It's time for a review of what's going on
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:34.880]  It's time for transparency
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:36.880]  Both within the government and with these
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:38.880]  Quasi-government institutions
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:40.880]  And your brother got yelled at by an outgoing
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:42.880]  President
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:44.880]  It was a big one
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:46.880]  He got into a big fight with Obama
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:48.880]  Obama called him on the phone over gun rights
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.880]  Mark favors gun ownership
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:52.880]  He doesn't believe we need any more laws
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:54.880]  To restrict gun ownership
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:56.880]  He's one of the few Democrats that do
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:58.880]  Before he ever ran, he told the Democratic leadership
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:00.880]  You're wrong
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:02.880]  You're wrong on development of Alaskan oil
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:04.880]  You're wrong on gun control
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:06.880]  You're wrong on net neutrality
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:08.880]  You're flat wrong
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:10.880]  You know, Mark votes more with Republicans
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:12.880]  Than any other senator
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:14.880]  And the reason he does is because
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:16.880]  Sometimes everybody has to recognize
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:18.880]  The other guy is right
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:20.880]  And even if you disagree with some of Mark's politics
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:22.880]  The fact of the matter is
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:24.880]  He does what he believes and he's willing to do the fight
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:26.880]  He's willing to take it on
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:28.880]  It's for veterans, which was the last caller
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.880]  He's on the Veterans Affairs Committee
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:32.880]  Holding their feet to the fire
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:34.880]  And I can tell you, go look at the tapes of him
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:36.880]  And committees, and you're going to see him
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:38.880]  Over those guys because veterans represent
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:40.880]  A major portion of our population
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:42.880]  And people who kept this country safe
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:44.880]  For the last 200 years
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:46.880]  It's a different way of looking at politics
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.880]  It's not all black and white
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:50.880]  We need a politics that goes back
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:52.880]  To the fundamentals of recognizing
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:54.880]  That it's human beings we represent
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:56.880]  It's the people we represent and we can
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:58.880]  Disagree vehemently about how to get to the solutions
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:00.880]  But we need real solutions
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:02.880]  Sure
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:04.880]  More cooperative and responsive government
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:06.880]  Thank you for all the time, Dr. Nick Baggage
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:08.880]  Look forward to having you in studio as soon as you want to come
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  Thank you for having me
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:12.880]  God bless you, Alex, and bless your listening audience
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:14.880]  You too, what a great guy
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:16.880]  What a fabulous guy
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.880]  I tell you, I read all that stuff in his books
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:20.880]  In the 90s and in the 2000s
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:22.880]  You will learn more in those books now
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:24.880]  Than has even come out
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.880]  It's insane the amount of stuff that's going on
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:28.880]  The admitted documents
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.880]  On human manipulation
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:32.880]  To suppress us
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:34.880]  I mean, I'm the type of guy
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:36.880]  If I see a lady walking outside
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:38.880]  An old lady or a man
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:40.880]  Whenever they fall down and hurt themselves
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.880]  I don't laugh at that
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:44.880]  And then I'll be around somebody and somebody will fall down
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.880]  And get hurt and people laugh and I look at that person
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:48.880]  I go, man, you're really a jerk
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.880]  I just don't get off on
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:54.880]  People failing
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:56.880]  Now what I don't like is strong people trying to suppress me
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:00.880]  I like seeing thugs fall
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:02.880]  But that's normal instincts, ladies and gentlemen
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:04.880]  And the globalists do not have
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:06.880]  Our interest at heart
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:08.880]  So anything they do is going to be bad
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:14.880]  Makes me so angry
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:16.880]  I talk about Warren Buffet constantly
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:18.880]  Because he's the archetype of a guy that
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:20.880]  Is the biggest recipient of U.S. taxpayer money alive
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:22.880]  Individually
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:24.880]  Look it up
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:26.880]  McClatchy newspaper is one of the sources
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:28.880]  And then he's on TV
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:30.880]  Every time I turn it on, lecturing
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:32.880]  On how taxes aren't high enough
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.880]  When he's an economist and knows full well
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:36.880]  You cut taxes and tax money
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:38.880]  Increases going in
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:40.880]  And that tax cuts
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:42.880]  Is what would get this economy going
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:44.880]  They don't want it to get going
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:46.880]  They want to shut it down
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:50.880]  I told the story going to my uncle's funeral
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:52.880]  I stopped
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:54.880]  With my son
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:56.880]  I didn't take my daughters
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:48:58.880]  At Lubies in Waco
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:00.880]  It's the place I stopped many times
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:02.880]  Going to see family in East Texas
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:04.880]  And it was nothing but old women
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:06.880]  It was age 65 to about 85 or 90
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:10.880]  And it was a big line of these old women
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:12.880]  It's all nothing but old women
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:14.880]  Coming in there to eat lunch
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:16.880]  I remember going to Lubies cafeteria
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.880]  Since I was a little kid
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:20.880]  In Dallas
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:24.880]  And none of those women could buy
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:26.880]  Hardly any food, even though it wasn't that expensive
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:28.880]  And they were all upset
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:30.880]  And they were all trying to just live
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:34.880]  It'd be one thing if we didn't have the resources
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:36.880]  That was going on, but the globalists have done that
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:38.880]  By screwing this economy over
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:40.880]  And it's only the beginning of the poverty
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:42.880]  And it made me mad, and I just know
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:44.880]  Most of those old women watch TV
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:46.880]  And think Obama really wanted to get them free healthcare
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:48.880]  I mean, it's the betrayal
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:50.880]  Of weak people
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:52.880]  Just really
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:54.880]  Makes me feel angry
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:00.880]  And maybe I was already emotional
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:02.880]  Going to my uncle's funeral
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:04.880]  But I just fundamentally got so upset
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:10.880]  When I see cops pulling over some poor woman
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:12.880]  With three kids in the back, writing them tickets
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:14.880]  The woman can't afford all the inspection
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:16.880]  Crap
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:18.880]  And I know they're going to write them tickets
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:20.880]  It's going to ruin that woman's life
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:22.880]  She won't even have a car to get to work
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:24.880]  She'll go on welfare, and that's what they want
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:26.880]  Not the cops, they're just there writing the ticket
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:28.880]  It's just such an evil system
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:32.880]  And I'm just not part of it
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:34.880]  I got my own problems
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:38.880]  But I'll tell you something right now
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:40.880]  I'm not going to screw little people
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:42.880]  It's never going to happen
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:44.880]  Because the day I ever even think like that
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:46.880]  Is the day that
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:48.880]  I don't need to be on the fish this planet
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:50.880]  I don't enjoy hurting people
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:52.880]  And our owners do
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:54.880]  We'll be right back with the final segment
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:56.880]  A couple phone calls and some key news

[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:36.880]  And we appreciate the enemy letting us know
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:38.880]  We're hurting them
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:40.880]  But we also appreciate you

[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:24.880]  And it's the animating contest
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:26.880]  That separates us from the animals
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:28.880]  Ladies and gentlemen

[02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:44.880]  We're going to have those guys on Sunday in studio
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:46.880]  Go ahead
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:48.880]  Okay, real quick Alex, I'll try to make this real fast
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:50.880]  There's a couple projects
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:52.880]  Just outside of AP Hill
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:54.880]  One of the facilities that's nearby
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:56.880]  Four pick it actually
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:58.880]  And there's a couple things I saw
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:00.880]  I noticed that they're doing
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:02.880]  One is they're building another thing
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:04.880]  That looks very similar to the AP Hill
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:06.880]  Training facility
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:08.880]  A $2.8 million construction project
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:10.880]  They're going to have buildings, alleys
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:12.880]  Athletic fields and all that
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:14.880]  Another project
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.880]  That they're working on
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:18.880]  I just found some articles on here
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:20.880]  It's a $461 million training facility
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:22.880]  For U.S. staff diplomats
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  Yeah, they're just building facilities
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:28.880]  Everywhere for the domestic takeover
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:30.880]  Yeah, I mean
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.880]  I thought it was very interesting that
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:34.880]  They spend that much money to train
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:36.880]  In official
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:38.880]  Well, they just need to take more old ladies
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:40.880]  Houses
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:42.880]  And then they can do it, I appreciate your call
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:44.880]  Great points, we'll look into it
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:46.880]  David and Alaska, go ahead

[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:06.880]  At the IETS
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:08.880]  It came to my attention that you guys
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:10.880]  Were kind of chatting and touching
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:12.880]  On some information about a mount
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:14.880]  What we refer to as mount training
[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:16.880]  Facility over at Camp June
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:18.880]  Yes
[02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:20.880]  Well, I just wanted to kind of call
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:22.880]  And give you guys some information on there
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:24.880]  About that facility, the facility's been
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:26.880]  Built to mock a very specific town
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:28.880]  It's in the northeast

[02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:38.880]  Stay there, don't hang up
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:40.880]  I'm going to come right back to David
