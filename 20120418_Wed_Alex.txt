[00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.573]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.334]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.096]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:11.697]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:13.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:17.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.543]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.843]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 18th day of April 2012.
[00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:45.446]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:49.868]  Bob Chapman, for many, many years, more than a decade, has been a frequent guest.
[00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.809]  The last few years, I've had him on every Friday.
[00:00:53.066 --> 00:01:01.329]  And I decided about a month ago to just shake the show up and stop having Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on just on a set date.
[00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.990]  It's better just to have him on every few weeks at random times whenever stuff's breaking.
[00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.710]  And he's got a lot to talk about today.
[00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.292]  He'll be on with us in the second hour and we'll open the phones up for Bob.
[00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.638]  We're also going to open the phones up and cover just a giant amount of news.
[00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:25.954]  By the way, guys, I forgot in my stack, will you print me the article from last night that Paul broke after the show about TSA on the Houston buses undercover?
[00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:28.984]  Thank you so much.
[00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:41.407]  I'm guessing it probably is in the stack, but I did the interview with Senator Rand Paul, and so I was unable to go through the whole stack, but that's fantastic.
[00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:52.189]  And yes, right up until Showtime here today, when we went live, I was taping an interview with Senator Rand Paul with big breaking news on so many fronts.
[00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.850]  This will be a news making interview.
[00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:03.028]  And I'm going to add some bells and whistles and clips to it, and we're going to air it for radio and TV viewers.
[00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:07.312]  This is a simulcast, internet, television, not just syndicated radio and XM Channel 166.
[00:02:07.312 --> 00:02:10.675]  We're going to stream the video as well.
[00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:15.780]  Coming up of my interview I just completed right before we went live.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.285]  It's kind of like a fire drill around here because we just don't normally do interviews taped right before the show.
[00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:26.607]  But the polls are so busy that that was the only time that the Senator could do that interview.
[00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:33.450]  It's an extensive 20-minute interview or so, and that is coming up.
[00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.091]  And yes, this is linked on Drudge.
[00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.192]  Fantastic, thank you so much, sir.
[00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:43.555]  Big Sis launches undercover TSA spies to ride Houston buses.
[00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:50.237]  So we are going to come back from break and we are going to launch into the news.
[00:02:50.237 --> 00:03:04.346]  And as I said, Bob Chapman's joining us live and then we'll have part of the third hour will be that big interview with the senator from Kentucky, Rand Paul, premiering right here on air.
[00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:23.835]  And if you're a radio listener and want to see the video, he was on the phone with me here in studio and the documents I'm going to be showing and video clips and things that are being edited into it, we will post that later this afternoon and also air it at PrisonPlanet.tv again tonight for InfoWars Nightly News viewers.
[00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:34.325]  It has been a tumultuous morning, to say the least, with a lot of other things going on around here.
[00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:38.646]  I have just got so many things happening, but it's a good place to be in.
[00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:45.228]  I know all of you are busy as well, and that's why we're honored and thankful that you are joining us here today.
[00:03:46.997 --> 00:04:01.610]  Again, normally, for 20 or 30 minutes right before showtime, I focus, go over the news, I've covered at night, that morning, what I've printed, what I've sent to the guys, the news they're bringing me, and I kind of get ready and then go on air, and then generally just disregard 90% of what I've already researched.
[00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.052]  I just kind of get angry before I get on air.
[00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:12.919]  It's almost like a ritual, not on purpose, but, you know, read the news, look at it all, prepare the giant feast of information, and then don't even cover one-tenth of it.
[00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:22.838]  Every time I do an interview, right up to show time, it breaks that.
[00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:26.725]  So this is probably going to be a very interesting, uh, breaks that train of thought.
[00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:30.474]  Which I think is a rut in many respects.
[00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:31.294]  So get ready.
[00:04:31.294 --> 00:04:34.416]  It's going to be a powerful transmission today.
[00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:35.256]  And your phone calls.
[00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:36.457]  I'll get that number out when we come back.
[00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:39.239]  We're going to take phone calls in this hour like we did yesterday.
[00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:44.661]  Didn't do a perfect job of getting a lot of calls in the first hour, but I'm moving in that direction.
[00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:46.622]  The old blockhead Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.223]  That's I.B.
[00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:48.823]  I.A.I.B.
[00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:50.524]  your captain.
[00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:53.226]  And a great old rogue at that.
[00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.126]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:54.867]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:56.668]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:02.048]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.048 --> 00:05:07.630]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.651]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:12.651 --> 00:05:18.212]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:22.893]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.274]  We're good to go!
[00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:57.394]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:57.394 --> 00:06:01.315]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:16.780]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.461]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:21.488 --> 00:06:34.239]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:41.525]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:52.570]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.491]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:59.613]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:00.313 --> 00:07:03.956]  Four, five, six, even seven dollars a gallon?
[00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:09.940]  According to fuel industry insiders and economic experts, those are the forecasted fuel prices, with no end in sight.

[00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:04.027]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:06.710]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:42.157]  Welcome, my friends, to the tip of the spear, the front lines in the fight for a free and prosperous constitutional civilization, the spirit of the American Revolution, of the Renaissance, of the awakening, of the enlightenment.
[00:08:43.577 --> 00:09:01.225]  1776 worldwide against the New World Order's false awakening or false enlightenment that actually is a black and wicked sunshine that robs men and women of their destinies and of their free will.
[00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:02.906]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:02.906 --> 00:09:05.967]  It is Wednesday, the 18th day of April, 2012.
[00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:11.223]  I said 2011 yesterday.
[00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:13.244]  These years just go by so quick.
[00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:14.806]  You know what happens to you?
[00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:17.128]  Sometimes you're writing a check and you put from the year before.
[00:09:17.128 --> 00:09:21.472]  What's really bad is when you write like a year from three years before on there.
[00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:24.074]  I'm like, it's not 2009.
[00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:24.895]  You guys ever do that?
[00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:25.435]  You ever done that?
[00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:31.200]  I mean, there's just so much to keep track of and that's what the social engineers are doing.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.022]  They're trying to get us off balance.
[00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.108]  Big news coming up.
[00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.209]  Then your phone calls.
[00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:41.554]  Then we have Bob Chapman, normally a regular Friday guest.
[00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:42.434]  I like to mix it up.
[00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:45.157]  We're not doing a Friday interview just at a set time anymore.
[00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:48.320]  We're going to have him as our roving correspondent and reporter.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.202]  He'll be joining us for an hour today.
[00:09:50.202 --> 00:09:58.030]  And then, an interview I taped right before I went live on the radio 10 minutes ago.
[00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:02.092]  An interview that I did with U.S.
[00:10:02.092 --> 00:10:09.276]  Senator from Kentucky, Rand Paul, and he's got breaking news on the U.N.
[00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:23.203]  globalist takeover of America, Agenda 21, the wars, the TSA, the police state, Obama, the Buffett rule.
[00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:27.386]  We covered it all with some breaking information
[00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:33.840]  That believe me, you're not going to want to miss dealing with impeachment of Obama.
[00:10:34.755 --> 00:10:38.937]  And that move, it's all coming up in the third hour.
[00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:42.059]  We will premiere right here on the radio.
[00:10:42.059 --> 00:11:01.750]  Blasting out on XM Channel 166, on over 100 AM and FM affiliates, on WWCR Global Shortwave, and number one on talk radio podcasting systems, number one in talk radio on Roku and Boxee, Shoutcast, every streaming system and metric out there.
[00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:14.222]  Number one, number one, number one, and I'm not bragging that, oh, Alex Jones is number one, InfoWars is number one, my listeners are part of the system that's number one.
[00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:21.148]  It's that freedom is popular and getting more popular by the millisecond.
[00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.451]  Liberty is being rediscovered.
[00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:36.440]  The weapons of information, the weapons of enlightenment, the power of the pen, far more mighty than the sword or a tommy gun or a hand grenade.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:47.182]  The fire that burns in the minds of men is igniting everywhere and I have come to light brush fires in the minds of men.
[00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:53.744]  I have come with the fire in the night to raise the alarm
[00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:01.041]  Oneth by land, twoth by sea, the banksters are coming.
[00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:05.622]  And we're going to identify them and their systems of control and their criminal acts.
[00:12:05.622 --> 00:12:07.983]  That's why they're rushing to complete their tyranny.
[00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:11.345]  That's why they're bringing in martial law incrementally.
[00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:20.228]  It's because they know the sleeping giant that is our republic and that is humanity is rising!
[00:12:24.517 --> 00:12:32.658]  Let me give you just a smattering of the news that we're going to go over today and hit some of our top stories before I give the number out and take your calls.
[00:12:32.658 --> 00:12:45.060]  This little tidbit right here in my hot, little, liberty-loving hands.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:53.302]  Big Sis launches undercover TSA spies to ride Houston buses.
[00:12:55.427 --> 00:13:01.771]  I told you nine plus years ago this was happening, not because I'm smart.
[00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:23.242]  While other people are hanging out at the bar, or playing pool, or going to the NFL games, or hockey games, or trying to pick chicks up, I discovered a plan for world government by watching C-SPAN and reading books, and I saw in early 2002
[00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:36.828]  Right as Homeland Security was getting cabinet position and congressional funding, I saw Governor Ridge lay out the entire plan.
[00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:51.575]  When people call me a fear monger, or people say I'm making stuff up, and it all comes true, and I'm still bad though, for being right, people are like, or now they're not saying I'm a fear monger, they're saying he's gotta be an insider.
[00:13:51.575 --> 00:13:52.736]  How does he know all this?
[00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:53.936]  How did he predict it?
[00:13:53.936 --> 00:13:58.960]  I don't know, the Rand Corporation said we need giant terror attacks instead of a police state and take everybody's liberties.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.221]  PNAC wrote that before 9-11.
[00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:04.103]  I knew the Feds had bombed the World Trade Center before.
[00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:09.266]  I saw him introducing bin Laden on the air, saying he's about to get you when he attacks, give your rights up.
[00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.288]  I talked to military sources six months before 9-11.
[00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:14.870]  They were massing around Afghanistan and were about to invade.
[00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:20.413]  And I went, they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden, who's known CIA.
[00:14:20.413 --> 00:14:20.974]  And they did it!
[00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:27.216]  On radio and TV, and people haven't even dug up the radio shows.
[00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:30.098]  I did three-hour radio shows, day and night.
[00:14:30.098 --> 00:14:35.481]  I had a nighttime show then, going into even more detail than a few minutes from my AXS show.
[00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:39.504]  People then say, oh, well, that really wasn't on his show, really?
[00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.646]  That's Jimmy Vaughn, blues legend.
[00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:42.947]  You know Stevie Ray Vaughn's brother?
[00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:50.914]  He was watching my show the day I live, July 25th, did two hours on how they were going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:53.576]  They ought to have him in here just to swear to that on air.
[00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.718]  People don't even believe that.
[00:14:56.718 --> 00:14:57.579]  But it's all on record.
[00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:07.683]  Check somebody's got it, because I know that same day and right around that in July, even months before that actually, I was saying get ready for it.
[00:15:07.683 --> 00:15:11.205]  Again, so I guess in a way I am smart, but only because I'm paying attention.
[00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.546]  All of you are smart.
[00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:23.152]  If you study football, or you study auto mechanic work, or you study gold mining, or you study being an arborist, you're going to get good at it.
[00:15:23.152 --> 00:15:26.034]  Some people might get better than you, but you're going to get good at it.
[00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:36.541]  I mean, they can teach mentally retarded people to be smarter in many cases than the average person with serious training or better at sports or things.
[00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:43.189]  You know, it's just, it's how much training and dedication is put in and research.
[00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:47.274]  But on the point of knowing about the martial law rollout plan,
[00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:59.088]  Honey, if you're a new viewer out there, ladies or others, and find this stuff frightening and don't want to believe it, I'm going to beg you to just go research what I'm saying.
[00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:00.569]  But see, most people won't do that.
[00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:05.310]  They'll just watch it come true and go, wow, that guy is a prophet.
[00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.510]  No, I'm not.
[00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:12.412]  Governor Ridge said to have a job, you're going to get Homeland Security approval.
[00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:14.853]  TSA will train and run all the police.
[00:16:16.087 --> 00:16:22.390]  Through threat fusion centers and the feds with a magic wand will tell police they're now allowed to grow up your genitals.
[00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.291]  They're now allowed to secretly arrest you.
[00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:27.292]  They're going to be a medical tyranny for forced inoculations.
[00:16:27.292 --> 00:16:32.895]  Part of the emergency systems that they tried to pass but couldn't in 2002.
[00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:36.317]  So they just went ahead and did it executively.
[00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:40.380]  And that's the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:47.087]  And they're preparing for forced inoculations, mass arrest, riot control, and now all this is admitted!
[00:16:47.087 --> 00:16:57.257]  But then they go on CNN and Fox and say there's nothing to it, there's no FEMA camps, when the legislation is there to expand what's already been built, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:16:57.257 --> 00:16:58.438]  Jesse Ventura goes in,
[00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:01.164]  Talks to the author of the bill.
[00:17:01.164 --> 00:17:02.565]  The bill admits it's already set up.
[00:17:02.565 --> 00:17:06.045]  They just want to fund it and make it national level and open.
[00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:06.726]  Further fund it.
[00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.166]  It's the old military bases.
[00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:10.286]  That's the camps.
[00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:16.648]  And we're going to have the biggest prison population in the world, but oh, you're a conspiracy theorist to think it's a serious problem.
[00:17:16.648 --> 00:17:19.408]  And he tells Governor Venturi, he goes, none of that exists.
[00:17:19.408 --> 00:17:20.228]  There's no such bill.
[00:17:20.228 --> 00:17:20.748]  What do you believe in?
[00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:21.329]  Spacemen?
[00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.649]  Aliens going to get you?
[00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:23.649]  Green men going to come down?
[00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:27.310]  And the governor looks at him and says, I'm talking about green men.
[00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:36.592]  And the guy looks at him like a cartoon character and goes, in a little Nelly thing, he goes, there's no such a bill.
[00:17:36.592 --> 00:17:41.154]  And Ventura really said, told me personally, he started freaking out at that point.
[00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:41.954]  You see it on tape.
[00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:43.634]  It's such a powerful exchange.
[00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:48.296]  That's why Homeland Security threatened Time Warner until they pulled that episode.
[00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:51.037]  Aired once, they remotely erased it off DVRs.
[00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.938]  They normally air them 50 plus times.
[00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:55.238]  All sorts of stuff happened, folks.
[00:17:56.414 --> 00:17:57.574]  And he goes, well, I have the bill right here.
[00:17:57.574 --> 00:18:01.995]  And he goes, oh, I declare that bill.
[00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:06.276]  Oh, I do remember that bill now.
[00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:08.177]  He literally talks like that.
[00:18:08.177 --> 00:18:15.938]  This affected fake Georgia accent in Tennessee.
[00:18:15.938 --> 00:18:18.419]  Oh, I do remember that bill.
[00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:21.780]  And he goes, ah.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.360]  They think you're idiots.
[00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.472]  Glenn Beck says for a month the camps are really going to expose it.
[00:18:27.472 --> 00:18:32.776]  I predicted he'd go on air and say it was all fake and predicted the day of so it wouldn't affect his show.
[00:18:32.776 --> 00:18:37.499]  I didn't want to show what he would do and have him copy it and then spoil my research.
[00:18:37.499 --> 00:18:38.860]  But I told the whole crew.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.404]  I said he'll show these famous debunked FEMA camp videos of the railway stations and stuff and not all the real ones.
[00:18:44.404 --> 00:18:51.530]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act, the Emergency Power Systems, the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:18:52.911 --> 00:18:54.132]  He's not going to go with those.
[00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:56.994]  I'd send him packets of all the info, hoping.
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:57.534]  And I said, no.
[00:18:57.534 --> 00:19:00.537]  I'd send him the real info.
[00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:01.898]  And I said, they've got researchers they know.
[00:19:01.898 --> 00:19:03.019]  I said, they're going to go with this.
[00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:11.606]  And the exact production that I said that day, hours before it aired, that he would betray and say they didn't exist and show the debunking.
[00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:13.107]  I didn't know Popular Mechanics would be involved.
[00:19:13.107 --> 00:19:13.668]  They popped up.
[00:19:15.505 --> 00:19:16.606]  It was exact.
[00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:20.350]  So I guess in a way I am actually able to absolutely document what they're going to do.
[00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.852]  But that's from studying them.
[00:19:21.852 --> 00:19:25.255]  The point is, on Homeland Security, I'm going to come back and cover this.
[00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:27.938]  They said to have a job, you'll get Homeland Security approval.
[00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:31.062]  They will turn your face scan and thumbprint off, even if you're paying cash.
[00:19:31.062 --> 00:19:32.303]  You won't be allowed to buy food.
[00:19:32.683 --> 00:19:33.323]  This has been announced.
[00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:33.944]  He said it on C-SPAN.
[00:19:33.944 --> 00:19:40.546]  They're going to have checkpoints everywhere, forced inoculations, giant property taxes meant to bankrupt you.
[00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:42.246]  They're going to take everything.
[00:19:42.246 --> 00:19:50.369]  Armed giant war wags, checkpoints, living hell, Soviet red terror in America.
[00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:52.730]  That's basically what they're setting up.
[00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.450]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.010]  Stay with us.
[00:19:54.010 --> 00:20:00.993]  I'm going to get into the Stasi spies spying on you in America, on the streets, out of their jurisdiction, federal spies.
[00:20:01.613 --> 00:20:08.196]  Over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:25.923]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:20:25.923 --> 00:20:30.005]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:32.025]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:40.127]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:22:38.584 --> 00:22:39.385]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:45.649]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:46.510]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:07.521]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:09.665]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:30.412 --> 00:24:33.078]  We are back live.
[00:24:33.078 --> 00:24:34.642]  Look, it's so simple.
[00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:38.192]  We saw the training for martial law.
[00:24:38.192 --> 00:24:41.233]  We witnessed the military training to take our guns.
[00:24:41.233 --> 00:24:57.037]  Head emergency managers in major cities and towns and police chiefs came on my show and said, the military came with bags of hundreds of thousands of dollars to turn me into a covert domestic spy against America.
[00:24:57.037 --> 00:25:01.478]  That was the chief of police of San Antonio, Ale Philippus.
[00:25:01.478 --> 00:25:02.619]  It's in my film Police State 2000.
[00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:10.351]  I interviewed Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, Vietnam veteran, Army Intelligence.
[00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:13.034]  He said they're doing gun confiscation drills.
[00:25:13.034 --> 00:25:15.457]  They told him this.
[00:25:15.457 --> 00:25:20.023]  That was Clinton testing to see if he could get martial law going.
[00:25:20.023 --> 00:25:22.045]  And people are like, oh, well it didn't happen.
[00:25:22.045 --> 00:25:23.787]  Yeah, because we exposed it.
[00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.632]  The militia exposed it.
[00:25:26.632 --> 00:25:28.674]  People talked about it.
[00:25:28.674 --> 00:25:34.980]  So then they went into this strategy under Bush and now Obama of just normalizing, hey, there's checkpoints.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:42.007]  Yeah, there are spies in restaurants and bus stops and train terminals and at the mall listening to you.
[00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:45.530]  I mean, they hired Marcus Wolf.
[00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.134]  When I first heard they'd hired Marcus Wolf in 2002, I didn't believe it.
[00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:53.563]  I saw the news articles, I thought, this is a hoax.
[00:25:53.563 --> 00:26:19.422]  So I went and found the federal funding of over a million dollars a year to pay Marcus Wolff, the former head of the East German Stasi, the famous lives of others, you know, spy chief, where they had like one out of 20 people was a spy, spies everywhere, listening to everyone, hidden microphones in your house.
[00:26:19.422 --> 00:26:20.283]  It's way past that.
[00:26:21.758 --> 00:26:33.545]  And they hired him, and then I'm watching C-SPAN for two hours, and I taped it back then on VHS, and it's just, we literally have a whole warehouse full of the crud I've taped, and I don't have the money or time to go through it all, but you can now search C-SPAN.
[00:26:33.545 --> 00:26:41.269]  Just go to Governor Ridge meetings from when he was first in there with corporate councils.
[00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:47.953]  This meeting was these big, giant tables all connected in a big rectangle with all these corporate leaders, and he was saying,
[00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:57.561]  For security and for infrastructure protection and InfraGard, you're all going to be executives with Homeland Security, with security clearances.
[00:26:57.561 --> 00:27:03.527]  You're going to have to have Homeland Security to have a job, first at security locations, then at other targets, and then everywhere.
[00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:09.572]  And then we're going to move out into transportation, out of the airports, bus stations, trains, and finally to the streets.
[00:27:09.572 --> 00:27:14.196]  We're going to certify the local police and work with them and fund them and be over them.
[00:27:15.313 --> 00:27:23.097]  And I'm just seeing him admit it, kind of like General Petraeus a month ago saying, yeah, all your new appliances spy on you and it's no big deal.
[00:27:23.097 --> 00:27:24.237]  There's no more Fourth Amendment.
[00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:26.799]  It's just throwing it in your face.
[00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:41.486]  But he was at a CIA In-Q-Tel meeting, which is the CIA's public funding arm into DARPA-type systems to fund private groups so they can then give new government R&D developments to their buddies so they can make money.
[00:27:43.066 --> 00:27:54.688]  I mean, sometimes they'll randomly pick some low-level tech or engineer and give them, you know, a hundred-plus-million-dollar contract and say they own something, and then that person fences the money out to them.
[00:27:54.688 --> 00:28:01.829]  The point is, the mafia that's taken over is just in our face.
[00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:04.270]  They are squatting on us.
[00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:10.931]  I remember one time I was like 11 years old, and this bully flunked like three or four grades, a lot bigger than me.
[00:28:12.072 --> 00:28:24.657]  I'm fighting back, he beats me up, he wrestles me down, he sits on my chest and on my arms, and starts punching me in the nose, not even that hard, just enjoying it while my nose was bleeding, and spitting.
[00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:30.719]  And I found that energy of pure anger and just exploded, threw him off me, stomped him.
[00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:34.060]  And that was the beginning of finding true rage power.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.842]  But the point is that that's what they're doing to us, is they are sitting on us, and that's what it feels like.
[00:28:40.502 --> 00:28:41.102]  How you like that?
[00:28:41.102 --> 00:28:51.027]  How you like them just normally going and people laughing and big old spit globs going right in my eye, right in my face.
[00:28:51.027 --> 00:28:55.929]  And then that click of I am getting him off of me and I am going to hurt him bad.
[00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:13.413]  Finding your heart is what it's called, and America needs to find its heart in the info war and get really aggressive with banner hangs, signs, whatever you gotta do!
[00:29:14.639 --> 00:29:18.800]  Founding fathers painted the enemy's, you know, government buildings and things.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.761]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:23.282]  Because, you know, the New Orleans is about a hundred times worse than the British Redcoats.
[00:29:23.282 --> 00:29:25.443]  Certainly don't get aggressive with these tyrants.
[00:29:25.443 --> 00:29:30.084]  Do whatever you got to so everybody sees the rebellion everywhere in the Info War.
[00:29:30.084 --> 00:29:36.406]  When we come back, Big Sis launches undercover TSA spies to ride Houston buses and to put people on list.
[00:29:36.406 --> 00:29:39.487]  Feds to watch for suspicious behavior, political speech.
[00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:40.568]  Look at how they're going after
[00:29:41.701 --> 00:29:44.926]  Ted Nugent right now, by the way, he's fired back.
[00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:47.370]  This is so creepy.
[00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.074]  It's meant to intimidate us.
[00:29:50.074 --> 00:29:51.476]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:54.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.442]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:02.442 --> 00:31:04.803]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:04.803 --> 00:31:07.925]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.925 --> 00:31:12.747]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:19.131]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:30.817]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:30.817 --> 00:31:35.300]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:41.563]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:41.563 --> 00:31:42.704]  Now that's results.
[00:31:43.124 --> 00:31:55.641]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:31:58.204 --> 00:31:59.446]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:32:01.206 --> 00:32:07.869]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:07.869 --> 00:32:13.012]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:21.736]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:25.799]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:28.140]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:34.824]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:32:34.824 --> 00:32:38.645]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:39.885]  Others don't.
[00:32:39.885 --> 00:32:42.026]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.826]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:43.826 --> 00:32:46.707]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:46.707 --> 00:32:53.328]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:53.328 --> 00:32:56.029]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:58.390]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.270]  Others don't.
[00:33:11.454 --> 00:33:21.723]  I looked it up last night.
[00:33:21.723 --> 00:33:33.573]  There have been over 100 fake FBI stings where the FBI profiles low-grade morons, generally mildly retarded, ADIQ-type people.
[00:33:36.463 --> 00:33:42.405]  On welfare, out of the prison system, and gets them to talk about doing violence.
[00:33:42.405 --> 00:33:45.706]  They've done it with moron Ku Klux Klan people.
[00:33:45.706 --> 00:33:56.608]  Even Texas Monthly gave the FBI a Bumsteer Award for finding these literal, total trash drunks who couldn't even get out of the house but once or twice a week.
[00:33:56.608 --> 00:34:03.650]  And the FBI would give them cameras and would give them money and tell them as their Klan leader, I will give you $100,000 when you bomb something.
[00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:10.374]  And then they would give them $10,000 just to talk about it.
[00:34:10.374 --> 00:34:21.456]  And these drunks were so stupid, so trashy, so bad, because the tapes got released, the transcripts, where they couldn't even get them outside and then have to offer them tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:34:21.456 --> 00:34:27.798]  And they were so drunk, the FBI agent and the informant, they had both of them in there with this case up in Fort Worth.
[00:34:27.798 --> 00:34:29.818]  It's a famous case, you can look it up.
[00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:35.880]  That they had to get them outside and they were too drunk to light black powder bottle bombs.
[00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:49.224]  So they went out and found poor people living in a trailer, totally drunk, the description, you know, no teeth.
[00:34:50.848 --> 00:34:56.970]  And the indictment read they would wage war, overthrow the Capitol, and shoot everyone in the Capitol.
[00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.991]  And then they were going to blow up chemical plants and murder everyone.
[00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:03.952]  And I remember when it was on the news, this is like 12 years ago, this one case.
[00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:11.595]  It was a giant nationwide Klan operation that was going to blow up military bases, bomb D.C., blow up chemical plants.
[00:35:11.595 --> 00:35:14.696]  We've got to watch farmers now with ammonium nitrate because of this.
[00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:17.737]  It was going to be a new Oklahoma City.
[00:35:18.928 --> 00:35:20.990]  It appears later in the court it came out.
[00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.972]  These people didn't know which day of the week it was.
[00:35:23.972 --> 00:35:31.479]  And since then, there has been over a hundred instances with just Muslims alone.
[00:35:31.479 --> 00:35:35.382]  Where they go, the FBI is the leader of the group, founds it.
[00:35:35.382 --> 00:35:37.103]  Sometimes they can't even find Muslims.
[00:35:37.103 --> 00:35:40.246]  So in one case, remember down in Florida, Miami?
[00:35:40.246 --> 00:35:44.730]  They found black street kids who were, quote, Rastafarians.
[00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.410]  They were potheads.
[00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.091]  They weren't even from
[00:35:49.269 --> 00:35:52.291]  Jamaica or other places like that.
[00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.412]  They weren't from the Caribbean.
[00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:54.292]  They weren't from Belize.
[00:35:54.292 --> 00:35:55.673]  They weren't from down there.
[00:35:55.673 --> 00:35:57.574]  And they were they were street kids on welfare.
[00:35:57.574 --> 00:35:59.415]  Most of them didn't even have parents.
[00:35:59.415 --> 00:36:00.516]  The youngest was 13.
[00:36:00.516 --> 00:36:01.957]  The oldest was like 18.
[00:36:01.957 --> 00:36:02.917]  You can look up this case.
[00:36:02.917 --> 00:36:03.498]  It was 2006.
[00:36:03.498 --> 00:36:07.420]  And it was they planned jihadists to wage war.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.741]  They weren't even Muslims.
[00:36:08.741 --> 00:36:10.442]  But they said jihadists.
[00:36:10.442 --> 00:36:12.023]  And again, the same story.
[00:36:12.023 --> 00:36:13.084]  The FBI agent.
[00:36:13.684 --> 00:36:23.070]  In a warehouse he rented them for a year, slowly would say I'll give you 10,000, 20,000 more to go film a federal building and to wear a camo outfit and shoot a video.
[00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.133]  And it's on the tapes like, oh, come on, man, I don't want to attack anybody.
[00:36:27.133 --> 00:36:29.434]  You got to do it for Allah.
[00:36:29.434 --> 00:36:30.535]  But we're not Muslims.
[00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:33.417]  We're Christians.
[00:36:33.417 --> 00:36:35.238]  Didn't matter.
[00:36:35.238 --> 00:36:36.779]  So, so, I mean, listen, I.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:47.206]  Could go out in a day, forget six months or a year, and find crazy homeless people who are mentally ill, drugged out of their minds, don't even know who they are.
[00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:49.668]  Sometimes they do, they just find schizophrenics and do this.
[00:36:49.668 --> 00:36:51.189]  I, hypothetically, wouldn't do this.
[00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:55.071]  They'll cut, they'll edit that out and say I'm planning this.
[00:36:55.071 --> 00:37:02.416]  I could go out and in 24 hours promise, take a homeless person out to dinner, give them $10,000 and promise them $10,000 more.
[00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:09.137]  If they would say on tape that they're going to blow up buildings and kill people.
[00:37:09.137 --> 00:37:12.139]  I could then go put that out on YouTube.
[00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:24.566]  But see what the FBI would first do is they get that homeless person an apartment, act like they're their friends, convince them to upload it to YouTube, because it wouldn't be convincing if it was 24 hours, I shot the video and then uploaded it on some dummy account.
[00:37:24.566 --> 00:37:25.806]  They'd say, how did they do that?
[00:37:25.806 --> 00:37:26.987]  The jury would at least ask that.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.105]  See, they want to create the synthetic view that there's terrorism and a threat out there.
[00:37:32.105 --> 00:37:33.286]  This is how this works.
[00:37:33.286 --> 00:37:37.331]  But I could do this in less than 24 hours.
[00:37:37.331 --> 00:37:44.760]  Start waving $10,000 in front of some... I would profile some out-of-their-mind, semi-schizophrenic person.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.623]  Get him, dress him up, clean him up.
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:37:49.729]  Go check them into a hotel.
[00:37:49.729 --> 00:37:51.571]  They do this sometimes when they need a quick one.
[00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:52.974]  I shouldn't be telling the FBI how to do this.
[00:37:52.974 --> 00:37:55.978]  It's only the senior terrorist guys that know how to do this.
[00:37:55.978 --> 00:38:01.046]  The low-level guys are busy, you know, getting cats out of trees and things.
[00:38:01.046 --> 00:38:02.689]  The quick way to do it is you go check them into a...
[00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:09.208]  You know, 24-hour motel, you know, one of those places, rundown areas.
[00:38:09.208 --> 00:38:13.930]  Check them in for a few days, get them there, get them cleaned up, more presentable.
[00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.611]  Tell them, I'll give you another thousand, just write up how you're going to do it.
[00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:19.013]  They'll be like, alright, whatever you want.
[00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:22.675]  Even easier than getting a drunk to do it, you get a crackhead.
[00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:24.256]  Oh, that's even quicker.
[00:38:24.256 --> 00:38:28.298]  But see, it's not as believable when it comes out it's a crackhead on the news.
[00:38:28.298 --> 00:38:33.721]  So you want to find some old vet who's pickled their brain with alcohol, semi-crazy,
[00:38:35.074 --> 00:38:36.575]  That's how you do it.
[00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:37.475]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:39.996]  I want to give the number out and go to your calls.
[00:38:39.996 --> 00:38:41.356]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:38:41.356 --> 00:38:41.416]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:47.318]  It's first-time callers again, by the way, because I want to give new people a chance to get on air and sit on hold.
[00:38:47.318 --> 00:38:49.859]  I'm trying to go to the calls.
[00:38:49.859 --> 00:38:49.899]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:58.427 --> 00:38:59.508]  So I went and just reviewed.
[00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:00.970]  It was over a hundred.
[00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:05.635]  I spent a few hours last night and even cracked open some Bluebell orange swirl ice cream.
[00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:06.737]  Shouldn't have done it.
[00:39:06.737 --> 00:39:09.420]  Had a pint of that and boy was it good.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.741]  But that's not product placement.
[00:39:10.741 --> 00:39:14.766]  Bluebell's not paying me to be a sponsor, though I would gladly be a sponsor for Bluebell.
[00:39:14.766 --> 00:39:16.448]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:19.611]  I sure bought enough of it over the years.
[00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:34.283]  Point is, I did my research and it was just, it was case after case where they had to admit in court, even mainstream news had to admit, the FBI whole cloth goes out and finds low-grade morons and sets them up.
[00:39:34.283 --> 00:39:42.590]  Now, because of the non-existent threat, no bombings of buses, no bombings of trains, no nothing but the continual fake people they bust,
[00:39:44.229 --> 00:39:49.294]  We're now told the TSA is going to be listening to what you're saying in plain clothes.
[00:39:49.294 --> 00:39:51.636]  You know, the same people at the airports.
[00:39:53.291 --> 00:40:07.983]  I can talk about it because Dave Mustaine did do a tweet about it, but soon he's going to come on air and tell the full story of what happened to his daughter Electra, so sweet, when he and his wife Pam and his daughter Electra were visiting and what happened there.
[00:40:07.983 --> 00:40:17.671]  There's another famous movie star actress who talked about how she was singled out by a woman to be groped and clearly the woman was enjoying it.
[00:40:17.671 --> 00:40:21.795]  Oh yeah, when you're sitting there and they're clearly enjoying it.
[00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:25.817]  Because I've gone to pat down one time to see what they would do.
[00:40:25.817 --> 00:40:32.540]  And no exaggeration, he first told me he was a listener, began smacking his lips.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.922]  He either enjoyed the power over me or he was enjoying it the other way.
[00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:40.323]  And I was wearing a tight t-shirt.
[00:40:40.323 --> 00:40:47.467]  I've never had a man, I've been to the medical doctor, they've never rubbed on my chest and gone, this won't take too long.
[00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.452]  And I'm just going, whoa, don't touch me down there.
[00:40:52.452 --> 00:40:53.753]  I'm going to sue you.
[00:40:53.753 --> 00:40:55.815]  He's like, I just do what I have to.
[00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:58.017]  And he looked up at me, his little twinkle eyes.
[00:40:58.017 --> 00:41:03.582]  And he said, I have administrative rights and smiled at me.
[00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:07.825]  And I was just like, wow.
[00:41:07.825 --> 00:41:09.907]  Actually recorded it all, but it's just so embarrassing.
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.949]  I've never even aired it.
[00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:17.133]  I'm listening to the recording of it because my iPhone's like over here in the box, like five feet away and you can boost it and hear it.
[00:41:17.133 --> 00:41:17.914]  And it's, it's, it's,
[00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:28.729]  I can lie to myself and say I went through a partial pat-down because I was doing a test and that was kind of my rationale.
[00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:29.669]  It's 9 a.m.
[00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:31.510]  I've been up till 4 a.m.
[00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.693]  with Sean Stone and Tyrell Ventura.
[00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:38.314]  Yes, I did have a couple of toddies when I was out there.
[00:41:38.314 --> 00:41:39.755]  I shouldn't have.
[00:41:39.755 --> 00:41:44.217]  And night caps, I guess they call them.
[00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:47.759]  And I'm sitting there and I just want to get on the plane, go to sleep.
[00:41:47.759 --> 00:41:48.380]  I want to get home.
[00:41:51.305 --> 00:41:52.545]  Of course, the adventure didn't end there.
[00:41:52.545 --> 00:41:55.066]  Then they had the dead soldier on the plane and all of that.
[00:41:55.066 --> 00:41:57.447]  It was wild.
[00:41:57.447 --> 00:42:02.429]  And I just was like, I did say, just do not touch my genitals.
[00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:05.070]  Doctors have touched them a few times, you know, in physicals.
[00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.791]  I just, I can't handle it.
[00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:15.693]  And he didn't, he didn't do it because I stopped after I went through and watched him grabbing men's genitals, grabbing women's genitals.
[00:42:15.693 --> 00:42:17.734]  They go right at the women's breasts, grab them.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:25.885]  I mean, again, if my wife isn't in... We've all had girlfriends, wives, you know, women.
[00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:29.047]  If your wife isn't expecting it, she's there making coffee at 6 a.m.
[00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:31.929]  and you come up behind her and, you know, hug her.
[00:42:31.929 --> 00:42:33.691]  Sometimes they like it, sometimes they don't.
[00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:36.613]  You know, this is a big deal being touched.
[00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:40.286]  And it's such a violation.
[00:42:40.286 --> 00:42:46.569]  That's why they've had combat veterans, who are airline pilots, who can't fly and go and throw up.
[00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:48.350]  Because it's not just like cops.
[00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.231]  You've seen cops do frisking.
[00:42:50.231 --> 00:42:52.833]  There's like, okay, checking, because you're arrested.
[00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:55.434]  And they're like, you know, actually looking for a weapon.
[00:42:55.434 --> 00:42:57.895]  They can see there's not one in your pants, whatever.
[00:42:57.895 --> 00:42:59.496]  They'll search you for drugs at the jail.
[00:42:59.496 --> 00:43:01.617]  They're not wanting to go in your pants, most of them.
[00:43:02.264 --> 00:43:04.525]  With the TSA, I mean, hot blonde going through.
[00:43:04.525 --> 00:43:05.566]  I'm like, watch this.
[00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:06.646]  I've flown with Dew and Aaron.
[00:43:06.646 --> 00:43:07.487]  I'm like, watch this.
[00:43:07.487 --> 00:43:08.447]  She's smoking.
[00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:09.628]  She's getting a full one.
[00:43:09.628 --> 00:43:13.229]  You see the predator manager run up the potbelly.
[00:43:13.229 --> 00:43:16.191]  Always got the little weird stubble, you know, the pervert thing.
[00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:17.111]  It's like, get her over here.
[00:43:17.111 --> 00:43:29.677]  Even after the body scan, they're just like, men are just going, and it is, I mean, they've even had TSA come up with naked body scans of men and women, movie stars, and ask them to sign it and had women hit on the men and say, I want a date.
[00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:30.558]  They've had to settle.
[00:43:31.198 --> 00:43:31.598]  For this.
[00:43:31.598 --> 00:43:35.281]  They've had to settle lawsuits where they openly ask him out for dates.
[00:43:35.281 --> 00:43:39.724]  I just gotta say, you are totally gorgeous.
[00:43:39.724 --> 00:43:41.985]  As the woman's crying, as they're grabbing their breast.
[00:43:41.985 --> 00:43:44.146]  I mean, this is America.
[00:43:44.146 --> 00:43:46.828]  And I'm like, watch that, that woman is gorgeous, you know she's getting it.
[00:43:46.828 --> 00:43:47.989]  And he's like, yep, here it is.
[00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:50.871]  And they're like, get over here, hottie, oh yeah.
[00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:59.226]  And again, for a normal man, everything about being with your wife, with a woman you love, is about the excitement.
[00:43:59.226 --> 00:44:01.787]  The more excited they are, the better it is.
[00:44:01.787 --> 00:44:02.968]  Sorry folks, I don't want to hear this.
[00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:04.509]  This is real life.
[00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:06.951]  That's the excitement of sex.
[00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:16.417]  I'm the opposite of someone, and there are people who like to take it, who like to be mean, opposite of Alex Jones.
[00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:16.657]  Okay?
[00:44:19.159 --> 00:44:20.679]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:26.901]  So it's like, wow, you get paid 20 bucks an hour and get to grope 14-year-old girls?
[00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:37.424]  And Dave said, that's it, I don't even have the money, but he goes, I'm gonna have to start getting my own private jet, because I cannot, and I go, oh, I said, Dave, you know, they're coming to the private jets now.
[00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:39.784]  Yeah, there's the top blonde model.
[00:44:39.784 --> 00:44:46.526]  We've got the article on screen, and she said, the female security guard, there was no doubt about her sexual orientation, and she enjoyed it.
[00:44:47.622 --> 00:44:47.762]  Let's
[00:45:09.281 --> 00:45:09.761]  Back in
[00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:28.813]  This is after we flew to New Orleans.
[00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:34.216]  Ventura was so angry, he was in a rage for weeks.
[00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:37.378]  And that's then when he told me, a controlled rage, he said, that's it, I'm suing.
[00:45:37.378 --> 00:45:39.299]  I figured out why I'm so mad at everybody.
[00:45:39.299 --> 00:45:40.420]  Ventura's real, folks.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.520]  He's not a tough guy.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.402]  He is actually an aggressive guy.
[00:45:43.402 --> 00:45:49.005]  And so we're talking about the TSA, and I'm like, we can fight it, we can save America.
[00:45:49.005 --> 00:45:50.286]  And he's like, what are you going to do?
[00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:51.587]  What are you going to do?
[00:45:51.587 --> 00:45:53.789]  This country's a bunch of people that want to be slaves.
[00:45:53.789 --> 00:45:54.090]  Ah!
[00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:59.315]  And we're almost in a fight in the taxi and the guy's like, whoa, whoa.
[00:45:59.315 --> 00:46:00.997]  Because he was so angry.
[00:46:00.997 --> 00:46:01.978]  People were trying to, oh my.
[00:46:04.446 --> 00:46:09.910]  Because, I mean, I was watching him going... It was just like the South Park episode.
[00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.871]  It was literally the women doing this to Ventura.
[00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:16.514]  Because it was women doing it there at the Atlanta airport.
[00:46:16.514 --> 00:46:17.795]  They'll have different sex to it.
[00:46:17.795 --> 00:46:19.356]  We're going, oh yeah!
[00:46:19.356 --> 00:46:23.299]  That's Ventura!
[00:46:23.299 --> 00:46:27.622]  It was just like the, let me look inside you!
[00:46:27.622 --> 00:46:30.624]  I mean, it was exactly out of the South Park episode.
[00:46:33.203 --> 00:46:36.305]  And there were TSA people walking around taking photos of Ventura.
[00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:39.586]  And he's not, he's there like five minutes where they're just going all over him.
[00:46:39.586 --> 00:46:43.128]  And he's just going, oh, oh, this country.
[00:46:43.128 --> 00:46:48.131]  And because it built it for like a minute, he's letting them rub all over him.
[00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:49.231]  They go over to his chest.
[00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:51.933]  They, they go down his legs.
[00:46:51.933 --> 00:46:53.754]  Then they go up to his genitals.
[00:46:53.754 --> 00:46:54.474]  Then they go.
[00:46:54.474 --> 00:46:56.615]  And then when they start like going, well, let's see what's in there.
[00:46:56.615 --> 00:46:58.036]  He was just like, ah,
[00:47:00.029 --> 00:47:01.690]  And I'm taking photos.
[00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.152]  We go get something to eat, because the plane's delayed.
[00:47:04.152 --> 00:47:05.433]  And he goes, erase them!
[00:47:05.433 --> 00:47:10.297]  And I go, but you might need them if you're going to sue for this court thing, because he was already talking about it then.
[00:47:10.297 --> 00:47:14.521]  Don't tell anyone, Alex, I'm going to sue them.
[00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:17.503]  And if a man can't get a day in court, I just might leave this country.
[00:47:17.503 --> 00:47:18.564]  I tell you, I can't believe it.
[00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:19.805]  It's out of East Germany.
[00:47:19.805 --> 00:47:22.007]  I just... Let me see the phone.
[00:47:22.007 --> 00:47:22.988]  Okay, erase them.
[00:47:22.988 --> 00:47:23.688]  I believe you.
[00:47:23.688 --> 00:47:24.449]  I believe you erased them.
[00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:25.770]  Good, good.
[00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.971]  Just don't talk about this for now.
[00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:27.592]  It's embarrassing.
[00:47:28.439 --> 00:47:29.480]  Well, you know what?
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.721]  Now he's talked about a lot of it, I'll just tell the full story.
[00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:34.283]  That is a blow-by-blow of what went on.
[00:47:34.283 --> 00:47:36.505]  And then the stomping around the airport.
[00:47:36.505 --> 00:47:38.987]  And he's usually like a big teddy bear.
[00:47:38.987 --> 00:47:41.668]  Really friendly, nice guy, you know, talking to old ladies and stuff.
[00:47:41.668 --> 00:47:47.352]  And then I watched him in this rage, definitely taking time off his life.
[00:47:47.352 --> 00:47:51.475]  A controlled rage, basically grinding his teeth on the airplane.
[00:47:51.475 --> 00:47:52.376]  And it's normal!
[00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:00.197]  And now here we are in this country.
[00:48:00.197 --> 00:48:05.438]  I tell you, Senator Rand Paul's coming up in a big exclusive interview in the third hour today.
[00:48:05.438 --> 00:48:07.479]  Imagine, this was already going on, folks.
[00:48:07.479 --> 00:48:10.300]  They've already got InfraGard, they've already got all these spies.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:17.882]  My dad and almost every dentist he knows was approached to be on Homeland Security payroll to spy on their patients.
[00:48:17.882 --> 00:48:20.823]  That's so illegal.
[00:48:20.823 --> 00:48:25.905]  Violates the Fourth Amendment, violates the Tenth Amendment, states' rights, and it's pre-crime.
[00:48:27.102 --> 00:48:30.706]  It's not like, oh, we think somebody did something wrong.
[00:48:30.706 --> 00:48:34.651]  Of course, it's really the FBI and ATF shipping drugs and guns out.
[00:48:34.651 --> 00:48:37.655]  It's not just the ATF involved in that.
[00:48:37.655 --> 00:48:39.797]  No, it's about letting you know.
[00:48:39.797 --> 00:48:40.778]  Here's the key.
[00:48:40.778 --> 00:48:42.600]  It's about letting you know.
[00:48:45.353 --> 00:48:46.273]  That you're being watched.
[00:48:46.273 --> 00:48:50.214]  Well, I say, listen criminals, I know I'm being watched.
[00:48:50.214 --> 00:48:51.314]  You're being watched.
[00:48:51.314 --> 00:48:52.474]  And you're being exposed.
[00:48:52.474 --> 00:49:06.157]  If you give in to them going, you know what, we are watching you, the CIA is watching you, we've hired all the executives and doctors and InfraGard, or tried to, and we've got your, the preachers are on these power trips now, spying on their flock, and I heard you were criticizing the government.
[00:49:06.157 --> 00:49:07.837]  That's not of the Lord, my son.
[00:49:07.837 --> 00:49:14.418]  I mean, these are authoritarian piles of trash, and need to be rebuked.
[00:49:15.848 --> 00:49:16.948]  And God has laid it on my heart.
[00:49:16.948 --> 00:49:22.490]  I think I'm going to start going in the churches, and when I hear those sermons, I'm going to stand up.
[00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:24.190]  I'm done.
[00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.370]  And I want you to do that, too.
[00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:26.511]  It is time.
[00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:28.711]  Go, what are you, an East German traitor?
[00:49:28.711 --> 00:49:30.412]  We know you've been hired by the government.
[00:49:30.412 --> 00:49:32.552]  Your denomination told you to do this.
[00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:34.173]  This is a government that's criminal.
[00:49:34.173 --> 00:49:35.653]  You're not looking for terrorists.
[00:49:35.653 --> 00:49:37.013]  You're looking for Americans.
[00:49:37.013 --> 00:49:38.414]  You're a globalist infiltrator.
[00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:39.954]  Moe!
[00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:41.835]  This isn't a church.
[00:49:41.835 --> 00:49:43.155]  This is a New World Order
[00:49:44.991 --> 00:49:54.316]  A synagogue of devilry, a church of iniquity, a mosque of Satanism, whatever you want to call it.
[00:49:54.316 --> 00:49:57.637]  It's so incredible.
[00:49:57.637 --> 00:50:02.840]  You're being watched, Globalist, and we know you're trying to watch us because you know we're hot on your trail.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.701]  You know what they use the NSA for, and this has been declassified?
[00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:13.585]  To find out when separate agency arms that aren't black, that means part of the New World Order, black side, white side, nothing to do with black people.
[00:50:15.942 --> 00:50:20.945]  They use the NSA to spy on people in the system that are whistleblowers and media.
[00:50:20.945 --> 00:50:24.387]  That's why Obama's now jailing all these journalists that talk to whistleblowers.
[00:50:24.387 --> 00:50:26.929]  A whistleblower exposes a billion bucks stolen?
[00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:29.991]  The reporter and the whistleblower go to jail under national security.
[00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:31.531]  Never before done.
[00:50:31.531 --> 00:50:34.033]  Whistleblowing crimes is totally protected.
[00:50:34.033 --> 00:50:34.753]  Not anymore.
[00:50:34.753 --> 00:50:38.035]  Because a mafia group of murderers run this country.
[00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.716]  And I told you I'm just letting it all hang out.
[00:50:39.716 --> 00:50:40.937]  They'll probably kill me.
[00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.278]  Knock on wood, I hope they don't.
[00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:47.919]  And I'm in God's hands, but I'm gonna tell it like it is, and know that somebody did.
[00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:49.440]  Okay?
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:51:01.143]  Right out of East Germany, right out of Soviet Russia, right out of despotism, right out of 1984, right out of the gates of hell, you're talking about spies everywhere, and they want you to know they're spying on you!
[00:51:01.143 --> 00:51:06.825]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but
[00:51:07.165 --> 00:51:13.929]  I wasn't following the regimen every day, but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds.
[00:51:13.929 --> 00:51:17.651]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.

[00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:32.976]  It'd be a lot more fun to go fishing and listen to Elvis.
[00:54:32.976 --> 00:54:38.420]  You know, that's the thing about the New World Order.
[00:54:40.919 --> 00:54:43.020]  They don't even hide what they're doing now.
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.622]  It's like, yeah, we ship most of the drugs in.
[00:54:46.622 --> 00:54:52.826]  Yeah, most of the big banks have been caught laundering drug money.
[00:54:52.826 --> 00:54:56.908]  Yeah, some of the big defense contractors do run child kidnapping rings.
[00:54:56.908 --> 00:55:00.650]  And yeah, they snuff some of the kids in films, but that's a big profit.
[00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:06.287]  But you know what, we're going to take all your rides because scary men with turbines want to get you.
[00:55:06.287 --> 00:55:18.454]  But yeah, those scary men with turbines, they are on record working for the CIA and foreign groups, and they are putting them in power in Libya and Syria and... Egypt.
[00:55:18.454 --> 00:55:20.595]  But that's okay.
[00:55:20.595 --> 00:55:24.277]  Because we're going to have the TSA, the federal government,
[00:55:27.501 --> 00:55:34.527]  On the highways and the roads and the bus terminals, in plain clothes like air marshals, spying on you.
[00:55:34.527 --> 00:55:37.289]  And by the way, they say for crime.
[00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:43.493]  That's why Homeland Security is now raiding people's gardens in the Amish.
[00:55:43.493 --> 00:55:45.115]  It's infrastructure protection.
[00:55:48.266 --> 00:55:55.828]  Imagine powerful megacorporations, bigger than most governments, who own governments and who can get away with anything.
[00:55:55.828 --> 00:55:57.068]  What would they do?
[00:55:57.068 --> 00:56:03.710]  They would raise taxes and transfer it to themselves in corporate welfare and bailouts, and they would shut down everybody.
[00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.651]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, what level of tyranny will you live under?
[00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:10.072]  The exact amount you'll put up with.
[00:56:10.072 --> 00:56:10.833]  You understand?
[00:56:10.833 --> 00:56:11.893]  There's no limit.
[00:56:11.893 --> 00:56:15.095]  There are crooks in every level of the system that have now gotten in.
[00:56:15.095 --> 00:56:24.841]  We've reached that critical mass where there's always somebody wilder and more wicked who wants to push the envelope.
[00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:26.002]  Emergency!
[00:56:26.002 --> 00:56:27.043]  Mayday!
[00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:28.143]  Global emergency!
[00:56:28.143 --> 00:56:28.824]  I just got chills.
[00:56:30.811 --> 00:56:35.617]  Big Sis launches undercover GSA spies to ride Houston buses.
[00:56:35.617 --> 00:56:38.300]  Feds to watch for suspicious activity, pre-crime behavior.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:44.308]  I told you they were in Houston and Dallas seven years ago, from my sources in the police departments.
[00:56:44.308 --> 00:56:45.650]  It's now been announced last year.
[00:56:46.681 --> 00:56:47.382]  I told you.
[00:56:47.382 --> 00:57:05.557]  Remember I'd always say, they're already on the streets with undercover people in Florida, and Texas, and Michigan, and California, and Massachusetts, and New York, and now they're gonna have feds out with the helmets on, the black uniforms, and German shepherds bugging, acting tough to intimidate everybody, not to make you feel safe.
[00:57:05.557 --> 00:57:08.000]  They're getting you ready for true martial law.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.422]  This is soft martial law being implemented.
[00:57:11.664 --> 00:57:13.686]  You guys are going to get to talk to Bob Chapman.
[00:57:13.686 --> 00:57:17.389]  Because on whatever issue, you can talk to me, you can talk to him, we'll go to your calls.
[00:57:17.389 --> 00:57:26.018]  I meant to go to him earlier, but I just... My head is spinning right now.
[00:57:26.018 --> 00:57:33.605]  Got a bunch of other articles that are just incredibly important.
[00:57:33.605 --> 00:57:34.606]  We've got Ted Nugent.
[00:57:35.305 --> 00:57:40.329]  Uh, responding to the, uh, Secret Service saying that they're gonna come after him for his comments.
[00:57:40.329 --> 00:57:42.752]  We've got Rand Paul coming up.
[00:57:42.752 --> 00:57:45.654]  We've got this, uh, new Internet Censorship Act coming up.
[00:57:45.654 --> 00:57:49.097]  We've got Rand Paul talking about that.
[00:57:49.097 --> 00:57:53.000]  A second MEP calls ACTA Internet Treaty a threat to liberties.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.963]  Cannot guarantee adequate protection for citizens' rights.
[00:57:55.963 --> 00:57:57.544]  That's InfoWars.com.
[00:57:57.544 --> 00:57:57.965]  Breaking.
[00:58:00.891 --> 00:58:03.592]  I've got news from all these prominent people.
[00:58:03.592 --> 00:58:10.013]  Look at this article with this LAX airport with the movie star getting her breast grabbed.
[00:58:10.013 --> 00:58:12.753]  And it's all on tape.
[00:58:12.753 --> 00:58:13.574]  Movie stars!
[00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:15.834]  And they're just like, you know you're getting groped.
[00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:20.055]  Because this is like, imagine for these perverts.
[00:58:20.055 --> 00:58:22.215]  It's like, imagine the LAX people.
[00:58:22.215 --> 00:58:28.077]  They're like, they get to be pedophiles, they get to grope movie stars, and get like jumping off a cliff.
[00:58:28.077 --> 00:58:29.297]  I mean, I certainly wouldn't like that.
[00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:31.741]  It's amazing.
[00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:37.366]  You couldn't pay me $10 million to fondle women and children all day.
[00:58:37.366 --> 00:58:37.987]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:21.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.937 --> 01:00:44.881]  Hour number two, coming up at the start of the third hour, we're going to air an exclusive interview I taped.
[01:00:44.881 --> 01:00:53.544]  An exclusive interview that I taped with Senator Rand Paul.
[01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:55.045]  That is coming up.
[01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:02.936]  We've got Bob Chapman, who I want to get on as a roving, not just every Friday at the same time.
[01:01:02.936 --> 01:01:04.177]  Bob's too good for that.
[01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:05.058]  He's got too much to do.
[01:01:05.058 --> 01:01:05.719]  I'd like to have him on.
[01:01:05.719 --> 01:01:10.704]  There's been a bunch of big events every few weeks, and he'll be honoring us with his presence coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:13.567]  I've got a bunch of incredible news, obviously, as well, we're going to be going over.
[01:01:13.567 --> 01:01:15.269]  And your calls while Bob's on with us.
[01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:16.710]  I know Bob loves calls.
[01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:17.211]  Sometimes he's like...
[01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.332]  Let's go to the calls, Alex.
[01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:21.333]  I can't imitate his cool voice.
[01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.954]  And my mom's like, I haven't heard Bob lately.
[01:01:22.954 --> 01:01:23.774]  You gotta get Bob on.
[01:01:23.774 --> 01:01:29.897]  I'm like, well, I always set him at a certain time, because it's hard to get Bob unless you do that.
[01:01:29.897 --> 01:01:31.098]  But I've been asking him to come on.
[01:01:31.098 --> 01:01:31.798]  He's been too busy.
[01:01:31.798 --> 01:01:35.200]  But I do have him coming up for you, Mom, this Wednesday.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.701]  So she's going to be listening.
[01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:40.782]  Let's talk to Brian in California before we go to Bob.
[01:01:40.782 --> 01:01:45.545]  Bob, you think I'm... Or, Brian, do you think I'm a little...
[01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.253]  Little overdoing it.
[01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:51.416]  Maybe it's good we're going to have the TSA outside the 10th Amendment.
[01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:54.279]  Spying on people and playing clothes on the streets of America.
[01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:59.604]  I mean, that's freedom to have federal secret police just randomly spying on thought crime, they admit.
[01:01:59.604 --> 01:02:03.967]  I'm totally against it.
[01:02:03.967 --> 01:02:04.868]  But that's freedom, though.
[01:02:04.868 --> 01:02:11.574]  I mean, everybody knows that, like Tony Montana in Scarface says, you want a Chavano in every corner spying on you?
[01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:12.715]  I mean, Cuba does that.
[01:02:12.715 --> 01:02:13.116]  It's freedom.
[01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:17.815]  Yeah, not in my country, not in America, not here.
[01:02:17.815 --> 01:02:24.563]  Maybe the new American flag should be like a snitch, like looking through your window blinds.
[01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:31.651]  I'm from California, I'm from the tyranny capital of the nation, so I mean, we know what the police state's all about here in California.
[01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:34.234]  Yeah, well I'm gonna shut up, I'm gonna shut up, tell me what's on your mind.
[01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:49.729]  Well, actually, the reason I was calling in today was, uh, I don't know if you guys are familiar with the, uh, thing that went down this weekend with, you know, holographic images of, uh, Tupac on stage, uh, but automatically first thing that popped into my mind was Project Blue Beam.
[01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:52.311]  Um, and I know you're familiar with that.
[01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:54.474]  Now, I saw there was big news that Tupac...
[01:02:55.514 --> 01:02:58.476]  Uh, you know, they've created holograms of him.
[01:02:58.476 --> 01:03:01.078]  I think Disney had that 60 years ago.
[01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.138]  And it is declassified.
[01:03:02.138 --> 01:03:02.559]  The U.S.
[01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:13.065]  government admits they can project 3,000-foot-tall Jesus, Buddha, Easter bunnies, flying saucers, Keebler elves, chupacabras, walruses, anything they want.
[01:03:14.019 --> 01:03:16.240]  Remember when CNN did that during the election?
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.720]  They had holograms?
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.281]  You know, their guests would join them via hologram?
[01:03:32.714 --> 01:03:33.255]  Yeah, I do.
[01:03:33.255 --> 01:03:34.156]  I remember that as well.
[01:03:34.156 --> 01:03:35.779]  Yes, on Fox and on CNN.
[01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:36.900]  Yes, I remember that.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.307]  All of these goggles they've got, they phase it in to make sure the slaves won't resist.
[01:03:41.307 --> 01:03:43.250]  All the movies go into 3D.
[01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.413]  That's getting you ready for bigger goggles.
[01:03:45.413 --> 01:03:46.715]  It's going to be projected.
[01:03:47.489 --> 01:04:02.575]  And you're gonna wear goggles, but in the next phase, this is what James Cameron's coming out with, I've talked to top Hollywood folks, it's no secret now, you'll go to arenas that are like 80% a bowl, and then on a round stage, you will see holograms.
[01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:06.195]  And it's just scary to me.
[01:04:06.195 --> 01:04:13.276]  And then the scarier thing is when you mention Project Blue Beam to people after they post these videos of the Tupac holograms, they say, well, what's that?
[01:04:13.276 --> 01:04:14.017]  What's that?
[01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.837]  Nobody even knows what Project Blue Beam is.
[01:04:15.837 --> 01:04:17.897]  Nobody even knows if the government has the technology.
[01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:19.738]  And nobody knows if NASA can do this.
[01:04:19.738 --> 01:04:21.158]  And it's just sad.
[01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:32.640]  But, you know, as soon as Tupac... Well, most of them don't know they've been injected with the dozens of deadly cancer viruses that are meant to trigger when their hormone levels go to a certain point, when they're 55, 60, so the government doesn't have to pay them their Social Security.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.062]  Most of them don't know they've been implanted.
[01:04:35.062 --> 01:04:45.051]  Basically the analogy, I'm going to do a YouTube video, this is like Escape from New York, where they put exploding detonators in Stake Plissken's neck and his carotid arteries.
[01:04:45.051 --> 01:04:48.994]  We've all been implanted with exploding viral plaques.
[01:04:48.994 --> 01:04:50.576]  I mean, we ought to be mad at these people.
[01:04:50.576 --> 01:04:53.959]  They've already taken 20-30% off our lives.
[01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:55.860]  Some people it triggers early.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.042]  So you get a kid dying of cancer.
[01:04:58.042 --> 01:04:58.503]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.016 --> 01:05:04.818]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:05.379]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:09.721]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:10.181]  Number two,
[01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:15.445]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.445 --> 01:06:16.205]  It's true.
[01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:21.910]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:25.493]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.493 --> 01:06:30.196]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:30.196 --> 01:06:32.958]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:36.301]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.621 --> 01:06:41.564]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:46.607]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.607 --> 01:06:50.789]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:52.590]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:57.193]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:02.469 --> 01:07:06.430]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:15.291]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:19.912]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:30.734]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:31.374 --> 01:07:40.876]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.876 --> 01:07:46.318]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:46.318 --> 01:07:53.799]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:53.799 --> 01:07:56.560]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:08:01.021 --> 01:08:06.426]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.426 --> 01:08:08.648]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.648 --> 01:08:12.030]  We do have the...
[01:08:28.206 --> 01:08:30.289]  Rand Paul interview coming up.
[01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:35.455]  Senator Rand Paul in the third hour.
[01:08:35.455 --> 01:08:41.162]  And we're talking right now to the one, the only Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[01:08:42.136 --> 01:08:43.937]  Hadn't been on this in a few weeks.
[01:08:43.937 --> 01:08:45.097]  So much has happened.
[01:08:45.097 --> 01:08:47.659]  So much has been unfolding.
[01:08:47.659 --> 01:08:52.061]  We have a stack of articles at Infowars.com today breaking this down.
[01:08:52.061 --> 01:09:00.325]  It is so important to get to your friends and family and explain to them Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and a handful of other big banks.
[01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:07.034]  Are directly engaged in a global coup d'etat over every sovereign nation.
[01:09:07.034 --> 01:09:10.475]  They admit this and call it that themselves.
[01:09:10.475 --> 01:09:14.376]  In their own documents, in the Financial Times, in The Economist.
[01:09:14.376 --> 01:09:16.377]  They're proud of it.
[01:09:16.377 --> 01:09:18.858]  Just search, Goldman Sachs coup in Europe.
[01:09:18.858 --> 01:09:20.839]  They brag.
[01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:22.499]  The money's not owed to them.
[01:09:22.499 --> 01:09:25.020]  It's their debt, their fraud.
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:30.622]  They build a Ponzi scheme so big, and then threaten to bring down the world market if you don't give in to them.
[01:09:31.795 --> 01:09:38.619]  It's like scrapping a nuclear weapon to yourself and saying, do what I say or I'll detonate it in the middle of Chicago.
[01:09:38.619 --> 01:09:40.840]  That's what we're talking about here.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:44.402]  This is the new world order and they've got their operatives in there everywhere.
[01:09:44.402 --> 01:09:52.926]  And they're now federalizing the police, they're putting spies on the street, they're training the police for forced inoculations, blood draws.
[01:09:52.926 --> 01:10:00.070]  I was just talking to a friend where it had been more than 10 years, she's younger than I am,
[01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:12.189]  A little more than 10 years since he'd been 18 years old and had done some odd jobs and didn't even know about paying taxes.
[01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:14.130]  It had been a few hundred dollars.
[01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:19.992]  It turned into more than $5,000 with penalties and interest after a decade.
[01:10:19.992 --> 01:10:24.174]  I didn't even know they could do that, but I guess they can do anything now.
[01:10:25.331 --> 01:10:38.233]  And the Internal Revenue Service that collects money for the private fellow reserve, the banksters, we've been captured by through fraud, recognize that the coup d'etat, the financial coup d'etat, that's how you begin to remove them.
[01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:51.796]  Get past the puppets and the pageantry of Mitt Romney versus everybody else and Obama and get to the fact that this is who's running the society.
[01:10:51.796 --> 01:10:52.036]  Okay?
[01:10:56.428 --> 01:11:01.531]  And it's hiding in plain view, and it's us or them.
[01:11:01.531 --> 01:11:04.913]  Goldman Sachs rules the World Bank of England next.
[01:11:04.913 --> 01:11:10.256]  Financial terrorists have exploited chaos they created to seize complete control.
[01:11:10.256 --> 01:11:23.263]  Mark Carney, the governor of Canada's central bank, has been informally approached as the potential candidate to replace Sir Marvin King as the head of the Bank of England in June of next year, reports the Financial Times.
[01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:29.632]  Now, he's the head of the Bank of Canada, which is private right now.
[01:11:29.632 --> 01:11:30.572]  It's their Federal Reserve.
[01:11:30.572 --> 01:11:32.533]  It's all the same shareholders.
[01:11:32.533 --> 01:11:36.375]  The point is, he's former Goldman Sachs.
[01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:42.679]  He was involved in the Russian crisis in 98, looting and robbing them as well.
[01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:43.419]  It's all the same.
[01:11:43.419 --> 01:11:44.660]  I mean, these guys wear suits.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:49.162]  They look distinguished.
[01:11:49.162 --> 01:11:50.503]  Ted Bundy looked distinguished.
[01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:57.942]  And this is what they're doing.
[01:11:57.942 --> 01:12:01.865]  And they're purposefully imploding the world, not just to get the assets.
[01:12:01.865 --> 01:12:05.008]  They want you poor so they can take control of your life.
[01:12:05.008 --> 01:12:06.729]  These are eugenicists.
[01:12:06.729 --> 01:12:09.671]  To a man, you're not in the club if you're not into this.
[01:12:09.671 --> 01:12:17.377]  It's the psycho religion, the control freak, abuser, predator religion that sees us as a side of lamb on the table to be carved up.
[01:12:17.377 --> 01:12:19.759]  Well, I'm not a lamb to be carved up, punks.
[01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:21.939]  And I'm sick of what you've done.
[01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:24.700]  And you people are so stupid on your power trips.
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:25.720]  I've studied you.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.361]  You've got blowback from all the evil you're doing into your own families and your own lives.
[01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:31.121]  But you don't care.
[01:12:31.121 --> 01:12:33.042]  You want to carry out the evil no matter what.
[01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:35.122]  You're not even winning.
[01:12:35.122 --> 01:12:44.204]  It's bad enough to be evil and ruthless, but you're destroying the planet in the process of telling us you're saving it.
[01:12:44.204 --> 01:12:48.765]  You're giving over to true, true dark side.
[01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:49.705]  And you're not in control.
[01:12:50.697 --> 01:12:52.959]  Force is a lot darker than you are.
[01:12:52.959 --> 01:12:55.981]  You're only instruments of this, and you know it.
[01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:57.222]  But you don't care.
[01:12:57.222 --> 01:13:02.266]  You're attracted like moths to that black flame.
[01:13:02.266 --> 01:13:03.827]  Goldman Sachs rules the world.
[01:13:03.827 --> 01:13:04.908]  Bank of England next.
[01:13:04.908 --> 01:13:09.351]  Financial terrorists have exploited chaos they created to seize complete control.
[01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.993]  Amid Euro slump, the IMF rethinks austerity.
[01:13:12.827 --> 01:13:19.380]  That's what Dominique Strauss-Kahn said before they set him up with the fake hooker, which is now admitted to be fake and a French intelligence operation.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.382]  We told you that day one.
[01:13:20.382 --> 01:13:21.123]  It's now been confirmed.
[01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:25.329]  Sarkozy did stuff like Twitter before the police had even been called.
[01:13:25.329 --> 01:13:33.153]  They didn't get their time zones straight and it came out that he was under British, excuse me, French intelligence and that whole thing was run by them.
[01:13:33.153 --> 01:13:37.714]  And she was connected to organized crime, of course, run by French intelligence and others.
[01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.916]  So now they're saying if we squeeze too tight it'll implode things faster.
[01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:45.598]  So the bankers are debating, hey, but the high up ones are like, that's the point.
[01:13:45.598 --> 01:13:46.178]  Destroy!
[01:13:48.533 --> 01:13:51.796]  It's like, but the DU, if we use it in Lebanon, will blow back into Israel.
[01:13:51.796 --> 01:14:00.524]  The DU, if we use it in other areas like Gaza, blows right back across us in the prevailing winds out of the Mediterranean.
[01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:04.588]  The New World Order just said, use thousands of tons, but it'll kill everybody in Israel.
[01:14:04.588 --> 01:14:05.329]  Soft kill.
[01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:06.950]  Fire weapons!
[01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:11.414]  Everyone must partake of death in the New World Order.
[01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:12.255]  Continuing here,
[01:14:13.624 --> 01:14:14.865]  Okay, let's go to Bob Chapman.
[01:14:14.865 --> 01:14:16.506]  Bob, what do you make of the statements I've made?
[01:14:16.506 --> 01:14:21.190]  What's the latest there at the International Forecaster in your research?
[01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:21.830]  What's happening?
[01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:22.931]  What's the latest manipulations?
[01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:30.236]  What do you make of Corzine, the announcement that he did lie, he did steal the money, and he's not going to get in trouble?
[01:14:30.236 --> 01:14:37.882]  Well, that's a real hatful, because he should be fined, at least.
[01:14:37.882 --> 01:14:40.104]  A very, very, very large fine.
[01:14:40.104 --> 01:14:41.785]  But I think that's what will happen in the end.
[01:14:42.805 --> 01:14:46.368]  And as I said, when the survey broke, I explained why.
[01:14:46.368 --> 01:14:49.930]  I said, everybody's going to get their money back.
[01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:53.973]  Right now, they've got about 68 to 70% back.
[01:14:53.973 --> 01:14:56.555]  And in time, they'll work it out.
[01:14:56.555 --> 01:14:59.116]  At least, that's my take on it.
[01:14:59.116 --> 01:15:09.344]  In reference to what you were talking about, have you discussed the new House Bill 1318, I think it is?
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:20.485]  Uh, which has been passed in the Senate and is now in the Housing Committee.
[01:15:20.485 --> 01:15:23.407]  And I think it's a transportation bill.
[01:15:23.407 --> 01:15:39.458]  And part of that bill is to, uh, confiscate or cancel passports of people who try to leave the country who owe the government money.
[01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:40.458]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:42.319]  I am a little bit, Bob.
[01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:42.780]  Tell me more.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.061]  Well, it's really as simple as that.
[01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:58.389]  Of course, you could step aside and say, well, if that's what you want to do, clear everybody to make sure they don't own the IRS money before they try to take a trip.
[01:15:58.389 --> 01:15:59.430]  But they're not going to do that.
[01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.553]  They're going to terrorize people at the airport.
[01:16:03.553 --> 01:16:11.878]  And I think that's what, you know, this bill and this, I'll call it an amendment to that bill.
[01:16:11.878 --> 01:16:12.579]  Uh, I think that,
[01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:16.893]  They're going to have real problems passing that.
[01:16:16.893 --> 01:16:22.194]  And it could be struck down, but it just shows you the length of what these people will do.
[01:16:22.194 --> 01:16:30.715]  Sure, I'm familiar with the bill that's passed the Senate, and I think is going to pass the House, to create debtors' prisons, basically, and not let you leave the country.
[01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:35.636]  And Homeland Security has said they're going to not let you have a job if you owe taxes next.
[01:16:35.636 --> 01:16:38.897]  Now, no judge, no jury, you can't revoke someone's
[01:16:40.277 --> 01:16:42.198]  Citizenship, they have to renounce it.
[01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:56.543]  That's part of law, part of the Constitution, and the lawyers concurred with my analysis, because I've seen them in the news since, saying yes, this is basically revoking citizenship by stealth to say we're canceling your passport.
[01:16:56.543 --> 01:17:00.044]  I mean, that is, only Stalin did stuff like that.
[01:17:00.044 --> 01:17:04.006]  I mean, this is, and people are like, well, they're now doing it for people that hadn't paid their child support.
[01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.227]  That's what I mean.
[01:17:06.227 --> 01:17:07.587]  It's totally illegal.
[01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:14.050]  But so is having federal spies on the streets randomly spying on people with pre-crime, Bob.
[01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:18.712]  That's true.
[01:17:18.712 --> 01:17:23.694]  Why do you think it's moving so fast and they're so out in the open?
[01:17:23.694 --> 01:17:29.257]  They've got a lot of stuff lined up that they want to put in position.
[01:17:29.257 --> 01:17:32.038]  I mean, two weeks before last,
[01:17:33.089 --> 01:17:39.011]  We had, uh, a woman who runs the commodities, uh, for, uh, J.P.
[01:17:39.011 --> 01:17:43.513]  Morgan Chase, who plays Masters on CNBC.
[01:17:43.513 --> 01:17:55.997]  Now, in that capacity, she nor anybody else had ever been on JPM on behalf of JPM and CNBC.
[01:17:55.997 --> 01:17:59.678]  And everything was pre-staged.
[01:17:59.678 --> 01:18:02.559]  And she was making excuses.
[01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:09.366]  Why they were following the law because people were saying that the markets were rigged.
[01:18:09.366 --> 01:18:11.367]  They were manipulated.
[01:18:11.367 --> 01:18:12.767]  We wouldn't do that sort of thing.
[01:18:12.767 --> 01:18:14.747]  We're not that kind of company.
[01:18:14.747 --> 01:18:17.128]  We're just working for our clients.
[01:18:17.128 --> 01:18:20.588]  So there's something in that area coming down the road.
[01:18:20.588 --> 01:18:22.549]  I don't know what it is yet.
[01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:32.971]  I would suspect perhaps the FTC might be going to make some limitations and
[01:18:34.338 --> 01:18:35.438]  Well it certainly is, and
[01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:08.782]  They're trying to accelerate, basically, a soft martial law to get everybody ready for it.
[01:19:08.782 --> 01:19:11.924]  So what I hear from you is it looks like things are deteriorating a lot faster.
[01:19:11.924 --> 01:19:14.165]  Is that what you're saying, Bob?
[01:19:14.165 --> 01:19:18.387]  It is, and it was in relation to your comment that that is.
[01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.588]  And yes, it is.
[01:19:20.588 --> 01:19:28.392]  Expedition of the plans that they have put in place and haven't had in place for many, many years.
[01:19:29.383 --> 01:19:30.303]  Bob, we're going to go to break.
[01:19:30.303 --> 01:19:37.685]  I want to take a bunch of calls, because whatever issue they raise on the waterfront, I know you can comment on it, and it's always interesting.
[01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:44.407]  And then towards the end of the hour, other tidbits that you think are important people should look into, and I'll throw out some other news at you.
[01:19:44.407 --> 01:19:45.827]  I'll get your take on Ron Paul.
[01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:48.388]  We got Senator Rand Paul coming up.
[01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:51.189]  Interview I taped right before we went live today.
[01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:53.669]  Amazing information on that front.
[01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:54.270]  Stay with us.
[01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:55.470]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.742]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:02.742 --> 01:20:13.396]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:20:13.396 --> 01:20:17.482]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:20:17.842 --> 01:20:20.585]  But we can't do that without your help.

[01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:35.022]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:20:35.342 --> 01:20:41.505]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:20:41.505 --> 01:20:51.351]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:52.872]  The war is here.
[01:20:52.872 --> 01:20:54.212]  It's an info war.
[01:20:54.212 --> 01:20:55.593]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:21:00.996 --> 01:21:07.021]  Would it save you time to get the best quality water filters and the best quality storable foods from one company?

[01:22:31.532 --> 01:22:36.095]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.095 --> 01:22:41.899]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.899 --> 01:22:45.541]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:48.263]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:53.326]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:23:57.527 --> 01:23:58.687]  Peace through preparedness.
[01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:19.663]  Bob Chapman is our guest, and I didn't know that he was under the weather, but we still appreciate him joining us.
[01:24:19.663 --> 01:24:22.004]  We can hear that in his voice.
[01:24:22.004 --> 01:24:26.345]  I want to go to some of your phone calls, and we will start those in the next segment.
[01:24:26.345 --> 01:24:30.566]  But Bob, I'm always asking, you know, the questions here.
[01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:38.728]  Tell me some of the things the International Forecaster has been looking at, and what you think is most important on the radar screen.
[01:24:38.728 --> 01:24:41.709]  Well, I think overall, you're looking at
[01:24:42.603 --> 01:24:50.026]  A situation in Europe that is insolvable, and they don't know what to do now.
[01:24:50.026 --> 01:25:08.755]  If you notice, for a month or so, you've not heard much from the Illuminati, the cracks of politicians, and now there's a fight going on between the Europeans and the U.S.
[01:25:08.755 --> 01:25:11.716]  members, and the Europeans are saying,
[01:25:13.735 --> 01:25:16.436]  You gotta help us with this thing.
[01:25:16.436 --> 01:25:19.437]  We already put a lot of money into it.
[01:25:19.437 --> 01:25:34.401]  We want you to put in, along with Japan and China and other third world countries that haven't put anything in, we want you to put a lot more money in.
[01:25:34.401 --> 01:25:35.741]  And you're saying, why should we do that?
[01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:39.062]  We didn't create the problem, you did.
[01:25:39.062 --> 01:25:41.582]  And that's what's going on.
[01:25:41.582 --> 01:25:43.383]  And it can lead to no good end because
[01:25:44.646 --> 01:25:46.567]  They're not cooperating with each other.
[01:25:46.567 --> 01:25:51.749]  It's been going on for what I think is a substantial amount of time.
[01:25:51.749 --> 01:25:55.851]  And so I think you're going to have some blow-ups here.
[01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:58.532]  We had three more suicides in Greece yesterday.
[01:25:58.532 --> 01:26:04.195]  People have jets of energy.
[01:26:04.195 --> 01:26:12.618]  I don't know what the election is going to accomplish on May 6th.
[01:26:12.618 --> 01:26:13.919]  They cannot be a majority.
[01:26:15.413 --> 01:26:23.316]  And even if the two major parties got together, they'd still only get 40% of the vote at the outside.
[01:26:23.316 --> 01:26:30.498]  So, there may be two or three elections, until finally, something happens.
[01:26:30.498 --> 01:26:41.321]  There's a major investigation going on with a former member of the government who stole millions and millions of dollars.
[01:26:44.386 --> 01:27:01.015]  And this was a program where in the process of purchasing silent submarines, the money was weaved through a group of offshore corporations.
[01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:06.818]  So this person is guilty because why would he do such a thing?
[01:27:06.818 --> 01:27:09.320]  Are you talking about Grace right now?
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:09.780]  Yes, I am.
[01:27:11.997 --> 01:27:13.638]  Let me raise this point to you.
[01:27:13.638 --> 01:27:16.119]  This is out of the Washington Post saying what you just said.
[01:27:16.119 --> 01:27:19.760]  Amid Euro slump, the IMF rethinks austerity.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:31.885]  And you had said eight, nine months ago, whenever that Dominique Strauss-Kahn thing happened, that it was a setup, that it was run by Sarkozy, that later came out, and that Kahn didn't want to squeeze
[01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:34.026]  That's hard.
[01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:37.648]  Not because he's a nice guy, but he's saying we're going to kill the Golden Goose.
[01:27:37.648 --> 01:27:40.709]  You can't impoverish them this fast.
[01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:46.871]  And so they basically removed him because he was set to also be able to beat Sarkozy coming up in the election.
[01:27:46.871 --> 01:27:50.272]  Now the person that you're friends with, Le Pen's doing good.
[01:27:50.272 --> 01:27:57.655]  But the point here is that the bankers are realizing that they are killing the Golden Goose and they're now admitting this.
[01:28:00.464 --> 01:28:02.065]  And they have no solution to the debt.
[01:28:02.065 --> 01:28:04.667]  Now they get Spain on their hands.
[01:28:04.667 --> 01:28:09.390]  You're talking a minimum of $1.25 trillion.
[01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:12.592]  And it could be as high as $2, $2.5 trillion.
[01:28:12.592 --> 01:28:15.554]  If you put them all together, you get $6 trillion.
[01:28:15.554 --> 01:28:22.338]  And there's no way they can come up with it without destroying their financial base.
[01:28:22.338 --> 01:28:28.422]  And so we continue to take this avoidance of responsibility as to what
[01:28:29.292 --> 01:28:31.132]  Going to or trying to do.
[01:28:31.132 --> 01:28:35.994]  And so all of that is in the pot, so to speak.
[01:28:35.994 --> 01:28:37.154]  And there are no solutions.
[01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:42.895]  So this is one of the reasons why gold and silver are being held down.
[01:28:42.895 --> 01:28:56.799]  Because they want them going up two or three hundred points in the face of this terrible predicament that exists in Europe, which could very well lead to the demise over the next couple of years
[01:28:57.766 --> 01:29:00.887]  Of the Eurozone.
[01:29:00.887 --> 01:29:04.929]  That unraveling, what do you expect gold to do when that unraveling accelerates?
[01:29:04.929 --> 01:29:08.871]  Because I know it always takes longer, but you're saying one or two years.
[01:29:08.871 --> 01:29:11.092]  A lot of experts are saying six months or so.
[01:29:11.092 --> 01:29:14.593]  There's no telling.
[01:29:14.593 --> 01:29:19.815]  But I think this year it would be safe to say that gold could test $2,000, $2,200.
[01:29:22.835 --> 01:29:28.440]  It's very hard to make projections because they keep on, you know, moving the goalposts.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:32.344]  Yeah, things are so rigged now, it's admitted we're in total la-la land here.
[01:29:32.344 --> 01:29:34.505]  I mean, there's incredible inflation.
[01:29:34.505 --> 01:29:37.008]  They tell us there basically is no inflation.
[01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:41.231]  They tell us unemployment is less than half of what it really is.
[01:29:41.231 --> 01:29:45.355]  Next, they're going to tell us pigs can fly.
[01:29:45.355 --> 01:29:48.057]  Phone calls for Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:29:48.057 --> 01:29:48.898]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:50.495 --> 01:29:53.482]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.482 --> 01:29:57.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.582 --> 01:30:02.662]  I had tried everything.
[01:30:02.662 --> 01:30:05.023]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:30:05.023 --> 01:30:08.144]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:08.144 --> 01:30:12.985]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:12.985 --> 01:30:19.827]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:19.827 --> 01:30:30.290]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:35.513]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:41.777]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:41.777 --> 01:30:43.358]  Now that's results.
[01:30:43.358 --> 01:30:50.142]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:30:50.142 --> 01:30:55.866]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:08.262]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:13.284]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:13.284 --> 01:31:18.306]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:18.846 --> 01:31:24.070]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:26.391]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:26.391 --> 01:31:31.194]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:32.315]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:32.315 --> 01:31:35.377]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:35.377 --> 01:31:39.000]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.202]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:42.202 --> 01:31:44.423]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:31:50.408 --> 01:31:58.038]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:58.038 --> 01:32:01.102]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:04.927]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[01:32:55.123 --> 01:32:55.443]  Big Brother.
[01:32:55.443 --> 01:32:56.103]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:56.783]  Government cover-ups.
[01:32:56.783 --> 01:32:57.704]  You want answers?
[01:32:57.704 --> 01:32:58.244]  Well, so does he.
[01:32:58.244 --> 01:33:00.064]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:29.176 --> 01:33:31.498]  Why do you think I'm a Baroque?
[01:33:31.498 --> 01:33:34.680]  If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.942]  But it better work this time.
[01:33:57.438 --> 01:34:00.039]  Yeah, I want to go back to our Republic, back to our Constitution.
[01:34:00.039 --> 01:34:03.280]  People keep blaming the Constitution, Time Magazine, Newsweek.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.481]  They want you to know all the problems are the fault of that.
[01:34:05.481 --> 01:34:13.004]  Of course, they're the ones who've already basically gotten rid of it, and jeepers creepers, you get rid of it, you're a giant slave.
[01:34:13.004 --> 01:34:16.546]  We're going to calls, but Bob, what else is on your radar screen right now?
[01:34:16.546 --> 01:34:20.768]  Well, I think that last item is very important.
[01:34:20.768 --> 01:34:25.570]  I hope that the listening audience pursues that bill in-house.
[01:34:26.966 --> 01:34:31.228]  House Bill 1813, I think it is.
[01:34:31.228 --> 01:34:43.852]  And, um, you know, each time they go to try to pass one of these things, if we can stop them, I know it's a small victory, but it's a very important one.
[01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:49.735]  Um, you brushed upon earlier, uh, what's going to happen with Corzine.
[01:34:49.735 --> 01:34:56.097]  And, uh, I think that's going to fall into the background because I, I believe that what they'll do
[01:34:56.886 --> 01:34:58.507]  It's fine.
[01:34:58.507 --> 01:35:01.909]  But it won't be a tough fine.
[01:35:01.909 --> 01:35:06.252]  And maybe even the company that's bankrupt will pay it.
[01:35:06.252 --> 01:35:10.175]  But there's a lot more of these coming down the line.
[01:35:10.175 --> 01:35:16.659]  And we've got suits against Shady Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.
[01:35:16.659 --> 01:35:21.742]  We have people getting caught in the commodity business.
[01:35:26.656 --> 01:35:32.260]  Taking positions and putting them on hold by putting them in another company account.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:42.107]  There's all sorts of terrible things going on in that industry and I think a lot more of them are going to come to surface and they're in the process of doing so now.
[01:35:42.107 --> 01:35:46.149]  Yeah, that's what it telegraphs to me.
[01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:55.616]  Their reluctance to prosecute him is because they know they're all in the same position and so they're setting the precedent to not pay people and to take
[01:35:57.369 --> 01:36:02.550]  Well, I think the bond market is the first place to look and they have just
[01:36:28.337 --> 01:36:32.179]  I've been unsuccessful at taking the 10-year U.S.
[01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:37.822]  note down to a yield of 2.5%.
[01:36:37.822 --> 01:36:45.086]  I should say the outside market, the long bonds, in that category.
[01:36:45.086 --> 01:36:57.732]  And I think what they're going to start doing again is a continuation of Operation Twist, which is aiding markets in one place and selling markets in another place.
[01:36:58.949 --> 01:37:06.713]  And it's coming to light, too, that they're taking direct orders from Jake P. Morgan, Chase, and Goldman Sachs.
[01:37:06.713 --> 01:37:15.318]  And I see that alluded to in much of the press throughout the world.
[01:37:15.318 --> 01:37:18.579]  And that's something really new.
[01:37:18.579 --> 01:37:23.862]  Like, they're the bad guys, and they're not really taking orders.
[01:37:23.862 --> 01:37:27.164]  They're taking orders from Wall Street.
[01:37:30.339 --> 01:37:32.320]  Well said, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.361]  Nicole in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:38.604]  Hi Alex, thanks so much for taking my call.
[01:37:38.604 --> 01:37:40.645]  Thanks for calling.
[01:37:40.645 --> 01:37:48.809]  I actually had a question about vaccines, but my husband is here with me and he wanted to share an experience he had in the military with a vaccine.
[01:37:48.809 --> 01:37:50.450]  Hey Jones, my name's John.
[01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:52.291]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:57.334]  I was medically discharged from the Air Force pending a quote-unquote flu shot.
[01:37:58.638 --> 01:38:04.652]  Within an hour of having this thing, I was within anaphylactic, uh, what do you call that?
[01:38:04.652 --> 01:38:05.534]  Anaphylactic shock.
[01:38:05.534 --> 01:38:06.576]  Anaphylactic shock.
[01:38:07.703 --> 01:38:10.664]  And it lasted for over a couple years.
[01:38:10.664 --> 01:38:15.905]  Yeah, you know, a lot of times they tell you they're shooting you up with one thing and it's really another.
[01:38:15.905 --> 01:38:22.527]  You might have been shot up with a small amount of nerve gas, biological, you really have no idea.
[01:38:22.527 --> 01:38:28.089]  They use you in late stage testing of weapon systems, you name it.
[01:38:28.089 --> 01:38:33.310]  You can look up Project Shad and other programs that have gone on right up until the 90s.
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:35.251]  That's the latest stuff we've seen declassified.
[01:38:36.371 --> 01:38:37.752]  And they actually kill U.S.
[01:38:37.752 --> 01:38:39.953]  troops routinely.
[01:38:39.953 --> 01:38:40.174]  U.S.
[01:38:40.174 --> 01:38:46.177]  troops are seen as expendable, basically like rhesus monkeys or rats.
[01:38:46.177 --> 01:38:56.223]  And I had one of Governor Perry's employees, who I've seen on television, is one of his spokesmen, come to my Endgame event when I was showing the Endgame film.
[01:38:56.223 --> 01:39:00.045]  And he said, no, it's, it's, I was at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.
[01:39:00.045 --> 01:39:01.206]  I was a medic a decade ago.
[01:39:02.048 --> 01:39:04.030]  This is a decade from then.
[01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:07.433]  And he said that we were told to shoot them up with a flu shot and they all died.
[01:39:07.433 --> 01:39:11.016]  And then we were told to scrub the whole thing out.
[01:39:11.016 --> 01:39:12.537]  So that's the type of stuff they do.
[01:39:12.537 --> 01:39:20.164]  I mean, was it a special shot or do they line everybody up and give them the shots?
[01:39:20.164 --> 01:39:21.826]  Check this out.
[01:39:21.826 --> 01:39:25.249]  We have routine flu shots on a yearly basis.
[01:39:25.249 --> 01:39:28.972]  And around that time, they were having the anthrax shot.
[01:39:30.114 --> 01:39:31.956]  And I told him, I said, I wasn't going to get it.
[01:39:31.956 --> 01:39:35.318]  And I told my chief, I said, I'm not taking this Amtrak shot.
[01:39:35.318 --> 01:39:39.902]  And he said, you're going to be court-martialed and probably dishonorable discharge.
[01:39:39.902 --> 01:39:41.443]  I said, well, I'd rather have that than die.
[01:39:42.153 --> 01:39:45.075]  So they just lied and said, here's the flu shot, and it was probably the anthrax.
[01:39:45.075 --> 01:39:49.357]  Because the anthrax did kill a bunch of people, and they had mutinies, finally, as you know.
[01:39:49.357 --> 01:39:53.079]  It was in the newspapers, and the doctors said they wouldn't do it.
[01:39:53.079 --> 01:39:59.442]  So it stopped, because it was causing anaphylactic shock, heart attacks, death, autoimmune disorders.
[01:39:59.442 --> 01:40:00.963]  What year was this that this happened to you?
[01:40:01.714 --> 01:40:11.037]  Uh, it's, it was, what was it, uh, it was around the year 2003, 2002, 2003, no it was 2001 or 2002 I think.
[01:40:11.037 --> 01:40:18.719]  Yeah, yeah, it was 2002, late 01, 02, when the government did the anthrax attacks, and now admit it was super U.S.
[01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:27.942]  grade, was mailed from Fort Detrick and all the rest of it, and they, you know, had a couple patsies that they tried to sell and they finally killed one of them to make it stick, uh, but
[01:40:28.562 --> 01:40:36.586]  Yeah, that was the first time they did it, and then they had to suspend it because the maker, you know, admittedly had so many problems with their plant.
[01:40:36.586 --> 01:40:40.328]  It was killing so many people, but it wasn't a problem.
[01:40:40.328 --> 01:40:43.189]  They're just seeing if they can do this to you.
[01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:44.630]  Wow, that's amazing.
[01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:50.012]  So, tell folks what it was like to be in the shock for a year, then we'll get Bob's take.
[01:40:50.012 --> 01:40:54.074]  Let me, let me evaluate, let me elaborate a little bit more on this shot.
[01:40:54.074 --> 01:40:57.536]  They gave me the shot, and within an hour I was in the emergency room almost dead.
[01:40:58.257 --> 01:41:03.619]  They had to pump me full of different drugs and stuff to get me out of it.
[01:41:03.619 --> 01:41:09.501]  Well, long story short, about three times a month I would get this reaction, and it would happen just whenever.
[01:41:09.501 --> 01:41:13.642]  It'd wake me up at 2, 3 in the morning, or it happened when I got to work.
[01:41:13.642 --> 01:41:18.704]  And I was covered from head to toe with red spots for up to a year, over a year actually.
[01:41:18.704 --> 01:41:20.805]  Yeah, that was your body battling to get...
[01:41:21.705 --> 01:41:34.330]  I mean, it turned out with that shot, it had, I'm not trying to scare you, look this up, so many cancer viruses and other microplasms in it, that particular shot, that they couldn't even count them all.
[01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:43.673]  I mean, you were shot up with just an incredible bioweapon, and you are now, and all those troops that got it, a walking laboratory experiment.
[01:41:43.673 --> 01:41:46.054]  I mean, they committed an amazing crime against you.
[01:41:46.502 --> 01:41:48.022]  Yeah, my immune system is shot.
[01:41:48.022 --> 01:41:53.404]  I get sick quite often now where before, like when I was in high school, I had a perfect attendance award.
[01:41:53.404 --> 01:41:55.164]  I never missed work.
[01:41:55.164 --> 01:41:59.806]  And then once I got this shot, I was, um, I'm, I'm highly allergic to everything.
[01:41:59.806 --> 01:42:00.926]  So what do you think happened?
[01:42:00.926 --> 01:42:05.287]  Do you think they lied to you and gave you an anthrax and told you it was flu?
[01:42:05.287 --> 01:42:07.328]  Well, I'm not, I'm not 100% sure.
[01:42:07.328 --> 01:42:15.510]  I really can't say, um, because they do these mass flu shots where you, like we would go to the base theater and you would just line up and get them.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.581]  So I don't know if they said, all right, I've got his number.
[01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:20.201]  I'm going to get him a different dose.
[01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:22.082]  And then they lie to you.
[01:42:22.082 --> 01:42:23.963]  Then they lie to you and say it's the law.
[01:42:23.963 --> 01:42:33.086]  You know, the military is the only group when you sign the contract that says they can give approved FDA approved shots.
[01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:35.367]  But it's law, no experimental.
[01:42:35.367 --> 01:42:37.948]  But they just lie to you and shoot you up.
[01:42:37.948 --> 01:42:42.750]  And all the stupid sergeants and captains and majors that take part in it, they're all walking dead, too.
[01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:46.912]  And so I hope they all enjoy following orders because you're dead.
[01:42:46.912 --> 01:42:48.513]  It's going to take a lot of time off your life.
[01:42:48.513 --> 01:42:57.699]  The reason I'm being a straight shooter with you, buddy, is so other people listen and so this stops and so people stop shooting their kids up because they are killing us.
[01:42:57.699 --> 01:43:02.782]  And I'm sorry to talk that harsh to you, but I'm sure you want to warn other people.
[01:43:02.782 --> 01:43:04.683]  What would you do now if you had it all over to do again?
[01:43:05.755 --> 01:43:07.156]  Well, I wouldn't take it, obviously.
[01:43:07.156 --> 01:43:11.639]  But what's kind of funny is I've had this flu shot on a yearly basis.
[01:43:11.639 --> 01:43:17.803]  I was in the military for eight years, and I've had that same flu shot, supposedly, same flu shot every year.
[01:43:17.803 --> 01:43:19.805]  And I've never had any reaction.
[01:43:19.805 --> 01:43:20.225]  Sure, sure.
[01:43:20.225 --> 01:43:23.147]  Well, listen, they also build up, and they're different every year.
[01:43:23.928 --> 01:43:28.289]  And it never, they never guessed the right flu the year before, never works on record.
[01:43:28.289 --> 01:43:33.951]  Each year, lowers your immunity by 50% big Canadian studies, so you just keep lowering it, lowering it.
[01:43:33.951 --> 01:43:39.772]  Three consecutive shots, if you're above the age of 55, major studies, doubles your chances of Alzheimer's.
[01:43:39.772 --> 01:43:48.134]  Most people I talk to, I go, when did your mom or dad really start deteriorating and then you got diagnosed?
[01:43:48.134 --> 01:43:50.255]  They said, I don't know, it was six months ago.
[01:43:51.155 --> 01:43:53.758]  And I said, uh, did they get a flu shot about a week before it?
[01:43:53.758 --> 01:43:55.660]  And they went, that's right, she did.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:00.285]  We thought, oh, I'm like, let me show you right here at the computer.
[01:44:00.285 --> 01:44:01.306]  And I just take them over.
[01:44:01.306 --> 01:44:04.209]  It was a prominent person a few weeks ago I was talking to about this.
[01:44:04.209 --> 01:44:06.711]  And they went, and I'm like, look, there's the studies.
[01:44:07.612 --> 01:44:14.897]  Again, they're murdering us, but they murder us in a way where we crawl off, and then their system can suck money out of us.
[01:44:14.897 --> 01:44:34.269]  But listen, your body may fight it off eventually with the proper vitamins, minerals, and prayer, and cleansing, and things, but at least you're not like the troops in Project Shad, where in some cases, they would take them into a room, nerve gas them, and they'd die on the spot, and then they'd tell their family they died of flu.
[01:44:35.049 --> 01:44:41.872]  So at least you weren't murdered on the spot as part of the patriotic freedom by the criminals that run things.
[01:44:41.872 --> 01:44:43.453]  How does that sound, sir?
[01:44:43.453 --> 01:44:45.234]  Oh, it's great.
[01:44:45.234 --> 01:44:47.075]  Listen, I'm going to get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[01:44:47.075 --> 01:44:49.096]  Bob, you're a veteran yourself.
[01:44:49.096 --> 01:44:50.396]  I know you've studied all this.
[01:44:50.396 --> 01:44:55.919]  What do you think about what the globalists do to people, the little gift they give everybody that keeps giving?
[01:44:55.919 --> 01:45:02.582]  Well, it was like, as I look back, I was lucky I wasn't taken into some of those programs
[01:45:03.685 --> 01:45:05.346]  Well, they really love killing kids.
[01:45:32.813 --> 01:45:35.994]  Well, that's the issue here, is that it's all on record.
[01:45:35.994 --> 01:45:41.156]  And it's not just military, it's foster kids, it's regular kids just getting shots.
[01:45:41.156 --> 01:45:44.878]  And again, you're right, you'd never think the government would do that, this type of betrayal.
[01:45:44.878 --> 01:45:55.202]  But it's not the government, it's the banker, Eugenics Crime Syndicate, that now has reached critical mass and has gotten its people in almost all the major power positions.
[01:45:55.202 --> 01:46:00.584]  That's why it's so refreshing to have a Ron Paul in Congress, or a Senator Paul, or a Walter Jones.
[01:46:01.324 --> 01:46:13.314]  But maybe 50 or so, Ron Paul, I agree with his number, in the House are good, 10 good senators, Rand said when I talked to him today, the interview is coming up.
[01:46:13.314 --> 01:46:17.497]  I mean that's scary, 50 or so members of the House, 10 senators.
[01:46:17.497 --> 01:46:22.301]  All the rest are wanton scum.
[01:46:22.301 --> 01:46:23.062]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:23.835 --> 01:46:25.036]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:25.036 --> 01:46:26.776]  Folks, I want to explain something.
[01:46:26.776 --> 01:46:30.477]  The guys Google everything I'm saying in there or sharp page it, they search it.
[01:46:30.477 --> 01:46:33.879]  They just showed all the Shad documents on TV if you're watching.
[01:46:33.879 --> 01:46:35.319]  I'm not making this up.
[01:46:35.319 --> 01:46:36.980]  I can pull up AP BBC.
[01:46:38.502 --> 01:46:44.648]  And it'll say, yes, in thousands of tests on ships, they sprayed chemical, biological, radiological.
[01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:51.114]  But then if you read deeper and then get into the Department of Energy and other documents, folks, they would kill people.
[01:46:51.114 --> 01:46:56.679]  The media tells you about people they sprayed that, you know, get tumors and die 10, 20 years later.
[01:46:56.679 --> 01:46:57.820]  In many cases, they go,
[01:46:59.907 --> 01:47:09.670]  Alright, you guys show up, we're picking Johnson, Brown, Horowitz, you know, Sanchez.
[01:47:09.670 --> 01:47:27.876]  This Saturday, your leave's cancelled, because I've read the records, I've had some of the survivors on, of some of the tests that weren't as lethal, and then they just march them in, nerve gas them, and they've got these special doctors who then package them, they always send everybody else off on leave, they kill them, and then they dissect their bodies, and then they tell their family they died of flu.
[01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:32.113]  I mean, the magnitude of this evil.
[01:47:32.113 --> 01:47:41.940]  But it's the globalist testing cadres of doctors that will march a young private in and murder them.
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:42.960]  Murder them.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.624]  I mean, this is who runs our government, Bob.
[01:47:47.624 --> 01:47:48.344]  Absolutely.
[01:47:48.344 --> 01:47:51.386]  It's been going on for a long time.
[01:47:51.386 --> 01:47:58.591]  You know, I contend that the only way we're going to take this thing down other than through Congress
[01:48:01.655 --> 01:48:08.465]  Is to have the financial system self-destruct.
[01:48:08.465 --> 01:48:10.648]  And when that happens, they lose their control.
[01:48:11.523 --> 01:48:13.764]  And that's the only way I can see getting to them.
[01:48:13.764 --> 01:48:20.467]  And it's key when it collapses that they don't use it as judo to get even more power posing as saviors.
[01:48:20.467 --> 01:48:23.008]  We've got to demonize them with the truth.
[01:48:23.008 --> 01:48:25.529]  We have got to overrun them with the facts.
[01:48:25.529 --> 01:48:29.951]  We have got to expose them as the murdering terrorists they are, the financial terrorists.
[01:48:29.951 --> 01:48:34.473]  We've got to show they're the real government that hijacked our government.
[01:48:34.473 --> 01:48:39.776]  The buck stops with them, not with Mitt Romney or Obama, these teleprompter reading puppets.
[01:48:40.696 --> 01:48:43.259]  Anything else there?
[01:48:43.259 --> 01:48:45.642]  Well, Nicole's husband who jumped on the phone?
[01:48:45.642 --> 01:48:47.684]  John, hey, I didn't give you the kicker.
[01:48:47.684 --> 01:48:56.094]  I went into the clinic, to the shot clinic, to talk to them about this shot several months after I've been having all these reactions.
[01:48:56.094 --> 01:48:58.176]  And they pulled up my shot record on the computer.
[01:48:58.865 --> 01:48:59.305]  I don't think so.
[01:49:19.192 --> 01:49:20.593]  What do you think of that?
[01:49:20.593 --> 01:49:26.457]  Oh no, the people that are over that know it's killing people in many cases and it's like fun.
[01:49:26.457 --> 01:49:28.398]  It's like a power trip.
[01:49:28.398 --> 01:49:45.971]  Listen, whenever they six years ago lined up the thousand plus kids and their parents in Maryland and Baltimore and said it was the law and had riot cops and dogs barking because it had been a big media issue, saying it's the law, you gotta take the shots, I got the state attorney on.
[01:49:47.199 --> 01:49:50.080]  Who was running it all, and I said, you know there's no law.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:50:01.665]  You know you kick them out for truancy because they haven't had shots, and then use that criminally, even though by law you can't kick them out for truancy when you're the one that kicked them out, and you can't kick them out for no shots.
[01:50:01.665 --> 01:50:03.046]  And he goes, well, you ought to be a lawyer.
[01:50:03.046 --> 01:50:05.627]  That's exactly, it starts laughing.
[01:50:05.627 --> 01:50:11.829]  And he goes, well, the judge had the waiver forms on his desk, but I go, you didn't tell people there were waiver forms.
[01:50:11.829 --> 01:50:15.010]  And he goes, man, you really ought to be one of us, started laughing.
[01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:15.871]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:50:16.756 --> 01:50:19.338]  You, do you give your kids shots?
[01:50:19.338 --> 01:50:21.520]  And he laughed and said, no I don't.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.584]  It's like they think they're winning, because they conned a bunch of people to come in and take shots.
[01:50:26.584 --> 01:50:27.985]  They wouldn't give their own kid.
[01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:32.429]  And then the waiver forms right up on the desk, but they don't tell you.
[01:50:32.429 --> 01:50:39.774]  I mean, and I said to the guy, I said, because we went to break, I said, buddy, you got some bad mojo coming your way.
[01:50:39.774 --> 01:50:40.835]  He's like, what is that, a threat?
[01:50:40.835 --> 01:50:42.296]  And I said, no, man.
[01:50:42.296 --> 01:50:43.938]  I go, you're not going to have to wait to go to hell.
[01:50:45.891 --> 01:50:49.053]  I said, you are going to be judged in this world.
[01:50:49.053 --> 01:50:49.914]  And I could tell it hit him.
[01:50:49.914 --> 01:50:50.654]  And I said, good.
[01:50:50.654 --> 01:50:53.276]  And I said, I'm not talking to you anymore.
[01:50:53.276 --> 01:50:54.837]  And we hung up on him.
[01:50:54.837 --> 01:50:56.618]  We'll be back with more calls with Bob Chapman.
[01:50:56.618 --> 01:50:57.018]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.334 --> 01:51:05.797]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:51:05.797 --> 01:51:07.298]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:51:07.298 --> 01:51:16.184]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:51:16.184 --> 01:51:19.626]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:51:19.626 --> 01:51:20.727]  But take heart.
[01:51:20.727 --> 01:51:24.489]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:51:24.489 --> 01:51:29.453]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:51:29.853 --> 01:51:33.696]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:51:33.696 --> 01:51:35.437]  The globalists are scared.
[01:51:35.437 --> 01:51:36.758]  They've overreached.
[01:51:36.758 --> 01:51:40.281]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:53:03.618 --> 01:53:08.419]  Diesel owners, had enough of hard starts, poor fuel mileage, and poor performance?
[01:53:08.419 --> 01:53:14.041]  The cause is stiction, a gummy residue that clings to injectors like cholesterol clings to arteries.
[01:53:14.041 --> 01:53:17.922]  Stiction robs your diesel engine of power, performance, and gas mileage.
[01:53:17.922 --> 01:53:18.722]  The answer?
[01:53:18.722 --> 01:53:19.882]  Hot shot secret.
[01:53:20.222 --> 01:53:21.504]  This is Lee from Minnesota.
[01:53:21.504 --> 01:53:26.192]  I have a F-350 with a 6.0 diesel, and I had many injector problems and hard starting problems.
[01:53:26.192 --> 01:53:31.640]  After I added Hot Shot Secret, it now starts better, feels stronger, and my mileage went up two miles per gallon.
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.345]  I recommend Hot Shot Secret to anyone with a diesel engine.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:41.381]  Hotshot Secret, the only oil additive engineered to remove stiction in all diesel engines.

[01:54:20.916 --> 01:54:24.981]  Something just hit me between the eyes during the break.
[01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:32.509]  I'm here on air, and I'm telling the story of the police dogs barking, the black uniforms.
[01:54:32.509 --> 01:54:35.832]  It was 1,200 children, over 1,000 parents.
[01:54:35.832 --> 01:54:36.893]  It was over 2,000.
[01:54:36.893 --> 01:54:38.635]  It was on CNN, MSNBC.
[01:54:38.635 --> 01:54:40.297]  It was a big story.
[01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:42.599]  It was a hoax that it's the law to take shots.
[01:54:44.073 --> 01:54:48.395]  And they ran this media hoax to scare everybody at the beginning of the school year.
[01:54:48.395 --> 01:54:49.075]  I think it was like 2007.
[01:54:49.075 --> 01:54:51.616]  That was the year Endgame came out.
[01:54:51.616 --> 01:54:56.697]  So five years ago, almost six years ago.
[01:54:56.697 --> 01:55:01.619]  And I'm there telling that story just now and I feel like a liar.
[01:55:01.619 --> 01:55:03.060]  I saw it on the news.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:07.101]  I had the state attorney on, forget his name, he's a black guy.
[01:55:07.101 --> 01:55:12.063]  It was the state attorney over Prince George County or whatever it's called.
[01:55:12.063 --> 01:55:12.183]  And
[01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:18.295]  It's so incredible that I know that story is exactly true as I just told it.
[01:55:18.295 --> 01:55:23.258]  Might have even been John Harmon board-opping and producing and running the show that day.
[01:55:23.258 --> 01:55:27.580]  He's the guy that gets to hear the behind-the-scenes stuff sometimes.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:30.982]  But still, truth is so wild, I can't believe it.
[01:55:30.982 --> 01:55:37.505]  But it was on the news that they lied, had police dogs out for security, because people have been protesting it.
[01:55:37.505 --> 01:55:39.686]  There were people there trying to warn the parents.
[01:55:39.686 --> 01:55:41.927]  The cops wouldn't let them go up and try to warn them.
[01:55:44.987 --> 01:55:47.092]  And that's when it hits me.
[01:55:47.092 --> 01:55:53.566]  That's why I got mad by the police shutting down the city for five hours for that police officer's motorcade who was killed.
[01:55:54.949 --> 01:55:59.091]  Valiant police officer, great guy from people I know that know him, knew him.
[01:55:59.091 --> 01:56:04.673]  It's that they shut it down on purpose and have this big pageant about how much they care about the police.
[01:56:04.673 --> 01:56:07.374]  And they'll do the same thing for certain military funerals.
[01:56:07.374 --> 01:56:11.015]  But the cops that were killed in Fast and Furious, they didn't have big parades for them.
[01:56:11.015 --> 01:56:15.317]  Because they don't want to make a big deal out of it because it was killed by guns the Attorney General helped ship in.
[01:56:16.434 --> 01:56:17.635]  And that's my point.
[01:56:17.635 --> 01:56:23.681]  They'll have these big, giant pageants for the military and police, but at the end of the day, the system could care less about you.
[01:56:23.681 --> 01:56:25.643]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:56:25.643 --> 01:56:28.426]  Is the bigger the pageant, the new old order puts on?
[01:56:28.426 --> 01:56:31.389]  Like, I'm sure Arte Saavedra actually probably was crying.
[01:56:31.929 --> 01:56:32.169]  Absolutely.
[01:56:32.169 --> 01:56:32.349]  And, uh...
[01:57:01.448 --> 01:57:08.192]  The people who are in the military, the Pentagon, and they're doing it for two reasons.
[01:57:08.192 --> 01:57:11.473]  Number one, to take out is where we're going to have a war next.
[01:57:11.473 --> 01:57:16.436]  And number two, to steal as much as they can.
[01:57:16.436 --> 01:57:16.976]  Exactly.
[01:57:16.976 --> 01:57:19.878]  And I mean, even a lot of the higher up officers aren't bad people.
[01:57:19.878 --> 01:57:21.239]  They're just order takers.
[01:57:21.239 --> 01:57:23.180]  They just follow orders and don't worry about it.
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:25.701]  They're busy playing golf, hanging out with their mistress.
[01:57:25.701 --> 01:57:27.342]  And so what of D.U.
[01:57:27.342 --> 01:57:29.023]  is soft killing all the troops that huff it?
[01:57:29.758 --> 01:57:32.819]  I mean, that is such a huge crime right there.
[01:57:32.819 --> 01:57:45.223]  And that's why when they want me to get up and salute some dead soldier when I get off an airplane and then wait there for 30 minutes, I would be happy to salute them, but I guarantee, and I did, but if I was to go up
[01:57:46.408 --> 01:57:48.289]  Are you going to put my hand over my heart or whatever?
[01:57:48.289 --> 01:57:50.010]  Which is a salute, basically.
[01:57:50.010 --> 01:58:04.676]  If I went up and told all those Austin cops waiting to take that dead Air Force MP out to Fort Hood to be buried, I'll guarantee you if I walked up and said, hey, the troops are breathing DU, it's bad for them, it's killing them, they're not giving them treatment, they'd be like, get out of here, traitor!
[01:58:04.676 --> 01:58:12.780]  See, being patriotic to them is being mindless and going along with the traitorous activity and then acting like you're patriotic.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:14.361]  You see the hypocrisy there, Bob?
[01:58:15.894 --> 01:58:35.488]  I certainly do, and when the minute of confrontation comes, and it will come, between the public and those in the military who are willing to shoot at the public, they're gonna find out that they made the wrong choice.
[01:58:35.488 --> 01:58:41.793]  That's right, those of you that shined on with the devil, you're not gonna like it.

[01:59:48.969 --> 01:59:49.830]  Others don't.
[01:59:54.221 --> 01:59:56.601]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:05.983 --> 02:00:07.303]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.303 --> 02:00:09.064]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.064 --> 02:00:10.824]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.824 --> 02:00:12.404]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.404 --> 02:00:13.944]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.944 --> 02:00:18.145]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.145 --> 02:00:22.266]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:37.857]  Alright, Bob Chapman with us for another 20 minutes or so to take your calls.
[02:00:37.857 --> 02:00:41.962]  And then we're going to get to the big Rand Paul interview.
[02:00:43.697 --> 02:00:45.058]  Yes, Bob Chapman, I got a question for you.
[02:00:45.058 --> 02:00:46.038]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:46.718]  Welcome back to the show.
[02:00:46.718 --> 02:00:49.560]  I was watching Fox and Friends, also known as Fox and Fiends.
[02:01:13.653 --> 02:01:19.055]  And I was listening to how President Obama is now snatching up oceans.
[02:01:19.055 --> 02:01:26.797]  So the United Nations and our government is now not only snatching up land, but oceans.
[02:01:26.797 --> 02:01:29.658]  And I want to see what you think about that.
[02:01:29.658 --> 02:01:43.063]  And what's the difference between Americans during World War I when they refused to take the League of Nations and Americans today who still insist on letting the United Nations
[02:01:43.911 --> 02:01:44.951]  Control things.
[02:01:44.951 --> 02:01:46.392]  Thank you.
[02:01:46.392 --> 02:01:51.073]  The difference is the Globalist had more sophisticated radio and could brainwash the public.
[02:01:51.073 --> 02:01:53.493]  Sorry, go ahead, Bob.
[02:01:53.493 --> 02:02:03.956]  Yeah, as far as the two wars are concerned, most people who were in them or alive are brainwashed.
[02:02:03.956 --> 02:02:09.477]  I mean, that's all I've heard for the last hundred years or less.
[02:02:09.477 --> 02:02:12.138]  And so that's the kind of reaction you would get.
[02:02:13.287 --> 02:02:18.889]  I would go to the American Legion and sit down and start talking to people.
[02:02:18.889 --> 02:02:22.631]  And you can't bring that subject up.
[02:02:22.631 --> 02:02:28.653]  They don't want to know that they were taken advantage of.
[02:02:28.653 --> 02:02:29.714]  The first part of it was what?
[02:02:29.714 --> 02:02:36.597]  What was the other part of your question, sir?
[02:02:36.597 --> 02:02:37.917]  John dropped off.
[02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:41.779]  I mean, I think basically he was asking, why did Americans reject the UN?
[02:02:46.015 --> 02:02:54.317]  I think because you had different kind of people.
[02:02:54.317 --> 02:02:59.758]  America changed at over 50 years.
[02:02:59.758 --> 02:03:07.580]  They didn't have the kind of propaganda during the late teens and early 20s.
[02:03:08.982 --> 02:03:17.586]  Yeah, it was just print, but then they had newsreels and radio and it had gotten really slick at brainwashing.
[02:03:17.586 --> 02:03:27.990]  I think Madison M. must have gotten 50-75% of their business from the government putting together those programs to brainwash people.
[02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:33.952]  I know when I was taking advertising in college, we discussed it.
[02:03:33.952 --> 02:03:37.994]  And then later, books came out on brainwashing.
[02:03:39.429 --> 02:03:46.873]  And what the Chinese and North Koreans have done, and never mentioning what the U.S.
[02:03:46.873 --> 02:03:47.293]  has done.
[02:03:47.293 --> 02:03:49.874]  You know, that's a good point.
[02:03:49.874 --> 02:03:59.900]  That brainwashing, Eber Bernays, Madison Avenue, all of that's on record, but the public's brainwashed to think brainwashing doesn't exist.
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:04.442]  We live in a brainwashed country.
[02:04:04.442 --> 02:04:06.583]  For sure.
[02:04:06.583 --> 02:04:08.204]  To believe the
[02:04:10.346 --> 02:04:14.370]  Well, these are medical victims.
[02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:18.295]  I mean, that's why I used to really get mad at sheep when they'd laugh at me and stuff.
[02:04:18.295 --> 02:04:21.578]  Now it's like a retarded child laughing at me.
[02:04:21.578 --> 02:04:23.160]  I mean, I'm sad for them.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.082]  I'm like, literally, I'm like, oh dear.
[02:04:26.027 --> 02:04:29.671]  Fifteen years ago, somebody would laugh at me, call me a tinfoil hat wearer.
[02:04:29.671 --> 02:04:32.433]  I would kind of go, hey buddy, this is serious.
[02:04:32.433 --> 02:04:33.614]  Don't laugh at me.
[02:04:33.614 --> 02:04:35.616]  Now I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, they got you.
[02:04:35.616 --> 02:04:37.658]  And they just smile at pre-programmed.
[02:04:37.658 --> 02:04:39.500]  I'm like, oh, you're a victim.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.442]  I mean, really, they are.
[02:04:41.442 --> 02:04:43.444]  These are victims, folks.
[02:04:43.444 --> 02:04:47.007]  These are poor, mindless, brainwashed, helpless little victims.
[02:04:48.368 --> 02:04:51.874]  All right, we'll be right back with more of your phone calls straight ahead.
[02:04:51.874 --> 02:04:53.978]  Again, the CIA, all of it.
[02:04:53.978 --> 02:04:55.942]  Foreign banker run.
[02:04:55.942 --> 02:04:58.025]  America has been captured.
[02:04:58.025 --> 02:04:59.027]  We've got to get it back.
[02:04:59.027 --> 02:04:59.608]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.403 --> 02:05:08.627]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:05:08.627 --> 02:05:26.517]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:05:26.517 --> 02:05:30.619]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:05:30.899 --> 02:05:32.680]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:40.846]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:07:00.918 --> 02:07:05.460]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:09.802]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.802 --> 02:07:15.544]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.544 --> 02:07:16.305]  It's true.
[02:07:16.305 --> 02:07:20.847]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.167 --> 02:07:21.987]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.987 --> 02:07:25.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.568 --> 02:07:29.489]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.489 --> 02:07:30.269]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.269 --> 02:07:33.030]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:36.711]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.711 --> 02:07:37.511]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.511 --> 02:07:41.652]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.652 --> 02:07:46.413]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.693 --> 02:07:50.876]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.876 --> 02:07:52.657]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.657 --> 02:07:54.919]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:07:57.741 --> 02:08:05.125]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:05.125 --> 02:08:07.987]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.461 --> 02:08:25.047]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, we're gonna air an exclusive interview.
[02:08:26.485 --> 02:08:33.111]  With the senator from the great state of Kentucky, Rand Paul, on a host of issues.
[02:08:33.111 --> 02:08:35.373]  This is going to be a newsworthy interview.
[02:08:35.373 --> 02:08:36.554]  You better believe it.
[02:08:36.554 --> 02:08:38.616]  He talks about his father's campaign.
[02:08:38.616 --> 02:08:39.536]  He talks about the U.N.
[02:08:39.536 --> 02:08:44.200]  takeover of America and Interpol, the TSA.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:47.183]  He gets into will he ever run for president.
[02:08:47.183 --> 02:08:53.989]  He also talks about would he accept an invitation to run as vice president with Mitt Romney.
[02:08:56.141 --> 02:08:58.442]  I'm not very good at hyping things, actually, folks.
[02:08:58.442 --> 02:09:03.245]  I'm good at seeing reality and really cutting down to what it is.
[02:09:03.245 --> 02:09:10.429]  But I should have been telling you that from the very beginning of the show today if I wanted to have everybody stay right through to the end of the show.
[02:09:10.429 --> 02:09:15.712]  But because this is important information coming up with Rand Paul.
[02:09:15.712 --> 02:09:18.994]  Bob Chapman's our guest taking phone calls right now.
[02:09:18.994 --> 02:09:23.036]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ivan in Florida.
[02:09:23.036 --> 02:09:23.977]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:29.151]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:09:29.151 --> 02:09:29.431]  Good!
[02:09:29.431 --> 02:09:42.319]  I heard your show the other day with Wesley Rawls, and my question is, how do you prepare if you're either renting or you have a high mortgage in your home for the coming economics collapse?
[02:09:42.319 --> 02:09:54.027]  Well, there's just a very good chance it could get Great Depression level, and for folks that don't know, 7 million people starved to death or died from complications from malnutrition.
[02:09:54.027 --> 02:09:55.608]  That's university numbers, you can look them up.
[02:09:57.217 --> 02:10:03.460]  And I've already gone over the fact that 90% or close to it are not self-sufficient.
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:09.123]  So it's just good to have a firearm with ammo.
[02:10:09.123 --> 02:10:12.365]  To have a couple of firearms if you can afford it.
[02:10:12.365 --> 02:10:15.467]  And it's good to have some extra food and a water filter.
[02:10:16.335 --> 02:10:18.416]  And by the way, we have the best water filter out there.
[02:10:18.416 --> 02:10:20.696]  It's the ProPure Gravity Fed System.
[02:10:20.696 --> 02:10:23.457]  Of all the gravity systems, there's some good ones out there.
[02:10:23.457 --> 02:10:24.537]  This is the next generation.
[02:10:24.537 --> 02:10:25.798]  It's what I personally use.
[02:10:25.798 --> 02:10:27.118]  It's what we use here.
[02:10:27.118 --> 02:10:29.239]  It's what we use on the RV.
[02:10:29.239 --> 02:10:30.759]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:10:30.759 --> 02:10:33.240]  And your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:38.201]  Haven't done a plug for anything in two hours plus, so might as well just tell you about ProPure.
[02:10:38.201 --> 02:10:41.882]  And there's a video up there where I break it down at Infowars.com.
[02:10:41.882 --> 02:10:43.163]  But water filters
[02:10:43.963 --> 02:10:56.807]  Uh, whatever you can afford, some basic food that stores, but more importantly, as Mr. Rawls said, friends and neighbors or country cousins that if things got really bad, you can go there and work with them.
[02:10:56.807 --> 02:11:03.809]  Um, so I, you know, that's kind of my backup plan is I live in the somewhat of the country now, but still it's only.
[02:11:05.427 --> 02:11:05.647]  No, I don't.
[02:11:22.012 --> 02:11:26.914]  So, I mean, I'm really got the water, rainwater collection.
[02:11:26.914 --> 02:11:29.574]  I've really been putting in the solar.
[02:11:29.574 --> 02:11:31.035]  I'm really moved to the country.
[02:11:31.035 --> 02:11:37.097]  I really put a wall and fence around my house proper and then a fence around the property itself was already there.
[02:11:37.097 --> 02:11:40.918]  I mean, I'm really, really know this is real.
[02:11:40.918 --> 02:11:42.579]  Bob Chapman, you want to tackle that question?
[02:11:42.579 --> 02:11:46.700]  I think you've covered it pretty well.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:47.960]  I mean, I've done the same thing.
[02:11:50.413 --> 02:12:13.409]  And I think even if you don't know people well, that when they're frugal and if they have the basics to be able to compete in a terrible environment, it's in your best interest to feed them and arm them.
[02:12:14.892 --> 02:12:22.937]  But I mean, even if it's a flash crash, instead of this slow slide into depression, that'll take generally a few weeks to start getting crazy.
[02:12:22.937 --> 02:12:26.860]  Even the big crash of 29, it didn't get wild for a couple years.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:32.224]  So, generally, in fact, in almost all cases, it takes a while for this to unroll.
[02:12:32.224 --> 02:12:36.807]  The problem is, you got about 2% getting prepped now.
[02:12:36.807 --> 02:12:37.647]  If it goes to 4% or so,
[02:12:39.898 --> 02:12:43.499]  All the actuary show, everything will skyrocket in price.
[02:12:43.499 --> 02:12:44.700]  You won't be able to get it.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:46.181]  The supply chains aren't there.
[02:12:46.181 --> 02:12:58.525]  Can you imagine if we have a real depression versus people in the 30s, on average, hardworking, very Christian, very moral, chop wood all day for, you know, a meal in the country.
[02:12:58.525 --> 02:12:59.686]  I've already had all the wood chops.
[02:12:59.686 --> 02:13:01.987]  Sorry, I don't have enough food, you know, to give you a meal.
[02:13:01.987 --> 02:13:06.769]  I mean, my family in the country, in the middle of nowhere, on dirt roads,
[02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:11.913]  Had city people coming by all the time wanting help in the 30s.
[02:13:11.913 --> 02:13:20.482]  I mean, and crime went up and almost all the deer and rabbits and squirrels were gone at the end of the Great Depression.
[02:13:20.482 --> 02:13:31.032]  You know, middle class people, my great grandparents went out and out of season, you know, shot deer and stuff and everybody did it because there wasn't food at the store and you didn't have the money to go 25 miles into town.
[02:13:32.593 --> 02:13:35.854]  You know, and a lot of the delivery things, you know, stopped coming.
[02:13:35.854 --> 02:13:37.915]  Because they always had trucks that brought, you know, food out and stuff.
[02:13:37.915 --> 02:13:39.096]  You could buy staples.
[02:13:39.096 --> 02:13:41.697]  You know, salesmen, traveling salesmen selling food.
[02:13:41.697 --> 02:13:43.837]  I mean, things really shut down for a while.
[02:13:43.837 --> 02:13:46.599]  Grapes of Wrath is exactly what it's like.
[02:13:46.599 --> 02:13:52.901]  People basically living in slave camps, where you can leave and go starve, or you can work here as a slave and get ripped off.
[02:13:52.901 --> 02:13:55.442]  Grapes of Wrath is not an exaggeration.
[02:13:55.442 --> 02:13:56.662]  It got a lot worse than that.
[02:13:58.343 --> 02:14:01.025]  Folks, you need to understand this is real.
[02:14:01.025 --> 02:14:05.349]  And what's going to happen is people aren't going to be able to pay the taxes in the rural areas.
[02:14:05.349 --> 02:14:10.813]  And the feds are going to come with the locals to take the property and they're going to get their butt shot off.
[02:14:10.813 --> 02:14:17.359]  Because people aren't going to leave their land and go bankrupt because the government wants some tax money nobody can pay.
[02:14:17.359 --> 02:14:19.801]  Bob Chapman.
[02:14:19.801 --> 02:14:22.002]  Absolutely.
[02:14:22.002 --> 02:14:24.845]  And that might even happen in the city as well.
[02:14:24.845 --> 02:14:27.647]  But it's more prone to happen in the country.
[02:14:28.484 --> 02:14:43.642]  Yeah, and you know they can't send 20 or 30 Homeland Security people or local police to each home that they are homestead that they want to take over.
[02:14:44.110 --> 02:14:54.813]  Well, the police in most cases now are refusing to throw a 90-year-old woman out of a house that the banks foreclosed on, just because they can't do it.
[02:14:54.813 --> 02:14:56.553]  They actually have humanity.
[02:14:56.553 --> 02:15:03.395]  And so, look, I believe when things get really bad, you're going to see the best in many people.
[02:15:03.395 --> 02:15:07.135]  I believe the police and military are going to be on our side, by and large.
[02:15:07.135 --> 02:15:13.377]  That's why the system is going to bring in mercenaries, and they're going to stage PSYOPs to demonize the American people.
[02:15:13.757 --> 02:15:18.718]  They're going to blow up police stations and shoot cops to try to blame the patriots for it.
[02:15:18.718 --> 02:15:29.760]  And I hope the police are sophisticated enough to know, in most cases, especially if the media is ready to jump on it and ready to roll out, and it's a spectacular massacre, know it's staged.
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.220]  Bob Chapman.
[02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.761]  Agreed.
[02:15:33.761 --> 02:15:41.962]  There'll be great retaliation by people with broom handles, as well as other things.
[02:15:42.833 --> 02:15:53.237]  Of course that's not going to do much if you get 20 people well armed who are going to take possession of your farm or your home for that matter.
[02:15:53.237 --> 02:15:54.838]  And so you've got to be prepared.
[02:15:54.838 --> 02:15:58.640]  That's what Alex has been talking about for the last 15 minutes.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.480]  Don't wait.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.922]  Get it done now.
[02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:09.584]  And a lot of that's just being prepared mentally.
[02:16:09.584 --> 02:16:11.805]  Because... Mental training is something
[02:16:13.217 --> 02:16:16.239]  It's not easy for people.
[02:16:16.239 --> 02:16:23.505]  Usually they learn the difference between what's good and what's bad when the first shot is fired.
[02:16:23.505 --> 02:16:26.227]  And they say, how do I use this thing?
[02:16:26.227 --> 02:16:30.170]  Tell me how to sight in so I can shoot people with it.
[02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:34.013]  That's usually the learning curve for maybe 40% of the population.
[02:16:37.048 --> 02:16:39.110]  Yeah, let me tell you, I'm down here in Texas, Bob.
[02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:42.832]  Almost anybody I know from Texas is a pretty good shot.
[02:16:42.832 --> 02:16:43.993]  It's pretty scary.
[02:16:43.993 --> 02:16:46.255]  And I know it's like that in a lot of other rural areas.
[02:16:46.255 --> 02:17:00.806]  The standard deal in Texas, this is standard, is you're stuck, you sit on, in between granddaddy's legs, when you're four years old and shoot Folgers coffee cans, one after the other with a .410, to teach you the power of a firearm.
[02:17:00.806 --> 02:17:02.207]  Then you're told, don't touch.
[02:17:03.442 --> 02:17:04.183]  Well our kids grew up that way.
[02:17:04.183 --> 02:17:05.043]  And we didn't live in Texas.
[02:17:32.715 --> 02:17:38.517]  And then in California, but I did the same thing.
[02:17:38.517 --> 02:17:42.859]  Same age, four years old.
[02:17:42.859 --> 02:17:52.363]  Now one of the interesting things was the first time my son shot a pistol at four.
[02:17:52.363 --> 02:17:57.064]  And it was a revolver.
[02:17:57.064 --> 02:18:00.986]  And I pulled the hammer back and put my finger over his finger
[02:18:02.011 --> 02:18:02.873]  I don't know.
[02:18:18.837 --> 02:18:21.601]  Yeah, it's people that you've got to show a four-year-old.
[02:18:21.601 --> 02:18:22.382]  That's the age.
[02:18:22.382 --> 02:18:26.949]  It goes all the way back to the founding of this country and before.
[02:18:26.949 --> 02:18:30.614]  Back then they had to have the rifle right out in the open there in a little log cabin.
[02:18:30.614 --> 02:18:34.660]  And you had to have kids by age five knowing how to use it because a lot of times daddy and mommy were gone.
[02:18:35.581 --> 02:18:40.384]  And there's a lot of cases of five-year-olds, you know, shooting marauders and things like that.
[02:18:40.384 --> 02:18:42.745]  Many cases of it.
[02:18:42.745 --> 02:18:50.850]  And so you had to show them, this is not a toy, you don't play with it, and this is the end you point, and this is where you pull the trigger, and you shove this into your shoulder.
[02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:55.132]  And if they don't listen the first time, that hurt, didn't it?
[02:18:55.132 --> 02:18:57.673]  Shove it into your shoulder.
[02:18:57.673 --> 02:18:58.574]  And that's how it's done.
[02:19:02.210 --> 02:19:08.595]  And then I see these full grown adults who see a gun and literally go into panic fear, Bob.
[02:19:08.595 --> 02:19:10.096]  Well, it's preconditioning.
[02:19:10.096 --> 02:19:20.945]  You know, they get into that mindset and I don't want to know until they start taking incoming fire.
[02:19:20.945 --> 02:19:24.388]  And then, you know, they say, well, how can I help?
[02:19:24.388 --> 02:19:27.190]  I'm going to take this 16 here.
[02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:28.171]  Well, how does it work?
[02:19:28.171 --> 02:19:29.352]  Just pull the trigger.
[02:19:29.352 --> 02:19:29.732]  It'll work.
[02:19:32.498 --> 02:19:34.960]  Surprising what good shots women are.
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:37.321]  Women, on average, I'm learning, are even better shots than men.
[02:19:37.321 --> 02:19:41.083]  And that's the truth.
[02:19:41.083 --> 02:19:43.485]  Well, Bob Chapman... I've always done a better shot.
[02:19:43.485 --> 02:19:45.046]  Bob, I'm sorry to hear your voice is out.
[02:19:45.046 --> 02:19:46.467]  Thanks for doing this with us.
[02:19:46.467 --> 02:19:48.368]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, folks.
[02:19:48.368 --> 02:19:49.128]  Find out more there.
[02:19:49.128 --> 02:19:50.349]  Or give Midas a call.
[02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:51.330]  They'll give you a free copy.
[02:19:51.330 --> 02:19:51.550]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:55.732]  Bob, we'll talk to you in the next few weeks.
[02:19:55.732 --> 02:19:56.913]  Thank you for the time.
[02:19:56.913 --> 02:19:58.394]  Let your voice get done.
[02:19:58.394 --> 02:19:59.615]  Quit doing so many interviews.
[02:19:59.615 --> 02:20:00.415]  Get some rest.
[02:20:00.415 --> 02:20:00.896]  We'll be back.
[02:20:01.596 --> 02:20:02.897]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.897 --> 02:20:08.500]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:13.522]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.522 --> 02:20:13.982]  It's true.
[02:20:13.982 --> 02:20:18.545]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:19.085 --> 02:20:24.309]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:26.630]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:31.433]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.433 --> 02:20:32.534]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.534 --> 02:20:35.616]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.616 --> 02:20:39.239]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:39.239 --> 02:20:42.401]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:42.401 --> 02:20:44.622]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:44.622 --> 02:20:45.543]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:49.185 --> 02:20:50.627]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:50.627 --> 02:20:58.256]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:58.256 --> 02:21:00.659]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:08.322]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:21:08.322 --> 02:21:10.443]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:21:10.443 --> 02:21:14.084]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:21:14.084 --> 02:21:18.586]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:21:18.586 --> 02:21:21.707]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:21:21.707 --> 02:21:26.309]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:32.311]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:21:32.651 --> 02:21:34.551]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:42.813]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:21:42.813 --> 02:21:45.853]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[02:21:45.853 --> 02:21:48.254]  So get one for you and one for a loved one.
[02:21:48.254 --> 02:21:51.254]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:21:51.254 --> 02:21:56.995]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[02:21:56.995 --> 02:21:58.576]  Faketv.com.
[02:21:58.576 --> 02:21:59.876]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:22:02.199 --> 02:22:07.241]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:22:07.241 --> 02:22:12.563]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[02:22:30.285 --> 02:22:31.526]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.526 --> 02:22:36.109]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.109 --> 02:22:41.913]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.913 --> 02:22:45.555]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.555 --> 02:22:48.377]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.377 --> 02:22:53.320]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:53.581]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.581 --> 02:22:54.982]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.725 --> 02:23:02.206]  Are you storing food?
[02:23:02.206 --> 02:23:08.370]  Prepared families are storing food for months and years, but only have enough fuel stored for days or weeks.
[02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:12.792]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with the Sun Oven.
[02:23:12.792 --> 02:23:19.336]  Food can be baked, boiled, or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun.
[02:23:19.336 --> 02:23:22.258]  You can use the sun for 50 to 80 percent of your cooking.
[02:23:22.598 --> 02:23:25.679]  Allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[02:23:25.679 --> 02:23:29.621]  Sun-baked foods stay moister and have less shrinkage and do not burn.
[02:23:29.621 --> 02:23:32.302]  Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent.
[02:23:32.302 --> 02:23:35.684]  And sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:23:35.684 --> 02:23:39.826]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification or personal hygiene.
[02:23:39.826 --> 02:23:44.248]  For the past 26 years, sun ovens have been proudly made in the U.S.
[02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:44.888]  They're durable.
[02:23:45.228 --> 02:23:49.594]  Have a long life and come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
[02:23:49.594 --> 02:23:51.938]  Don't be fooled by cheap imitations.

[02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:46.935]  We are back live, taking some more phone calls before I air the Rand Paul interview with the Senator earlier today.
[02:24:46.935 --> 02:24:51.998]  Let's go ahead and go to Ghost in Illinois.
[02:24:51.998 --> 02:24:52.899]  Ghost, you're on the air.
[02:24:54.844 --> 02:24:55.704]  Thanks Alex.
[02:24:55.704 --> 02:24:58.025]  I'd like to thank you for your inspiration.
[02:24:58.025 --> 02:25:06.546]  I'd like to thank you for giving the resistance, the tools, and the information we need to fight this globalist scum.
[02:25:06.546 --> 02:25:08.587]  I'm known as Ghost in the Biker World.
[02:25:08.587 --> 02:25:10.467]  I reach out to the bikers.
[02:25:10.467 --> 02:25:12.987]  And I'm the CB Radio Channel 19.
[02:25:12.987 --> 02:25:14.728]  I'm Paul Revere.
[02:25:14.728 --> 02:25:19.448]  And I just thank you once again for the inspiration that helped save my country, Alex.
[02:25:19.448 --> 02:25:21.709]  I got four bullet points.
[02:25:21.709 --> 02:25:22.009]  Go ahead.
[02:25:23.854 --> 02:25:35.790]  Well, the first one is with tomorrow being the anniversary of Paul Revere's ride, I'm proposing a National Infowars Flag Day from now on, on 4-19.
[02:25:37.896 --> 02:25:59.145]  And the second one is, last week you were talking about putting Bill Gates and David Rockefeller's picture up on the wall so we know who the enemies of humanity are, and I'm proposing that we make an InfoWars deck of cards with the enemies of humanity, and we both know who the Joker is.
[02:25:59.145 --> 02:26:00.025]  And number three,
[02:26:02.398 --> 02:26:17.633]  Noticed on one of your decals that I bought for my car I bought I buy hundreds of your decals that you are the resistance decal in the bottom horizontally you have InfoWars.com in a real small print
[02:26:18.357 --> 02:26:34.540]  I'm saying if we could take that little small print InfoWars.com and put it vertically on one decal, we could have 20 to 30 little InfoWars decals to put in bathrooms, to put in... No, no, I got it.
[02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:45.063]  Have a regular bumper sticker with InfoWars.com over and over again on it, vertically, so you can sit there and cut them off as little pieces.
[02:26:45.063 --> 02:26:45.963]  Amen, brother.
[02:26:48.732 --> 02:26:50.053]  That's my public point.
[02:27:05.106 --> 02:27:07.990]  And it's like we're just political and we just say that.
[02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:21.370]  We're in resistance against a global government run by banks whose policy is to bankrupt the individual, destroy national sovereignty, destroy the family, and inject everybody with cancer viruses on record.
[02:27:22.509 --> 02:27:25.013]  And if you're a new listener and heard that and are like, what?
[02:27:25.013 --> 02:27:27.337]  Just look, cancer viruses and vaccines.
[02:27:27.337 --> 02:27:32.826]  You'll get ABC, BBC, but it's all, oh yes, millions get cancer from it, but it's no big deal.
[02:27:32.826 --> 02:27:34.148]  They're doing it on purpose.
[02:27:34.148 --> 02:27:35.290]  I have all the documents.
[02:27:36.121 --> 02:27:40.564]  And again, I go back to, they kill troops in experiments.
[02:27:40.564 --> 02:27:41.865]  This is not our government.
[02:27:41.865 --> 02:27:49.310]  It's a group of criminals organized around science and this mutual admiration club that they're geniuses.
[02:27:49.310 --> 02:27:52.092]  It's mad scientists who think they're God.
[02:27:52.092 --> 02:27:54.073]  That's what the New World Order is.
[02:27:54.073 --> 02:27:58.757]  Financed by a bunch of crazy bankers that took over through fraud.
[02:27:58.757 --> 02:28:00.398]  And world government's here.
[02:28:00.398 --> 02:28:01.779]  Ghost, good to hear from you.
[02:28:01.779 --> 02:28:03.380]  Lloyd in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[02:28:04.619 --> 02:28:05.580]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:07.101]  Good!
[02:28:07.101 --> 02:28:22.334]  Um, yeah, I live over by, uh, some military base in, uh, southeastern Wisconsin, and for the past couple months I've been hearing gunfire pretty frequently around seven o'clock, from seven o'clock in the morning till...
[02:28:23.021 --> 02:28:24.803]  About 11 o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:28:24.803 --> 02:28:31.308]  A couple times I would hear it at night, around 11 o'clock at night to about 1 o'clock in the morning.
[02:28:31.308 --> 02:28:41.255]  I'd call the local police departments around here, ask them questions about if they know anything that's going on over there, and I get nothing but stupid answers, like they have no idea.
[02:28:41.255 --> 02:28:44.378]  Well, of course, you're the enemy, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[02:28:44.378 --> 02:28:46.619]  You're the enemy.
[02:28:46.619 --> 02:28:47.340]  You're the enemy.
[02:28:49.542 --> 02:28:51.243]  Number one, I'll explain what that means.
[02:28:51.243 --> 02:29:00.349]  Number one, the people at the local police department, they're compartmentalized, they don't know what's going on, but you're still seen as pretty much the enemy.
[02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:07.234]  The public is one group, they're another, and lying to you is just all part of the art of war.
[02:29:07.234 --> 02:29:08.835]  The military lies to its own people.
[02:29:09.775 --> 02:29:11.136]  The generals get lied to.
[02:29:11.136 --> 02:29:12.377]  It's all about betrayal.
[02:29:12.377 --> 02:29:13.878]  It's all about dishonor.
[02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:15.399]  It's all about deception.
[02:29:15.399 --> 02:29:16.840]  It's all about lies.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:18.501]  It's all about scams.
[02:29:18.501 --> 02:29:23.124]  Look at how the TSA constantly says, we don't naked scan, and they do.
[02:29:23.124 --> 02:29:24.545]  We don't save it, get caught.
[02:29:24.545 --> 02:29:26.246]  We don't strip old women, get caught.
[02:29:26.246 --> 02:29:28.008]  We don't grope children, get caught.
[02:29:28.008 --> 02:29:30.649]  We don't steal products, get caught.
[02:29:30.649 --> 02:29:32.671]  We're going to stop naked scanning.
[02:29:32.671 --> 02:29:34.792]  Just on and on and on.
[02:29:34.792 --> 02:29:38.095]  The day they rolled out the scanners, that they already had it scheduled to roll it out,
[02:29:39.164 --> 02:29:44.971]  They launched the underwear bombing as a way to... I mean, they even have PR rollouts.
[02:29:44.971 --> 02:29:48.195]  If you're conscious, it's completely obvious.
[02:29:48.195 --> 02:29:49.677]  Okay?
[02:29:49.677 --> 02:29:50.818]  Rand Paul, coming up.
[02:29:50.818 --> 02:29:52.220]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:53.822]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.822 --> 02:29:57.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:09.199 --> 02:33:11.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:24.722]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:24.722 --> 02:33:27.324]  until 2 p.m.
[02:33:27.324 --> 02:33:30.026]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:30.026 --> 02:33:32.127]  We are here.
[02:33:32.127 --> 02:33:35.690]  Again, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:43.215]  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky took some time out to be interviewed by me this morning.
[02:33:44.486 --> 02:33:49.730]  And we're going to premiere that interview here on the radio in just a few minutes.
[02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:55.373]  And it will basically take us out of this hour, because it's a 21-minute long interview.
[02:33:55.373 --> 02:34:00.337]  Again, I started the show today with this news headline from InfoWars.com.
[02:34:00.337 --> 02:34:03.759]  It's also at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:34:03.759 --> 02:34:09.543]  Big Sis launches undercover TSA spies to ride Houston buses.
[02:34:10.916 --> 02:34:15.298]  Feds to watch for suspicious activity, pre-crime behavior.
[02:34:15.298 --> 02:34:17.198]  And they say general crime.
[02:34:17.198 --> 02:34:24.981]  The feds and the buses all over the country, including Houston, now have giant billboards on the side
[02:34:27.381 --> 02:34:32.888]  It was decal wraps of TSA agents smiling at you saying, keeping America safe.
[02:34:32.888 --> 02:34:34.529]  I mean, total creepville.
[02:34:34.529 --> 02:34:36.612]  They're not even sworn bonded peace officers.
[02:34:36.612 --> 02:34:37.934]  They're not FBI.
[02:34:37.934 --> 02:34:38.775]  They're not bonded.
[02:34:38.775 --> 02:34:40.116]  They're not sworn.
[02:34:40.116 --> 02:34:40.997]  They're not trained.
[02:34:42.045 --> 02:34:48.050]  That's why they create a new group where there's no history of teaching the Bill of Rights and Constitution or due process.
[02:34:48.050 --> 02:34:53.015]  Even though the FBI and a lot of police are out of control, there's at least lip service paid to that.
[02:34:53.015 --> 02:34:57.399]  No, they teach them, they have administrative rights to do anything they want to you.
[02:34:57.399 --> 02:34:58.500]  It is wild!
[02:35:01.391 --> 02:35:05.556]  When I had the TSA agent say, I'm going to grope you or you're not going to fly.
[02:35:05.556 --> 02:35:07.198]  And I said, but it violates Fourth Amendment.
[02:35:07.198 --> 02:35:09.581]  He goes, I have administrative rights.
[02:35:09.581 --> 02:35:10.683]  And said, so you can leave.
[02:35:10.683 --> 02:35:14.628]  By the way, when that happens, they try to fine you or arrest you.
[02:35:14.628 --> 02:35:16.790]  Or you're going to let me do this.
[02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:20.115]  And it was bizarre, the getting off on it.
[02:35:20.882 --> 02:35:22.183]  I mean, this is the country we live in.
[02:35:22.183 --> 02:35:27.566]  And now, right out of classical police states, people keep saying we're about to be a police state.
[02:35:27.566 --> 02:35:27.987]  No, no.
[02:35:27.987 --> 02:35:29.047]  We are one.
[02:35:29.047 --> 02:35:35.312]  The IRS can grab your bank account without a judge, without a jury, without a trial.
[02:35:35.312 --> 02:35:37.333]  You're in a police state.
[02:35:37.333 --> 02:35:39.715]  The government can grope you.
[02:35:39.715 --> 02:35:40.615]  You're in a police state.
[02:35:40.615 --> 02:35:42.617]  They can pull you over to a warrantless checkpoint.
[02:35:42.617 --> 02:35:44.458]  You're in a police state.
[02:35:44.458 --> 02:35:49.301]  They can say that the President's launching wars and that Congress has no authority over it.
[02:35:49.301 --> 02:35:50.602]  You're in a dictatorship.
[02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:55.306]  Now Obama, the puppet, may leave.
[02:35:55.306 --> 02:35:58.349]  They'll put a new puppet, financed by the very same banks in there.
[02:35:58.349 --> 02:36:01.272]  His name's Mitt Romney.
[02:36:01.272 --> 02:36:12.124]  Now somebody that I can tell you that is not bought and paid for by the New World Order, somebody who's kept their promises, is Senator Rand Paul, and of course, Ron Paul.
[02:36:12.124 --> 02:36:16.028]  And I said from the beginning, win, lose, or draw, we win by Ron Paul running.
[02:36:17.557 --> 02:36:24.403]  When he first ran four years ago, the first time, maybe 5% of the population knew about the Federal Reserve being private, hijacking our country.
[02:36:24.403 --> 02:36:25.744]  Now it's over 90%.
[02:36:25.744 --> 02:36:27.526]  We've had a victory period.
[02:36:27.526 --> 02:36:35.553]  And Ron Paul staying in keeps him in the debates, keeps him out there injecting real issues, talking to crowds of 8 to 10 to 12,000 people.
[02:36:37.728 --> 02:36:41.251]  The one thing I didn't raise that ran, because I ran out of time, was the election fraud.
[02:36:41.251 --> 02:36:42.612]  Clearly in May in Iowa.
[02:36:42.612 --> 02:36:50.339]  But the fact that they had to steal it early on, to make him look like a loser, to give it to Romney, shows how desperate the system is.
[02:36:50.339 --> 02:36:53.662]  Ron Paul, early on, was the frontrunner.
[02:36:53.662 --> 02:36:56.664]  He was the frontrunner in every actuary and poll.
[02:36:56.664 --> 02:36:58.186]  So you saw it stolen.
[02:36:58.186 --> 02:37:03.911]  But by getting in the arena, we exposed it's rigged, and we exposed the New World Order.
[02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:04.911]  So it's happening.
[02:37:05.717 --> 02:37:06.877]  And look at his son.
[02:37:06.877 --> 02:37:08.678]  The whole system went after him.
[02:37:08.678 --> 02:37:11.338]  It blew up in their face in Kentucky.
[02:37:11.338 --> 02:37:15.099]  First, the Republicans tried to block him in the primary, then the Democrats did.
[02:37:15.099 --> 02:37:17.759]  Bill Clinton went and campaigned against him.
[02:37:17.759 --> 02:37:22.620]  It only gave Rand more credibility.
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:24.821]  And he went up the polls.
[02:37:24.821 --> 02:37:30.062]  And when there's a landslide, they have trouble with a 15-point lead cheating somebody.
[02:37:32.011 --> 02:37:36.292]  So the system is having to cheat more and more, but it's exposing them.
[02:37:36.292 --> 02:37:38.113]  Here is this in-depth interview.
[02:37:38.113 --> 02:37:40.354]  We cover the waterfront.
[02:37:40.354 --> 02:37:43.915]  Would he run with Mitt Romney?
[02:37:43.915 --> 02:37:46.676]  What's happening with the UN and Interpol?
[02:37:46.676 --> 02:37:48.337]  The election.
[02:37:48.337 --> 02:37:49.057]  His father.
[02:37:51.212 --> 02:37:52.713]  The Buffett Rule.
[02:37:52.713 --> 02:37:54.794]  We cover so many subjects.
[02:37:54.794 --> 02:37:58.456]  Best interview I've ever done with Senator Rand Paul.
[02:37:58.456 --> 02:38:01.878]  I've only done a few since he's been elected senator because he's so busy.
[02:38:01.878 --> 02:38:09.822]  But here is Senator Rand Paul premiering here at Infowars.com radio.
[02:38:12.270 --> 02:38:13.891]  We are joined by U.S.
[02:38:13.891 --> 02:38:17.114]  Senator hailing from Kentucky, Rand Paul.
[02:38:17.114 --> 02:38:27.201]  And the freshman senator, as everyone has noticed, has actually been fulfilling his campaign promises to try to cut government and restore our constitutional republic.
[02:38:27.201 --> 02:38:30.424]  And he joins us from Washington, D.C.
[02:38:30.424 --> 02:38:32.345]  Senator, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:38:32.345 --> 02:38:33.146]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[02:38:33.726 --> 02:38:42.434]  There is so much to talk about, but I noticed that you're trying to point out that Interpol is now operating inside our country with diplomatic immunity.
[02:38:42.434 --> 02:38:50.422]  Yeah, I'm kind of concerned about having an international police force in our country with the ability, maybe, to extradite U.S.
[02:38:50.422 --> 02:38:52.324]  citizens and send them to another country.
[02:38:53.104 --> 02:39:03.668]  Egypt, as you know, over the last couple of months has been holding some American pro-democracy workers in their country, and they were going to try them on trumped-up political charges.
[02:39:03.668 --> 02:39:05.909]  And so a couple of months ago, I said, you know what?
[02:39:05.909 --> 02:39:10.771]  Should we send $2 billion to a country that treats us this way and treats our citizens?
[02:39:10.771 --> 02:39:17.694]  So I tried to hold up their foreign aid, and as a consequence, I think partly of what I was doing, they released our American citizens.
[02:39:18.514 --> 02:39:22.417]  Then they came home and then Secretary Clinton went ahead and released their aid.
[02:39:22.417 --> 02:39:29.943]  I wrote her a letter and said, you know, she shouldn't do it because these prosecutions were still ongoing right now in absentia.
[02:39:29.943 --> 02:39:31.664]  They're prosecuting them without being there.
[02:39:31.664 --> 02:39:33.485]  They also made the U.S.
[02:39:33.485 --> 02:39:40.951]  taxpayer pay a $5 million ransom for these Americans to come home, promising they would come back to Holtz to stand trial.
[02:39:40.951 --> 02:39:42.592]  But then this week we've learned that
[02:39:43.386 --> 02:39:46.369]  Egypt has asked Interpol for international warrants.
[02:39:46.369 --> 02:39:50.893]  They have these red letter warrants that can be used anywhere in the world.
[02:39:50.893 --> 02:39:53.955]  And most people say, oh, that could never happen in America.
[02:39:53.955 --> 02:39:55.777]  We would never let that happen.
[02:39:55.777 --> 02:39:58.279]  But Interpol is doing this in other countries.
[02:39:58.279 --> 02:40:00.340]  Saudi Arabia asked Interpol.
[02:40:01.383 --> 02:40:10.785]  To return a Saudi journalist from Malaysia who had said something about a Mohammed that they found offensive and they were going to accuse him of blasphemy.
[02:40:10.785 --> 02:40:14.806]  Interpol picked him up in Malaysia and took him back to Saudi Arabia.
[02:40:14.806 --> 02:40:17.847]  He will now face the death penalty for blasphemy.
[02:40:17.847 --> 02:40:25.749]  But the scary thing is he's being picked up by Interpol and the scary thing is what kind of authority does Interpol have in the United States?
[02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:32.685]  And President Obama expanded their authority with an executive order in December giving them diplomatic immunity.
[02:40:32.685 --> 02:40:34.670]  So all of this concerns me.
[02:40:36.272 --> 02:40:40.495]  Senator, we also saw just last year the South African U.N.
[02:40:40.495 --> 02:40:43.757]  Summit, and they called for a global U.N.
[02:40:43.757 --> 02:40:52.943]  environmental crime tribunal where you will be arrested if you deny man-made global warming, and that made headlines in Europe, but almost no news here.
[02:40:52.943 --> 02:41:03.330]  So they're openly calling for this international power, and four of our Supreme Court justices have said that we should get our rules from the U.N., not the Constitution.
[02:41:03.330 --> 02:41:05.992]  So I think you're right to be very concerned about this.
[02:41:06.592 --> 02:41:23.752]  Well, you know, one of the interactions in the last couple weeks that was very, very telling was the interaction between Senator Sessions and Secretary Panetta in a committee in which Panetta said that if we go to war, of course we'll consult with the UN and get their approval, and Sessions asked him, he said,
[02:41:24.651 --> 02:41:29.277]  You know, isn't there a role here under the Constitution for Congress?
[02:41:29.277 --> 02:41:42.453]  And Panetta basically just kept going on about NATO, the UN, and then he finally sort of said, well, yeah, we would probably inform Congress of what we're doing, but never in there was there any understanding that they had to get approval or permission from Congress.
[02:41:43.581 --> 02:41:46.242]  And of course, you've spoken on the Senate floor about that.
[02:41:46.242 --> 02:41:51.585]  One of the few senators to actually be concerned about the Constitution being brazenly violated.
[02:41:51.585 --> 02:41:58.968]  And if anyone was confused by what the Secretary of Defense said and tries to come out and say, well, he didn't really mean that.
[02:41:58.968 --> 02:42:06.772]  We have the letter, as you know, last year, where Obama responded to Congress with the Libya war and said, I don't need your authorization.
[02:42:06.772 --> 02:42:08.373]  I have the UN.
[02:42:08.373 --> 02:42:10.834]  And that brings me to my next question, Senator.
[02:42:12.859 --> 02:42:17.580]  Are you or others going to call for the House to begin impeachment investigations?
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:28.103]  I know Congressman Jones has introduced legislation that if Obama starts another war without congressional war power authorization, that they will then trigger that.
[02:42:28.103 --> 02:42:30.263]  But that's not moving very fast.
[02:42:30.263 --> 02:42:36.685]  I mean, this is extremely brazen, like Caesar crossing the Rubicon, if you or your father
[02:42:37.466 --> 02:42:40.170]  We're getting a lot more attention than Congressman Jones.
[02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:50.405]  Were to call for impeachment investigations, at least to begin hearings on impeachment, then I think that might get the executive to stop saying it follows the orders of the UN, Senator.
[02:42:51.198 --> 02:42:54.739]  I think the first step is to stop him in his tracks.
[02:42:54.739 --> 02:42:58.220]  We tried very hard on the Libya motion.
[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:03.901]  In fact, what we did on the Libya, when he went to war with Libya, is we introduced his own words.
[02:43:03.901 --> 02:43:12.023]  His words in 2007, when he ran for office, said that no president should unilaterally go to war without congressional authority.
[02:43:12.483 --> 02:43:16.324]  He basically just restates the Constitution, and good for him.
[02:43:16.324 --> 02:43:17.284]  That's what he ran on.
[02:43:17.284 --> 02:43:18.564]  That was part of his platform.
[02:43:18.564 --> 02:43:22.865]  And then he went around and did exactly the opposite when he became president.
[02:43:22.865 --> 02:43:28.306]  And this is not the first time a Democrat or a Republican has changed their mind once they became president.
[02:43:28.306 --> 02:43:35.468]  They sort of believed in limitations on the presidential power until they actually became the president, and then they believe in unlimited powers.
[02:43:35.468 --> 02:43:36.948]  But we will fight them tooth and nail.
[02:43:38.088 --> 02:43:45.573]  We introduced his own words on the Senate floor and asked people to vote for it, but the disappointing thing was ten people in the U.S.
[02:43:45.573 --> 02:43:52.937]  Senate believe in the Constitution and believe that the Congress should have to declare war before a president goes to war.
[02:43:52.937 --> 02:43:55.559]  We got only ten votes and they were all Republicans.
[02:43:55.559 --> 02:44:00.662]  Not one Democrat voted for the words of their own president when he ran for office.
[02:44:01.957 --> 02:44:08.041]  What did you make of the CIA director a month ago, it was in Wired Magazine, if you caught it?
[02:44:08.041 --> 02:44:20.870]  What did you make of him saying, yeah, we're watching you, we're reading your emails, we're building a giant NSA center, and then Congress said, we want to see the details of that NSA center, and Obama said, you don't get to see it!
[02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:29.677]  Since when does Congress not get to get details of the new NSA center that they admit is to read all our emails and listen to our phone calls illegally, Senator?
[02:44:30.461 --> 02:44:35.684]  Well, I'd say the one good news as far as Big Brother snooping on you is that there is some pushback.
[02:44:35.684 --> 02:44:51.774]  You know, the SOPA battle, the battle over, you know, the internet and whether or not they could shut down different websites indiscriminately based on accusations without a day in court, without, you know, any Fourth Amendment or jury trial protections.
[02:44:51.774 --> 02:44:54.335]  You know, we won that battle and won it in a big way.
[02:44:54.335 --> 02:44:56.516]  And so there is a pushback.
[02:44:56.516 --> 02:44:57.517]  That was really the first
[02:44:57.717 --> 02:44:58.418]  We're good to go.
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.362]  The internet rose up and as a power did stop them in their tracks.
[02:45:31.362 --> 02:45:44.328]  We're not winning all the battles but there's going to be another battle over cyber security bills coming up and we have to worry about the power that's being given to agencies like the NSA to snoop on personal information on the internet.
[02:45:44.328 --> 02:45:49.831]  So we haven't, we aren't done yet but I think it was encouraging when we beat the SOPA bill.
[02:45:49.831 --> 02:45:55.594]  Well it's good to know you're there because we've got on the other side Senator Jay Rockefeller famously saying in committee
[02:45:56.673 --> 02:45:59.580]  We would have been better off never inventing the internet.
[02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:01.203]  I mean, that's a wild statement.
[02:46:02.298 --> 02:46:08.560]  The Internet's the great equalizer, you know, because now people get their news and they look around for the news.
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:15.262]  And I think it's particularly young people now who are so cynical of all the politicians they see on TV.
[02:46:15.262 --> 02:46:23.085]  And I think this is why my dad has become so popular is because they see him as a genuine voice, someone who they can believe and trust in.
[02:46:23.085 --> 02:46:25.426]  And that makes a big difference.
[02:46:25.426 --> 02:46:28.247]  And the Internet has been the fountain of all that.
[02:46:28.987 --> 02:46:39.757]  And I think it really is leading to a movement out there that's neither Republican nor Democrat, but really wants a different way.
[02:46:39.757 --> 02:46:43.321]  Certainly the establishment has to know they can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:46:43.321 --> 02:46:48.345]  People have had a taste of real choice in news and information and ideas.
[02:46:48.345 --> 02:46:53.190]  Freedom is catching on thanks to you, your father, and tens of millions of supporters across the planet.
[02:46:54.244 --> 02:47:01.609]  Yep, well that's one of my father's favorite lines as he's out on the trail, is that freedom is popular, freedom brings people together.
[02:47:01.609 --> 02:47:05.131]  And it's one of the amazing things you see when you go to his rallies.
[02:47:05.131 --> 02:47:21.583]  You see people of all races, all economic levels, you see working class people, you see Chamber of Commerce types, but you see much more diverse crowd at the Ron Paul rallies, and particularly the youth, than you see at any Republican function.
[02:47:22.183 --> 02:47:29.307]  It's what the Republicans, if they had half a clue, would realize nationally is that Ron Paul is a phenomenon.
[02:47:29.307 --> 02:47:39.271]  Getting five to ten thousand people at speeches, more than any other candidate, and they need to realize that they need that momentum and they need that to win in the fall.
[02:47:39.271 --> 02:47:44.214]  And I'm just hoping that they will do some outreach to him to try to get him to participate in their convention.
[02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:50.745]  Speaking of your father, Congressman Ron Paul, who has said that if he doesn't win the presidency, he's going to retire.
[02:47:50.745 --> 02:47:55.449]  Texas, of course, is very sad about that, but the idea continues on.
[02:47:55.449 --> 02:48:04.256]  And undoubtedly, we're winning the war, even if he doesn't win the battle, in educating hearts and minds about the true constitutional system.
[02:48:04.956 --> 02:48:10.718]  But what is at the heart of the delegate battle and the broker convention strategy?
[02:48:10.718 --> 02:48:15.800]  Can you tell us, if Paul doesn't win the full nomination, what they're going to call for?
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:21.542]  And can you put to bed these rumors, the latest one yesterday in the Seattle Times?
[02:48:21.542 --> 02:48:29.885]  It's all over the news that if Mitt Romney was to get the nomination that there's discussions of asking you to be vice president.
[02:48:30.956 --> 02:48:37.703]  Well, I always tell people if there's a secret plan for that to happen, it's so secret that nobody's let me in on it yet.
[02:48:37.703 --> 02:48:40.266]  So, I kind of doubt that will happen.
[02:48:40.266 --> 02:48:46.553]  I do tell people to be considered to be the Vice President of the United States is obviously an honor.
[02:48:46.553 --> 02:48:47.434]  I mean, it is.
[02:48:47.434 --> 02:48:52.419]  And I know some people may not like hearing that, but to tell you the truth, it is an honor to be considered.
[02:48:52.859 --> 02:48:53.219]  I think so.
[02:49:14.245 --> 02:49:26.051]  Unless something changes dramatically in the next couple of primaries, in all likelihood, Romney will collect the numbers necessary to get the nomination sometime in May or June.
[02:49:26.051 --> 02:49:35.216]  One of the things is that if you win five states, you get to get your name placed in nomination and you get guaranteed a position at the convention.
[02:49:35.216 --> 02:49:36.597]  And there's still some chance of that.
[02:49:37.407 --> 02:49:44.172]  Even though my dad didn't win five states, a lot of the delegations are not decided until you go through the state convention.
[02:49:44.172 --> 02:49:47.294]  They have county conventions and they work their way up.
[02:49:47.294 --> 02:49:55.659]  And Ron Paul's done very well in Nevada, Missouri, Maine, Iowa, and a couple of the other caucus states.
[02:49:55.659 --> 02:50:02.344]  So there's an outside chance that he still wins five states, but I think that's one of the reasons that he'll go on.
[02:50:03.004 --> 02:50:10.167]  Probably giving speeches and traveling around and encouraging voters, at least through the state conventions, which are mostly over in June.
[02:50:10.167 --> 02:50:13.809]  Sure, it's a victory just to be there injecting real issues.
[02:50:13.809 --> 02:50:17.370]  Moving quickly through some questions in the five minutes we have left, Senator.
[02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:25.854]  TSA, they have now announced, Congresswoman Jackson has announced here in Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee,
[02:50:26.514 --> 02:50:34.600]  That they have undercover Homeland Security outside of the 10th Amendment, TSA now on the buses and the highways.
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:40.325]  We've known this is coming, but that's just as illegal as Obama taking orders from the UN.
[02:50:40.325 --> 02:50:44.068]  There's got to be some end to this craziness.
[02:50:44.068 --> 02:50:48.972]  Dave Mustaine was just here in town visiting me a few weeks ago, a rock star from Megadeth.
[02:50:49.372 --> 02:50:54.739]  And he complained to me that his 14-year-old daughter got groped at the airport here in Austin.
[02:50:54.739 --> 02:50:57.202]  There's got to be some, you know, end to this.
[02:50:57.202 --> 02:50:59.585]  Can you call for hearings in the Senate?
[02:50:59.585 --> 02:51:04.951]  I mean, is it illegal from your constitutional research to have the TSA now on the streets of Texas?
[02:51:06.331 --> 02:51:07.652]  I can't call for hearings.
[02:51:07.652 --> 02:51:10.255]  The majority party completely controls hearings.
[02:51:10.255 --> 02:51:13.537]  ISA can get hearings in the House and it's had some.
[02:51:13.537 --> 02:51:16.279]  The interesting thing is, is what happened to you guys in Texas?
[02:51:16.279 --> 02:51:22.885]  I thought you guys were going to stand up to the federal government and ban the TSA from doing that in Texas.
[02:51:22.885 --> 02:51:32.032]  The feds threatened an air blockade, military blockade, and the unanimous house then fell to their knees and said, here's our daughters and sons, start groping.
[02:51:33.114 --> 02:51:55.423]  Well we're going to continue the fight up here and really it becomes more complicated because this ends up becoming not just about personal liberty, it becomes about union power and the fact that the Democrats are big on creating new government unions because they're new voting blocks and new blocks of money that they can get, you know, forced union dues to support their campaigns.
[02:51:55.423 --> 02:51:58.304]  So really the TSA is one of the biggest government unions now.
[02:51:58.784 --> 02:52:04.549]  And so, we've been fighting, you know, to privatize security, many of us, and would like to do that.
[02:52:04.549 --> 02:52:15.058]  We will probably propose legislation coming up that will do that, as well as some that will be less dramatic, but would actually forbid them from doing pat-downs.
[02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:21.023]  We think the idea of random pat-downs is ridiculous, insulting, and really making no one safe.
[02:52:21.643 --> 02:52:22.024]  I think?
[02:52:38.878 --> 02:52:39.439]  I don't know.
[02:52:56.138 --> 02:52:59.920]  Two final questions, Senator Paul.
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:11.246]  Number one, everyone has been impressed, even mainstream media has been impressed, that you could run for office for the first time in your life and be catapulted into the U.S.
[02:53:11.246 --> 02:53:21.832]  Senate and that you have kept your promises and done so well and had such a senatorial gentlemanly bearing and have learned the procedures and things.
[02:53:22.572 --> 02:53:26.875]  Everyone I know across the political spectrum is saying Rand Paul.
[02:53:26.875 --> 02:53:35.122]  If Ron Paul doesn't make it, well, Rand Paul is definitely presidential material for the Republic.
[02:53:35.122 --> 02:53:40.766]  I mean, I know you don't like to toot your own horn, but I mean, are you starting to think more about running for president?
[02:53:41.721 --> 02:53:46.362]  Well, I think it's too early to tell, and a lot of it, you know, depends on what happens with this election.
[02:53:46.362 --> 02:54:03.725]  So, you know, we'll wait and see, but I think also the voice within the Senate can be a pretty loud voice, and I'm definitely going to do everything I can to use the position of the Senate to fight for constitutional limited government, to really fight to fend off what I think is a coming calamity.
[02:54:03.725 --> 02:54:07.046]  If we do not address this debt bomb that's coming at us,
[02:54:07.666 --> 02:54:13.669]  We really are in for a bad way and it may be something that hits us before there is even another presidential election.
[02:54:13.669 --> 02:54:19.973]  So we're fighting day in day out to get people around here to wake up to the imminence of this problem.
[02:54:19.973 --> 02:54:25.356]  I've been telling people for a year there's a day of reckoning coming and it's not something we're looking forward to.
[02:54:25.356 --> 02:54:27.637]  It's either something where we destroy our currency.
[02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:34.380]  And when you destroy a currency, you at least decay off in the streets, and we don't want that to happen.
[02:54:34.380 --> 02:54:55.112]  All of these problems are fixable, though, and we have a wonderful country with a wonderful heritage, and there is an amazing potential locked up in our country that if it were unleashed and you allow people to freely interact and trade with each other, that we would once again be a dominant force in the world if we would just, you know, really believe in ourselves and believe in our heritage.
[02:54:55.865 --> 02:54:56.926]  I agree with you.
[02:54:56.926 --> 02:55:11.712]  Speaking of our heritage, not having high taxes, Buffett, Warren Buffett, the biggest recipient of the banker bailouts domestically, that's McClatchy Associated Press, it's a fact, he says raise taxes on millionaires or people making $150,000 individually or a quarter million in a couple.
[02:55:15.456 --> 02:55:19.399]  Well, he's the guy that wants that money out of the next bailout on record.
[02:55:19.399 --> 02:55:22.502]  I mean, this is asinine.
[02:55:22.502 --> 02:55:28.227]  Give us a brief comment on that, Senator, because I know you've got to go, and then what you're going to do on a balanced budget amendment.
[02:55:29.401 --> 02:55:32.742]  I tell people I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about Buffett's secretary.
[02:55:32.742 --> 02:55:41.645]  I think she makes more money than I do and I think her assets are probably greater than mine and so I'm not, you know, too concerned about Warren Buffett's secretary.
[02:55:41.645 --> 02:55:51.208]  But I think the argument that if two people pay the same percentage in taxes, you know, if he pays 15%, his secretary pays 15%, let's say she makes $200,000 a year and he makes
[02:55:54.149 --> 02:55:56.530]  20 million a year or 200 million.
[02:55:56.530 --> 02:56:00.292]  He pays a thousandfold more in taxes than she does.
[02:56:00.292 --> 02:56:04.954]  So the thing is, is you can have progressive taxation with a flat tax code.
[02:56:04.954 --> 02:56:10.136]  So the idea that the rich are not paying their fair share in our country is a lie.
[02:56:10.136 --> 02:56:11.677]  It is absolutely untrue.
[02:56:11.677 --> 02:56:15.299]  We have the most progressive tax code maybe in the world.
[02:56:15.299 --> 02:56:18.040]  Our tax code is more progressive than Sweden's tax code.
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:29.126]  So they need to just tell the truth on it, but the bottom line is I want the private sector, the pie that is the private sector to be bigger and the pie that is the government sector to be smaller.
[02:56:29.126 --> 02:56:31.467]  So I don't want anybody's taxes to go up.
[02:56:31.467 --> 02:56:36.330]  And if you're richer than me and you've got three cars and I've got a moped, I need to go out and work harder.
[02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:38.450]  And I don't need to take it from you.
[02:56:38.450 --> 02:56:42.411]  I need to encourage you to hire more people by allowing you to do better.
[02:56:42.411 --> 02:56:48.112]  And so I don't really look at people who are wealthy business owners and say, oh, let me drag them down.
[02:56:48.112 --> 02:56:56.194]  I look at them and I say, how can we get the government out of the way so this creative person, man or woman, can create more jobs?
[02:56:56.194 --> 02:56:57.774]  So I look at it the opposite way.
[02:56:57.774 --> 02:57:03.235]  And I think there's enough people left in America who like the idea of the American dream, who like the idea of success.
[02:57:04.076 --> 02:57:05.681]  And every generation there's somebody.
[02:57:05.681 --> 02:57:06.704]  I meet people every day who...
[02:57:07.671 --> 02:57:13.555]  Parents just finished high school and weren't very successful, who are now successful in this generation.
[02:57:13.555 --> 02:57:18.598]  It doesn't always happen, but that has been the beauty of America, that mobility.
[02:57:18.598 --> 02:57:25.503]  And the interesting thing is 60% of the people born in the lowest rung, the bottom 20%, move up out of poverty.
[02:57:25.503 --> 02:57:30.486]  60% of millionaires the following year don't make a million dollars a year.
[02:57:30.486 --> 02:57:34.029]  So people move up and down this social ladder all the time.
[02:57:34.029 --> 02:57:37.511]  And that freedom to go up and down the ladder is really what America is about.
[02:57:38.311 --> 02:57:44.856]  Well the crony monopolist they know that when you raise taxes over time it destroys the pie and impoverishes.
[02:57:44.856 --> 02:57:47.577]  They want the control undoubtedly.
[02:57:47.577 --> 02:57:53.461]  It is so refreshing to talk to a senator who does not compromise and it's just so real.
[02:57:53.461 --> 02:57:56.823]  Senator Rand Paul thank you so much for the time today.
[02:57:56.823 --> 02:57:57.824]  Thank you Alex.
[02:57:57.824 --> 02:57:58.204]  Amazing.
[02:58:02.723 --> 02:58:12.152]  There is our interview that we shot right before we went on the radio slash TV here today.
[02:58:12.152 --> 02:58:16.055]  Very powerful and news-making interview.
[02:58:16.055 --> 02:58:20.179]  More coming up in the next hour, if your station carries that hour.
[02:58:20.179 --> 02:58:25.744]  And then, I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock.
