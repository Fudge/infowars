[00:50.680 --> 00:54.880]  had him on every Friday and I decided about a month ago to just shake the
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.440]  show up and stop having Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on just on
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.400]  a set date it's better just to have him on every few weeks at random times
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.360]  whenever stuff's breaking and he's got a lot to talk about today he'll be on with
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.640]  us in the second hour and we'll open the phones up for Bob we're also gonna open

[01:29.040 --> 01:34.760]  guessing it probably is in the stack but I did the interview with Senator Rand
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.960]  Paul and so I was unable to go through the whole stack but that's fantastic and
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.000]  yes right up until showtime here today when we went live I was taping an

[02:12.880 --> 02:17.440]  completed right before we went live it's kind of like a fire drill around here
[02:17.440 --> 02:21.520]  because we just don't normally do interviews tape right before the show but
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.080]  the polls are so busy that that was the only time that the senator could do that
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.280]  interview it's an extensive 20-minute interview or so and that is coming that
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.720]  is coming up and yes this is linked on Drudge fantastic thank you so much sir

[03:58.720 --> 04:02.000]  then generally just disregard 90% of what I've already researched I just kind of
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.280]  get angry before I get on air it's almost like a ritual not on purpose but
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.320]  you know could read the news look at it all prepare the giant feast of
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.520]  information and then don't even don't even cover it one-tenth of it but but
[04:15.520 --> 04:23.200]  every time I do an interview right up to show time it breaks that so this is
[04:23.200 --> 04:28.600]  probably gonna be a very interesting breaks that train of thought which

[12:07.160 --> 12:12.280]  tyranny that's why they're bringing in martial law incrementally is because they

[12:45.640 --> 12:56.960]  launches undercover TSA spies to ride Houston buses now I told you nine plus
[12:56.960 --> 13:03.040]  years ago this was happening not because I'm smart while other people are
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.280]  hanging out at the bar or playing pool or going to the NFL games or hockey games
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.720]  or trying to pick chicks up I discovered a plan for world government by
[13:16.720 --> 13:26.320]  watching c-span and reading books and I saw in early 2002 right as Homeland
[13:26.320 --> 13:34.200]  Security was getting cabinet position and congressional funding I saw Governor
[13:34.200 --> 13:40.920]  Ridge lay out the entire plan and so when people call me a fear monger or
[13:40.920 --> 13:44.160]  people say I'm making stuff up and then it all comes through and I'm still bad
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.120]  though for being right it's people are like well yeah or or now they're not
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.960]  saying I'm a fear monger they're saying he's got to be an insider how does he
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.840]  know all this how did he's predicted I don't know the Rand corporation said we
[13:55.840 --> 13:58.560]  need giant terror attacks a set of a police state and take everybody's
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.880]  liberties PNAC wrote that before 9-11 I knew the feds had bombed the World
[14:02.880 --> 14:06.640]  Trade Center before I saw him introducing bin Laden on the air saying he's
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.040]  about to get you when he attacks give your rights up I talked to military
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.080]  sources six months before 9-11 they were massing around Afghanistan and we're
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.560]  about to invade and I went they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and
[14:17.560 --> 14:24.200]  blame it on their asset bin Laden who's known CIA and they did it on radio and
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.240]  TV and people haven't even dug up the radio shows I did three hour radio shows
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.600]  day and night at a nighttime show then saying going into even more detail than
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.480]  a few minutes for my access show people then say oh well that's that that really
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.120]  wasn't on his show really ask Jimmy Vaughn blues legend you know Stevie Ray
[14:42.120 --> 14:49.080]  Vaughn's brother he was watching my show the day I live July 25th did two hours
[14:49.080 --> 14:51.960]  on how they were gonna blow up the World Trade Center I gotta have him in here
[14:51.960 --> 14:57.240]  just to swear to that on air people didn't believe that but it's all on
[14:57.240 --> 15:03.240]  record check somebody's got it cuz I know that same day and right around that
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.160]  in July even months before that actually I was saying get ready for it again so
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.680]  so I guess in a way I am smart but only cuz I'm paying attention all of you are
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.320]  smart if you study football or you study auto mechanic work or you study
[15:16.320 --> 15:23.280]  gold mining or you study being an arborist you're gonna get good at it some
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.640]  people might get better than you but you're gonna get good at it I mean they
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.560]  can teach mentally retarded people to be smarter in many cases than the average
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.400]  person with serious training or better at sports or things you know it just it's
[15:37.400 --> 15:44.440]  how much training and dedication is put in and research but on the point of
[15:44.440 --> 15:50.880]  knowing about the martial law rollout plan honey if you're a new viewer out
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.400]  there ladies or others and find this stuff frightening and don't want to
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.560]  believe it I'm gonna beg you to just go research what I'm saying but see most
[15:59.560 --> 16:03.760]  people won't do that they'll just watch it come true and go wow that guy is a
[16:03.760 --> 16:10.880]  prophet no not Governor Ridge said to have a job you're gonna get Homeland
[16:10.880 --> 16:17.200]  Security approval TSA will train and run all the police through threat fusion
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.360]  centers and the feds with a magic wand will tell police they're now allowed to
[16:21.360 --> 16:24.800]  grow up to genitals they're now allowed to secretly arrest you they're gonna be
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.120]  a medical tyranny for forced inoculations part of the emergency
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.480]  systems that they tried to pass but couldn't in 2002 so they just went ahead
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.320]  and did it executively and they next the model states Health Emergency Powers
[16:39.320 --> 16:44.400]  Act and they're preparing for forced inoculations mass arrest riot control
[16:44.400 --> 16:49.000]  and now all this is admitted but then they go on seeing it in Fox and say
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.760]  there's nothing to it there's no FEMA camps when the legislation is there to
[16:52.760 --> 16:56.640]  expand what's already been built the emergency centers establishment act
[16:56.640 --> 17:01.880]  Jesse Ventura goes in talks to the author of the bill the bill admits it's
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.960]  already set up they just want to fund it make it national level and open if a
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.200]  further fund it the old military bases that's the camps and we're gonna have
[17:11.200 --> 17:14.000]  the biggest prison population in the world but oh your conspiracy theorists
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.440]  are not you know to think it's a serious problem and he tells the governor
[17:17.440 --> 17:20.600]  Ventura he goes none of that exist there's no such bill what do you believe
[17:20.600 --> 17:24.920]  in spacemen aliens gonna get you green men gonna come down and the governor
[17:24.920 --> 17:29.240]  looks at him and says I'm talking about green men and the guy looks at him like
[17:29.240 --> 17:35.200]  a cartoon character and goes in a little nally thing he goes there's no such
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.680]  a bill and Ventura really said told me personally started freaking out at that
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.320]  point you see it on tape it's such a powerful exchange that's why Homeland
[17:44.320 --> 17:49.000]  Security threatened Time Warner till they pulled that episode aired once they

[18:32.040 --> 18:35.320]  affect his show I didn't want to show what he would do and they had him copy it
[18:35.320 --> 18:39.600]  and then spoil my my research but I told the whole crew I said he'll show these
[18:39.600 --> 18:43.880]  famous debunked FEMA camp videos of the railway stations and stuff and not all

[19:03.720 --> 19:09.000]  production I that I said that day hours before it aired that he would betray and

[19:12.600 --> 19:17.920]  would be involved they popped up it was exact so I guess in a way I am actually
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.560]  able to absolutely document what they're gonna do but that's from studying them
[19:21.560 --> 19:25.360]  the point is on Homeland Security I'm gonna come back and cover this they

[20:07.480 --> 20:12.000]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.840]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[20:14.840 --> 20:19.120]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[24:11.600 --> 24:38.280]  we are back live look it's so simple we saw the training for martial law we
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.800]  witnessed the military training to take our guns had emergency managers in
[24:42.800 --> 24:49.360]  major cities and towns and police chiefs came on my show and said the
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.640]  military came with bags of hundreds of thousands of dollars to turn me into a
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.600]  covert domestic spy against America that was the chief of police of San
[24:58.600 --> 25:05.520]  Antonio Ali Philippus it's in my film police state 2000 I interviewed Thomas
[25:05.520 --> 25:08.720]  Sanchez the head of emergency management in Kingsville Vietnam veteran
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.840]  army intelligence he said they're doing gun confiscation drills they told him
[25:13.840 --> 25:20.040]  this that was Clinton testing to see if he could get martial law going and
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.760]  people are like oh well it didn't happen yeah because we exposed it the
[25:24.760 --> 25:30.400]  militia exposed it people talked about it so then they went into this strategy
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.640]  under Bush and now Obama of just normalizing hey there's checkpoints
[25:34.640 --> 25:40.240]  yeah there are spies in restaurants and bus stops and train terminals and at the
[25:40.240 --> 25:46.400]  mall listening to you I mean they hired Marcus Wolf when I first heard they'd
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.480]  hired Marcus Wolf in 2002 I didn't believe it I saw the news articles oh
[25:52.480 --> 25:59.840]  this is a hoax so I went and found the federal funding of over a million dollars
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.000]  a year to pay Marcus Wolf the former head of the East German Stasi the famous
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.320]  you know lives of others you know spy chief where they had like one out of 20
[26:11.320 --> 26:16.200]  people as a spy spies everywhere listening to everyone hidden microphones in
[26:16.200 --> 26:24.640]  your house it's way past that and they hired them and then I'm watching C-span
[26:24.640 --> 26:28.720]  for two hours and I taped it back then on VHS and it's just we literally have a
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.160]  whole warehouse full of the crowd I've taped and none of the money or time to go
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.920]  through it all but you can now search C-span just go to Governor Ridge meetings
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.920]  from when he was first in there with corporate councils this meeting was
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.000]  these big giant tables all connected in a big rectangle with all these corporate
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.280]  leaders and he was saying for security and infrastructure protection and
[26:51.280 --> 26:55.920]  infra-guard you're all going to be executives with homeland security with
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.120]  security clearances you're gonna have to have Homeland Security to have a job
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.160]  first at security locations then at other targets and then everywhere and
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.280]  then we're gonna move out into transportation out of the airports
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.720]  bus stations trains and finally to the streets we're gonna certify the local
[27:10.720 --> 27:16.160]  police and work with them and fund them and be over them and I'm just seeing him
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.800]  admit it kind of like General Petraeus a month ago saying yeah all your new
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.200]  appliances spy on you and it's no big deal there's no more Fourth Amendment
[27:24.200 --> 27:29.720]  it's just throwing it in your face but he was at a CIA in-Q-tel meeting which
[27:29.720 --> 27:36.160]  is the CIA's public funding arm in the DARPA type systems to to fund private
[27:36.160 --> 27:39.920]  groups so they can then give new government R&D developments to their
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.800]  buddies so they can make money I mean sometimes they'll randomly pick some
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.480]  low-level tech or engineer and give them you know a hundred plus million dollar
[27:49.480 --> 27:53.840]  contract and and say they own something and then that person fences the money
[27:53.840 --> 28:01.040]  out to him the point is that the mafia that's taken over is just in our face
[28:01.040 --> 28:06.600]  they are they are they are squatting on us I remember one time I was like 11
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.760]  years old and this bullied flunk like three or four grades a lot bigger than
[28:10.760 --> 28:15.760]  me he I'm fighting back he beats me up he wrestles me down he sits on my chest
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.080]  and on my arms and starts punching me in the nose not even that hard just
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.640]  enjoying it while my nose is bleeding and spitting and I found that energy of
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.220]  pure anger and just exploded throw him off me stomping and that was the
[28:31.220 --> 28:36.440]  beginning of finding true rage power but the point is that that's what they're
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.160]  doing to us is they are sitting on us and that's what it feels like just like
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.480]  how you like that how you like then just remember going and people laughing and
[28:44.480 --> 28:51.920]  big old spit globs going right in my eye right in my face and then that click of
[28:51.920 --> 28:57.840]  I am getting him off of me and I am going to hurt him bad
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.680]  finding your heart is what it's called and America needs to find its heart in
[29:06.680 --> 29:12.800]  the info war and get really aggressive with banner hangs shines whatever you
[29:12.800 --> 29:18.360]  gotta do founding fathers painted the enemies you know government buildings
[29:18.360 --> 29:21.280]  and things I'm not saying do that because you know the new orders about a
[29:21.280 --> 29:23.840]  hundred times worse than the British Redcoats don't certainly don't get
[29:23.840 --> 29:27.440]  aggressive with these tyrants do whatever you got to so everybody sees

[33:13.960 --> 33:28.800]  last night there have been over 100 fake FBI stings where the FBI profiles
[33:28.800 --> 33:37.040]  low-grade morons generally mildly retarded ADIQ type people on welfare
[33:37.040 --> 33:42.680]  out of the prison system and gets them to talk about doing violence they've done
[33:42.680 --> 33:47.920]  it with moron Ku Klux Klan people even Texas Monthly gave the FBI a bum
[33:47.920 --> 33:54.120]  steer award for finding these literal total trash drunks who couldn't even
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.600]  get out of the house but once or twice a week and the FBI would give them
[33:57.600 --> 34:02.400]  cameras and would give them money and tell them as their clan leader I will
[34:02.400 --> 34:07.960]  give you $100,000 when you bomb something and then they would give them
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.760]  $10,000 just to talk about it and and and these drunks were so stupid so
[34:12.760 --> 34:17.200]  trashy so bad because the tapes got released the transcripts where they
[34:17.200 --> 34:20.720]  couldn't even get them outside and then have to offer them tens of thousands of
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.360]  dollars and they were so drunk the FBI agent and the informant they had both
[34:25.360 --> 34:28.720]  of them in there with this case up in Fort Worth it's a famous case you can
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.880]  look it up that they had to get them outside and they were too drunk to light
[34:33.880 --> 34:42.320]  black powder bottle bombs so they went out and found poor people living in a
[34:42.320 --> 34:52.560]  trailer totally drunk the the description no teeth and the indictment
[34:52.560 --> 34:56.240]  read they would wage war overthrow the Capitol and shoot everyone in the
[34:56.240 --> 34:59.720]  Capitol and then they were going to blow up chemical plants and murder everyone
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.160]  and I remember when it was on the news this is like 12 years ago this one case
[35:03.160 --> 35:07.200]  it was a giant nationwide clan operation that was going to blow up
[35:07.200 --> 35:12.840]  military bases bomb DC blow up chemical plants we've got to watch farmers now
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.840]  with ammonium nitrate because of this it was going to be a new Oklahoma City
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.040]  and then a few years later in the court it came out these people didn't know
[35:22.040 --> 35:26.800]  which day of the week it was and since then there has been over a hundred
[35:26.800 --> 35:33.960]  instances with just Muslims alone where they go the FBI is the leader of the
[35:33.960 --> 35:37.960]  group founds it sometimes they can't even find Muslims so in one case remember
[35:37.960 --> 35:43.520]  down in Florida Miami they found black street kids who were quote
[35:43.520 --> 35:51.480]  rastafarians they were potheds they weren't even from Jamaica or other
[35:51.480 --> 35:54.400]  places like that they weren't from the Caribbean they weren't from police they
[35:54.400 --> 35:57.720]  weren't from down there and they were they were street kids on welfare most
[35:57.720 --> 36:01.640]  of them didn't even have parents the youngest was 13 the oldest was like 18
[36:01.640 --> 36:06.360]  you can look up this case remember it's 2006 and it was they planned jihadist to
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.280]  wage war they weren't even Muslims but they said jihadist and again it was the
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.520]  same story the FBI agent in a warehouse he rented them for a year slowly would
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.800]  sell give you 10,000 20,000 more to go film a federal building and to wear a
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.720]  camo outfit and shoot a video and it's on the tapes like oh come on man I don't
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.640]  want to attack anybody you got to do it for a la but we're not Muslims we're
[36:30.640 --> 36:40.360]  Christians didn't matter so so I mean listen I could go out in a day forget
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.920]  six months or a year and find crazy homeless people who are mentally ill
[36:44.920 --> 36:47.720]  drugged out of their minds don't even know who they are sometimes they do they
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.320]  just find schizophrenics and do this I hypothetically wouldn't do this they'll
[36:51.320 --> 36:56.720]  cut they'll edit that out and same I'm planning this I could go out in in 24
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.640]  hours promise take a homeless person out to dinner give them $10,000 and
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.320]  promise them 10,000 more if they would say on tape that they're gonna blow up
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.440]  buildings and kill people I could didn't go put that out on YouTube but see what
[37:12.440 --> 37:15.760]  the FBI would first do is they get that homeless person an apartment act like
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.200]  they're their friends convince them to upload it to YouTube because it wouldn't
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.320]  be convincing if it was 24 hours I shopped the video and then uploaded it
[37:23.320 --> 37:26.560]  on some dummy account they'd say how did they do that the jury would at least
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.400]  ask that see they want to create the synthetic view that there's terrorism in
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.200]  a thread out there this is how this works but I could do this in less than
[37:35.200 --> 37:41.560]  24 hours start waving $10,000 in front of some I would profile some out of
[37:41.560 --> 37:48.240]  their minds semi schizophrenic person get them dress them up clean them up go
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.400]  check them in to a hotel they do this sometime when they need a quick one I
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.480]  shouldn't be telling the FBI to do this so the senior terrorist guys that know
[37:55.480 --> 37:59.320]  how to do this the low-level guys are busy you know getting cats out of trees
[37:59.320 --> 38:05.280]  and things you go to the quick way to do it as you go check them in to a 24-hour
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.160]  motel you know one of those places rundown areas check them in for a few
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.400]  days get them there get them cleaned up more presentable tell them I'll give
[38:14.400 --> 38:17.400]  you another thousand just write up how you're gonna do it they'll be alright
[38:17.400 --> 38:22.160]  whatever you want even easier than getting a drunk to do it you get a crack
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.640]  head oh that's even quicker but see it's not as believable when it comes out it's
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.320]  a crack head on the news so you want to find some old vet who's pickled their
[38:31.320 --> 38:38.540]  brain with alcohol semi crazy that's how you do it anyway side issue I want to
[38:38.540 --> 38:41.920]  give the number out and go to your calls the toll-free number to join us is 800
[38:41.920 --> 38:50.520]  25 at 9 9231 800 25 at 9 9231 it's first time callers again by the way
[38:50.520 --> 38:53.000]  because I want to give new people a chance to get on air and sit on hold
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.680]  I'm trying to go to the calls 800 25 at 9 9231 so I went and just reviewed it was
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.080]  over a hundred I spent a few hours last night and even cracked open some blue
[39:04.080 --> 39:07.920]  bell orange swirl ice cream shouldn't have done it had a pint of that and boy
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.640]  was it good well that's not product placement bluebell is not paying me to
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.080]  be a sponsor though I would gladly be a sponsor for bluebell a writer in central
[39:16.080 --> 39:21.840]  Texas I'm sure bought enough over the years point is I did I did my research
[39:21.840 --> 39:25.480]  and it was just it was case after case where they had to admit in court even
[39:25.480 --> 39:32.000]  mainstream news had to admit the FBI whole cloth goes out in fines low-grade
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.200]  morons and sets them up now because of the non-existent threat no bombings of
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.200]  buses no bombings of trains no nothing but the continual fake people they
[39:42.200 --> 39:48.520]  bust we're now told the TSA is going to be listening to what you're saying in
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.640]  plain clothes the you know the same people at the airports I could talk
[39:53.640 --> 39:56.880]  about it because Dave Mustaine did do a tweet about it but soon he's gonna come
[39:56.880 --> 40:01.600]  on air and tell the full story of what happened to his daughter Electra so sweet
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.760]  when he and his wife Pam and his daughter Electra were visiting and and what
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.480]  happened there there's another famous movie star actress who talked about how
[40:11.480 --> 40:17.280]  she was singled out by a woman to be groped and clearly the woman was enjoying
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.760]  it oh yeah when you're sitting there and they're clearly enjoying it cuz I've
[40:22.760 --> 40:29.320]  done a pat down one time to see what they would do and no exaggeration he
[40:29.320 --> 40:34.000]  first told me he was a listener began smacking his lips he either enjoyed the
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.200]  power over me or he was enjoying it the other way and rub I was wearing a tight
[40:39.200 --> 40:44.760]  t-shirt I've never had a man I've been to the medical doctor they've never rubbed
[40:44.760 --> 40:52.120]  on my chest and this won't take too long and I'm just going whoa don't touch me
[40:52.120 --> 40:56.440]  down there I'm gonna sue you he's like I just do it I have to I and he looked up
[40:56.440 --> 41:02.200]  at me his little twinkle eyes and he said I have administrative rights and
[41:02.200 --> 41:09.400]  smiled at me and I was just like wow actually recorded it all but it's so
[41:09.400 --> 41:13.280]  embarrassing I've never even aired it I'm listening to recording of it cuz my
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.120]  iPhone's like over here in the box like five feet away and you can boost it in
[41:16.120 --> 41:25.160]  here and and it's it's it's I can lie to myself and say I went through a partial
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.480]  pat down because I was doing a test and that was kind of my rationale it's 9 a.m.
[41:29.480 --> 41:36.400]  I've been up till 4 a.m. with Sean Stone and Tyrell Ventura yes I did have a
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.960]  couple of toddies when I was out there I shouldn't have and nightcaps I guess
[41:42.960 --> 41:47.360]  they call them and I'm sitting there and I just want to get on the plane go
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.880]  sleep I want to get home of course the adventure didn't in there then they had
[41:52.880 --> 41:58.240]  the dead soldier on the plane and all of that it was wild and I just was like
[41:58.240 --> 42:03.520]  I just I did say just do not touch my journals doctors have touched them a
[42:03.520 --> 42:10.920]  few times you know in physicals I just I can't handle it and he didn't he didn't
[42:10.920 --> 42:13.760]  do it because I stopped after I went through and watched them grabbing men's
[42:13.760 --> 42:17.520]  generals grabbing women's generals they go right at them women's breasts grab
[42:17.520 --> 42:25.120]  them I mean again if my wife isn't in we've all had girlfriends wives you know
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.520]  women if your if your wife isn't expecting it she's there making coffee at
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.440]  6 a.m. and you come up behind her and you know hug her and she sometimes they
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.760]  like it sometimes they don't you know this is a this is a this is a big deal
[42:35.760 --> 42:42.160]  being touched and it's such a violation that's why they've had combat veterans
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.440]  who are airline pilots who can't fly and go and throw up because it's not just
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.200]  like cops you've seen cops do frisking there's like okay checking kids you're
[42:52.200 --> 42:55.840]  arrested and they're like you actually looking for a weapon they could see
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.080]  there's not one in your pants whatever they'll search you for drugs at the jail
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.000]  they're not wanting to go in your pants most of them with a TSA I mean hot blonde
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.280]  going through I'm like watch this a flung would do an error I'm like watch this

[43:16.240 --> 43:18.920]  like get her over here even after the body scan they're just like men are just
[43:18.920 --> 43:23.200]  going oh and it is I mean they've even had TSA come up with naked body scans of
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.920]  men and women movie stars and ask them to sign it and had women hit on the men
[43:27.920 --> 43:33.080]  and say I want to date they've had to settle for this they've had to settle
[43:33.080 --> 43:36.160]  lawsuits where they openly ask them out for dates I just got to say you are
[43:36.160 --> 43:42.200]  totally gorgeous as the woman's crying as they're grabbing their breast I mean
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.480]  this is America and I'm like watch that that woman is gorgeous you know she's

[43:50.360 --> 43:55.760]  yeah and again for a normal man everything about being with your wife
[43:55.760 --> 44:00.960]  where the woman you love is about the excitement the more excited they are the
[44:00.960 --> 44:04.960]  better it is sorry folks don't want to hear this this is real life that's the
[44:04.960 --> 44:11.320]  excitement of sex I'm the opposite of someone and there are people who like to
[44:11.320 --> 44:20.240]  take it who like to be mean opposite of Alex Jones okay this is what we're
[44:20.240 --> 44:24.440]  dealing with so it's like wow you get paid 20 bucks an hour and get to grope
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.320]  14 year old girls and and Dave said that's it I don't even have the money

[44:41.840 --> 44:45.800]  female security guard deaf there was no doubt about her sexual orientation and
[44:45.800 --> 44:50.960]  she enjoyed it what's like miss USA crying they went in her pants are like
[44:50.960 --> 44:59.520]  miss USA they went in her pants and into her body I mean I remember been flying
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.400]  with Ventura when they went into his when they were grabbing the front he was
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.800]  going East Germany East Germany I guess why I'm leaving this country but when
[45:07.800 --> 45:14.280]  they went back behind and up into his buttocks and we're shoving their hand
[45:14.280 --> 45:19.880]  in there Ventura was in was so angry he can confirm this I've never told the
[45:19.880 --> 45:25.480]  story we got in a screaming argument in the taxi to the hotel I mean Ventura
[45:25.480 --> 45:33.400]  this is after we flew to New Orleans Ventura was so angry he was he was in a rage for
[45:33.400 --> 45:36.640]  weeks and that's them when he told me controlled rage he said that's it I'm
[45:36.640 --> 45:40.880]  suing I figured out why I'm so mad at everybody Ventura is real folks not a
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.840]  tough guy a key is actually you know aggressive guy and and and and so we're
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.040]  like are talking about the TSA and I'm like we can fight it we can save America

[46:10.040 --> 46:13.520]  literally the women doing this to Ventura because it was women doing it
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.240]  there at the Atlanta Airport they'll have different sex to it we're going oh

[46:25.840 --> 46:33.480]  inside you I mean it was exactly out of the South Park episode and there were
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.400]  TSA people walk around taking photos of Ventura and he's like is there like five
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.080]  minutes where they're just going all over him and he's just going oh this
[46:42.080 --> 46:47.560]  country and because it built it for like a minute he's letting them rub all
[46:47.560 --> 46:52.800]  over him they go over this chest they they go down his legs then they go up to
[46:52.800 --> 46:56.520]  his genitals then they go and then when they start like let's see what's in there
[46:56.520 --> 47:03.040]  he was just like and I'm taking photos we go get something to eat because the
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.400]  plane's delayed and he goes erase them I go but you might need them if you're

[47:31.800 --> 47:36.560]  is a blow-by-blow of what went on and then the stomping around the airport and
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.760]  he's usually like a big teddy bear really friendly nice guy you know talking to
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.720]  old ladies and stuff but and then I watched him in this rage definitely taking
[47:44.720 --> 47:50.560]  time off his life a controlled rage basically grinding his teeth on the
[47:50.560 --> 48:00.640]  airplane and it's normal I and now here we are in this country that's a Rand

[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.600]  that like Tony Montana in Scarface says you want a chivano in every corner
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.560]  spying on you I mean I mean Cuba does that it's freedom yeah not in my country
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:21.000]  not America not here maybe the new flags should be maybe the new American
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.280]  flags should be like a snitch like like looking through your window blinds in
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.520]  California I'm from the tyranny capital of nation so I mean we know what we know
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.080]  what police the police they told about here in California yeah well I'm gonna
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.400]  shut up I'm gonna shut up tell me what's on your mind well actually the reason
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.840]  I was calling in today was a I don't know if you guys are familiar with the
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.640]  thing that went down this weekend with your holographic images of a Tupac on
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.320]  stage but automatically first thing to pop them and my project blue beam and I
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.960]  know you're familiar with that now I saw there was big news that Tupac you know
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.400]  they've created holograms of him in Disney had that 60 years ago and it is
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.320]  declassified the US government admits they can project 3,000 foot tall Jesus
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:11.680]  Buddha Easter bunnies flying saucers Kebler elves to Bacabra's walruses
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:17.200]  anything they want and exactly and the thought about it was the response that
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.600]  people had from it because on Facebook and Twitter it just going crazy people
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.120]  say oh I got chills from it I did it was real and just all the number one
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.480]  CNN did that during the election they had holograms you know their guests
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.640]  would join them via hologram yeah I do I remember that as well yes I'm on
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.520]  boxing on CNN all of these goggles they've got they phase it in to make
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.760]  sure the slaves won't resist all the movies going to 3D that's getting you
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.040]  ready for bigger goggles it's going to be projected and you're going to wear
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.560]  goggles but but then the next phase this is what James Cameron's coming out
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.920]  with I've talked to top Hollywood folks it's no secret now well you'll you'll go
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.900]  to arenas that are like 80% a bowl and then on a round stage you will see
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:08.240]  holograms and to me and then the scary thing is when you mentioned project
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.960]  blue beam of people after they post these videos of the Tupac holograms they
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.640]  say well what's that what's that nobody even knows what project blue beam is
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.200]  nobody even knows if the government has a technology and nobody knows NASA can
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.320]  do this and it's just sad but you know as soon as to most of them know they've
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.920]  been injected with the dozens of deadly cancer viruses that are meant to trigger
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.080]  when their hormone levels go to a certain point when they're 55 60 so the
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.240]  government doesn't have to pay on their social security most of them don't don't
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.840]  know they've been implanted basically the analogy I'm going to do a YouTube
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.480]  video it's like escape from New York where they put exploding detonators and
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.560]  snake plizcans next in his carotid arteries you've all we've all been
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.440]  implanted with exploding viral plaques I mean we ought to be mad at these people
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.920]  they've already taken 20 30% off our lives some people it triggers early so

[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:33.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.680]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.000]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.760]  forecaster had been homeless in a few weeks so much has happened so much has
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.880]  been unfolding we have a stack of articles at info wars.com today breaking
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.160]  this down it is so important to get to your friends and family and explain to
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:03.040]  them Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and a handful of other big banks are directly
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.920]  engaged in a global coup d'etat over every sovereign nation they admit this
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.920]  and call it that themselves in their own documents and the financial times and
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.000]  the economists they're proud of it just search Goldman Sachs coup in Europe they
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.480]  brag the money's not owed to them it's their debt their fraud they built a
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.720]  Ponzi scheme so big and then threatened to bring down the world market if you
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.280]  don't give in to them it's like strapping a nuclear weapon to yourself and
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.000]  saying do what I say or I'll detonate it in the middle of Chicago that's what
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.520]  we're talking about here this is the new world order and they've got their
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.000]  operatives in there everywhere and they're now federalizing the police
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.960]  they're putting spies on the street they're training the police for forced
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.800]  inoculations blood draws I was just talking to a friend where it had been
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:05.800]  more than 10 years she's younger than I am a little more than 10 years since he'd
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.640]  been 18 years old and had done some odd jobs and didn't even know about paying
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.160]  taxes it had been a few hundred dollars it turned into more than $5,000 with
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:23.240]  penalties and interest after a decade I didn't even know they could do that but
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.960]  I guess they can do anything now and the internal revenue service that collects
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.000]  money for the private fellow reserve the banksters we've been captured by
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.360]  through fraud recognize that the coup d'etat the financial coup d'etat that's
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.920]  how you begin to remove them get past the puppets and the pageantry of Mitt
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:48.440]  Romney versus everybody else and Obama and get to the fact that this is who's
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:11:00.880]  running the society okay and it's hiding in plain view and it's us or them
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.320]  Goldman Sachs rules the world Bank of England next financial terrorists have
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.280]  exploited chaos they created a cease-complete control Mark Carney the
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.160]  governor of Canada central bank has been informally approached as the
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:21.000]  potential candidate replace sir Marvin King as the head of the Bank of England
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.760]  in June of next year reports the Financial Times now he's the head of the
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.800]  Bank of Canada which is private right now it's their Federal Reserve it's all
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.200]  the same shareholders the point is he's former Goldman Sachs he was involved in
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.120]  the Russian crisis in 98 looting and robbing them as well it's all the
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:49.840]  same I mean these guys wear suits they look distinguished Ted Bundy look
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:59.000]  distinguished and this is what they're doing and they're in purposefully
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  imploding the world not just to get the assets they want you poor so they can
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.160]  take control of your life these are you Genesis to a man you're not in the club
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.080]  if you're not into this it's the psycho religion the control freak abuser
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.040]  predator religion that sees us as a side of lamb on the table to be carved up
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.640]  well I'm not a lamb to be carved up punks and I'm sick of what you've done
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.080]  and you people are so stupid on your power trips I've studied you you've got
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.360]  blowback from all the evil you're doing into your own families in your own
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.200]  lives but you don't care you want to carry out the evil no matter what you're
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.520]  not even winning it's bad enough to be evil and ruthless but you're you're
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.480]  you're destroying the planet in the process of telling us you're saving it
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:51.280]  you're given over to true true dark side and you're not in control forces a lot
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.080]  darker than you are you're only instruments of this and you know it but
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:02.800]  you don't care you're attracted like moths to that black flame Goldman Sachs
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.160]  rules the world Bank of England next financial terrorists have exploited
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.600]  chaos they created to seize complete control I made Euro swamp the IMF
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.880]  rethink saucedarity that's what Dominique Strauss Con said before they set him up
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.120]  with the fake hooker which is now admitted to be fake and a French
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.600]  intelligence operation we told you that day one it's now been confirmed
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.200]  Sarkozy did stuff like Twitter before the police had even been called if they
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.920]  get their time zone straight and it came out that he was under British excuse me
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.440]  French intelligence and that whole thing was run by them and she was
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.560]  connected to organized crime of course run by French intelligence and others so
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.000]  so so now they're saying if we squeeze too tight it'll implode things faster so
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  the bankers are debating hey and but the high up ones are like that's the point
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.440]  destroy it's like but the DU if we use it in Lebanon I'll blow back into Israel
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:58.480]  the DU if we use it in other areas like Gaza blows right back across us in the
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.040]  prevailing winds of a Mediterranean and the new order just said use thousands of
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.520]  guns but it'll kill everybody in Israel soft kill fire weapons everyone must
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:14.320]  partake of death in the new world order continuing here okay let's go to Bob
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.360]  Chapman Bob what do you make of the statements I've made what's the latest
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.000]  there at the international forecaster in your research what's happening what's
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.200]  the latest manipulation what do you make a core sign the announcement that he did
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.440]  lie he did steal the money and he's not going to get in trouble
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:38.080]  well that's a real helpful because he should be fine at least you know very
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.200]  very very large fine but I think that's what will happen in the end and they
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.520]  said when the story broke I explained why I said everybody's going to get their
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:54.640]  money back right now they've got about 68 to 70 percent back and in time they'll
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.160]  work it out that's at least that's my take on it in reference to what you were
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  talking about have you discussed the new house bill 1318 I think it is which has
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.280]  been passed in the Senate and is now in the House and Committee and I think it's
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:32.880]  transportation bill and product bill is to confiscate or cancel passports of
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:40.000]  people who try to leave the country who all the government money are you familiar
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  with that I'm a little bit Bob tell me more well it's really as simple as that
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.960]  of course you could step aside and say well that's what you want to do clear
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.120]  everybody to make sure they don't own the IRS money before they try to take a
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.760]  trip but they're not going to do that they're going to terrorize people at the
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:09.360]  airport and I think that's good rep you know this bill and this I'll call it an
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:15.240]  amendment to that bill I think that they're going to have real problems
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:20.400]  passing that and it could be struck down but he just shows you the length of what
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.760]  these people do sure I'm familiar with the bill that's passed the Senate they
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.600]  think's gonna pass the house to create debtors prisons basically and not let
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.880]  you leave the country and Homeland Security has said they're gonna not let
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.240]  you have a job if you owe taxes next now no judge no jury you can't revoke
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:44.160]  someone's citizenship they have to renounce it that's part of law part of
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.680]  the Constitution and the lawyers concur with my analysis because I've seen
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.160]  them in the new sense saying yes this is basically revoking citizenship by
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:58.800]  stealth to say we're canceling your passport I mean that is only Stalin did
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.600]  stuff like that I mean this is in people like well they're now doing it for
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.240]  people that hadn't paid their child support that's what I mean it's it it's
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.720]  totally illegal but but so is having federal spies on the streets randomly
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:19.480]  spying on people with pre-crime Bob that's true why do you think it's
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:25.720]  moving so fast and they're so out in the open they've ever get a lot of stuff
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:33.200]  lined up that they want to put in position I mean to week before last we
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:42.520]  had a woman who runs the commodities for J.P. Morgan Chase and play masters on
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:52.760]  CNBC you know in that capacity she nor anybody else had ever been on JPM on
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:18:01.880]  behalf of JPM and CNBC and everything was pre-staged and she was making
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:07.560]  excuses why they were following the law because people were saying that the
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.720]  markets were rigged so we manipulated and we wouldn't do that sort of thing
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.400]  we're not that kind of company we're just working for our clients so there's
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.760]  something in that area coming down the road I don't know what it is yet I would
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:35.040]  suspect perhaps the 50T might be going to make some limitations and actually
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:44.320]  police them for the purchase of different kinds of futures and in
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.640]  particular in this case they've been manipulating the market for a long time
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.360]  but now it's in a big way and maybe what maybe they want to get the owner
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:59.840]  stuff that back for all I know but something's going on well it certainly
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.760]  is and they're trying to accelerate basically a soft martial law to get
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.680]  everybody ready for it so what I hear from you is it looks like things are
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.280]  deteriorating a lot faster is that what you're saying Bob it is and it was in
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:23.120]  relation to your comment that that is and yes it is expedition of the plans
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.680]  that they have put in place and haven't had in place many many years Bob we're
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.400]  gonna go to break I want to take a bunch of calls because whatever issue they
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.160]  raise on the waterfront I know you can comment on it and it's always
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.840]  interesting and then towards the end of the hour other tidbits that you think
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.280]  are important people should should look into and I'll throw out some other news
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.720]  that you I'll get your take on Ron Paul we got Senator Rand Paul coming up

[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.040]  Bob Chapman is our guest and I didn't know that he was under the weather but we
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.480]  still appreciate him joining us we can hear that in his voice I want to go to
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.600]  some of your phone calls and we will start those in the next segment but Bob
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.520]  I'm always asking you know the questions here tell me some of the things the
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.120]  international forecaster has been looking at and what you think is most
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:42.040]  important on the radar screen. Well I think overall you're looking at a
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:50.840]  situation in Europe that is insolvable and they don't know what to do now if
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:57.440]  you notice for a month or so you've not heard much from the illuminous the
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:07.320]  protests of politicians and now there's a fight going on between the Europeans in
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:14.640]  the US members and the Europeans are saying look you got to help us with this
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:21.720]  thing we already put a lot of money to it into it we want you to put in along
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:29.440]  with Japan and China and other third world countries that haven't put
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.280]  anything in we want you to put a lot more money in and they say why should we
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:41.800]  do that we didn't create the problem you did and that's what's going on and it
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.520]  could lead to no good end because they're not cooperating with each other
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.040]  that's been going on for what I think is a substantial amount of time and so I
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.480]  think you're gonna have some blow-ups here we had three more suicides in
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:07.320]  Greece yesterday I don't know what the election is going to accomplish on May
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:17.920]  6th the they cannot be a majority and even if the two major parties got
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:25.240]  together they still only get 40% of all at the outside so there may be two or
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:33.080]  three elections until finally something happens there's a major investigation
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:40.600]  going on with a former member of the government who stole millions and
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:52.200]  millions and this was a program where in the process of purchasing
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:27:00.120]  silent submarines the money was sure we through a group of offshore
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  corporations tell you know that this person is guilty because why would he do
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:12.240]  such a thing are you talking about Greece right now yes I am yeah let me
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.840]  raise this point to you this is out of the Washington Post saying what you just
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:22.800]  said I'm at Euro slump the IMF rethinks austerity and you had said eight nine
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.400]  months ago whenever that Dominique Strauss content happened that it was a
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:31.320]  set up that it was run by Sarkozy that later came out and that Khan didn't want
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.960]  to squeeze as hard not because he's a nice guy but he's saying we're gonna
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:41.280]  kill the golden goose you can't impoverish them this fast and so they
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.600]  basically removed him because he was set to also be able to beat Sarkozy coming
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:50.120]  up in the election now the person that you're friends with LaPen's doing good
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.920]  but the the point here is that the bankers are realizing that they are
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:00.920]  killing the golden goose and and they're now admitting this and they have no
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.280]  solution to the debt now they get Spain on their hands you're talking a minimum
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:12.760]  of 125 trillion and it could be as high as two two and a half trillion if you
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.600]  put them all together you get six trillion and there's no way they can come up
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:23.840]  with it without destroying their financial base and so we continue to
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.480]  take the avoidance of responsibility as to what that going to we're trying to do
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:38.040]  and so all of that is in the pot so to speak and there are no solutions so this
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.800]  is one of the reasons why gold and silver are being held down because they
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.960]  would want them going up 200 300 points in the face of this terrible
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.880]  predicament that exists in Europe which could very well lead to the demise of
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:02.880]  the next couple years of the eurozone that unraveling what do you expect gold
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.720]  to do with that unraveling accelerates because I know it always takes longer
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.200]  but you're saying one or two years a lot of experts are saying six months or so
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:19.160]  just not telling but I I think this year it would be safe to say that gold
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.760]  could test two thousand twenty two hundred I you it's very hard to make
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.040]  predictions because they keep on you know moving the gold post yeah things are
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.360]  so rigged now it's admitted we're in total a la land here I mean there's
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.400]  incredible inflation they tell us there basically is no inflation they tell us
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:43.080]  unemployment is less than half of what it really is next are going to tell us
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:50.840]  pigs can fly phone calls for Bob Chapman straight ahead I'm Alex Jones we're on
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:30:01.760]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I had
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.520]  tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.920]  weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.040]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:18.640]  that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.800]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team dot com
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:29.680]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two

[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.520]  than 37 pounds in just two months now that's results I want to challenge my

[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:54.640]  why do you think I'm a baroque if there's a new way I'll be the first in line but
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.400]  about to work this time yeah I want to go back to our republic back to our
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.360]  Constitution people keep blaming the Constitution Time Magazine Newsweek they
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.600]  want you to know all the problems are the fault of that of course they're the
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:11.080]  ones who've already basically gotten rid of it and Jeepers Creepers you get rid
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.600]  of it you're a giant slave we're going to calls but Bob what else is on your
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.800]  radar screen right now well I think that life the last item is very important I
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:29.480]  hope that the listening audience pursues that bill in the house house bill 1813 I
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:37.480]  think it is and you know each time they go to try to pass one of these things if
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:44.440]  we can stop them I knew it's a small victory but it's a very important one you
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:52.320]  brushed upon earlier what's going to happen with Corazine and I think that's
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.920]  going to fall into the background because I I believe that what they'll do is
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:03.160]  fine them and but it won't be a tough fine and maybe even the company this
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:10.880]  bankrupt or pay it but there's a lot more of these coming down the line and we
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:18.520]  get suits against shaking more Bank of America while Svargo we have people
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:23.760]  getting caught and in the commodity business
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:31.000]  taking positions and putting them on hold by putting them in another company
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.480]  account there's all sorts of terrible things going on in that industry and I
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.640]  think a lot more of them are going to come to surface and they're in the
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:47.000]  process of doing so now yeah that's what it telegraphs to me their reluctance to
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.960]  prosecute him is because they know they're all in the same position and so
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.800]  they're setting the precedent to not pay people and to take folks's money and
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:08.040]  that's what Max Kaiser says that's what other guests we've had on confirm I mean
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.400]  I know you don't have to give us timeframes on the meltdown but it's
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:20.280]  pretty bad now what what signs should we look for well I think of the bond
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:29.560]  market is the first place to look and they have just been unsuccessful at
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:36.760]  taking the 10-year US note down to a yield of two and a half percent it's I
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:46.280]  should say the the outside market the long bonds in that category and I think
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:52.280]  what they're going to start doing again is a continuation of Operation Twist
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:59.360]  which is aiding markets in one place and selling in another place and it's
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.680]  coming to light too that they're taking direct orders from Jake P Morgan Chase
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:13.600]  and Goldman Sachs and I see that alluded to in much of the press throughout
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:22.440]  the world and that's something really new like they're the bad guys and they're
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:31.000]  not really taking orders they're taking orders from Wall Street well said let's
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.120]  go to your phone calls Nicole in Michigan you're on the air hi Alex thanks
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:41.840]  so much for taking my call thanks for calling I actually had a question about
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.320]  vaccines but my husband is here with me and he wanted to share an experience he
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.480]  had in the military with a vaccine my name is John sure go ahead hey I was
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:58.920]  medically discharged from the Air Force pending a quote-unquote flu shot within
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:06.160]  an hour of having this thing I was with an anaphylactic we call that anaphylactic
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.520]  shock and it lasted for over a over a couple years yeah you know a lot of
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.720]  times they tell you they're shooting you up with one thing and it's really
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:21.080]  another you might have been shot up with a small amount of nerve gas biological
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.880]  you really have no idea they use you in late-stage testing of weapons systems
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.640]  you name it you can look up project Shad and other programs that have gone on
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.640]  right up until the 90s that's the latest stuff we've seen declassified and they
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.840]  actually kill us troops routinely us troops are seen as expendable basically
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.880]  like Reese's monkeys or rats and I had one of Governor Perry's employees who I've
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.840]  seen on television it is one of his spokesman come to my in-game event when
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.680]  I was showing the in-game film and he said no it's it's I was at Fort Sam
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.440]  Houston in San Antonio I was a medic a decade ago this is a decade from then
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.280]  and he said that we were told to shoot him up with a flu shot and they all died
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:12.080]  and then we were told to scrub the whole thing out so that's the type of stuff
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  they do I mean was it a special shot or do they line everybody up and give them
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:25.720]  the shots check this out we have routine flu shots on a yearly basis and around
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.240]  that time they were having the anthrax shot and I told them I said I wasn't
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.520]  gonna get it and I told my chief I said I'm not taking this anthrax shot and he
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.120]  said you're gonna be court-martialed and probably dishonorable discharge I said
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:43.720]  well I'd rather have that than die so they just lied and said here's the flu
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.160]  shot it was probably anthrax because the anthrax did kill a bunch of people and
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.880]  they had mutinies finally as you know was in the newspapers and the doctors
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.080]  said they wouldn't do it so it stopped because it was causing anaphylactic shock
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.840]  heart attacks death autoimmune disorders what year was this that this happened to
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:09.080]  you yeah it it was what was it it was around the year 2003 2002 2003 no it was
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:15.920]  2001 or 2002 I think yeah yeah it was 2002 late 0102 when the government did
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.440]  the anthrax attacks and now admitted was super US grade was mailed from Fort
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.600]  Dietrich and all the rest of it and they you know had a couple patsies that
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.520]  they tried to set up and they finally killed one of them to just to make it
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.240]  stick but yeah that was the first time they did it and then and then they had
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:36.040]  to suspend it because the maker you know admittedly had so many problems at
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.840]  their plant it was so so it was killing so many people but it wasn't a problem
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  they're just seeing if they can do this to you wow that's amazing so so how tell
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.280]  folks what it was like to be in the shock for a year then we'll get Bob's
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.640]  take let me let me evaluate there let me elaborate a little bit more on this
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.300]  shot they gave me the shot and within an hour I was in the emergency room almost
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:02.840]  dead they had to pump me full of different drugs and stuff to get me out
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:08.160]  of it well long story short about three times a month I would get this reaction
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.680]  and it would happen just whenever it wake me up at 2 3 in the morning or it
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.280]  happened when I got to work and I was covered from head to toe with red spots
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:22.000]  for up to a year over a year that was your body battling to get I mean it
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.880]  turned out with that shot it had I'm not trying to scare you look this up so
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.920]  many cancer viruses and other microplasms in it that particular shot
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.760]  that they they couldn't even count them all I mean you were shot up with just
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:41.360]  an incredible bio weapon and you are now in all those trips that got at a walking
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.080]  laboratory experiment I mean they committed an amazing crime against you
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.120]  yeah my immune system is shot I get sick quite often now where before like when I
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.240]  was in high school I had a perfect attendance award I never missed work
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:00.160]  and then once I got this shot I was I'm I'm highly allergic to everything what
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.440]  do you think happened do you think they lied to you and gave you an anthrax and
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.840]  told you it was flu well I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure I really can't
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.160]  say because they do these mass flu shots where you like we would go to the base
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.440]  theater and you would just line up and get them so I don't know if they said
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.440]  all right I've got his number I'm gonna get him a different dose then they lie
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.080]  to you then they lie to you and say it's the law you you know the military is the
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.200]  only group when you sign the contract that says they can give approved FDA
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.720]  approved shots but it's law no experimental but they just lie to you
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.640]  and shoot you up and all the stupid sergeants and captains and majors that
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.120]  take part in it they're all walking dead too and so I hope they all enjoy following
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.600]  orders because you're dead it's gonna take a lot of time off your life and the
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.320]  reason I'm being a straight shooter with you buddy is so other people listen and
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.400]  and so this stops and so people stop shooting their kids up because they are
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.000]  killing us and I'm sorry to talk that harsh to you but I'm sure you want to
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  warn other people what would you do now if you had it all over to do again
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.240]  well I wouldn't take it obviously but it was kind of funny is I've had this flu
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:14.040]  shot on a yearly basis I was in the military for eight years and I've had
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:21.520]  that same flu shot supposedly same flu shot every year and they also build up
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.880]  and they're different every year and it never they never guessed the right flu
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.200]  the year before never works on record each year lowers your immunity by 50%
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.160]  big Canadian studies so you just keep lowering it lowering it three
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.240]  consecutive shots if you're above the age of 55 major studies doubles your
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.320]  chances of Alzheimer's most people I talked to I go when did your mom or dad
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.760]  really started deteriorating and then you got diagnosed they said I don't know
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.480]  it was six months ago and I said did they get a flu shot about a week before
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:58.600]  and they went that's right she did we thought oh I'm like let me show you right
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.760]  here at the computer and I just take them over the prominent person a few
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.120]  weeks ago I was talking to about this and they went and I'm like look there's
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:11.560]  the studies again they're murdering us but they murder us in a way where we
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:16.200]  crawl off and then their system can suck money out of us but listen but you look
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.880]  like your body may fight it off eventually with the proper vitamins
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.760]  minerals and and prayer and cleansing and things but at least you're not like
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.320]  the troops in Project Shad where in some cases they would take them into a room
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.600]  nerve gas them and they die on the spot and then they tell their family they
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.440]  died of flu so at least you weren't murdered on the spot as part of the
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.920]  patriotic freedom by the criminals that run things how does that sound sir oh
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.360]  it's great but listen I'm gonna get Bob Chapman's take on this Bob you're a
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.760]  veteran yourself I know you've studied all this what do you what do you think
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.360]  about what the globalists do to people the little gift they get everybody that
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:45:01.480]  keeps giving well it was like as I look back I was lucky I wasn't taken into
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:08.040]  some of those programs they look mostly biological at that time they had other
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:16.000]  kinds of programs but you know you never would think for a second that your own
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.760]  government would give you something that would kill you and they are and they
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.400]  have been and evidently they'll continue to well they really love killing kids
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:33.360]  people taking a going in the military you better think twice well that's the
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.520]  issue here is that it's all on record and it's not just military it's foster
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.880]  kids it's it's it's regular you know kids just getting shots and again you're
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.000]  right you never think the government would do that this type of betrayal but
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.120]  it's not the government it's the banker eugenics crime syndicate that now has
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.960]  reached critical mass and has gotten its people in almost all the major power
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.800]  positions that's why it's so refreshing to have a Ron Paul in Congress or a
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:04.880]  senator Paul or Walter Jones but maybe 50 or so Ron Paul I agree with this
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:10.760]  number and in the house are good 10 good senators ran said and I talked to him
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:15.600]  today that the interview is coming up I mean that's scary 50 or so members of
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:24.720]  the house 10 senators all the rest are wanton scum unbelievable unbelievable
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.560]  folks I'm gonna explain something the guys Google everything I'm saying in
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.200]  there or sharp page it they search it they just showed all the sad documents
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.800]  on on TV if you're watching I'm not making this up I can pull up AP BBC and
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:43.000]  it'll say yes in thousands of tests on ships they sprayed chemical biological
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.920]  radiological but then if you read deeper and then get into the Department of
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.840]  Energy and other documents folks that they would kill people the media tells
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.600]  you about people they sprayed that you know get tumors and died 10 20 years
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.280]  later in many cases they they go all right you guys show up we're picking
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:11.200]  Johnson Brown the Horowitz you know Sanchez this Saturday your your leaves
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.400]  canceled you're just I've read the records I've had some of the survivors on
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.560]  of some of the tests that weren't as lethal and then they just march them in
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:21.280]  nerve gas them and they've got these special doctors who then package them
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.560]  they always send everybody else off on leave they kill them and then they
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.240]  dissect their bodies and then they tell their family they died a flu I mean I
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:34.760]  mean the magnitude of this evil but it's the globalist testing cadres of
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:43.920]  doctors that will march a young private in and murder them murder them I mean
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:50.720]  this is who runs our government Bob absolutely it took on for a long time
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.840]  and you know I can tell you that the only way we're going to take this thing
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:04.920]  down and how that's done through Congress is to have the the financial
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:10.600]  system self-destruct and when that happens they're a little bit of control
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.680]  and that's the only way I can see getting to them and it's key when it
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.680]  collapses that they don't use it as judo to get even more power opposing a
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.360]  savior's we've got to demonize them with the truth we have got to overrun them
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.920]  with the facts we have got to expose them as the murdering terrorists they
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:33.080]  are the financial terrorists we've got to show they're the real government that
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:37.680]  hijacked our government the buck stops with them not with Mitt Romney or Obama
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:44.160]  these teleprompter reading puppets anything else there well Nicole's husband
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.360]  who jumped on the phone hey John hey I didn't give you the kicker as I went
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.240]  into the clinic to the shop clinic to talk to them about this shop several
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.040]  months after I've been having all these reactions and they pulled up my shot
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  record on the computer and they said yeah it looks like you got two shots that
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:06.280]  day I said no I only got one shot and I pulled out my hard copy of my shot
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.000]  records and they said let me look at that and I let them look at it and they
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.600]  said here let me delete this one and they deleted the one on the computer and
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.720]  then they got ready to get rid to scratch the one off on my hard cock and I
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.600]  snatched it back from I said I'll just hold on to that what do you think of
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.720]  that oh no the people that are over that know it's killing people in many
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.720]  cases and it's like fun it's like a power trip listen whenever they six years
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.280]  ago lined up the thousand plus kids and their parents in Maryland and Baltimore
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.440]  and said it was the law and had riot cops and dogs barking because it'd been a
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.400]  big media issue saying it's the law you got to take the shots I got the state
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.360]  attorney on who was running at all and I said you know there's no law you know
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.800]  you kick them out for truancy because they haven't had shots and then use that
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:58.360]  criminally even though by law you can't kick them out for truancy when you're
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.800]  the one that kicked him out and you can't kick him out for no shots and he
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.120]  goes well you ought to be a lawyer that's exact it starts laughing and he
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.920]  goes well the judge had the waiver forms on his desk but I go you didn't tell

[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.040]  laughed and said no I don't at least like they think they're winning because
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.320]  they conned a bunch of people to come in and take shots they wouldn't give their
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.840]  own kid and then the waiver forms right up on the desk but they don't tell you

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:25.480]  science something just hit me between the eyes during the break I'm here on
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:31.720]  air and I'm telling the story of the police dogs barking the black uniforms
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:37.720]  it was 1200 children over a thousand parents it was over 2000 it was on CNN
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:44.240]  MSNBC was a big story it was a hoax that it's the law to take shots and they
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:48.340]  ran this media hoax to scare everybody at the beginning of the school year I
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:52.920]  think it was like 2007 that was the year in game came out so five years ago
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:59.880]  almost six years ago and I'm there telling that story just now and I feel
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.840]  like a liar I saw it on the news I had the state attorney on forget his name is
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.440]  a black guy it was the state attorney over Prince George County or whatever
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:17.720]  it's called and it's so incredible that I know that story is exactly true as I
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.320]  just told it I don't even been John Harmon board hopping and producing and
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.000]  running the show that day he's the guy that gets to hear the behind the scene
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.400]  stuff sometimes but still truth is so wild I can't believe it but it was on
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:36.280]  the news that they lied had police dogs out for security because people been
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.000]  protesting it there were people there trying to warn the parents the cops
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.240]  wouldn't let them go up and try to warn them and that's when it hits me that's
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.600]  why I got mad by the police shutting down the city for five hours for that
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:56.640]  police officers motorcade who was killed valiant police officer great guy for
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.880]  people I know that knowing knew him it's that they shut it down on purpose and
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.840]  have this big pageant about how much they care about the police and they'll
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:08.440]  do the same thing for certain military funerals but the cops that were killed
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.600]  in fast and furious they didn't have big parades for them because they don't
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:14.360]  want to make a big deal out of it because it was killed by guns the attorney
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.360]  general help ship in and that's my point they'll have these big giant pageants
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.680]  for the military and police but at the end of the day the system could care less
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.440]  about you that's what I'm trying to say is the bigger the pageant the new old
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.160]  order puts on like I'm sure Arte Sveita actually probably was crying you know
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.640]  for that police officer that got killed because now I've learned that they
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.480]  actually knew each other and that they were somewhat of friends so you know I
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.440]  apologize for saying Arte Sveita was probably fake crying the point is now
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.160]  that I've learned more about it behind the scenes the point is is that Bob you
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:51.600]  get when I'm saying that I'm tired of like these big productions of how much
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.440]  they care about the troops when the people running our military are killing
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:02.360]  our troops you see what I'm saying absolutely and the people of the
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.680]  military of the Pentagon and they're doing that for two reasons number one to
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.880]  take out is where we're gonna have a war next and number two to steal as much as
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:19.480]  they can exactly and I mean even a lot of the higher-up officers aren't bad
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:22.600]  people they're just order takers they just follow orders and don't worry about
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.520]  it they're busy playing golf hanging out with their mistress and and so what if
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.080]  do you is soft killing all the troops that huff it I mean that is such a huge
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.840]  crime right there and that's why when they want me to get up and salute some
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.440]  dead soldier when I get off an airplane and then wait there for 30 minutes I
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:44.840]  would be happy to salute them but I guarantee and I did but if I was to go
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.000]  up or you know put my hand over my heart or whatever which is a salute
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.440]  basically if I went up and told all those Austin cops waiting to take that
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:58.120]  dead Air Force MP out to Fort Hood to be buried I'll guarantee if I walked up and
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.480]  said hey the troops are breathing do you it's bad for them it's killing them
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.800]  they're not giving them treatment they'd be like get out of here traitor see
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.780]  being patriotic to them is being mindless and going along with the
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:13.120]  traitorous activity and then acting like you're patriotic you see the
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:21.480]  hypocrisy there Bob I certainly do and when the minute of confrontation comes
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:28.560]  and it will come between the public and those in the military who were willing
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:35.600]  to shoot it public they're gonna find out that they made the wrong choice that's
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:41.880]  right those of you that shunned on with the devil you're not gonna like it you

[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:49.360]  before we went live today there's video and audio that is coming up with the
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:56.000]  senator breaking news on that front right now let's go back to John in Texas
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.200]  then ghost Lloyd Ed Ivan and others like Ivan's after John John you're on the
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.440]  air with Bob Chapman go ahead yes Bob Chapman I got a question for you it's
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.440]  good to talk to you welcome back to the show I was watching Fox and Friends also
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.280]  known as Fox and Themes and I was listening to how President Obama is
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:23.440]  now snatching up oceans so the United Nations and our government is now not
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:29.120]  only snatching up land but oceans and I want to see what you think about that
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:34.760]  and what's the difference between Americans during World War one when they
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:41.440]  refused to take the League of Nations and Americans today who still insist on
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:47.160]  letting the United Nations control things thank you the difference is the
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.360]  globalist had more sophisticated radio and could brainwash the public sorry go
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:58.840]  ahead Bob yeah as far as the two wars are concerned most people who were in
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:07.200]  them or alive are brainwashed I mean that's all I heard for the last 100
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:14.000]  years or less and so that's the kind of reaction you would get I would go to the
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.800]  American Legion and sit down and stop talking to people and you can't bring
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:28.000]  that subject up they don't want to know that they would take an advantage out
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:38.160]  that was what was the other part of your question sir John dropped off I mean I
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:44.560]  think basically he was asking why did Americans reject the UN after World War
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:52.960]  one but accepted after World War two I think because you had different kind of
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:03:01.920]  people America changed that's over 50 years they didn't have the kind of
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:10.720]  propaganda during the late teens and early 20s any and I think later yeah it
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.040]  was just print but but then they had newsreels and radio and it got really
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:22.320]  slick at brainwashing I think Madison M must have gotten 50 75 percent of their
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:27.480]  business on the government putting together those programs to brainwash
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:32.320]  people I know what I was taking advertising in college we discussed it
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:42.120]  and then later books came out on brainwashing and what the Chinese and
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:47.720]  North Koreans had done and never mentioning what the US had done you
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.800]  know that's a good point that brainwashing Edward Bernays Madison
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.640]  Avenue all of that's on record but the public's brainwash to think brainwashing
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:07.840]  doesn't exist brain we live in a brainwashed country for sure to believe
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.040]  the stories that they're given to people I still believe them well these are
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.800]  medical victims I mean that's why I used to get really get mad at sheep when
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.760]  they laugh at me and stuff now it's like a retarded child laughing at me I mean
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:26.760]  it doesn't I'm sad for them I'm like literally I'm like oh dear 15 years ago
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.640]  somebody laugh at me call me a tinfoil hat wearer I would I would kind of kind

[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.400]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:09.960]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.040]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:17.480]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:22.240]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:49.760]  he gets into will he ever run for president he also talks about would he
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:56.640]  accept an invitation to run as vice president with Mitt Romney I'm not very
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.560]  good at hyping things actually folks I'm good at seeing reality and really
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.400]  cutting down to what it is but I should have been telling you that from the very
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:08.800]  beginning of the show today if I wanted to have everybody stay right through to
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:14.640]  the end of the show but because this is important information coming up with Rand
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.760]  Paul Bob Chapman's our guest taking phone calls right now let's go ahead and
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:29.680]  talk to Ivan in Florida you're on the air sir hey don Alex good I was I heard
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:35.640]  your show the other day what Wesley Rawls and my question is how do you prepare
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:40.280]  if you either renting or you have a high mortgage in your home for the coming
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:44.400]  economics collapse well there's just a very good chance it could get great
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.480]  depression level and for folks that don't know seven million people starved to
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:54.960]  death or died from complications from malnutrition that's university numbers
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:00.800]  you can look them up and I've already gone over the fact that 90 percent or
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:07.080]  close to it are are not self-sufficient so it's just good to have a firearm with
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:13.480]  ammo to have a couple firearms you can afford it and it's good to have some
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:18.120]  extra food and a water filter and by the way we have the best water filter out
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:21.960]  there it's the pro pure gravity fed system of all the gravity systems there's
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:25.680]  some good ones out there this is the next generation it's what I personally use
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:30.600]  it's what we use here it's what we use on the RV available at info wars calm
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.560]  and your purchase supports the broadcast haven't done a plug for anything in two
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:38.880]  hours plus so might as well just tell you about propure and there's a video up
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.360]  there where I break it down at info wars calm but but water filters whatever
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.640]  you can afford some basic food that stores but more importantly as mr. Rawls
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:54.360]  said friends and neighbors or country cousins that if things got really bad
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:11:00.360]  you can go there and work with them so I you know that's kind of my backup plan
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:05.800]  is I live in the somewhat of the country now but still it's only you know 20
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:08.840]  miles outside Austin that's not really enough but I can't commute further than
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:15.200]  that I got country cousins we've actually built a little metal building that
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.800]  can you what's pretty good size actually now as a quote you know hunting camp house
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:25.400]  but it can double for other things so I mean I'm really got the water rainwater
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:31.000]  collection I've really putting in the solar I'm really moved to the country I
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.520]  really put a wall and fence around my house proper and then a fence around the
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:41.040]  property itself was already there I mean I'm really really know this is real Bob
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.680]  Chapman you want to tackle that question I think you've covered it pretty well I
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:55.360]  mean I've done the same thing and I think even if you don't know people well
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:04.920]  that when their food and talk and if they if they have the basics to be able
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:11.560]  to can compete in a terrible environment it's in your best interest to feed them
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:18.200]  and arm them but I mean even if it's a flash crash instead of this slow slide
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:23.080]  into depression that'll take generally a few weeks to start getting crazy even
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:28.720]  the big crash 29 I didn't get wild for a couple years so generally I'm back in
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:34.160]  almost all cases it takes a while for this to unroll the problem is you got
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:40.160]  about two percent getting prepped now if it goes to four percent or so all the
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:44.760]  actuary show everything will skyrocket in price you won't be able to get it the
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:48.240]  supply chains aren't there can you imagine if we have a real depression
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:54.400]  versus people in the 30s on average hard-working very Christian very moral
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.160]  chop wood all day for you know a meal in the country I've already had all the
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:02.800]  woodshop sorry don't have enough food you know to give you a meal I mean my
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:08.680]  family in the country in the middle of nowhere on dirt roads had city people
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:14.040]  coming by all the time wanting help in the 30s I mean the and crime went up and
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:18.520]  almost all the deer and rabbits and squirrels were gone at the end of the
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.120]  Great Depression you know middle-class people you know my great-grandparents
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  went out and came out of season you know shot deer and stuff and everybody did
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.320]  it because there wasn't food at the store and you don't have the money to go
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:35.240]  25 miles into town you know and and a lot of the delivery things you'll stop
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:37.920]  coming because they always had trucks that brought you know food out and stuff
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.080]  you could buy staples you know salesman traveling salesman selling food I mean
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:46.880]  things really shut down for all grapes of wrath is exactly what it's like people
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:51.000]  basically living at slave camps where you can leave and go starve or you can
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.960]  work here as a slave and get ripped off grapes of wrath is not an exaggeration
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:01.080]  they got a lot worse than that and folks you need to understand this is real and
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:05.160]  what's gonna happen is people aren't able to pay the taxes in the rural areas
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:07.680]  and the feds are gonna come with the locals to take the property and they're
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.440]  gonna get their butt shot off and because people aren't gonna leave their land
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:17.440]  and go bankrupt because the government wants some tax money nobody can pay Bob
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:27.160]  Chapman absolutely and I have the city as well but it's more prone to happen in
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:35.760]  the country yeah and you know they can't send 20 or 30 homeland security people
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:43.360]  are local police to each home that they are homestead that they want to take
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:49.240]  over well the police in most cases now are refusing to throw a 90 year old
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:53.920]  women out of the house that the banks foreclosed on just just because they
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:00.040]  can't do it they actually have humanity and and and so look I believe when
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:04.360]  things get really bad you're gonna see the best in many people I believe the
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.080]  police and military are gonna be on our side by and large that's why the system
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.560]  is gonna bring in mercenaries and they're gonna stage psyops to demonize
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:16.880]  the American people they're gonna blow up police stations and shoot cops to try
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.760]  to blame the Patriots for it and I hope the police are sophisticated enough to
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.160]  know in most cases especially if the media is ready to jump on it and ready to
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:31.440]  roll out and it's a spectacular massacre know it stage Bob Chapman
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:43.600]  agreed they'll be great every day a retaliation by people with a broom handles as well as other things of course that's not gonna
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:48.240]  make it if you get 20 people well well armed to gonna take possession of your
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:54.320]  farm or are you home for that matter well and and so you've got to be prepared
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:16:00.560]  that's what Alex has been talking about for the last 15 minutes don't wait get
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:10.440]  it done now and a lot of that's just being prepared mentally because mental
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:17.280]  training is something that's not easy for people usually they learn the
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.920]  difference between what's good and what's bad when the first shot is fired
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:28.080]  and they say how do I use this thing tell me how to site in so I can shoot
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:34.200]  people with it that's usually the learning curve maybe 40% of the
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:40.600]  population yeah let me tell you I'm down here in Texas Bob almost anybody I
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.520]  know from Texas is a pretty good shot it's pretty scary and I know it's like
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:48.640]  that a lot of other rural areas the standard deal in Texas this is standard
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.480]  is you're stuck you sit on in between grand Eddie's legs when you're four
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:59.160]  years old and shoot Folgers coffee cans one after the other with a 410 to teach
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:04.040]  you the power of a firearm then you're told don't touch I want to go through the
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:07.320]  whole training and then the next time you go out and shoot they tell you what a
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.880]  great honor it is to get to shoot now dangerous it is and all the basics and
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:16.840]  if you make any mistakes you get admonished and now you don't get to blow
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.360]  up the Folgers cans so the next time you get a chance you want to do it just
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.800]  right and by the time you're 10 years old you can you can shoot like Annie
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:33.080]  Oakley well our kids grew up that way so and we live in Texas and then in
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:43.080]  California but we did I did the same thing same age four years old now one
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:55.040]  of the interesting things was the first time I shot a pistol at four and it was
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:03.680]  revolver and I pull a hammer back and put my finger over his finger on the
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:09.320]  trigger and pulled it and of course he had people's are as ears well after it
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:15.040]  went off he picked the things off his ears and he said I understand what this
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:22.160]  does yeah it's people that you've got to show a four-year-old that's the age
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:27.360]  goes all the way back to the founding of this country and before back then they
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:30.320]  had to have the rival right out in the open there in a little log cabin and
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:33.520]  you had to have kids by age five knowing how to use it because a lot of times
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:37.320]  daddy and mommy were gone and there's a lot of cases of five-year-olds you know
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:43.800]  shooting marauders and things like that many cases of it and so you had to show
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:47.360]  them this is not a toy you don't play with it and this is the end you point
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:50.840]  and this is where you pull the trigger and you shove this into your shoulder
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:55.880]  and they don't listen the first time that hurt didn't it shove it into your
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:03.760]  shoulder and that's how it's done and then I see these full-grown adults who
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:11.800]  see a gun and literally go into panic fear Bob well it's a preconditioning you
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:18.360]  know they get into that mindset and I don't want to know until they start
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:24.840]  taking in coming higher and then you they say well how can I help I gotta take
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:31.560]  this 16 year well how does it work just pull the trigger it'll work
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:36.160]  surprising what good shots women are one women on average I'm learning are it
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:42.760]  even better shots than men that's the truth well Bob Chapman always been a
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:45.880]  better shot Bob I'm sorry to hear your voice is out thanks for doing this with

[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.040]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:13.840]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.000]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.920]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.000]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:59.280]  are really ready to awaken right now but the biggest thing is when we say we
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.480]  are the resistance it's not like oh we're the resistance against the big
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:08.160]  government people and it's like we're just political and we just say that we're
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.080]  in resistance against the global government run by banks whose policy is
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.840]  to bankrupt the individual destroy national sovereignty destroy the family
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:22.920]  and inject everybody with cancer viruses on record and if you're a new
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:27.000]  listener and heard that are like what just look cancer viruses and vaccines

[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:37.440]  big deal they're doing it on purpose I have all the documents and again I go
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.360]  back to they kill troops and experiments this is not our government it's a group
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:48.200]  of criminals organized around science and this mutual admiration club that
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.680]  they're geniuses it's mad scientist who think they're God that's what the New
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.440]  World Order is financed by a bunch of crazy bankers that took over through
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:02.120]  fraud and and and world governments here goes good to hear from you Lloyd in
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:09.280]  Wisconsin you're on the air hey how you doing good yeah I live over by some
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:15.640]  military base in southeastern Wisconsin and for the past couple months I've been
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:21.520]  here in gunfire pretty frequently around seven o'clock from seven o'clock in
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:26.240]  morning till about eleven o'clock in the afternoon a couple times I would hear it
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.000]  at night around eleven o'clock at night to about one o'clock in the morning I'd
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.880]  call the local police departments around here asking questions about if they know
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.800]  anything that's going on over there and I get nothing but stupid answers like they
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:46.920]  have the enemies sir and I appreciate your call you're the enemy you're the
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:53.680]  enemy number one I'll explain what that means number one the people at the
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:56.480]  local police department their compartmentalized they don't know what's
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:01.400]  going on but you're still seen as pretty much the enemy the other public is one
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:07.280]  group there another and lying to you is just all part of the art of war the
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:11.760]  military lies to its own people the generals get lied to it's all about
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:16.240]  betrayal it's all about dishonor it's all about deception it's all about lies
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:22.200]  it's all about scams look at how the TSA constantly says we don't naked scan

[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:09.120]  drudge report dot com big sis launches undercover tsa spies to ride houston
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:15.520]  buses feds to watch for suspicious activity pre-crime behavior and they
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:22.480]  say general crime the feds and the buses all over the country including houston
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:30.600]  now have giant billboards on the side those decal wraps of tsa agents smiling
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.040]  at you saying keeping america safe i mean total creepville they're not even
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:39.520]  sworn bonded peace officers they're not fbi they're not bonded they're not sworn
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.320]  they're not trained that's why they create a new group where there's no
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.160]  history of teaching the bill of rights and constitution or due process even
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.560]  though the fbi and a lot of police are out of control there's at least a lip
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:56.240]  service paid to that no they teach them they have administrative rights to do
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:02.840]  anything they want to you it is wild and i had the tsa agents say i'm gonna
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:07.160]  grope you or you're not gonna fly and i said but it violates fourth minute he
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:11.920]  goes i have administrative rights and so you can leave by the way when that
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:16.640]  happens they try to find you or arrest you or you're gonna let me do this and
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:22.280]  it was bizarre the getting off on it i mean this is the country we live in and
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:26.920]  now right out of classical police states people keep saying we're about to be a
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.520]  police state no no we are one the irs can grab your bank account without a judge
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:37.880]  without a jury without a trial you're in a police state the government can
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.760]  grope you you're in a police state they can pull you over to warrantless
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.320]  checkpoint you're in a police state they can say that the president's launching
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:53.640]  wars and the congress has no authority over it you're in a dictatorship now
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.520]  obama the puppet may leave they'll put a new puppet financed with the very same
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:03.360]  banks in there his names meant romney now somebody that i can tell you that is
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:07.440]  not bought and paid for by the new world order somebody who's kept their
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:12.720]  promises is senator rand paul and of course ron paul and i said from the
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:18.560]  beginning when loser draw we win by ron paul running me first ran four years
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.440]  ago the first time maybe five percent of the population knew about the fellows
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:26.160]  are being private hijacking our country now it's over 90 percent we've had a
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:32.360]  victory period and ron paul staying in keeps him in the debates keeps him out
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:36.320]  there injecting real issues talking to crowds of eight to ten to twelve thousand
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:40.240]  people the one thing i didn't raise the ran because i ran out of time was the
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.440]  election fraud clearly in may in iowa but it the fact that they had to steal it
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:49.440]  early on to make him look like a loser to give it to romney shows how desperate
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:54.640]  the system is ron paul early on was the front runner he was the front runner in
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:59.880]  every actuary in pole so you saw it stolen but by getting in the arena we
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:05.920]  expose its rigged and we expose the new world order so it's happening and look
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.400]  at his son the whole system went after him it blew up in their face in kentucky
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.800]  first the republicans tried to block him in the primary then the democrats did
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:21.000]  bill clinton went and campaigned against him it only gave rand more
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.320]  credibility and he went out the polls and when there's a landslide they have
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:33.520]  trouble with a 15-point lead cheating somebody so the system is having to
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:38.240]  cheat more and more but it's exposing them here is this in-depth interview we
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:44.680]  we cover the waterfront we would he run with mit romney what's happening with
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:54.120]  the u.n. and enter pole the election his father the buffet rule we cover so many
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:58.920]  subjects best interview i've ever done with senator rand paul i've only done a
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:04.320]  few since he's been elected senator because he's so busy but here is senator
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:13.840]  rand paul premiering here at info wars dot com radio we are joined by u.s.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:19.120]  senator hailing from kentucky rand paul and the freshman senator as everyone
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:23.640]  has noticed has actually been fulfilling his campaign promises to try to cut
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.720]  government and restore our constitutional republic and he joins us from
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:32.160]  washington dc senator thank you for coming on with us
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:36.240]  glad to be with you alex there is so much to talk about but i noticed that
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:40.920]  you're trying to point out that enter pole is now operating inside our country
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.440]  with diplomatic immunity i'm kind of concerned about having an international
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.880]  police force in our country with the ability maybe to extradite u.s. citizens
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.080]  and send them to another country egypt as you know over the last couple of
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.480]  months has been holding some american pro-democracy workers in their country
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:04.320]  they were going to try them on trumped up political charges and so a couple of
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:08.280]  months ago i said you know what we send two billion dollars to a country that
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:11.840]  treats us this way and treats our citizens so i tried to hold up their
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.120]  foreign aid and as a consequence i think partly of what i was doing they
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:20.680]  released our american citizens then they came home and then secretary clinton
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.200]  went ahead and released their aid i wrote her a letter and said you know she
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:28.920]  shouldn't do it because these prosecutions were still ongoing right now
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:33.080]  in absentia they're prosecuting them without being there they also made the
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.200]  u.s. taxpayer pay a five million dollar ransom for these americans to come home
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.000]  promising they would come back to holt's to stand trial but then this week we've
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.640]  learned that egypt has asked interpole for international warrants they have
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.160]  these red-letter warrants that can be used anywhere in the world and most
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.360]  people say oh that could never happen in america we would never let that happen
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:01.480]  but interpole is doing this in other countries saudi arabia ask interpole to
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:06.560]  return a saudi journalist from malaysia who had said something about a
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:10.200]  muhammad that they found offensive and they were going to accuse him of blasphemy
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:15.040]  interpole picked him up in malaysia and took him back to saudi arabia he will
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:19.200]  now face the death penalty for blasphemy but the scary thing is he's being
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.080]  picked up by interpole and the scary thing is is what kind of authority does
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.880]  interpole have in the united states and president obama expanded their authority
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.000]  with an executive order in december giving them diplomatic immunity so all
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:40.360]  of this concerns me senator we also saw just last year the south african un
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.960]  summit and they called for a global un environmental crime tribunal where you
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.920]  will be arrested if you deny man-made global warming and that made headlines
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.520]  in europe but almost no news here so they're openly calling for this
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:59.880]  international power and four of our supreme court justices have said that
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.240]  we should get our rules from the un not the constitution so i think you're right
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:08.320]  to be very concerned about this but you know one of the interactions in the last
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:12.160]  couple weeks it was very very telling was the interaction between senator
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:17.120]  sessions and secretary panetta and a committee in which panetta said that if
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:22.560]  we go to war of course we'll consult with the un and get their approval and
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:27.400]  sessions asking me said well you know isn't there a role here under the
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:32.080]  constitution for congress and then it basically just kept going on about nato
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:35.960]  the un and then he finally sort of said well yeah we would probably inform
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:39.720]  congress of what we're doing but never in there was there any understanding that
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:44.120]  they had to get approval or permission from congress and of course you've
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.080]  spoken on the senate floor about that one of the few senators to actually be
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:53.080]  concerned about the constitution being brazenly violated and if anyone was
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.320]  confused by what the secretary defense said and tries to come out and say well
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.840]  he didn't really mean that we have the letter as you know last year or Obama
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:05.960]  responded to congress with the libya war and said i don't need your
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:10.840]  authorization i have the un and that brings me to my next question senator
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:16.280]  are you or others going to call for the house to begin impeachment
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:21.320]  investigations i know congressman jones has introduced legislation that of
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:26.040]  obama starts another war without congressional war power authorization that
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:31.360]  they will then trigger that but that's not moving very fast i mean this is this
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.520]  is extremely brazen like Caesar crossing the rubicon if you or your father who
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:41.200]  would get a lot more attention than congressman jones were to call for
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.320]  impeachment investigations at least to begin hearings on impeachment then i
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:49.640]  think that might get the executive to stop saying it follows the orders of the
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:55.720]  un senator i think the first step is to stop him in his tracks we tried very
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:00.760]  hard on the on the libya motion in fact what we did on the libya when he went to
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:05.600]  war with libyas we introduced his own words his words in two thousand seven
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:10.520]  when he ran for office said that no president should unilaterally go to war
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.320]  without congressional authority which basically just restates the constitution
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:18.760]  and good for him that's what he ran on that was part of his platform and then
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:23.000]  he went around and did exactly the opposite when he became president and
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.080]  this is not the first time but democrat or republican has changed their mind
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:31.160]  once they became president they sort of believed in limitations on the presidential
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:34.400]  power until they actually became the president and then they believe in
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.720]  unlimited powers but we will fight them to the nail we fought him we introduced
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:42.600]  his own words on the senate floor and asked people to vote for it but the
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:47.400]  disappointing thing was ten people in the u.s. senate believe in the
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:51.600]  constitution and believe that the congress should have to declare war
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:54.440]  before president goes to war we got only ten votes and they were all
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:59.600]  republicans not one democrat voted for the the words of their own president
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:05.440]  when he ran for office what did you make of the CIA director a month ago's and
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:09.800]  wired magazine if you caught it what did you make of him saying yeah we're
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:13.680]  watching you we're reading your emails we're building a giant nsa center and
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:18.920]  then congress said we want to see the details of that nsa center and Obama
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:23.360]  said you don't get to see it the since when does congress not get to get
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.000]  details of the new nsa center that they admit is to read all our emails and
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:32.200]  listen to our phone calls illegally senator well I say the one good news as
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:35.920]  far as big brother snooping on you is that there is some pushback you know
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:41.240]  the soap a battle the the battle over you know the internet and whether or not
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:44.560]  they could shut down different websites indiscriminately based on
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.120]  accusations without a day in court without you know any fourth amendment or
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:55.440]  jury trial protections you know we won that battle on one in a big way and so
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.120]  there is a pushback that was really the first battle since I've been up here
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:04.520]  that we actually won and we won in a clear fashion because the internet the
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:08.920]  grassroots community really defeated the establishment they were planning on
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.080]  passing that under unanimous consent which means they were just going to push
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.280]  it right through if I objected they were going to roll right over me and the
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:22.440]  internet woke up people a lot of people who listen and get their news you know
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:30.000]  from you and from info wars calm that the internet rose up and as a power did
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.280]  stop them in their tracks we're not winning all the battles but there's
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:36.560]  going to be another battle over cybersecurity bills coming up and we
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.920]  have to worry about the power that's being given to agencies like the nsa to
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:46.360]  snoop on personal information on the internet so we haven't we aren't done
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:50.200]  yet but I think it was encouraging when we beat the soap bill well it's good to
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.080]  know you're there because we've got on the other side senator Jay Rockefeller
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.920]  famously saying in committee we would have been better off never a inventing
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.160]  the internet I mean that's a wild statement the internet's the great
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.000]  equalizer you know because now people get their news and they look around for
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.320]  the news and I think it's a particularly young people now who are so cynical of
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:17.360]  all the politicians they see on TV and I think this is why my dad has become so
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:21.840]  popular is because they see him as a genuine voice someone who they can
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:26.440]  believe and trust in and that makes a big difference and the internet has been
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:33.440]  the fountain of all that and I think it will it really is leading to a movement
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:38.240]  out there that's neither Republican nor Democrat but really wants a different
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:42.840]  way certainly the establishment has to know they can't put the genie back in
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:47.280]  the bottle people have had a taste of real choice in news and information and
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:51.920]  ideas freedom is catching on thanks to you your father and tens of millions of
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.200]  supporters across the planet yep well that's what my father my father's
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:00.760]  favorite lines as he's out on the trail is that freedom is popular freedom brings
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:04.320]  people together and it's one of the amazing things you see when you go to
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:09.800]  his rallies you see people of all races all economic levels you see working
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:16.160]  class people you see Chamber of Commerce types but you see much more diverse
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.120]  crowd at the Ron Paul rallies and particularly the youth then you see it
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:24.840]  any Republican function and it's what the Republicans if they had half a clue
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:30.840]  would realize nationally is that Ron Paul is a phenomenon getting five to ten
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.640]  thousand people at speeches more than any other candidate and they need to
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.840]  realize that they need that momentum and they need that to win in the fall and
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:42.920]  I'm just hoping that they will do some outreach to him to try to get him to
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.280]  participate in their convention speaking of your father Congressman Ron Paul who
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:51.280]  has said that if he doesn't win the presidency he's gonna retire Texas of
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:56.600]  course is very sad about that but the idea continues on and undoubtedly we're
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:01.400]  winning the war even if he doesn't win the battle in educating hearts and minds
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:07.040]  about the true constitutional system but but what is at the heart of the
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:12.520]  delegate battle and the broker convention strategy can you tell us if Paul
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:16.160]  doesn't win the full nomination what what they're gonna call for and can you
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:21.880]  put to bed these rumors the latest one yesterday in the Seattle Times it's all
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:27.600]  over the news that you have Mitt Romney was to get the nomination that there's
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:32.560]  discussions of asking you to be vice president well I always tell people if
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:36.600]  there's a secret plan for that to happen it's so secret that nobody's let me on
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:43.240]  it yeah I kind of doubt that will happen I do tell people to be considered to be
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:47.680]  the vice president United States is obviously an honor I mean it is and I
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:51.840]  know some people may not like hearing that but the truth it is an honor to be
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:56.040]  considered and to know that you could have some influence in the direction of
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:00.400]  we know that the country goes but I don't probably see that happening and no
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.160]  one's asked me in particular specifically about it with regard to you
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:09.760]  know where my father goes what the delegate strategy is whether it could be a
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:13.600]  broker convention I think it's unlikely I think now that Santorum has dropped out
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.640]  unless something changes dramatically in the next couple of primaries in all
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.840]  likelihood Romney will collect the numbers necessary to get the nomination
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:28.720]  sometime in May or June the one of the things is that if you win five states
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:32.320]  you get to get your name placed in nomination and you get guaranteed a
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:37.560]  position at the at the convention and there's still some chance of that even
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:42.560]  though my dad didn't win five states a lot of the delegations are not decided
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:45.440]  until you go through the state convention they have county conventions and
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:53.040]  they work their way up and Ron Paul's done very well in Nevada, Missouri, Maine, Iowa
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:57.000]  and a couple of the other caucus states so there's an outside chance that he
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.440]  still wins five states but I think they'll I think that's one of the reasons
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.120]  that he'll go on probably giving speeches and traveling around and
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:09.200]  encouraging voters at least through the state conventions which are mostly over
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:13.680]  in June sure it's a victory just to be there injecting injecting real issues
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:16.920]  moving quickly through some questions in the five minutes we have left senator
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:24.520]  TSA they have now announced Congresswoman Jackson has announced here in Texas
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:30.160]  Sheila Jackson Lee that they have undercover homeland security outside of
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:35.320]  the Tent Amendment TSA now on the buses and the highways we've known this is
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.800]  coming but that's just as illegal as Obama taking orders from the UN
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:45.280]  there's got to be some end to this craziness Dave Mustaine was just here
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:49.600]  in town visiting me a few weeks ago you rock star for mega death and he
[02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:54.000]  complained to me that his 14 year old daughter got groped at the airport here
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.400]  in Austin there's got to be some you know into this can you call for hearings
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:02.600]  in the Senate I mean isn't it illegal from your constitutional research to have
[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:08.160]  the TSA now on the streets of Texas I can't call for hearings the majority
[02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:12.160]  party completely controls hearings I said can get hearings in the house and
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:16.320]  it's had some the interesting thing is is what happened you guys in Texas I
[02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:20.720]  thought you guys were gonna stand up to the federal government and then ban the
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:25.720]  TSA from doing that in Texas the feds threatened a air blockade military
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:30.480]  blockade and the unanimous house then fell to their knees and said here's our
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:34.640]  daughters and sons start groping but we're going to continue the fight up
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:39.280]  here and really becomes more complicated because this this ends up
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:44.280]  becoming not just about personal liberty it becomes about union power and the
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:48.560]  fact that the Democrats are big on creating new government unions because
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:52.240]  they're new voting blocks and new blocks of money that they can get you know
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:56.760]  forced union dues to support their campaigns so really the TSA is one of
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:01.040]  the biggest government unions now and so we've been fighting you know to
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:05.160]  privatize security many of us and would like to do that we will probably
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:09.600]  propose legislation coming up that will do that as well as some that will be
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:15.400]  less dramatic but would actually forbid them from doing pad towns we think the
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:20.880]  idea of random pad towns is ridiculous insulting and really making no one safe
[02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:29.000]  and you know I think that if you made searches based on evidence of suspicious
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:35.800]  behavior or something like that or basically had some kind of risk
[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:40.120]  assessment done then you wouldn't be doing this to elderly women babies
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:43.720]  children the rest the other thing that would make it a little better not
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:48.120]  perfect but it would be just to have a frequent flyer program of some sort and
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:52.000]  I don't want the government running it but if it were done privately and
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:56.280]  voluntarily I think you could develop some kind of frequent flyer program two
[02:52:56.280 --> 02:53:03.360]  final questions senator Paul number one everyone has been impressed even
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:07.840]  mainstream media has been impressed that that that you could run for office
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:12.240]  for the first time in your life and be catapulted into the US Senate and that
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:17.560]  you have kept your promises and done so well and had such a senatorial
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:22.920]  gentlemanly bearing and have learned the procedures and things I mean everyone
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:28.040]  I know across the political spectrum is saying Rand Paul you know if Ron Paul
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:33.800]  doesn't make it well Rand Paul is definitely presidential material for
[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:38.800]  the Republic I mean I know you don't like to toot your own horn but I mean are
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:42.760]  you starting to think more about running for president I think it's too early to
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:47.240]  tell and a lot of it you know depends on what happens with this election so you
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:51.040]  know we'll wait and see but I think also the voice within the Senate can be a
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:55.040]  pretty loud voice and I'm definitely going to do everything I can to use the
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:54:00.200]  position of the Senate to fight for constitutional limited government to
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:04.760]  really fight to fend off what I think is a coming calamity if we if we do not
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:09.440]  address this debt bomb that's coming at us we really are in for a bad way and it
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:12.760]  may be something that hits us before there is even another presidential
[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:17.680]  election so we're fighting day in day out to get people around here to wake up to
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:21.880]  the imminence of this problem I've been telling people for a year there's a day
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:25.440]  of reckoning coming and it's not something we're looking forward to it's
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:29.800]  either something where we destroy our currency and when you destroy a currency
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:34.760]  you at least a chaos in the streets and we don't want that to happen all of these
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:38.400]  problems are fixable though and we have a wonderful country with a wonderful
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:43.240]  heritage and there is an amazing potential locked up in our country that
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:46.920]  if it were unleashed and you allow people to freely interact and trade with
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:51.720]  each other that we would once again be a dominant force in the world if we would
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.360]  just really believe in ourselves and believe in our heritage I agree with
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:01.960]  you speaking of our heritage not having high taxes Buffett Warren Buffett the
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.160]  biggest recipient of the banker bailouts domestically that's that's
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:09.560]  McClatchy Associated Press it's a fact he says raised taxes on millionaires or
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:12.800]  people making a hundred and fifty thousand dollars individually or
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:17.720]  quarter million in a couple and well he's the guy that wants that money out
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:23.400]  of the next bailout on record I mean this is asinine give us a brief comment
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.280]  on that senator because I know you've got to go and then what you're gonna do
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:31.120]  on a balanced budget amendment I tell people I'm getting sick and tired of
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:34.600]  hearing about Buffett's secretary I think she makes more money than I do and I
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:38.840]  think her assets are probably greater than mine and so I'm not you know too
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:43.000]  concerned about Warren Buffett's secretary but I think the argument that
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.160]  if two people paid the same percentage in taxes you know if he pays 15% his
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:52.960]  secretary pays 15% let's say she makes two hundred thousand dollars a year and
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:58.520]  he makes 20 million a year or 200 million he pays a thousandfold more in
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:03.200]  taxes than she does so the thing is is you can have progressive taxation with a
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:08.320]  flat tax code so the idea that the rich are not paying their fair share in our
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:13.600]  country is a lie it is absolutely untrue we have the most progressive tax code
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.680]  maybe in the world our tax code is more progressive than Sweden's tax code so
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:23.080]  they need to just tell the truth on it but the bottom line is is I want the
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:27.200]  private sector the pie that is the private sector to be bigger and the pie
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:30.440]  that is the government sector to be smaller so I don't want anybody's taxes
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:34.320]  to go up and if you're richer than me and you've got three cars and I've got a
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.520]  moped I need to go out and work harder and I don't need to take it from you I
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:43.520]  need to encourage you to hire more people by allowing you to do better and so I
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.040]  don't really look at people who are wealthy business owners and say oh let
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:50.680]  me drag them down I look at them and let's say how can we get the government
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:56.400]  out of the way so this creative person man or woman can create more jobs so I
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:59.640]  look at it the opposite way and I think there's enough people left in America
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:04.520]  who like the idea of the American dream who like the idea of success and every
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:09.080]  generation there's somebody I meet people every day whose parents just finished
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:12.960]  high school and weren't very successful who are now successful in this
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:17.200]  generation it doesn't always happen but that has been the beauty of America that
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:22.120]  mobility and the interesting thing is 60% of the people born in the lowest
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:27.600]  rung the bottom 20% move up out of poverty 60% of millionaires the
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:31.360]  following year don't make a million dollars a year so people move up and
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:36.000]  down this social ladder all the time and that freedom to go up and down the
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.480]  ladders what really what America is about well the crony monopolist they
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:44.640]  know that when you raise taxes over time it destroys the pie and impoverishes
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:50.640]  they want to control undoubtedly it is so refreshing to talk to a senator who
[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:55.560]  does not compromise and it's just so real senator Rand Paul thank you so much
