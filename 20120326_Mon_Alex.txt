[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.240 --> 00:30.480]  well I hope everyone is strapped in because this is going to be another
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.000]  incredibly jam-packed global transmission against tyranny I'm Alex
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.960]  Jones your host it is the 26th day of March 2012 and we have Gerald Salente
[00:42.960 --> 00:49.600]  ripped off by Don John Corzine joining us now we have the clips of Corzine
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.440]  saying he didn't know where the money went as if it wasn't all on record as
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.320]  if as CEO he didn't give the order then we have Terrence Duffy the head of the
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.480]  Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME group first the CME group put out his
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.840]  prepared statement hours before he gave the speech months ago the testimony
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.240]  before Congress and then when he got up there he went off script and said that
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.200]  Corzine did know and gave the order now we have the spectacle now of all the
[01:18.200 --> 01:22.640]  emails via lawsuits being forced to be released and what does this tell us what
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.760]  we already knew the mainstream media and the federal regulators most of them
[01:26.760 --> 01:35.800]  former minions of Corzine knowingly are lying and the feds aren't going to do
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.200]  anything the media is in fact the media the corporate prostitutes are running
[01:40.200 --> 01:46.280]  defense right now for Corzine and if they get away with this stealing people's
[01:46.280 --> 01:51.480]  private accounts farmers ranchers mainly who have accounts to then trade in
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.120]  commodities on the Chicago Mercantile to try to hedge their bets not knowing
[01:56.120 --> 01:59.720]  if there's gonna be rain sun or what's coming up in the growing season the
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.040]  spring and summer I mean you know most farmers do that they're just keeping
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.880]  your money and that's the way they roll and you just see that the federal
[02:11.880 --> 02:17.000]  government is a pack of larcenist criminals at the top this country is
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.120]  full of good people it's full of good people even in government it's full of
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.480]  good people in the private sector but at the top the criminals have taken
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.760]  control and it's a very simple equation but sometimes simple things are hard to
[02:32.760 --> 02:39.880]  get when good people don't get into the positions in business and government and
[02:39.880 --> 02:45.720]  religion and everything and when good people don't fight to be in control of
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.120]  society and when good people don't stand up for their own private property
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.560]  their own family when you're not territorial the hyenas come in the
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.960]  jackals come in the wolves come in the weevils come in and they eat our lunch
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.720]  because evil people then fill all of those spaces and then the evil people
[03:05.720 --> 03:10.400]  something happens after that the old-fashioned evil that's just boss hog it
[03:10.400 --> 03:14.720]  gets supplanted once a good stands down by even more and more reckless evil
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.320]  vicious evil evil so dark it can't even be imagined by people that aren't given
[03:19.320 --> 03:23.720]  over to wickedness and so there's a competition within the power structure
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.840]  where the survival of the most wicked not survival the fittest but survival of
[03:28.840 --> 03:33.840]  the most cancerous the most malignant gets into the to the system and takes
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.360]  over and then you get a hyper tyranny and hyper tyranny's always grow like a
[03:38.360 --> 03:46.440]  tropism the same web the same structure they build pyramids and they chop hearts
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.720]  out and they eat children and you're like boy that sounds crazy have you read
[03:50.720 --> 03:56.560]  a history book every culture ends up building pyramids and throwing children
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.160]  to fiery pits chopping hearts out slitting throats raping virgins giant
[04:01.160 --> 04:08.080]  wars black uniforms smoke death murder destruction torture that's what
[04:08.080 --> 04:13.280]  psychopaths are into the most vicious type and they compete with each other
[04:13.280 --> 04:22.040]  and so that manifestation that signature transmission then manifest so that's the
[04:22.040 --> 04:27.640]  domino effect good people stand down evil comes in and takes over then evil
[04:27.640 --> 04:33.800]  competes with itself and the maximum evil is then purified the essence of evil
[04:33.800 --> 04:41.120]  the primordial prime evil is then manifest health gates are opened giant
[04:41.120 --> 04:47.280]  war famine destruction total loss of security then ensues and all the
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.320]  trappings of that evil wavelength is now a transmitting and we see it building
[04:53.320 --> 04:59.680]  like nanotech in front of us the giant armies the pyramids the secret arrest a
[04:59.680 --> 05:05.240]  little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.000]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.080]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[05:13.080 --> 05:16.600]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[05:16.600 --> 05:21.240]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[05:21.240 --> 05:25.760]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.560]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[06:07.280 --> 06:10.400]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[06:10.400 --> 06:14.320]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver

[07:04.280 --> 07:08.240]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[07:08.240 --> 07:11.640]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[07:11.640 --> 07:16.480]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.040]  name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[07:20.040 --> 07:24.280]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[07:24.280 --> 07:28.720]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices

[08:09.080 --> 08:12.080]  Alex Jones show
[08:23.880 --> 08:29.480]  we have a particularly important global transmission lined up for you today and
[08:29.480 --> 08:34.440]  yes every day is important but as we get deeper into this global crisis
[08:34.440 --> 08:41.320]  engineered by the monopoly men that run the world government each success of
[08:41.320 --> 08:46.920]  transmission will become more important than the last look at this massive stack
[08:46.920 --> 08:50.400]  of news I have here in front of me if you were a radio listener and aren't
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.160]  watching at prison planet TV I've got one two three four five six seven eight
[08:55.160 --> 09:05.960]  nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 stacks of news and each stack is completely insane
[09:05.960 --> 09:11.280]  let me just randomly pick this one and just mention what's in it climate funds
[09:11.280 --> 09:17.200]  seeks UN style diplomatic immunity this is the environmental takeover stack new
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.520]  East River bridges toll proposal goes after everyone including bicyclists and
[09:21.520 --> 09:25.720]  I mentioned yesterday that all over the world they're bringing pedestrian tolls
[09:25.720 --> 09:31.200]  in and I saw comments on info wars that I was a liar and I knew my memory was
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.600]  right so I simply searched the term and pulled up San Francisco Chronicle
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.480]  Associated Press and others where in San Francisco they do told you to walk
[09:41.480 --> 09:50.240]  across the bridges but again it's only six dollars what's wrong with that good
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.480]  news India bans its airlines from paying EU carbon tax and that'll make George
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.480]  Soros angry hose pipe hotlines to enforce drought restrictions as March
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.800]  heatwave continues all week England has record amounts of water they've never in
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.780]  most cities paid for water there because there's so much water in their
[10:08.780 --> 10:13.080]  aquifers and it's some of the best water but now they're teaching you that there
[10:13.080 --> 10:16.760]  isn't water and telling you that there's restrictions and telling everyone to
[10:16.760 --> 10:21.160]  tattle we'll be getting into that again not a tattle on folks for water not for
[10:21.160 --> 10:27.040]  10 years you can buy glowing monkeys cats and dogs in Hong Kong shops that are
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.280]  part jellyfish and are in extreme pain because they have stinging cells in
[10:32.280 --> 10:39.760]  their own flesh beyond Blade Runner but the environmentalists don't care about
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.200]  that no they want to lecture me for poking an ant pile in a video I shot and
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.720]  uploaded Sunday showing people how when you stir up ants they swarm illustrating
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.000]  that if I then just give them and grow poison they think it's food taken in and
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.760]  die that's what the globalists do with GMO to us versus a frontal assault they
[11:00.760 --> 11:10.440]  attack you but I am now an animal cruelty person for poking at ants that are
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.760]  invasive from Brazil and have spread all the way to Australia and kill most of the
[11:15.760 --> 11:22.160]  around for foraging birds like turkeys and quail being decimated by them they
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.560]  kill most the baby wild boar most of the baby deer so on record just the worst
[11:28.560 --> 11:37.640]  invasive species on earth on earth never able to get over the Andes but brought
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.880]  to the Houston Ship Channel on a shipment of wood what the 1940s I said
[11:41.880 --> 11:46.240]  the 50s that's incorrect but there's literally people who are serious on my
[11:46.240 --> 11:54.080]  YouTube channel saying arrest me for killing ants again that's how they
[11:54.080 --> 12:00.960]  protect the environment not worry about actual GMO that's destroying and wrecking
[12:00.960 --> 12:08.720]  the biospheres original genetic code genetic vandalism here is the San
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.960]  Francisco Chronicle article from 2005 it was put into place Bay Area $6 toll
[12:13.960 --> 12:19.360]  for Gate Bridge hikers bicyclists may also have to pay to crossover and they
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.720]  did put that into place there's been big fights over they're talking about
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.840]  removing it but I thought I'd mention here is Golden Gate Bridge a bicycle and
[12:27.840 --> 12:37.120]  walking toll but again I'm a liar that's your agenda 21 see this is what this is
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.960]  what strawmen attackers do to me every day as part of a concerted jealousy
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.320]  effort a lot of its jealousy and I'm sad that that's the case but a lot of it is
[12:46.320 --> 12:49.040]  government sock puppets it's actually come out that we're targeted by
[12:49.040 --> 12:52.440]  government propaganda and national media but also at grassroots that's the
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.080]  White House strategy and we're on the White House enemies list they come out
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.840]  and say oh look Alex is lying this article is about tolls on bicycles and
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.480]  what I said on last night's radio show Sunday night show four to six is I said
[13:08.480 --> 13:15.240]  in New York they're looking at toll roads for people on bicycles but I said in
[13:15.240 --> 13:21.320]  other areas of the world some areas the US England and in China they're they're
[13:21.320 --> 13:27.840]  moving towards tolls on pedestrians and I saw people attacking me last night
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.480]  saying I was a liar just just saw it without looking and saw it as a meme and
[13:31.480 --> 13:34.840]  so I thought well I know I've seen that over and over again but I double checked
[13:34.840 --> 13:41.200]  my knowledge and there it was China England US tolls on walking but see a
[13:41.200 --> 13:49.440]  strawman would say look that's not in the article it's it's bicycles don't lie
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.680]  to people and I'm like I didn't say that article was it was about bicycles in
[13:53.680 --> 13:59.280]  New York I was saying they're also going after people walking over bridges and see
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.840]  that's like a mental illness that jealous people do they'll say you're
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.600]  wrong about something just like it proves a point like like they won up you
[14:07.600 --> 14:11.640]  because they prove you wrong but they didn't really prove you wrong they
[14:11.640 --> 14:18.680]  misrepresented what you said and then tear that down and isn't about Alex
[14:18.680 --> 14:21.840]  Jones being right let me tell you something I can walk out on the stage
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.040]  and have people throw tomatoes at me and it doesn't get to me never happened
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.080]  but I've had things you know that are similar to that being attacked by studio
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.640]  audience that's told to attack me people making fun of me a group of yuppies on
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.040]  their motorcycles on South Congress stopping you know eight years ago and
[14:41.040 --> 14:44.200]  getting around me and laughing at me like it was getting to me and I just said
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.600]  if somebody's gonna do something go ahead I'm gonna stop your butt into the
[14:46.600 --> 14:51.240]  ground I mean it's not cuz I'm some great person or Mr. Tough guy either the
[14:51.240 --> 14:56.600]  point is is that I'm just a normal man who hidden back and down and in the past
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.680]  that was the way everybody was we've had it engineered and chemically taken out
[15:01.680 --> 15:07.800]  of us and it means nothing to me if I'm attacked peer pressure means nothing to
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.600]  me zero and that's the kind of attitude that built this country and people need
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.800]  to get that back that's why I attacked the trendies I don't care how you look
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.000]  or what you're into if you like a style I don't care what it is that's great
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.360]  whether it's gothic or golf shirt or cowboy whatever it is just actually
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.280]  stand for something at the end of the day as well not just whatever outfit you
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.240]  got from the clothing rack whatever genre you decided to go along with do
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.640]  you see what I'm saying because the essence of our enslavement is that
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.280]  people feel so empty and all they do is watch television hoping that if they
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.680]  get into certain niche or go with a certain look or a certain idea or if
[15:54.680 --> 15:59.080]  they repeat what they saw in the sitcoms they're gonna be popular because all
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.320]  these social engineering shows show you men acting like fools and acting super
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.720]  stupid and getting all the women and then men go out and do that all day and
[16:08.720 --> 16:13.360]  wonder why they're not getting women and in every role you're shown on
[16:13.360 --> 16:17.520]  television men are groveling to women and are idiots and let the women be the
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.680]  boss and they let that and then women see that and think that's what they want
[16:21.680 --> 16:25.200]  and then that's not what they want everything you're taught is how to
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.840]  socially destroy you and make you not be fulfilled because when you're
[16:29.840 --> 16:34.760]  fulfilled you begin to not even care about yourself see if they can freeze
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.280]  you and never let you get into the hierarchy of the hierarchy of needs and
[16:40.280 --> 16:45.080]  that pyramid of the hierarchy of needs is incredibly accurate and if they can
[16:45.080 --> 16:51.080]  keep you from it ever getting self-sufficient or truly being independent
[16:51.080 --> 16:55.640]  then they've got you because if they can arrest your development you will
[16:55.640 --> 16:58.760]  never develop into the higher levels where you realize you're not gonna live
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.920]  very long and that you love humanity and you're building a society and that you
[17:02.920 --> 17:09.640]  live forever through what you build and through those that you lift up and and
[17:09.640 --> 17:14.040]  through your genetic line and the elite don't want you thinking like they
[17:14.040 --> 17:18.920]  think they I mean I went to a Walmart last night since the only place you can
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.400]  buy film for a Polaroid camera here locally hadn't been in one in a while
[17:23.400 --> 17:29.960]  and I watched as I walked around my son the people and and I saw women who were
[17:29.960 --> 17:36.760]  attractive and I watched them they were so insecure moping around feeling
[17:36.760 --> 17:41.000]  totally horrible there was a salon at the front I saw a young woman come in it
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.800]  was closed and she looked totally freaked out and depressed I could tell she had
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.320]  some date coming up that evening and and and you know oh my gosh she she couldn't
[17:49.320 --> 17:54.400]  go in there and get that certification of beauty you know it's all these props
[17:54.400 --> 18:00.040]  people need and I watched the men all wearing skull shirts black white old
[18:00.040 --> 18:05.320]  young Hispanic all trying to act tough all trying to act tough around their
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.160]  wives and girlfriends and you can look in their eye they were so insecure they
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.600]  were so scared they had seen all these images and culture and video games and
[18:14.600 --> 18:20.720]  they didn't really feel powerful and they were like little children because I
[18:20.720 --> 18:27.280]  guess they well I know they watch television all day and they're not
[18:27.280 --> 18:33.440]  driving Lamborghinis they're not driving the latest Ferrari they don't have a
[18:33.440 --> 18:40.160]  high maintenance tin on their arm and they're worried about money and that's
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.920]  why the system creates fiat money that's controlled by private groups and
[18:44.920 --> 18:53.920]  then artificially deflates the value of it inflation so that you're so obsessed
[18:53.920 --> 19:00.640]  with that and so insecure that you don't have time to challenge the system I
[19:00.640 --> 19:04.720]  never thought I'd say it but I saw a Justin Timberlake movie this weekend in
[19:04.720 --> 19:11.560]  two treadmill sessions and it's called in time and I want to do a review of that
[19:11.560 --> 19:17.280]  because it's all about that how they artificially control the resources its
[19:17.280 --> 19:22.920]  feudalism so that there's a class structure and also get some of the elite
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.200]  living forever and they have to kill 90% of the public if they're going to be
[19:26.200 --> 19:31.760]  able to live forever obviously influenced by reality that's art imitating life but
[19:31.760 --> 19:37.400]  it's a good film I have to say that I thought Justin Timberlake was a pretty
[19:37.400 --> 19:43.080]  good actor as well but side issue the point is is that we live in an
[19:43.080 --> 19:47.760]  artificial environment it's not totally artificial but the globalist in DARPA and
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.840]  the scientific engineers are attempting in their own words to create a fully
[19:52.840 --> 19:58.000]  artificial habitat I'm here to get you to wake up to this and to tell average

[24:13.160 --> 24:26.560]  and that's what this Trayvon Martin thing is all about
[24:26.560 --> 24:41.280]  we're gonna be breaking that down
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.560]  and why the media has seized upon this now
[24:47.560 --> 25:00.800]  you know I look at the videos of these black panthers the new black panther
[25:00.800 --> 25:12.880]  party calling for the vigilante capture of mr. Zimmerman and they have the same
[25:12.880 --> 25:20.320]  clownish look as Ku Klux Klan rallies I've seen on video except they've got
[25:20.320 --> 25:25.240]  dark skin it's all part of the same divide and conquer and you notice the
[25:25.240 --> 25:28.560]  federal government and the state governments are not going after them if
[25:28.560 --> 25:36.000]  I got on air and said I've got a $10,000 reward I want 10,000 whatever color
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.080]  people to go grab somebody there would be police cars pulling up here within an
[25:41.080 --> 25:51.800]  hour guaranteed because that is an insurrection and a violation of due
[25:51.800 --> 26:00.800]  process so you have to ask yourself why is this going on why is this happening
[26:00.800 --> 26:06.880]  now I'm going to talk about that later that's one of the things in my stack
[26:06.880 --> 26:12.480]  black friend defense shooter of Florida team we're gonna be going over that I'm
[26:12.480 --> 26:15.360]  not defending any of it it sounds stupid following the guy down the street but
[26:15.360 --> 26:19.840]  there are witnesses that what you're not hearing in the media is he had a broken
[26:19.840 --> 26:27.720]  nose and that Trayvon Martin was seen by witnesses on top of him that was stupid
[26:27.720 --> 26:31.360]  as well so we don't really know what happened here and we're gonna be getting
[26:31.360 --> 26:36.000]  into that also China unveils a new legislation on police powers of
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.320]  detention modeled after the NDAA I've talked about this the last two weeks but
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.080]  it's back in the news but how do you criticize them when that's what our
[26:46.080 --> 26:49.280]  criminal government formerly landed the free home of the brave is doing also
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.960]  Cheney older waited longer than average for heart transplant that's how they're
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.440]  spinning it yeah because you're not supposed to get a heart transplant when
[26:58.440 --> 27:04.480]  you're above about 55 on average because they don't do well younger people in the
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.120]  bioethicist actuaries are supposed to get them but not in the case of Dick
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.480]  Cheney but I'll be honest I'm surprised he waited that long somebody like Steve
[27:14.480 --> 27:21.200]  Jobs didn't wait very long for liver and a lot of rich people just go to China or
[27:21.200 --> 27:25.040]  go to Japan they fly it just you know the couple hundred miles over the ocean
[27:25.040 --> 27:28.800]  they have mobile execution vans if you're a new listener I'm not joking each
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.080]  major city has two dozen mobile execution vans they kill you for petty
[27:33.080 --> 27:38.440]  crimes you name it and then they chop your organs out on the tarmac guys Google
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.080]  China mobile execution vans it'll show them it's like a London Guardian article
[27:42.080 --> 27:47.120]  pop up first choking a woman and then it shows the van and the and the and the
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.400]  butchering facility in the back of it the medical table and then they fly them
[27:52.400 --> 27:58.320]  while they're still warm generally right over the South China Sea there right
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.680]  into Japan right into those medical cities they've got there on the East
[28:04.680 --> 28:11.840]  Coast China's high-tech death van where criminals are executed and their organs
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.160]  are sold on black market yeah scroll down that's daily mail let's see oh
[28:16.160 --> 28:23.280]  there's a loving execution van oh just step right in here
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.040]  the execution van looks like a normal police van now there's another one shows
[28:28.040 --> 28:31.440]  them choking a woman and taking her in
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.720]  by the way they got our their cues now from the United States so that's got to
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.880]  make you feel proud you're an extremist though if you don't like it and I got a
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.200]  big police state stack that's what see this is a climate fraud global fascist
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.560]  takeover stack here I got a little bit of that then I have the police state

[29:08.960 --> 29:13.440]  98 yeah there were police investigations in 95 with rape kids and
[29:13.440 --> 29:19.760]  nothing was done that's NBC news I mean what a perv his house backed right up to
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.480]  a school where he'd watch the kids and he was so emboldened he was raping

[33:18.720 --> 33:23.080]  planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.600]  of time it has refinements technological advances and a more sophisticated
[33:28.600 --> 33:33.560]  approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the

[34:44.840 --> 34:53.320]  well today let me get into some news on the authoritarian angle first and then
[34:53.320 --> 34:58.800]  I'm going to get into Harvard scientists reverse the aging process in mice now
[34:58.800 --> 35:04.920]  for humans they've had this very type of technology for at least 20 years when I
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.840]  was first on air 17 years ago this was well-established in different
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.520]  scientific journals they're just now advertising it and it's already on the
[35:14.520 --> 35:22.440]  market for many elites but under bioethics you will not have access to it
[35:24.120 --> 35:30.640]  unless we take our society back but to do that you'll have to control your own
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.920]  destiny and control the type of news you're into and not just let them tell
[35:35.920 --> 35:44.040]  you what you're going to be watching like football again I get going over to
[35:44.040 --> 35:50.240]  a friend's house and grilling cheeseburgers or steaks and drinking beer

[35:56.560 --> 36:00.760]  dictatorship with thousands of public documents we've linked to some new ones
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.640]  today from the Rockefeller Foundation about putting sterilants and cancer
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.320]  viruses in the vaccines and then I've watched my family members and friends
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.600]  shrivel up dying from cancer and I watch young people getting cancer all over the
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.440]  place and the cancer numbers exploding you know I can't sit there and watch a
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.640]  football game anymore cannot do it occasionally I get roped into going to
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.880]  one parents invite me over for a barbecue I want my children to be around
[36:27.880 --> 36:33.880]  their parents other grandparents and so I'll go outside and shoot a YouTube
[36:33.880 --> 36:43.560]  video and upload it I will not watch it I will not I can't now occasionally I'll
[36:43.560 --> 36:47.720]  watch a comedy because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy something
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.200]  like horrible bosses or something was the last comedy I watched it is funny
[36:51.200 --> 36:58.320]  it's also not for children to watch Jennifer Aniston is very lovely and
[36:58.320 --> 37:05.720]  there's a brunette but the point is that I can't do it anymore and you can go man
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.320]  that guy's a weirdo he's obsessed with legislation you know so many times I'll
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.440]  be out to eat with business people prominent people that invite me out to
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.480]  dinner and even if they know about my show and invited me out because they
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.320]  have seen or heard the show they still say but it kind of weird being into this
[37:25.320 --> 37:30.240]  you know shouldn't you not be so obsessed with this I'm like how do I not be
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.920]  obsessed with knowing they're poisoning the food and water by design to
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.480]  sterilize me and to hurt my children and to hurt your children I mean I would
[37:40.480 --> 37:46.960]  have to be a lunatic to not be obsessed with this and people are like oh it
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.800]  isn't that bad Alex no it's that bad and then some okay don't you get it it's
[37:51.800 --> 37:57.400]  real don't you get it it's all hiding in plain view they think you're so stupid
[37:57.400 --> 38:03.080]  it was on record that two billion dollars right at two bill was transferred
[38:03.080 --> 38:09.960]  of private people's accounts to JP Morgan in London that came out in Forbes
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.720]  the Associated Press the day after it happened and it was just a minor foot
[38:15.720 --> 38:18.240]  note they've been transferred and then a few weeks later people couldn't get
[38:18.240 --> 38:21.640]  their money it was like oh we'll look into it I'm like look into it it's right
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.320]  here Corzine ordered it it's on record then Corzine goes up and says I don't
[38:26.320 --> 38:29.880]  nothing about it even though he was a CEO and the head of the CME group comes
[38:29.880 --> 38:33.200]  out it was the regulator the private regulator over it says no he ordered it
[38:33.200 --> 38:36.840]  I was in the phone calls you don't move two billion dollars without it being
[38:36.840 --> 38:42.320]  regulated and the federal regulators all in the three major groups all the
[38:42.320 --> 38:45.960]  Securities and Exchange Commission all of it were formally working under him at
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.320]  Goldman Sachs he was the head of Goldman Sachs and now it's been confirmed that
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.680]  JP Morgan said we don't care if it's your private customers money you'll give it
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.880]  to us it was Max Kaiser first reported that Kaiser who has the sources in
[38:58.880 --> 39:01.440]  Europe you know he used to work with George Soros his son not that he's
[39:01.440 --> 39:07.080]  involved in this he says the head of JP Morgan called him up and said you're
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.680]  dead Kaiser isn't just gonna say this he's over there under French libel laws
[39:12.680 --> 39:16.120]  where you basically have no First Amendment he's not gonna say that if
[39:16.120 --> 39:23.280]  he wasn't told that said you're dead if you don't transfer that money and the
[39:23.280 --> 39:29.280]  issue here is we've now gotten to the point in this country and this world
[39:29.280 --> 39:34.720]  where the entire corporate horror media knows it's a lie knows he I mean three
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.520]  months ago Terrence Duffy testified before Congress and said I'm not gonna
[39:38.520 --> 39:42.920]  lie he was there he ordered him to do it he's not gonna lie under oath for
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.760]  Corzine and the media still acts like that perjury wasn't committed now the
[39:46.760 --> 39:53.800]  emails and his orders are public and no one gets in trouble and here's the
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.160]  issue the banksters have stolen we haven't gotten a new number in two years
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.040]  were four years into the bank or bailout was really just signing us over to the
[40:01.040 --> 40:04.820]  banks shining on to their too big to fail that's how they can slave us
[40:04.820 --> 40:08.640]  signing us on to their derivatives they created as a ball and chain to tie to
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.880]  us media covers that up acts like they're the experts when they're the
[40:12.880 --> 40:25.320]  authors of this this is a type of information we're talking about and it
[40:25.320 --> 40:30.880]  makes my head spin and now he's caught in absolute
[40:30.880 --> 40:36.880]  replicate it's like walking out of the bank with your your handgun holstered
[40:36.880 --> 40:42.400]  with two bags in your hand with big money symbols on it loading it into the
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.200]  back of a van and the cops pull up and walk by with a cup of coffee and go hey
[40:46.200 --> 40:53.160]  what you doing oh I'm just loading some money up I got a mask on the cops say I
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.760]  don't see anything have a good day now if cops did that you'd know they were on
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.840]  the take of the bank robber and that's exactly all this is and the media tried
[41:03.840 --> 41:10.440]  to spend it well you shouldn't have been investing in the mercantile exchanges
[41:10.440 --> 41:16.160]  tried to con the public knowing most people aren't in commodities and futures
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.920]  trading you know to act like it was the stock market or something these were
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.680]  their accounts like when you go to a casino you go put a thousand dollars on
[41:24.680 --> 41:28.880]  the casino card you're gonna go use on slot machines or whatever that's your
[41:28.880 --> 41:35.120]  money on that card people put their money into the account to make bets and
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.560]  then their account is up or down and people like Gerald Salente had been
[41:39.560 --> 41:48.160]  trading in that account for 20 plus years and he was way up and he had taken
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.240]  delivery order delivery months before he'd want a bunch of money making good
[41:52.240 --> 41:57.680]  bets on gold and they said you know what you're not getting it Jack and they
[41:57.680 --> 42:03.240]  adjusted his statement even though he had the statements where he had over a
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.200]  hundred thousand dollars that's all he'll say the in-profit and they just said
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.480]  you're not getting to Jack now do do any of you feel safe when we've got
[42:13.480 --> 42:18.240]  reckless bankers I mean core sign like made-off made-off created the Nasdaq
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.880]  doesn't get much bigger than that what's bigger people like core sign their
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.720]  actual mega managers former head of Goldman Sachs above that is owners
[42:26.720 --> 42:34.920]  Rockefeller Rothschilds people like that the banks got 27 trillion two years
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.400]  into this we have we don't know new numbers since then of US taxpayer money
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.280]  that they leveraged out to infinity again there's more derivatives now and
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.600]  there was four years ago and they've got assigned on to those and do any of you
[42:48.600 --> 42:58.040]  feel safe do any of you feel good knowing that they could have easily just
[42:58.040 --> 43:02.520]  guaranteed at the CME group as they promised previously all of the
[43:02.520 --> 43:07.160]  commodities exchanges going on through the mercantile as they've done in the
[43:07.160 --> 43:12.000]  past this is happened before some things similar no this time they didn't and
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.720]  what does that tell you they know that they don't want to set a precedent that
[43:15.720 --> 43:21.440]  when all of this derivatives paper goes bad it's already bad but when when the
[43:21.440 --> 43:26.440]  dominoes start moving even quicker they do not want the precedent that they're
[43:26.440 --> 43:29.120]  going to pay you your money that's in these accounts but it's worse than that
[43:29.120 --> 43:33.240]  they're going to take your pension funds they've already done this in Europe
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.960]  they're going to take your private bank accounts they're going to take your 401
[43:38.960 --> 43:46.160]  K's they're going to take your commodity futures trading accounts your bank
[43:46.160 --> 43:52.560]  accounts that's what this is this is all the big test to see if they can do
[43:52.560 --> 43:59.480]  that and right now Corzine is just out in the open with hundreds of articles I
[43:59.480 --> 44:03.600]  typed his name in this morning it was actually thousands you put it into this
[44:03.600 --> 44:07.680]  Google NSA search engine click niche it was thousands you'll have the top five
[44:07.680 --> 44:10.600]  or six articles and it'll say the number under it that do that for folks type in
[44:10.600 --> 44:15.400]  John Corzine Google News and click it will I say hundreds see people accuse me
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.000]  of exaggerating no it's actually the opposite I tend to know it was in the
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.120]  thousands this morning when I looked at it and so I just say hundreds and I've
[44:24.120 --> 44:27.320]  got to stop doing that blow it up
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.560]  okay scroll up and it depends on the algorithm each time you search scroll
[44:32.560 --> 44:42.720]  down it says yeah it says 1,050 results in the last seven seconds or point seven
[44:42.720 --> 44:48.360]  go ahead and scroll down and of top news it's 69 and then you go back down it's
[44:48.360 --> 44:53.560]  357 you go back down yeah it's weird each time it's different like do it again
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.480]  and then it'll show you a totally different number point is it's thousands
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.120]  of articles there you go so get these idiot you know comments oh you didn't
[45:00.120 --> 45:06.480]  hundreds of articles you're right I lied to you I tend to hold back the fact of
[45:06.480 --> 45:13.080]  only way I am dishonest is that I don't go all the way it's not that I'm
[45:13.080 --> 45:16.520]  exaggerating it's the opposite of it as I keep trying to tell you my mind
[45:16.520 --> 45:21.440]  automatically gauges it back because it sounds ridiculous so I wasn't lying just
[45:21.440 --> 45:27.120]  now on purpose I'm trying to have total transparency here it's that my mind if I
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.720]  say I saw thousands of articles this morning people most people don't know
[45:30.720 --> 45:33.920]  how search engines work they're not going to believe that so I just showed
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.400]  people watching on prisonplanet.tv
[45:41.040 --> 45:46.400]  that in the last two days over a thousand articles this morning was like
[45:46.400 --> 45:49.960]  1600 and something's like that in fact show them again do the search again
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.760]  because it's weird the algorithm vary sometimes hour to hour in fact this
[45:55.760 --> 46:01.880]  morning when I did it says 1060 now here scroll down yeah I was 1600 something
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.720]  this morning scroll down and show them yeah there it is 1060 whatever the point
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.400]  is I'm trying to teach people and show people just how serious all this is
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.320]  because this is this is a major bellwether and that's why we're gonna
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.040]  spend a lot of time on it with Gerald Salenta he's only about 15 minutes away
[46:18.040 --> 46:21.960]  I got now I got to talk about this and dovetail it with this other article over
[46:21.960 --> 46:28.840]  here this is a police state news Obama's disbelief after staring into North Korea
[46:28.840 --> 46:33.880]  now here's a guy who went to school and was an open communist funded of course
[46:33.880 --> 46:38.880]  by the Rockefeller and Rothschild Foundation Ford Foundation all of it on
[46:38.880 --> 46:46.520]  record living with the weatherman bombers I mean this is our president but
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.560]  again that's just the bankers front of course they want all revolution to be
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.280]  communist because the big mega banks set offshore they want to destroy free
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.040]  market for the general public here's a guy shutting down our power plants here's
[46:58.040 --> 47:02.200]  a guy shutting down our pipelines here's a guy with taxes he knows putting us
[47:02.200 --> 47:06.000]  into a cardiac arrest and he goes and looks over the DMZ and I made the joke
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.280]  yesterday before these comments were out that he was coming home because there's
[47:09.280 --> 47:14.760]  only one place in the world up until just last week that allows the secret
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.280]  arrest and disappearance of people and that was North Korea now the United
[47:18.280 --> 47:23.640]  States has signed the law similar stuff that this still completely illegal you
[47:23.640 --> 47:26.400]  can sign a law saying you can rape kids on the White House lawn doesn't mean
[47:26.400 --> 47:30.320]  it's true I got a right to resist that that's illegal Hitler can pass laws all
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.320]  day you know doing bad things I say it's baloney there's a universal right to
[47:35.320 --> 47:41.440]  resist tyranny as the founders stated in his common sense shows but now China
[47:41.440 --> 47:44.880]  unveils new legislation on police powers they did pass it of detention
[47:44.880 --> 47:48.320]  experts warn that official draft legislation would have legalized
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.000]  disappearance allowing police to hold suspects without informing families
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.920]  legislation's passed through one group of Communist Party officials now it's
[47:56.920 --> 48:00.680]  going to the other group it's on a hundred percent done and it's a model and
[48:00.680 --> 48:04.200]  they're defending it off of the NDAA go read it for yourself one and guardian
[48:04.200 --> 48:14.520]  now that said Obama who demanded this power that is at North Korea level that
[48:14.520 --> 48:18.960]  China is now imitating we're now the example of evil that is the criminal
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.080]  bankers that have taken over our country and they're openly trying to break our
[48:22.080 --> 48:26.680]  will like lawyers to set this precedent I mean you know they got federal grants
[48:26.680 --> 48:29.800]  to take blood at checkpoints without warrants first they use fake rubber
[48:29.800 --> 48:35.320]  stamp general warrants that weren't real a kangaroo warrant now they just don't
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.240]  even have them now they've gotten medicalized police units to train the
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.720]  other police and forced inoculation I told you that years ago now they're
[48:42.720 --> 48:50.920]  announcing that you see how they're getting this ready if I walked up to a
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.280]  cop and punched him in the nose they would the average cop would savagely
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.120]  attack me right back but if I was the Rockefeller Foundation and I'm trying to
[48:59.120 --> 49:02.920]  force the cops to take shots and make them take the public filled with cancer
[49:02.920 --> 49:06.880]  viruses and sterile it's the cops do it because it's authority doing it to him
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.280]  see you're under attack we're all under attack none of us are on the winning
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.880]  globalist team even if you're a moral and think you're part of the system you're
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.080]  under attack and a lot of you won't listen but when you get diagnosed with
[49:19.080 --> 49:22.920]  cancer at 35 when your child dies of cancer and you finally go look at the
[49:22.920 --> 49:27.120]  statistics and and find that pediatric cancers over 10,000 percentage points up
[49:27.120 --> 49:31.600]  the last 50 years the average cancer is 2,000 percent for adults then you're
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.920]  gonna look I want to save you now I care about you and I want us to all come in
[49:35.920 --> 49:39.120]  together for the big one against the globalist I'm not risking my life for
[49:39.120 --> 49:42.920]  nothing I know we can win we can turn this back but we've got to admit the
[49:42.920 --> 49:49.560]  horror it's beyond what I can tell you words do not describe it I'm begging you
[49:49.560 --> 49:57.400]  look into what I'm saying look at this Obama it says after squinting through
[49:57.400 --> 50:00.920]  binoculars into the nation frozen in time US President Barack Obama reeled
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.360]  off a contempt laden startlingly frank indictment of North Korea well wait a
[50:06.360 --> 50:09.440]  minute he said he wants a post-industrial world more he's strong in the UN want
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.040]  that that's what carbon taxes are they want a North Korean existence for us
[50:13.040 --> 50:19.800]  that's actually their model while they live in high-tech palaces the Stalinist
[50:19.800 --> 50:24.280]  remnant of the Cold War was in Obama's eyes nothing but a nation which cannot
[50:24.280 --> 50:29.600]  make anything of any use doesn't work and even is vaunted weapon exports
[50:29.600 --> 50:34.960]  hardly state-of-the-art this is Obama it's like you're in a time warp Obama said
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.880]  Sunday after he turned a rocky border post in the demilitarized buffer zone that
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.800]  has split North Korean Peninsula for more time than he's been alive it is
[50:46.800 --> 50:50.200]  like you're looking across 50 years into a country that has missed 40 years or
[50:50.200 --> 50:53.520]  50 years of progress progress like your socialist health care that they're
[50:53.520 --> 50:57.920]  getting everybody ready for the for the conservative appointees to sign off on
[50:57.920 --> 51:01.560]  because the big banks are the ones that wrote the health care a little over a
[51:01.560 --> 51:05.880]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.360]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[51:09.360 --> 51:13.440]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[51:13.440 --> 51:16.880]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.560]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[51:21.560 --> 51:26.000]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.760]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[51:30.760 --> 51:34.720]  young Jevity the young Jevity products are designed to give you the real
[51:34.720 --> 51:38.800]  nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to

[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.720]  up later I think I'm gonna get Gerald's take on it also tungsten filled one
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:05.160]  kilo bars gold bars found in the UK it's confirmed and the reports are most the
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.720]  gold in the Federal Reserve's already been secretly taken out and as tungsten
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.360]  I have that from good high-level sources off record this is the second time it's
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:21.080]  been confirmed this is a big deal this is a big big big deal also I haven't got
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:29.640]  into the situation yet with George Zimmerman and the tragic shooting of
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.160]  Trayvon Martin looking big developments in that case and I'm gonna cover that
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.640]  a little bit would Gerald as well get his take on it how the system's race
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.760]  baiting and really trying to divide people so we're gonna be breaking that
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.600]  down as well also I mentioned some of this yesterday but there's been some
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.000]  big new developments on the front they're trying to give diplomatic immunity
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.480]  to all the globalist scammers with their global carbon tax plan developed by
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.800]  Ken Lay and Al Gore they're trying to now give their operations worldwide
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.280]  because UN groups are slaughtering people in Uganda and not just Africa areas of
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.160]  central and South America it's come out Honduras I mean actually shooting
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.520]  people and so they want diplomatic immunity for these new global stock
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:18.440]  market systems that'll be the new global tax so all of that is going on we'd
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.560]  already have Gerald up we're having a Skype issue is he ready
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.920]  we're getting close it's fine we'll just get to him in the next segment of not

[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:39.880]  scrambled for a skate pod as space junk threat gets serious look it'd be fun to
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.880]  attack Santorum who talks a good game about Christianity and anti-abortion but
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.160]  his voting records big government he started cussing in a reporter which I'm
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.160]  not saying it's good but it makes you think you might actually be a real
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.080]  person that he's not totally controlled but we may get to that a little bit
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.080]  later also China unveils new legislation on police powers of detention
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.160]  model after the NDAA police detain protesters in Moscow St. Petersburg AP
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.600]  decries it but our own government does that too I think Russia's wrong doing it
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.360]  but our government's doing it more and more Egypt's Islamist groups consolidate
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.200]  power mention that there it is financial times of London Egypt liberals quit
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.640]  Islamists led Constitution body dovetails with Tunisian Islamists set up
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:29.440]  demand for Islamic State media runs defense for course on after MF global
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.160]  revelation that's Paul Watson's article very very very important and we've got
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.920]  a consolidation of articles for the record Rockefeller soft kill the
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.280]  population plans exposed always mispronounce this great writers name
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:52.240]  but it's jury on may sin I want to get this person on the right force like five
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.520]  years in a great job four or five years as a guest sometime as it's doing great
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.480]  work but we need an article to that writer where you just get all the soft
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.440]  kill admissions of the UN putting sterilence in vaccines and all the
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.400]  different people calling for sterilence in the water and food and and prozac in
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.040]  the water and lithium in the water and all the admissions and the calls see I
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.200]  like overload articles where it's just it's not just some Rockefeller documents
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.200]  you know not gender 15 that's not enough I want there's what I've been asking
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.120]  Watson to do and it hurt I want articles where where you've got him say kill
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.040]  people anytime the government wants you Genesis even healthy people kill babies
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.600]  up to age three poison babies chemical lobotomies of the general public so
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.200]  we're not angry drugs so we won't be racist so lobotomized people so you
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.240]  can't think all of this I mean because because we do these articles people are
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.920]  blown away by them it's not hardcore enough just like I'm not hardcore enough
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.040]  people think we're being too hardcore it's the opposite we're not going far
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.080]  enough we're not giving you the full magnitude it's it's it's 50 times worse
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.280]  okay and it's gonna get a hundred times worse we don't fight back a little over

[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.400]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a

[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.960]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.960]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.200]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.480]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.840]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.480]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.400]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.120]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.560]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.200]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:00.400]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:08.760]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:27.680]  all right you remember back in October of last year we learned that several
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:33.320]  billion dollars of private sequestered accounts with people that were trading
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.920]  in future commodities in the Chicago mercantile exchange had disappeared and
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.480]  then we were told that hundreds of millions would not be paid back then
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.440]  we were told a billion then a billion three then a billion six and the media
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.120]  still plays games and says now it's only 200 million missing numbers I've got
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.640]  is it's more like 600 million they then went in and just altered people's
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640]  statements even though they had statements of their money that they had
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.800]  in their accounts you have to put money into trade and you also win money if
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.560]  you're successful that's how these markets work and Gerald Salente who'd
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:12.040]  been doing this for what was it close to 30 years you know an expert in it and
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.920]  it was his money it just disappeared and people that were ignorant spawned it and
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.320]  said no it was like the stock market and just went down no it's it's like you go
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.720]  to a casino and you they have cards now at casinos because I was shooting
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.760]  interviews with Jesse Ventura a few months ago and I had been to Vegas in
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.600]  years I was watching people you go put money on a card and that's what you use
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.840]  in the slot machines and buy drinks with and stuff it'd be the same thing if you
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.000]  like if you put a thousand dollars on your card that's your money and then you
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.440]  went to use it and they said no money on it that's a theft plain and simple
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:52.720]  okay now all of that took place and it came out in Reuters it came out in
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.320]  Forbes that a billion six was sent to London to J.P. Morgan Max Kaiser with
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.040]  his connections in London confirmed journalist Max Kaiser that indeed it
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.360]  went to J.P. Morgan it was known zero hedge reported it in full wars dot com
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.080]  reported it we all knew what happened this went on for months and then Gerald
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.880]  Salente on his over a hundred thousand that's all he'll say he gets a corrected
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.560]  statement his other statement said he had all this money now hey it's gone pal
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.600]  we corrected your statement now they could have easily just paid back this
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.480]  money the fellow reserve bail stuff out with our tax money all the time they
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.080]  didn't and the big question is why I'm gonna ask Gerald that here in a moment I
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.320]  think they're setting the precedent when they know when all the derivatives go
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.440]  completely belly up to just take everybody's bank accounts stock portfolio
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.920]  401ks it's already happening in Europe government says we're we're taking your
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.320]  401k to protect it but we're putting a 20% tax on it this year and you're lucky
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:57.160]  you're getting some of it and the next year they take another 20% that's what's
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:02.320]  happening we're being taught to be gang raped right now basically now here's Paul
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.640]  Watson's article media runs defense for core design after MF global revelation
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.480]  he lied and said he didn't know where it was when it's on record he's the CEO and
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.720]  ordered it then Terrence Duffy this all happened in December we're talking three
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.760]  four months ago now December 14th part of the testimony we're about to play and
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:24.240]  they go to Gerald I want to put this on record we have all of this going on the
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.040]  head of the CME to his credit even we'd attack team for making fun of Gerald
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.560]  Salente and others and say and these are conspiracy theorists you know the money's
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.560]  not missing well a few months later he had to come out and say no looks like
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.680]  they took it and by the way I'm not gonna lie for core sign and you know he was in
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.360]  the meetings and he gave the order so so that happened now the corporate
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:54.920]  prostitute media as Gerald has coined it properly then played along the last few
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.720]  months and said it was no big deal now he's been caught perjuring himself 100
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.560]  percent the memos are public the lawsuits have been filed it's all coming out all
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.960]  the major federal federal regulators formally worked for him when he was at
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.440]  Goldman Sachs the head of the commodities trading group all of it that's
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.280]  why he he hasn't gotten in trouble so if they get away with this the sky is the
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:24.000]  limit nobody's money is safe now I want to play a short clip of Congress where
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.280]  they're talking to members of MF global and they're saying we don't know where
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.240]  the money went and then they go to core sign who obviously is lying you know my
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.680]  son doesn't lie a lot but sometimes he does literally climb up and steal
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.280]  cookies that are meant to go in their lunch throughout the week and he he's
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.640]  snuck in and got cookies this week and he said I didn't get the cookies and I
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.240]  looked at him I said I know you're lying he goes I got the cookies I mean it's
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.280]  that obvious but this isn't cookies this is farmers and ranchers money mainly
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.760]  that's what they really stole here from the CME group only part of it was gold
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:00.520]  here is that clip in Congress December 14th almost well I guess it is more than
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:06.520]  four months ago here it is and we'll go ahead and fade that up let's stop right
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.280]  there because I'm not getting fed this audio let's go ahead and start to clip
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.440]  over again for everybody go ahead and play it where is the money from funds
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:24.680]  that were supposed to be kept separate customer money which is in campus CFO
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:34.200]  where's the money senator unfortunately I do not know where the money is well
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:14:01.600]  who does I never directed anyone at MF global to misuse customer funds let's
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.040]  go to Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Institute in fact right here
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.400]  I've got some of the latest trends journals here in my hot little hands
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.680]  Gerald great to have you here thank you for joining us what is your latest
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:20.120]  breakdown of what's happened as a victim of these hoodlums well it's another
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:25.000]  cover-up if this was you or me or anybody out there listening you know they
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.840]  have us on right to right Rikers Island by now like they did with that Dominique
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.120]  Strauss count con character from the former head of the World Bank when he
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:45.920]  was allegedly raped a hotel staff person the maid and Corzine just gets a free
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:52.200]  ride I mean let's go through this this is what November December January
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.760]  February what five months later and this guy still doesn't know what they did
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.280]  with the money and now of course it's all coming out and then again everyone
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.440]  that I spoke with I know people in the business everybody laughed at his
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:14.280]  testimony and when you read now what the memos are saying and and Paul Watson
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:19.080]  did a great job on it how the prostitutes are covering it up and say
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.280]  things like well you know there's no criminal charges here and they're all
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.320]  they're all running cover for him you read what's going on here the head of
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:35.880]  JP Morgan the division the chief risk officer he called Corzine to receive
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:42.120]  assurances about the source of the money the firm followed up with a draft
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.760]  letter from Mrs. O'Brien that was the person within the MF global that
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  transferred the money to sign a statement stating that all past present and
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:00.360]  future transactions complied with federal regulations according to the memo
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:06.520]  but Laurie Ferber the firm's general counsel hey I wonder if she was the same
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:13.360]  general counsel that that guy Louie free wants to give a bonus to staying with
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.620]  this and straightening it all out but anyway she may be another general
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:24.480]  counsel thought the letter was too broad she wanted to limit its scope to
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:31.760]  transfers made on October 28th the memo said to make a long story short they
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.400]  never signed the memo and to make a long story very short this thing is going
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.880]  back and forth and back and forth Corzine's demanding that the money be
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:47.880]  sent over there JP Morgan Chase knows it's a deal that they won't cover and
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.280]  they can't get a sign off on it and all of a sudden two hundred million dollars
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.720]  is gone on this one deal and now you know what they say here is where the
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.280]  prostitutes really suck up you know what they're saying it was attributed to
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:12.360]  sloppy bookkeeping sloppy bookkeeping how can they make this stuff up no it's
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:17.120]  all a cover-up and you said it this whole thing is crashing down that's why
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.320]  they had the National Defense Authorization Act that's why Obama signed
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:28.760]  that executive order a few weeks ago that's why Holder our esteemed attorney
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.200]  general just put through another law that allows the government now to watch
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:41.560]  every move we make everything we do without a warrant without a warrant
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:48.880]  every beat bit of our private lives are now government data and they could do
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.480]  what they want with it and you know why because they know the whole thing is
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.360]  collapsing and they know the natives are restless they're restless in Spain they
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.320]  restless in Greece they're restless in Romania they're restless in the UK and
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.840]  Portugal they're restless in Greece they're restless in Ireland and they're
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.000]  restless in the USA and this thing is collapsing and you said it the money's
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.600]  not there the Golden's not there and that guy Duffy that you mentioned the
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.880]  head of the CME group that was making fun of people like me calling us
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.280]  conspiracy theorists how come nobody's holding his feet to the fire how come
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.080]  nobody's replaying that videotape that I put out there over and over again with
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:36.680]  the 47,000 people in the media showing big mouth Duffy blowing out a lot of hot
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:42.160]  air about how the CME group this is the exchange where the commodities run
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.920]  through out in Chicago land he's saying they have a hundred billion dollars in
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.840]  collateral to back such kind of incidents as the one we later saw with
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:59.400]  MF global with a hundred billion dollars when they can't cover 1.6 billion the
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:04.840]  whole game is rigged it's a criminal operation from credit to full swaps
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:10.240]  luxury rate securities collateralized debt obligations synthetic collateralized
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.760]  debt obligations and how about it a few obligations well said and we do have that
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.120]  clip we also have Duffy and again he's obviously a scallywag as well but to
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.280]  his credit I'm blind hogs do find the Acorns broken clocks are iced are right
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:32.120]  twice a day he did come out and say that
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.280]  Corzine did give the order to transfer the money and and you know was the first
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.480]  to finally back off so so my point is he did attack you and the CME did attack
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.920]  you by name but now they've been forced to back off and and have admitted that
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.600]  you were right so I'm wondering where this goes also want to look at this
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:58.000]  tungsten steel being found inside gold bars for the second time now out of
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.920]  Switzerland this is big news stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know

[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.000]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.240]  performing even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.020]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put

[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:13.040]  because there's a war on for your mind all right here's one of those
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.680]  Terence Duffy clips there's a whole bunch of them where he's come out and said
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:26.800]  that no it was ordered by Corzine Corzine quote knew of as the CEO that they
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.600]  were ordering these sequestered accounts to be wired out of the country
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.080]  well now the memos are out it's confirmed he gave the order no kidding
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.440]  the former head of Goldman Sachs runs his own brokerage firm MF Global
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.920]  Rob's accounts and he didn't know and then the government for the last six
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.120]  months didn't know where the money went when they know when you are a thousand
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.480]  dollars I mean this is outrageous let's go to a short piece of that clip then
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.640]  back to Gerald Salente of trends research comm here it is CFTC and CME
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.960]  staff and auditors returned to the firm on Sunday October 30th and were informed
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.880]  by MF global employees that this discrepancy was caused by quote an
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.080]  accounting air our auditors worked with the CFTC devoted the rest of the day and
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.600]  night Sunday to find the so-called accounting air no such air was ever
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:22.720]  found instead at about 2 a.m. Monday morning October 31st MF global informed
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.440]  both the CFTC and CME at approximately the same time that the shortfall was real
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.040]  and that customer segregated funds have been transferred out of segregation to
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.880]  the firm's broker dealer accounts after receiving this information CME remained
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.720]  at MF global why MF global attempt attempted to identify funds that could
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:50.120]  be transferred into segregation to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy a CME
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:55.120]  auditor also participated in a phone call with senior MF global employees
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:01.200]  wherein one employee indicated that Mr. Corzine knew about the loans that had
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:07.160]  made for the customer segregated from the customer segregated accounts CME group
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:14.040]  has provided this information into these individuals to the Department of
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.800]  Justice and the CFTC who are investigating these matters all right
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:24.960]  there you go that's just part of the clip Gerald this is hiding in plain view
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:31.680]  why isn't he in jail right now because he's a member of the white shoe boys
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:40.500]  club that's why you know the word justice JUST US just us have you seen a
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:46.800]  head roll from the Goldman Sachs gang they get fine five hundred and fifty
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.880]  million dollars and they don't have to admit nor deny that they screwed
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:59.840]  anybody have you seen anybody's head roll from countrywide oh you remember
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.160]  that one that phony mortgage company over there that was raping us in front
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:13.520]  of everybody in the White House and in Congress have you seen one head roll
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:21.320]  from any of these major banks that committed the greatest financial fraud
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:29.760]  in the history of the universe hey if you live in Wisconsin I just read that
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:37.000]  if you make home brewed beer you have to keep it in your house and you can't
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.800]  bring it to a friend's house to drink because it's against the law and those
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.680]  little kids out there selling lemonade get them off the street first it's
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:55.400]  lemonade and then it's heroin I know it's a it's a heroin lemonade yeah it's
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:05.720]  all connected Alex it's fascism 2.0 the merger of state and corporate powers
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:14.280]  what is it going to take people to see what's going on our new trends journal
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.760]  is coming out the cover of the trends journal be out in a few weeks is going
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:31.240]  to read next train to Auschwitz all aboard no need to worry about those
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.080]  calories kiss them goodbye
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.160]  incredible Gerald we're gonna go to break the long segments coming up I want
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.240]  to get into a host of issues but when you speak about fascism I've looked at
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:51.880]  the numbers about countless economists on trends forecasters like yourself it's
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.640]  clear there's no way to get out of this unless the banksters all go to jail
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.920]  unless we write off all their fraudulent derivatives instead they're clearly
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.720]  establishing a high-tech police state to use the crisis to take over our lives
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.120]  we're going into a hot tyranny this is not just going to be good old boy
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:22.680]  corruption no you're right it's happened again how many laws have to be passed
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.160]  before people realize there's no Constitution left and that's why the
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:34.040]  trends journals gonna be next train to Auschwitz well it seems that there's
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:39.640]  nothing that these banksters can't or won't do and I want to discuss solutions
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.600]  to this and how you think we'll get out of it I also want to bring up some news

[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.960]  Bernays who advised the Department of War and then Department of Defense the
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:45.560]  nephew of Sigmund Freud probably more important even then Sigmund Freud they
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:50.440]  all write books that I've read and quoted here on air you can go read this
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:58.200]  about habitualization habitualization it's just like cigarettes they say it's
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.720]  not even so much the nicotine that's part of it it's that you doing some of
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.240]  them with your hands wanting to smoke the cigarette getting you in the habit
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.480]  they get you in the habit of the TSA sticking their hands down your pants
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.760]  people say I used to hate it but now I'm just used to it well now they're getting
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.640]  you used to taking your bank account and all over the country from San Francisco
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:27.720]  to New York they're announcing tolls to ride bicycles and to walk they're
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.160]  announcing all over the country that the police want to inspect gardens because
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:38.560]  you might be growing drugs all over the country they're setting up federally
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.200]  mandated checkpoints they're totally illegal not just Fourth Amendment but
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.560]  Second Amendment what are the feds doing that for it's not their jurisdiction so
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:53.120]  the system is racing to habitualize us or condition us or acclimatize use whatever
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:59.680]  word you want to get us accustomed to this I went to Walmart last night
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:10.480]  because I had been one in years and they had film for a Polaroid style camera so
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.200]  my grandmother can take pictures she doesn't want to run computerized you
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.640]  know cameras and all the other there's a few little shops I guess they weren't
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.360]  carrying it so I went in there and almost all the checkouts are now self-serve
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:29.400]  and I noticed it took them longer than even longer lines with a human so again
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:37.440]  it's all about control and this system is racing into place and we as a society
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.400]  are in deep trouble going back to Gerald Salenta of TrendsResearch.com who
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:47.880]  was robbed by MF Global we see them racing we see Communist China saying
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.040]  we can now secretly arrest and disappear people because America does it so so now
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.200]  the Communist Chinese leadership that perches on top of the hard-working smart
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.760]  Chinese people as parasites they're now using America as their pretext to fully
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.960]  do things they wouldn't have dared do before I mean I don't think people
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:14.400]  realize as you're saying just how evil and what an abomination our country's
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.560]  become Gerald. Again it's in front of everybody but the
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.320]  prostitutes don't report it they barely reported on the NDAA that was signed on
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:32.760]  New Year's Eve they barely reported on Obama's signing that last executive
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:39.120]  order that also what does it allow him to take over with a potential threat
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.120]  potential a potential threat they could take over corporations farms and
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.480]  slave us I mean I read it on Prison Planet you have it all outlined there a
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:57.800]  potential when's potential well potential is potentially forever they didn't
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:04.480]  write they wrote some little column about the latest one that a big bro out
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:11.880]  there Eric Holder in our relationship to big brother that he just signed off on
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.840]  that now they could collect all the information they want about any of us
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:24.640]  Google emails telephone conversations and you don't even have to be a threat
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:33.080]  they're doing this all under the guise of the war on terror no no it's not the
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:39.880]  war on terror it's that they're terrorized they may be incompetent they
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:46.680]  may act like psychopaths and are arrogant but and they may appear stupid
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:54.200]  but they're not stupid enough not to be able to read the graffiti on the wall
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:01.640]  and it's very clear and you know my saying when people lose everything and
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:07.960]  have nothing left to lose they lose it and they're putting these things these
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:15.360]  draconian measures and this police state in place because they know there's
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:26.160]  going to be a lot of mass protests very large protests throughout Europe
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:33.200]  throughout the United States throughout Russia the systems are collapsing and
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.600]  they're putting everything in place to clamp down on the people and I keep
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:48.000]  asking the question what is it going to take before the people realize that
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.040]  those great red white and blue coaches are nothing more than an express train
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:04.760]  to Auschwitz well said what do you make of open announcements that they're
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:09.920]  going to taxi to walk down the street again they're going to keep clamping
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:19.040]  down on us at every level they can until you truly have all wells 1984 come
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:27.480]  alive in 2012 and you said it Alex they they make it okay to feel you up at the
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:33.680]  airport they make it okay to stop you and that's what happens to the pros the
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:39.560]  pros will be fine with paying a little bit here or there being that big brother
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:45.760]  is watching over them and taking care of them or well would be shocked if he saw
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:51.080]  what was happening far greater than he could have ever imagined the control
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:58.320]  freaks are in control the systems are breaking down and how how could any
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:06.480]  dignified person how can any person with that much self-respect look up to a
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:15.760]  Santorum to a Romney to an Obama we're months away from the 2012 election and
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:24.200]  imbeciles people with the Cajones the size of moths are going to go to the
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:32.680]  ballot box and say I voted for a lesser of two evils how about you voted for the
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:39.040]  greater of two cons so that's what we're looking at the people are signing
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:46.640]  their own death warrant when they go to vote for the two criminal parties let
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.280]  me raise this point you know I'm a big supporter of Ron Paul he's 76 years old
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.320]  running a really hard campaign on the ground but even Paul's admitted in the
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.080]  New York Times has admitted that there's been election fraud they stole the
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:12.760]  early states from him and I know that legislation was introduced to begin the
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.920]  impeachment process against Obama if he launches more wars without congressional
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.200]  approval what about the last one in Libya well how about we go directly to
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.840]  impeachment Ron Paul that'd be a great campaign move as well how about said a
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.160]  Ron Paul other special get to him fighting with the other little
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.440]  Republican Twits how about Ron Paul starts impeachment against Obama how
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:41.040]  about that it's not gonna go anywhere I mean well you know it's like having
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.720]  somebody in the third right you know screaming and yelling you know Hitler's
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:50.120]  not doing it right I mean it's been fascism it's taken over you post them on
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:56.000]  your website all the time how many is it going to take to end up before people
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.880]  can see it well I think the only way I see this ending is to end these two
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:10.240]  criminal operations call the Republicans and the Democrats my campaign for 2012 I
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:16.720]  want to see a voter's strike if the only choice we have is Romney or Ron Paul
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:24.480]  from these two major parties and I believe that if less 40% or less of us
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.400]  go out to vote we could call this an illegitimate election because it's
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:37.920]  really clear folks we don't want any of you two jerks you barely got 25% of the
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.560]  vote or 30% of the vote whoever the winner is we need to change the system
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:50.480]  the systems corrupt from top to bottom Nancy Pelosi's were $200 million yet
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:56.600]  didn't she got that because he's so smart how much is it going to take people
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.480]  before they understand that every aspect of their life is being destroyed being
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:12.000]  destroyed by a gang of 535 that's what Congress is that is taking over for them
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:22.520]  a bunch of megalomaniacs psychopaths sociopaths arrogant stupid people making
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:28.600]  decisions for them that are going to affect the rest of their lives when
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.480]  are they going to stand up and understand that Washington is not a world
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:42.600]  away no no no no read Big Bro Holders latest proclamation they're in your
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:49.680]  email they're in your bedroom they're on Google they're listening to you on the
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:57.320]  telephone how much more is it going to take well I agree with you Gerald it is
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:03.880]  so over the top that it is completely illegal to listen to some without a
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.400]  warrant and they have the CIA director out saying hey we listen to everything
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.920]  and we're getting companies to put little tracker chips and listening
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.320]  devices in all your devices we're listening to you over the phone the
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.600]  computer Google for now at least six years admits they're watching and
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:24.600]  listening to people over the built-in microphones and cameras it's totally
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:31.840]  illegal and it's in our face now it's just off the charts it is so
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.600]  overwhelming what they're doing it's no longer illegal those are words they made
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:46.080]  it legal the Constitution no longer exists in the latest declarations by the
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.920]  Attorney General and El Presidente Losestados who need us they can do
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:58.400]  anything they want they've granted themselves full power and he again
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:05.200]  potential threats mean that they exist forever so again when I look at what's
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:12.760]  going on Alex I'm a writer I could in my wildest dreams I could not have come up
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:18.480]  with a more lame script than the presidential reality show it's off the
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:24.040]  charts it's like a Kurt Vonnegut dark satire of the most ridiculous system but
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.920]  we have parallels we have this big power grab they're openly stealing bank
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.920]  accounts but then we still have a lot of basic freedoms people are starting to
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:37.320]  wake up so my point is Gerald we have to call it for what it is and I think the
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:43.280]  heart of it is the prostitutes will not report on it and make it a big issue and
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:48.360]  they use distractions like the Trayvon Martin situation which is tragic and I
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:52.040]  don't think that the wannabe cops should have followed him you know down the
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:57.440]  street a bit but now black friend defense shooter of Florida teen says is
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.400]  that he's known him for years in fact it's a black anchorman there locally
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.040]  that's friends with George Zimmerman witnesses have told police that this has
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.120]  been in their day one that Trayvon Martin was on top of Mr. Zimmerman and
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.760]  had quote well now we know his nose was broken my point is why are they making
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:23.040]  such a big giant deal out of this why is the Justice Department coming out and
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.160]  saying that they may charge him with hate crimes and and now the black panther
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:35.760]  party the new black panther party is saying vigilante arresting my point is
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.280]  when a cop shoots a black guy in handcuffs and then lies about it you
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.640]  don't see Obama come out and talk about it because that scene is the system but
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.680]  when they can try to play black off against white they do it because the
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.680]  system the prostitutes want us fighting with each other instead of knowing it's
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:59.000]  the big offshore megabanks your take on all that oh you're 100% right I agree
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.600]  with you and and let's bring it to another level is there racism of course
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.120]  there is is there are there are there ethnic slurs about different nationalities
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.920]  and groups hey you put on put on an equivalent of you know what was that
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.240]  show a sopranos yeah do that with a black and Hispanic or a juice see how far
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.960]  you get is that kind of thing going on short as do I like it as Italian no but
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.640]  let's not call America a racist country because let's make this really clear the
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.560]  people in this country elected a black president if you can't have more proof
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:43.200]  than that you know let's call it a day here is this guy maybe they was a hate
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  crime here maybe but this is not this is not an overtly racist country not when
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.240]  you have a black man sitting in the United States and the attorney generals
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.960]  black give me a break well let's remember this whenever there's black on
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:06.160]  white crime the media will not cover it but take the lacrosse team turned out
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.360]  that was all made up they had to drop the charges same people Jesse Jackson
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.720]  Al Sharpton in there implying that white guys are a bunch of devils folks I'm
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.400]  white and I'm here to tell you I'm not thinking hateful things about people I
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.640]  want everybody to do well I want to live in peace and I'm sick of the
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.920]  prostitutes because they're the ones trying to stir this up they're the same
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.480]  prostitutes that said attack Iraq they're the same ones that told you
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.760]  Corzine's a nice guy if the prostitutes are stirring up this Trayvon Martin
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.840]  thing and and why are black people on average getting so mad just when the
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:47.680]  media tells you to get mad again it's a manipulation what's the same
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.080]  manipulation we hate Muslims in this country you know so of course it's a
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:58.640]  manipulation it's a big brother they want us why do you think they're pulling
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.760]  this right now because there's lots because they want to get our minds off
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.600]  the major issues as I said look at the presidential reality show look at these
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:13.000]  three characters a Romney a Santor and Obama you know Larry Moe and Curly
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.280]  coming come on you couldn't make this one up there's Obama in the papers I see
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:23.840]  the other day and he's in North Korea and it says Barack Obama commander in
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.800]  chief and he has these field glasses looking over at the DMZ between South
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:36.880]  Korea and North Korea I mean come on what commander in chief does you see
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.280]  where he said oh communism's terrible it's like it's frozen in time well he's
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.720]  bringing in fascism where they communalize our wealth and then steal it
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.120]  to these megabanks exactly look we haven't had a commander in chief in this
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:55.920]  country since the white the eyes and how I mean George little Georgie Bush
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.440]  playing commander in chief any of these guys that want to call themselves
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:08.080]  commanders in chief get on the white horse and lead the charge or shut your
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.800]  mouth like they're doing to this guy bells this poor guy you know I don't
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.240]  know what happened over there in Afghanistan but if we're gonna have a
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:25.000]  murder trial let's start with Bush and Cheney and all those congress people that
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.840]  voted for the war and sent them over there you want to have a murder trial
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:36.280]  let's have a war trial court war crimes tried butyl for the people that are
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.800]  prosecuting this war I agree you want to invade Uganda to get the imaginary

[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:11.800]  still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the

[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.320]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:21.880]  like an angel talk like an angel but I got one you're the devil we've got
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:27.040]  Webster Griffin hardly joining us at 15 after next hour for 45 minutes to cover
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.800]  a host of important issues but when we start the next hour we'll do that short
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:36.120]  segment and then one part of the next taking your phone calls for Gerald
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.760]  Salente Mike James Mojo Carol and Shane we'll have time to take five calls your
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:45.920]  quick questions for Gerald Salente but I wanted to raise the point here that
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:51.800]  analyzing this historically the elite have a plan to control us but they
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.960]  don't have a plan the kleptocrats to control themselves because none of the
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.280]  crooks can tattle on the other one because they've all got dirt on each
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.600]  other now the stealing is out in the open what I'm saying when I'm getting
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:07.360]  from high-level sources is for five years there's been a snatching and a
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.000]  grabbing that they're just looting things now and planning to leave the
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.080]  country but they're going to leave us behind with a police state that they
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:19.640]  think is going to do a rear guard action from anybody ever going after them
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:23.400]  and that's why they're getting away with all this craziness but Ruger in just a
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.800]  few months sold over a million guns they've got there a million plus
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:32.040]  back order right now all the other gun manufacturers I go to gun stores now and
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:38.920]  half their shelves are bare the ammo is gone the American people are buying
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.600]  around five million guns a month now everyone I talked to knows the
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.960]  government's criminal and has a line in the sand you try to put me in a work
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:50.840]  brigade you try to forcibly inoculate me you come on my property people are
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.760]  getting to the point the system thinks they're wimps they're actually just very
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.680]  sad and desperate I don't think the bureaucracy Gerald realizes that they're
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:03.600]  going to stick their arm in a bear trap and that this country is on the edge
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.440]  because if you've got 200 million gun owners 1% fights back that's 2 million
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.600]  combatants and the government's gearing up for war but all the drones all the
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:17.880]  fancy equipment is not gonna stop people I mean if you got 2 million people to
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.680]  fight back all they got to do is go find one bureaucrat one globalist it's game
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.640]  over yeah and I'm not again I don't want it to go there but I'm telling the
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:33.400]  globalist don't start a fight you can't back up Gerald Tolente well Alex
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:40.520]  that's all they ever do is start fights that they keep losing these are
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:47.920]  psychopaths was Vietnam a nice one that they started for fake reasons oh let's
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:54.200]  go back to Korea I forgot that one how about that lovely Iraq war you remember
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:58.680]  that one because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:04.400]  Afghanistan hey Alexander the great couldn't win the British got their
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:11.680]  behind kit well Russians got thrown out their empire collapse but George W. Bush
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.360]  and Dick Cheney and the rest of the little creeps out there they were gonna
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:21.880]  start another winner how about the beauty Obama started over there in Libya
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:28.400]  that's now a civil war oh did you read today the United States is sending help
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:35.440]  to the Syrian rebels oh non-lethal what rebels who are they what I'm saying Alex
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:42.560]  you have people that are deranged they don't look at the consequences so yes
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.960]  they're gonna start this and yes they believe they can enslave us all and by
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:54.440]  the way I want to make this official announcement regardless of who wins in
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:58:05.720]  November I Gerald Salenty demand the cabinet position of secretary of trends
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:13.960]  and consequences so that we can look at what you're doing and how it's going to
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:21.840]  end up because they never do that no nine out of ten reactors most of them
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.800]  40 years old are now leaking and their answer is because the radiation eats
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.640]  holes and everything just raise the level and say it's safe just like 20
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:36.680]  years ago they wouldn't let troops use DU now they do I mean it's true the elite

[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:20.240]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:28.080]  Alex Jones again throughout history elites think they're in control they
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.800]  don't get challenged when they commit a bunch of crimes they go hog wild crazy
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:36.160]  and we're now entering that level where Corzine openly burgers himself feels
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.040]  money and doesn't get in trouble and the corporate war media goes along with it
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:45.880]  Mike in California you're on the air with Gerald Solente go ahead thank you
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:51.040]  Gerald thank you for your furthering your voice I have two quick questions one
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:58.920]  with the possibility of a unconstitutionally declared war and Iran
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:02.880]  perhaps it seems like now would be a key point for the American people to
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:11.040]  demand the impeachment of a president that would declare a next war without
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:17.160]  the vote of Congress and how about they declare the corporate whore media cover
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.600]  the fact that an impeachment proceedings were gone what's the second question second
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:29.280]  question for Gerald was how would a voter protest work okay Gerald well again you
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.960]  know the impeachment proceedings have as Alex said already begun but the media
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.320]  is not covering them I personally don't think they'll go anywhere not in enough
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.560]  time for the election how would it it would be a strike we call a voter's
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:50.160]  strike we're not going out as self-respecting people with dignity
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:57.840]  and courage and integrity to cast our ballot for a lesser of two evils we
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:03.440]  want to rerun we want to start this process all over again we don't like
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:08.320]  the creeps that you so it's a no-confidence it's saying none of the
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.520]  above you like going to dealership they got two junkie cars you don't want
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:18.760]  either one stay home stay home a voter's strike that we should not even
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:26.280]  waste our time to buy into their criminal system as you pointed out Alex the
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:31.520]  game is rigged anyway the voter frauds everywhere we know who could so you're
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.200]  saying it's time to really declare that in most national level it is a come
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:39.960]  fraud quit playing along with it and instead of just not voting people are
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:44.800]  already doing a voter strike for decades let people know and go out that the the
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:49.160]  week of the election and everybody protest not even against just saying
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.640]  if there's no election there's election fraud it's all a scam I think that's a
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.920]  good idea I'm gonna get behind you on that let's let's develop a plan on that
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.760]  James and Texas let's call their bluff James in Texas you're on the air go
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:08.000]  ahead hello Alex Gerald I'm a fan of both your work Alex I've listened to your
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.640]  show for ten years when I was in college and you really inspire me thank I've got
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:21.480]  quite a strange story involving Goldman Sachs and Freemason and a tie-in I know
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.320]  you're from Dallas I'm from the family that owned the Times Herald and Carol D
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:32.680]  back in the day that's below right but below bottom all their assets yeah
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:41.200]  closed down you know print and all that and Carol D is now WFAA but anyway when
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:45.240]  all that happened when the buyout occurred and all that my family became
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.600]  very wealthy they already were but it kind of quadrupled their will and the
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:56.200]  bulk of that wealth was managed at Goldman Sachs well about three years ago
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:02.920]  my aunt who was the current standing matriarch of my family came down with
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:11.600]  Alzheimer's and it took its toll pretty quickly and once this once Goldman Sachs
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:18.400]  got wind of this nine million dollars mysteriously disappeared out of her
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:25.040]  net worth well she had Alzheimer's so she wasn't really all there to do
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:30.440]  anything about it or even think about it really and so I had a cousin who had her
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:34.600]  power of attorney and was the executor of her estate and he started
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.880]  investigating this you know what you know what sir I like to if this is true
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.480]  I'd like to have you as a guest sometime we're almost out of time but let me talk
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:46.560]  to you during the break but we'll come back and get Gerald's take on what's
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.320]  going on I mean it sounds like part of the course I know so many people they're
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.120]  in the stock market who have money in accounts or stocks and they just rob
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.120]  their clients I mean you've got the Goldman Sachs guy going public saying
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.160]  they do that to their customers when you're out on the road the last place
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.880]  you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you

[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:12.600]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.960]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:20.680]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:25.280]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be

[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.200]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:15.160]  are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:19.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:27.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.600]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:11.640]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind okay we just joined us Gerald
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:16.520]  Salentes with us for about seven eight minutes takes more calls here and we were
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:22.520]  just taking call from a gentleman who was saying that Goldman Sachs took money
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:25.560]  away from his grandmother they were managing I don't know about that case
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:30.840]  Gerald but what do you think of the report of one of their presidents one
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:34.400]  of their top guys quitting as you know two weeks ago and saying that they have
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.000]  distaste for their customers that they're there to rip them off they call
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.560]  them muppets I mean this is this is really another bird's-eye view into the
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:46.160]  mindset we're dealing with Gerald no we've been saying this you know since it
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.600]  began you've heard me say if the names on Wall Street were named Salente Caruso
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.920]  Mondavi Buccini Rossini they call it the mafia but you're not allowed to call the
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:01.960]  financiers crooks or criminals I'd like to read you something from the
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.800]  Financial Times quote is mr. Corzine testified before Congress he asked that
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:13.040]  the overdrafts with JPMorgan be corrected said Stephen Goldberg a spokesman for
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:19.000]  mr. Corzine quote he never directed miss O'Brien or anyone else regarding which
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.160]  accounts should be used to cure the overdrafts and he never directed the
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:29.640]  customer that customer funds should be used for that purpose now that's
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:37.960]  legalese crap Goldberg let's make this really straight they're in a crisis
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:44.600]  situation they need two hundred million dollars really fast and they don't have

[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:13.480]  crap they're 200 million dollars short they know where they were getting the
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:18.960]  money this is a lot of baloney and they get away with it and you know why they
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.240]  get away with it I'll tell you why they get away with it because they're all
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:29.960]  better than we are they go to Harvard they go to Princeton don't you know who

[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:53.720]  in it because they don't want you in it because then they got to cut the piece
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:57.320]  of the pie up more how could a bunch of crap
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:04.520]  spilling out a Goldberg's fat mouth make it into the media 200 million dollars
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:10.080]  they can't find the money where did it come from where the hell you think it
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:16.640]  came from get 200 million dollars we're going on I don't care how you get it
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:22.080]  that's the real story well expanding on that we played the clip of new listeners
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:27.320]  just joined us on XM or however they're listening that parents Debbie the head of
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:31.000]  the CME saw the money come up missing had a meeting on the phone with the
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.360]  executives and they said mr. Corzine ordered it and authorized segregated
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.720]  accounts that's been on record for almost four months we know he earlier
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.720]  Corzine said he never even knew money was transferred period he's been caught
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:50.400]  perjuring himself and now the corporate whore media is trying to dance around
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:55.640]  this so their readers don't know that they're just as complicit as Corzine in
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:01.320]  all of this criminality and what these idiots don't get is it nobody's safe if
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  he doesn't get punished if they're allowed to start stealing this nakedly
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:11.000]  nobody's money and nobody's property safe confidence is going to be lost why
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.400]  would they risk the system like this at this point then you got me fired up now
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.440]  Gerald why would they do that because they know more of its coming and they're
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.600]  testing things right now you got it this thing is collapsing in front of
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.880]  everybody look what's going on over there in Europe with that with that
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:34.200]  droggie oh the excuse me maybe he's the honorable droggie he's the head of the

[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:47.080]  and what did he do he just dumped in 1.3 trillion euros for the banks to borrow
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:52.120]  at very low like 1% interest rates actually could make money on it by
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.920]  putting it back in the bank they make another 25% when they hold it to buy out
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.960]  these crappy bonds oh and by the way they don't have to pay back the money in
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:06.000]  three years oh and where's droggie from son of a gun wasn't he the vice
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.640]  chairman of Goldman Sachs the European division the federal regulators are all

[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:02.240]  whole system collapsing all they did was paper over it temporarily they gave

[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.560]  withdrawal I called him up the day before told him what time I was coming and
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.920]  I and then we called him back I couldn't make we gave him another time I went
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:19.080]  there they wanted me to speak to the manager I sat down and the manager said
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:23.720]  to me mr. Salenci this is a sizeable withdrawal what are you gonna do with the
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.200]  money and I said none of your business and she's that's no way to start a
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.520]  conversation I said how about none of your damn business and it went on from

[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.680]  bank right around the corner over here twice they don't want you to take the
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:46.720]  money out of the bank because they're using it just like John the slime
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:53.400]  cause I used it to cover their bed beds incredible listen Carl Carl Carl wasn't

[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.720]  what's happening and trying to get all these callers them before he's got to go
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:01.420]  we got a minute and a half left we're coming back with the one the only
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:06.120]  Webster Tarpley with key info tarpley.net Shane in Illinois last caller go
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:13.400]  ahead how's it going guys first time caller Tom make quick here mr. Gerald
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:20.600]  Fuente do you think or what if this whole core sign MF global scandal is just
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:24.280]  the Trojan horse from then to see if they can get away with it and start
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:28.560]  taking other people's accounts that's Alex that's what Alex is saying that's
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:33.800]  what I agree that's what I'm trying to say you don't own your money unless you
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:41.040]  have it end of story that is the way I look at it and that's the way and this
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:47.240]  MF global thing I believe is Alex does it's just testing the grounds to see how
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:52.440]  much they could get away with and how much they could steal from you that's
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:56.720]  it call or anything else I was watching the clip earlier and looked like
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:00.520]  co-design I caught feeling from our candy store when he was like five who's

[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:24.440]  again it's as old as the Bible the only time the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:31.640]  becomes violent is when he drives the money changes out of the temple so as I
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:37.600]  say if the Prince of Peace could become violent I could become angry for John the
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:45.160]  slime co-zine and his mouthpiece little Goldberg trying to cover for him as they
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:51.000]  steal my money and if people don't like it and they don't want to speak up and

[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:35.160]  on air with us here and there's so much that I want to discuss with him today in
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.560]  the time we have so much that's happening in the media and in our world but
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:43.880]  Webster doesn't even know what I'm going to ask him here up front but I want his
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:48.520]  take on this before we get into Libya Uganda Syria what's happening
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.000]  domestically what do you make of the Trayvon James thing because that's the
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.520]  biggest story in the country right now and turns out that mr. Zimmerman has
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:01.080]  these black friends coming out defending him turns out witnesses told
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:07.440]  police has never released in the report that that James that that Trayvon
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:13.920]  Martin was on top of him punching him in the face I'm not taking sides in this
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.840]  but it looks like one of these manufactured diversions and it looks
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.920]  like Obama because you were the first to talk about this four years ago you've
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.560]  written three books on it but I know in one of them you talk about Odinga when
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:33.480]  he didn't win the election in Kenya and all of this was going on that he told
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:38.520]  and the letters public he told Odinga to cause riots and interstripe between
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:45.360]  Christian blacks and Muslim blacks as a way to try to force his way into some type
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.160]  of government position they created a prime ministership for him my gut tells
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:54.520]  me this is like a beta test so they can use the Trayvon Martin situation with
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:58.720]  the George Zimmerman situation as a way to beta test some type of race war
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:04.200]  limited outbreak so that Obama has an excuse to declare an emergency do you
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:10.320]  think that's in left field well let me say first of all Alex I think that in
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:16.880]  general in terms of the big issues the movement of people who are protesting
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.600]  right even even people that one doesn't need to agree with right from the Jesse
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.640]  Jackson to the Al Sharptons whatever they are they are right that there is a lot
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.680]  of institutionalized racism in police departments that there's a double
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:36.120]  standard that black suspects are treated differently I would also go on to say
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.560]  that this stand your ground law in Florida seems to me to be a legal
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:44.960]  monstrosity that makes absolutely no sense seems to be designed to produce
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:50.000]  more violent crime rather than less seems to have had that effect but then
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.360]  when we get down to the level of the individual fact in this
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:27:00.680]  case I think it's much less clear and I have also seen a local television
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:06.200]  report of someone who says that he's an eyewitness if that's true that there
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:12.360]  was a an altercation between these two people and indeed that that Trayvon was
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:21.600]  supposedly punching Zimmerman so I I think that simply is is not clear cut
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.520]  at this point so I really can't can't comment on on who's right and who's
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:34.040]  wrong in that immediate sense the the idea that Zimmerman goes from being I
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:40.120]  think a Hispanic which is what he is to being just white is also a somewhat
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:47.760]  strange leap but certainly the the media handling of this there's absolutely no
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:53.120]  doubt this is the kind of incident that the media were waiting for so that they
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.760]  could begin to foment a kind of artificial racial tension looking forward to
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  the Obama re-election campaign and in concerning the opportunism in that sense
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:09.960]  there's no doubt on the other hand again the complicating factor is that people
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.800]  who were making a big issue out of this are actually pointing to something real
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:21.680]  the double standard the racism the the the the monstrosity of these standard
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:26.440]  ground laws but at the same time they're doing it for the wrong reason I know
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:31.520]  but they're doing it as for a partisan political cause so all in all that is
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:39.200]  somewhat murky kind of situation not not clear cut and I also I have no I am
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:43.560]  not going to choose one side or the other in this because I think exactly but
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.400]  but but with the Trayvon Martin situation with the George Zimmerman
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:52.120]  situation it's got all the markers of the media trying to play the American
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.160]  people off against each other and then when you've got real cases of you know
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:59.320]  police shooting a black guy on the back who's in handcuffs and lying about it
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  then when people protest oh the media says it's bad but when they can just say
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:10.280]  it's a white guy it reminds me of that whole across college team you know with
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.680]  the black stripper and all that it turned out that was made up there's this
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:20.240]  real desire to get racial tension going overall why do you think that's going
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.760]  on Webster well again the reason the media do this is because of the me of
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:31.160]  the the at least a large part of these television characters are devoted to
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.280]  getting Obama reelected and they've devoted to serving him in any way I'd
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.760]  stay there when we come back I want to ask you why Obama's putting executive
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:43.560]  orders in to take over the economy secretly arrest citizens all the new
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:48.200]  wars where are they going what's their big strategy Webster Tarpley of Tarpley

[02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:31.560]  where's your crowd I wanted to ask Tarbley who has been all over the
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:37.920]  world very brave he never talks about it but he's somewhat of a madman he has
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:41.240]  been in Libya under bombardment he's gone to Syria to the areas where people
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:46.440]  are being killed by snipers he has been into central Africa during during
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:52.600]  massacres that are going on he really is an amazing person because I have
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:34:00.520]  courage the courage of my convictions but I'm kind of lazy when it comes to
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:04.560]  you know giant airports with people with leprosy and cigarette smoke
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:11.240]  billowing everywhere and mosquitoes and malaria and it's not even fear I don't
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:15.720]  want to be around it it's what you do what I'm saying it's it's more of a form
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:21.480]  of laziness than I know we've got one reporter that wants to go to Syria to
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:25.880]  cover stuff over there and I'm just like man I mean just by extension I don't
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:30.280]  want to be around it Tarbley has a lot of courage and I want to get his report
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:36.480]  from his latest travels on that because Tarbley you got proven right about
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:42.760]  al-Qaeda blowing up police stations they call it protesting when al-Qaeda my
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:45.480]  headpiece unplugged you know this this headpiece for me so it keeps coming out
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:48.760]  of the plug it like got smaller or something just pops out all the time
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:57.400]  Tarbley certainly got proven right on that front and we have we have now
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:03.560]  al-Qaeda killing people being called protesting I'm not saying Assad's a good
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.640]  guy either but I mean compared to al-Qaeda same thing with Muammar
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:10.720]  Qaddafi and now they admit what Tarbley told us eight nine months ago when he
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:14.200]  was there he said they're lining blacks up and killing him first time I ever
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:17.760]  heard that when they were in the east now it's admitted but the media is like
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.080]  well that's kind of liberal show show I digress I want to get into Obama's
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.680]  power grab where he's going but first let's get into your travels let's get
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:29.760]  into Corzine I want to pick your brain on a host of issues about where the
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:34.320]  Anglo-American establishment is right now since we've covered the diversion of
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:40.440]  the whole you know Trayvon Martin race war they're trying to get cooking you
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:45.520]  been in Africa the county 2012 all of it what is going on right now actually
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.200]  Alex if I might just some of the things you were just mentioning I'm gonna be
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:55.960]  at the International Spy Museum in Washington DC on a week from today next
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:02.440]  Monday April 3rd I think it is April 2nd anyway it's next Monday and David
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.920]  from remember him he was a speechwriter in the in the Bush White House he coined
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:12.000]  the term axis of evil for that state of the Union and then Jonathan Kaye that I
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.480]  think you talked to right he's got you in his book right among the truth eras
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:21.120]  so I'm gonna be debating them about 9-11 conspiracy theories black ops and
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.680]  more 630 at the at the spy museum a week from today yeah problems attack me
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:31.080]  many times he's a chief neocon and the other guy wanted me to be in this book
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:38.040]  I refuse to but I still think I haven't read anyway is that the guy out of
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:42.440]  Canada yes right there because I have people show me the passage he implies
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:48.520]  we had an interview and I was never interviewed by well we'll try to straighten
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:54.280]  that out a week from today anyway I think I think a good place to start is
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:37:00.360]  is what's going on with with Obama we can see his intentions maybe most clearly
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.400]  from what he's doing in Seoul South Korea right we have this world nuclear
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:09.240]  summit right a lot of countries are are there and we have this very interesting
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:14.640]  inadvertent or maybe it burdened I don't know but we have this sort of a leak
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:20.400]  where Obama is talking to Medvedev who is still the president of Russia for a
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:27.400]  few more weeks until until Putin takes over Obama says to Medvedev you got to
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:31.320]  give me a little more time right like the song give me a little more time
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:37.320]  because I'll have more flexibility after my reelection and what he's talking
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:42.120]  about is anti ballistic missile defense right the fact that the US is putting
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:49.960]  these SM3 interceptors and also Aegis cruisers in places along you can say
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:54.840]  the western edge of Russia I suppose we could say in the in the black sea in the
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:38:01.640]  in the Baltic and the in the Atlantic and these are interpreted by Russia and I
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.760]  think correctly as part of a threatened first strike by the United States against
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:12.600]  Russia in some situation of of term that way you can nuke Russia with the nuclear
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.840]  subs and ICBMs and when Russia tries to launch a retaliatory strike when the
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:22.760]  missiles are incoming the anti missile system shoots those down so it's a
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:27.600]  sneak attack grid yes and of course you have to look at what is he trying to do
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.880]  this is the last the last hurrah for Medvedev at least as president at least
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:39.600]  now and hopefully for for permanently Medvedev has been an absolute disaster
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:45.360]  Medvedev is a weakling he's an appeaser he did that hamburger diplomacy with
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:51.600]  with Obama that was idiotic he went to Silicon Valley and and formed on on jobs
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:57.120]  and gates and these people he's got all kinds of problems right he's got a
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:01.380]  long list but now he's on his way out so you can see what Obama is trying to do
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:09.800]  is to get the last use that they can out of this weakling Medvedev try to
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:14.840]  delay the Russian countermeasures in the words over the Russians say fine if you
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:19.320]  put in this system that's directed against us then we're going to install
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:26.520]  these extender short-range ballistic missiles in the area around Kalinian
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.720]  grad now you take a look at that that's the old East Prussia it's separated from
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:36.240]  the main body of the Russian Federation by the Baltic States right Latvia
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:40.160]  Lithuania Stony which are now independent countries and indeed NATO
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.280]  members but the Russians still have this exclave right it's like an island of
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.480]  Russia that sits much further west in territory that used to be used to be
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:55.120]  Germany right so it's East Prussia so Medvedev says Putin is said and the
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:58.920]  Russians have said if you insist on having an anti ballistic missile system
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:04.360]  then we're gonna put in these really fast strike weapons right that could hit
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.080]  you know NATO bases in Germany within two or three minutes so we'll we'll
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.000]  balance you that way so what Obama is obviously doing is saying don't do that
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.600]  let me get reelected I'm your friend give me a little more time I need some
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:23.680]  space and indeed it looks like Medvedev says for whatever it's worth yes but
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:28.400]  that's Obama's standard deal I don't worry they're not gonna pass into EA and
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:32.920]  I don't want the secret arrest provision turns out he demands it has it put in
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:37.240]  but then says don't worry I won't sign it then does sign it then says I won't
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:42.040]  use the power now he says he will I mean it's just total deception right and
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.880]  that's that's of course Obama's stock in trade is whereas with Bush we had this
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:52.600]  blunt in-your-face brute reactionary imperialist aggressor warmonger
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:58.560]  with Obama we have deception dissembling treachery they have in the back all the
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:05.160]  stuff but now what does this have to do with that executive order the the
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:10.600]  conversation between Medvedev and Obama it seems to me makes sense in this kind
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:17.400]  of a framework the US and NATO really have to push forward the
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.560]  destabilization of Syria in particular as much as they can and that once you
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.440]  do that once you get involved in some kind of conflict with Syria then you're
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:31.440]  likely to be embroiled in a conflict with Iran and Hezbollah and and others
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:36.600]  at the same time this is at least the the the logic of a possible plan maybe
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:43.680]  not the plan but a plan and if you get to a confrontation suppose the US is
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:49.360]  we're going to attack Iran and Russia says don't do it Iran of course you
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:53.600]  look at the map right it's very close to the southern edge of what used to be the
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:59.200]  Soviet Union you have the Caspian Sea if you had a pro-nato militant
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:05.560]  government in Iran this would be the gateway to destabilize of the trans
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.800]  Caucasus lots of parts of Russia the Central Asian states would with the
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.160]  drift further away from Russia it would be it really is they could send in all
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:18.360]  the loving al-Qaeda forces I want to shift gears away from Russia I know you're
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:22.400]  focused on that right now because it's the heart of all this general encirclement
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:26.640]  but what about Syria where they say al-Qaeda blowing up bases in police
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.520]  departments is the new protestant they're actually calling it loving
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:35.640]  protesting at a police fire back it's called outrageous well it looks to me
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:39.200]  like these these are the tactics of desperation now thanks to the fact that
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.120]  mid-date if it's been pushed into the background because that is what has made
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:47.440]  it possible the ascendancy of Putin and the fact that the Russians have vetoed
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.880]  these these attack resolutions and they've taken the Chinese with them on
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:57.440]  that that is that is that is now allowed the Syrian army to go into these
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:02.800]  neighborhoods really these parts of cities which had been the only strongholds
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.960]  of these rebels that I call them death squad because that's really what they
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:13.240]  are it's NATO death squads that have come in from abroad plus the the deserters
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.040]  and draft resistors and others that they've they've gathered around them
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:21.040]  plus fanatics from the muslim brotherhood and and al-Qaeda and so forth
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:26.120]  but those have been pretty much methodically quelled that would be
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:31.800]  harms that would be idlib in the north that would be dera in the south there's
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.840]  another town over by the Iraqi border that has been quelled they're all along
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.480]  the borders because that's where NATO has been able to to ship in their their
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:45.840]  fighters and their and their supplies and so forth so right now the the actual
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:50.400]  rebellion rebellion they the activity of the death squads and their fellow
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.720]  travelers has reached the low ebb and the response to that of course by these
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:59.120]  desperadoes the rebels if we can call them that is to say well we're gonna go
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:03.560]  to Damascus now we're gonna take the war to Damascus and carry out terrorism in
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:08.600]  Damascus and the people doing this indeed are in many cases al-Qaeda veterans
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.840]  some of them are al-Qaeda veterans that fought under bell hodge in Libya last
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:20.240]  summer and they've then been shipped over to Turkey and then into Syria that's
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.280]  where they're now operating so what we've always said that al-Qaeda is the CIA
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:30.800]  Arab Legion al-Qaeda is the infantry of NATO when they attack these countries
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.760]  and then it's also used to take our liberties but what do you make of the
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.320]  admissions now that Google is in essay run with the former head of DARPA running
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:45.360]  it and that they did indeed do the Arab Spring why do they want to put Muslim
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:50.880]  extremists in charge of all these countries I think the goal is to weaken
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:57.400]  them the idea being that such stability as the middle of Middle East has had as
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:03.760]  has come through governments that you could generally say are some form of
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:08.080]  Arab socialism I mean that's the common denominator of these places they all go
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:12.920]  back to President Nasser of Egypt and and a lot of them have strayed very far
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.520]  from what he represented but if you look at if you look at Gaddafi and Libya
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.560]  Assad in Syria Mubarak in Egypt whatever else they were they claimed to be
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:28.000]  nationalist military now again a lot of them you know completely struck out
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.280]  right Mubarak especially in his last 20 or 25 years was was was not really
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:38.240]  doing anything but again better than a civil war right then that's really the
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:42.000]  choice right because you look at Assad you can say well there are problems with
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.800]  Assad but if the choice becomes Assad or civil war Assad or chaos it's clear the
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:52.360]  choice has to be a thought but not for the Syrian National Council a bunch of
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:57.880]  foreign activists who were paid by NATO intelligence services and not for the
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.080]  Syrian the Free Syrian Army right which is this the State Department's real
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.120]  stated goal is to destabilize put extremists in put burqas on the women's
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.960]  heads slaughter the Christians and Jews that's what the forces have said they're
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:17.520]  gonna do in Syria that's them saying it and then I'm anti-American because I
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:22.000]  don't want to put al-Qaeda in I mean how do they sell this give your rights up
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.240]  al-Qaeda is gonna hit you but then al-Qaeda are freedom fighters well of
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:30.560]  course the contradiction it couldn't be more gaping and couldn't be the
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:35.040]  hypocrisy the double standard couldn't be more obvious on the one hand you know
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:40.400]  al-Qaeda is a kid if you're in Pakistan or was iris down or someplace if you have
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.280]  al-Qaeda passing by the door they can come and bomb you and destroy your house
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:50.400]  too in the process but somehow in in Libya it's a different brand of al-Qaeda I
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:55.040]  guess and that they become freedom fighters this is simply the bankruptcy
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:00.280]  of the of the foreign policy that we've had for the past 10 or 12 years but now
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:04.920]  they've twisted it and turned it so many times that it's I think becoming
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:09.320]  obvious to a lot of people around the world but the point is this entire model
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:15.040]  has broken down in Syria right it's failing now one some point during the
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.680]  course of this year London and Washington will be confronted with the fact
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:24.400]  well your Syrian destabilization has been a complete failure and your attack on
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:29.760]  Iran you're in circumventive Iran is also therefore failing what do you do if
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:34.240]  they decide to go to a confrontation that's where the stuff with Russia comes
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:38.280]  in and that's really what Obama is trying to get he's saying give me until
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:43.480]  November December before you do your countermeasures the idea then being that
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.480]  if you know in July or August or September right the prime military
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:52.920]  season and the prime bombing season if we get a confrontation between the US and
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:58.520]  Russia over some massive issue in the Middle East the US blackmail potential
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:02.520]  will be will be greater if the Russian countermeasures have not been done the
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:06.920]  Russians want to put these missiles in the in the Kaliningrad area and also on
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:12.760]  the Russian coast of the Black Sea right opposite the Balkans opposite Turkey so
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.080]  this is very very serious and much too important to be left and Russian troops
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:22.720]  are being injected into Syria on record now I mean this is disastrous briefly
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:26.160]  what do you make of Corzine openly being caught stealing the money which we
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:30.840]  already knew not getting in trouble Europe melting down austerity everything
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:34.560]  you talked about the Obama deception coming true what's the next phase of
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:41.200]  this well of course what it shows is is the corruption of the of the Democratic
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:44.040]  Party right we've got we've got this wonderful country of ours where we've
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.360]  got reactionary Republicans on the one side but then the alternative to that
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:53.160]  becomes Wall Street Democrats and among the Wall Street Democrats Corzine is
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:57.920]  one of the champions right he was a senator from New Jersey got bored with
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:02.440]  that he decided to become governor of New Jersey and then he was he was voted
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:07.440]  out because he was not a good governor again how can you be when you've got
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:12.720]  you know your main focuses is how to help Wall Street so I think there's a
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:16.960]  good you know he's now been caught with his hand in the till right this is this
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:23.400]  is I guess the embezzlement and a pretty big battle involved at that whether
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.400]  he's above the law well I guess we're soon gonna find out right what about it
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:31.120]  they're Attorney General Eric Holder you're gonna enforce the law against the
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:35.200]  finance oligarch or did they all get off right sometimes they do meanwhile
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.640]  holders shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment it's just a
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:46.040]  bunch of crooks yes and of course at that point well at that point if the
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:50.280]  answer would have to be would have to be political but Webster undoubtedly
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:55.080]  saying they'll arrest citizens takeover infrastructure I mean they really are
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:50:01.800]  trying to start basically cooling well you know the public's out buying guns
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.200]  but they're now taking out a deep freeze and warming up all these police state
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:09.840]  grids I certainly hope the oligarchs don't think they're gonna use some type
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:15.080]  of martial law here even with a false flag it's not gonna work no and that I
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:19.000]  guess that gets us to Obama's executive order now the executive order
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.400]  obviously he wanted to do this um therapeutic is they right he wanted to
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:28.640]  do a stealth operation these are these Friday afternoon five o'clock Washington
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:34.640]  DC the rush is rush hours on and then they they they reveal these things so
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:39.560]  he's essentially he's mobilizing what has already always been there right since
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:44.240]  1950 the Defense Production Act stay there is why now yeah we're gonna come
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.160]  back and answer that question why now with Webster Tarbley by the way a plug
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:52.120]  one more time we come back the intriguing debate you're gonna have with
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:56.960]  some little nasty globalist minions on the other side well I wish I could be
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:01.800]  there for that stay with us Webster Tarbley's our guest

[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:25.520]  Obama and the executive order here with Tarbley but he was he was talking to me
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:29.840]  later in the break and I was like hey I need to send a cameraman up to DC to the
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:34.200]  International Spy Museum next Monday when you're gonna debate David from and
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:38.680]  Jonathan Kaye and a bunch of other people and he said oh sorry they're not
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:42.680]  letting anybody else tape it's just them so it's a TV production and it's gonna
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:48.200]  be Tarbley with like five people against him with David from the neocon
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:53.800]  from the White House moderating I mean that would be like having that would be
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:55:00.840]  like you know having the Washington Redskins coach moderating as a um as a
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:05.680]  referee and the Dallas Cowboys versus the Washington Redskins sudden death
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:11.480]  overtime in Super Bowl 87 you know in the future I mean it is total conflict of
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:18.680]  interest so I'll say this it's 15 bucks to get in neocons only watch Fox News so
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.920]  they don't even know this event's coming up but it's 9-11 false flags and black
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:26.960]  ops and evening of debate with David from Jonathan Kaye and Webster Tarbley
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.000]  show it's $15 members of the inner circle I guess that means if you're
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:39.800]  members to it $12 I want patriots to get in there and I want you guys if you
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:44.160]  you know what to do get video of this don't because what's gonna happen is I
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:47.880]  I'm gonna guess they're doing a TV production for history channel or
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.600]  discovery or something and they're gonna cut it up Webster where you look like
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:57.040]  you've been lobotomized by a monkey with a jackhammer
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:02.720]  I assume now if maybe you want to contact them directly and ask about having a
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:06.240]  camera because that that part I didn't really look into it we'll just turn loose
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:10.520]  the info warriors they'll get cameras in you know they've got to hide it where
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:18.240]  they hide the watch and pulp fiction they're gonna get them in anyways anyways
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:22.400]  so but you're gonna go in there with these piranhas huh look I think it's
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.640]  important because I mean what are the issues right I mean there's this broad
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:30.240]  issue of no but say the Latin thing because it's you know any publicity is
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:36.040]  good publicity and people attack me I love it and teach me that Latin this is
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:39.120]  a Roman proverb right so it's in Latin and it goes like this
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:48.520]  Bonafama good fame Malafama bad fame Semperama right Semperas always fame
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:54.480]  mama so Bonafama Malafama Semperama good fame bad fames all the same it's all
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:57:00.560]  fame and we'll take it on Broadway we say a knock is a boost if you attack me it
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:04.600]  means that I'm somehow important enough to be worthy exactly attack right there's
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:10.440]  no such thing as bad publicity and so forth right no no all of my enemies
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:14.680]  with jealousy and operatives and all of them they've only helped us just look
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:19.440]  Bible says no weapon formed against us so prosper so keep it coming I love it
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.840]  and of course you have to go into the blood and sand of the arena right the
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:29.440]  the the this is the the unfortunately this is the the arena in which the battle
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:33.400]  of ideas has to take place though when you have the opportunity you have to do
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:36.680]  but it's important to point out it's rigged they wouldn't have to have two to
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.520]  one three to one and they run the rules the only way they're letting you the
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:45.320]  arena is with both hands tied behind your back and you'll still you know
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:50.240]  absolutely clean the floor with them Webster yeah well you have to be ready
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:53.160]  for that that's for sure I would just ask him hey how come two passports got
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:58.200]  found that day it's not just that they survived they were found and I'd go oh
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:02.240]  why were they trained at US military bases Newsweek why was Mayor Willie
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:07.040]  Brown warned not to fly Jefferson to Chronicle why was US troops massing
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:11.180]  around Tajikistan Uzbekistan in the month before 9-11 and Bush signed the
[02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:15.440]  launch order to attack the day before source-associated press Newsweek oh you
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:19.640]  want some more I would my idea would be to not not to go so much into these into
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:23.520]  these technical details but rather the question of the invisible government the
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:27.560]  rogue network what that is meant for the United States why that is the threat to
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:31.000]  everybody's future why it's real and it's in yeah because it's gonna be a bunch
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.800]  of spies there from all different governments in the meeting of course
[02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:43.520]  there will be stay there I'm sure I'm gonna the executive order thank you for
[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:53.760]  listening to GCN visit GCN live com today a little over a year ago I began to do a
[02:58:53.760 --> 02:58:57.960]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[02:58:57.960 --> 02:59:02.440]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:05.360]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:09.680]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:14.800]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight

[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:47.000]  that arena with those piranhas but again I'm pleased that they have to have it
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:52.160]  all rigged that's good shows their weakness it still won't be enough even
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:55.960]  other delusional thank God so we're beating them so badly right now so let's
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:00.480]  let that continue Webster getting into the executive orders as you said they're
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:04.680]  thawing out things that were meant for during a nuclear war when Congress has
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:09.320]  all been killed but Obama's saying for any reason including threats peacetime
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:13.040]  martial law is what all the constitutional scholars are calling it
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:19.280]  they're scared aren't they yeah I think the big question again is the ominous
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:23.320]  thing is why now why do this now the defense production act has been there
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.200]  since 1950 it's a product of the Korean War I think many of these provisions
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:32.320]  could be used in a very positive way we could use them to get out of the current
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:37.800]  depression but that's not what Obama has in mind he is sort of pulling out the
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:41.840]  defense production act and he's updating it in the following way the
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:46.040]  defense production act up to now the executive orders that have been issued
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:51.480]  under Clinton and a couple of others make FEMA the lead agency in
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:57.680]  coordinating this emergency economic and maybe political rule but certainly
[03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:02.200]  economic in other words the the war mobilization war preparedness of the
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:07.440]  entire US economy was normally then going to be under FEMA except FEMA has
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:12.280]  now been included in the Homeland Security Department so this means that
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:15.840]  the head of FEMA is no longer going to be the czar but it's going to be
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:20.800]  Napolitano right secretary of Homeland Security and of course her track
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:27.160]  record of incompetence malfeasance non-feasance insolence impudence I mean
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:32.120]  isn't Mr. Napolitano just a puppet yeah of course you've got to look at you
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.080]  know at who I mean exactly all the influences that would converge on her
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:41.560]  yeah that's one side the other side is that the notion of national
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:46.160]  defense has been in broadened in the following way there was a law called the
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:51.440]  Stafford law which has to do with in natural emergencies earthquakes
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:57.000]  hurricanes forest fires things like this that has all been incorporated in so
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.760]  those are the two big sort of formalistic changes that FEMA is no longer
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:07.400]  the lead agency they don't share the Homeland Security panel or whatever it
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:11.720]  is there's a whole interagency group that they've created it generally it's
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:17.120]  going to be the the the lead agency is Homeland Security and the definition is
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:21.560]  broadened to include all of these so-called natural disasters but now
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:27.040]  what is he really looking towards well one could be the obvious right Iran
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:32.360]  right anything with oil anything with the Hormuz the Persian Gulf Arabian
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:36.920]  Gulf that could be what what he has in mind but they want to be ready for a
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:42.320]  confrontation and that seems to be where at least some forces are pushing
[03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:49.040]  another question would be the short-term collapse of the dollar or the euro and
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:54.800]  the dollar some kind of catastrophic dollar panic a rush to the exit to dump
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:58.680]  all the dollars in the world that could make it very hard to get oil because
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:03.280]  obviously one of the things that's included in this in this executive order
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.360]  is stockpiling you can create you know stockpiles of all kinds what do you make
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:12.760]  of the NDA a though and the Communist Chinese using that as their own secret
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.800]  arrest model I mean this is getting really crazy yeah these things are now
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:23.560]  adding up right because you've got this NDA a with the you know Guantanamo
[03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:28.480]  forever with torture they're saying they'll spy without warrants now why we
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.000]  only got 30 seconds left why is there a coming out of the closet right now it
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:35.480]  can be war with Iran it can be the depression it can be that they're
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:40.600]  looking forward to riots and it this is generally varmarization of it this is
[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:44.800]  what happened in Germany 1931 30 yeah get out of the depression the next move
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:48.120]  is dictatorship webs where we gotta have you up the next few weeks again things
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:52.240]  are moving so quickly tarply.net our sites in full wars calm thank you so
