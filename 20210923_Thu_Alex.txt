[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the target of globalist disturbance.
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the victim of a globalist bio-weapon attack.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  All the pieces have fallen into the jigsaw puzzle.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  We already had 95% of an assemble, but we know exactly what's going on now.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  But as evil as the globalist are, we need to realize that we have the power still
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  in our daily lives with what we do and the decisions we make.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  And Darren McBreen put together a four-minute report that's at Band-Out Video
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  that can literally save lives. Your whole email list, your text list,
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  your Facebook, your Twitter, save lives.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  Save lives with this incredibly important four-minute report.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  We're going to come back with all of this huge broadcast today.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  But this is life-saving COVID treatment revealed.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Please share it.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs ever invented.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  And there's 23 studies that show that Ivermectin is effective.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  And there is a systematic review, which is the highest level of evidence-based medicine
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  that says that it works. It's like going to the Supreme Court and winning.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And yet the NIH will not acknowledge that peer-reviewed systematic review.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  There are over 14 medical and scientific papers which hail Ivermectin's success.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  You have all the mainstream media demonizing Ivermectin.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  They tell you it's only for horses. They tell you that if people are overdosing on it,
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  that's all lies.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  Tom Schnorr says for three weeks now he's gone from filling 70 prescriptions
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  a day for Ivermectin to 250 a day.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  So far this year, that's nearly 2,500 patients.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  And none of them have ever had a need to go to the hospital.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  Do you think there's hope in Ivermectin?
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Is it potentially an effective therapeutic for COVID?
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  It could be a lifesaver.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  We've had over 600,000 Americans lose their lives.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  We know that those who have been admitted to the hospital and those who died,
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  the majority die in the hospital, they receive no early treatment.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  All the people in the hospital today are there because they listen to the CDC advice to stay home.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  And if you have really severe symptoms, go to the hospital.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  But the one thing that everybody has in common in the hospital,
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  or almost everyone has in the hospital today, is none of them got early treatment.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  Why is early safe effective treatment not being talked about?
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  I think that's a very, very important question.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  Early treatment is best.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin are safe and effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  The earlier outpatient treatments like monoclonal antibody and Ivermectin are started,
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  the better the outcomes will be.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And there's been a suppression of early treatment that I think has been very intentional
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  by a whole variety of stakeholders in order to prepare the population to receive the vaccine.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  And it seems to be saved by the vaccine.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  And what they're learning now is the vaccine doesn't work well enough in everyone to prevent hospitalization or death.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  And this is why doctors who start these early treatment protocols
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  keep going because they don't lose any patients to hospitalization or death.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  And yet their peers are too afraid to try things like Ivermectin or fluvoxamine,
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  even though those drugs will kill virtually nobody.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  What America needs to know is we have four major organizations.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  One of them which has chapters in every state in America supporting early treatment.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  And America should look to these treatment organizations and not be chilled
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  by the messaging that's coming down through major media.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  Joe Rogan, he came down with COVID. He says he's been taking the livestock dewormer Ivermectin.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Do I have to sue CNN? They're making shit up. They keep saying I'm taking horse dewormer.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  I literally got it from a doctor.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  What does that represent to you that they don't want people to know about Ivermectin?
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Number one reason would be is it's an option that's actually been proven in 61 studies around the world
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  to be effective at stopping the disease process of SARS-CoV-2, which they call COVID-19.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  And within two days, it actually reduces transmission of COVID-19, even to loved ones and households.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's how many studies have been done?
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  Yes, and the actual vaccines have never been promoted to even do that.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  We've been proven right. We've been vindicated. You've been vindicated.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  We've got to save lives and get all this information out.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  My name is Dr. Chrissy Rice.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  Deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  I've had a lot of loss that everybody else has.
[05:10.000 --> 05:23.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled,
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  transient. And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[05:40.000 --> 05:51.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[05:51.000 --> 06:06.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[06:06.000 --> 06:26.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  I've been watching and I've been waiting for the globalists to make their big move and I knew it was coming.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  It was in all their white papers and battle plans. And now we are almost two years into their big assault.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  The beginning of the worldwide technocracy takeover and the forced depopulation.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  So submitting to this means you're very slow, painful death and humiliation before you're killed.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  Resisting means a human future worth livable.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  We are facing absolute pure evil turned loose writ large.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  We are facing absolute pure evil not the road to hell's paved with good intentions.
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  That's the general public going along with the tyranny because they believe the cover stories.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  Now I had a big headline yesterday for the full show saying this is the biggest news of the 21st century.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  And I explained there and I was very clear about it.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Why I said that and I really meant that that was not hype.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  I had a lot of people in the halls asked me.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  I had family calling asked me.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  I had politicians calling me and they said you really think this is the biggest story in world history
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  that Fauci lied to Congress and cooked up gain of function chimera in the documents that matches cover 19
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  and then sought the Pentagon's permission to release it on China.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  Well, that's that's the epicenter.
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  But but the nuclear war or biological war that would have started, which it has started a biological war.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  The ramifications of the lockdown of civilization, the ramifications of forced inoculations and the end of a free society
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  and the ramifications of the corporate media and the general public and our Congress and our governors.
[08:04.000 --> 08:13.000]  Not saying a damn word about it when the smoking gun of smoking guns comes out.
[08:13.000 --> 08:21.000]  The ramifications of what that means about civilization and what the globalist have gotten away with are getting away with
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  and are planning to get away with is just devastating.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  I'm ready to die.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  I don't want to die.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  I don't want to watch my family die.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  But I know that's coming.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  That's their plan.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  They've said that's their plan and I'm sitting here white knuckled going listen to me public.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  This is a real plan.
[08:40.000 --> 08:41.000]  Here's the evidence.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  You need to be aware of this.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  I told you this was coming to this point.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  It happened just like I told you the rest is coming.
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  You can take your shots.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  You can kiss their ass.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  You can take your five year old to have his balls chopped off to worship the left.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  The left just one facsimile of the New World Order's depopulation program.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  At the top, it has an agenda of total exterminism and it gets you to go along with exterminating this group or exploiting that group,
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  hoping they won't get around to you.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  They will.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  So there's the day's headline Thursday emergency broadcast and it's an emergency broadcast every day is now.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  Fauci created thousands of other deadly viruses Pentagon confirms that's in there.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  So let me let me walk through this for you.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Then I'm going to hit all the other news today.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  We got a bunch of big guests coming on on other subjects like a big Breitbart, Texas head editor Brandon Darby,
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  who was certainly right about anti-fun the left 15 years ago.
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  And I wasn't.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  He's taught us a lot.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  He's been joining us when he's seen on the border.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  What's happening there coming up the next hour.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  But let's just look at how my brain works so that people can get how I know all this does.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  Everybody asked me how well how do you know what's coming next in Union because I study all the players.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  Okay.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  And you know up front I said I thought the chai comms were involved with the globalist because they were involved at Wuhan.
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  They stood to gain and the globalists said they were with China and said China did a great job and that they should open up that we should remain closed
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  because that helps globalist interest shut down their main enemy the West.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  But they also want to control China and China's now broken their deals with them.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  But now as we look closer and the propaganda that came out yesterday to respond to what I was saying on air,
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  you begin to see that it was the globalist trying to play China and the United States off against each other in my view.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  It's a fact Fauci created the weapon with Bill Gates.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  It's a fact they released it.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  It's a fact that's the exact same virus they described that is covered 19.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  It's a fact they're releasing new variants.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  We know all that.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  I'll go over it.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  It's a fact they've released protein crystal simulants that do the same thing,
[10:44.000 --> 10:51.000]  but don't continue to infect others at three or four levels.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  It's very important.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  It's the neutron bomb of biological weapons.
[10:57.000 --> 11:05.000]  But this information coming out is incontrovertible.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  Now I'm going to move you to speculation areas with all the pieces, what this points to.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  And we'll open the phones up tomorrow and stuff and we can have a discussion about this because I want to get your take on it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  Because everything else I've said is documented in his hiding in plain view.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  The question is, obviously it was released on purpose.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  We don't know that.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  But who stood to gain and who was really behind it?
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  We understand the same globalists that put Mao Zedong in power,
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  the same globalists that made one side of trade deals to empower their state and then to transfer all the West money,
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  not to the Chai comms, part of it was transferred, but more than a third of it to themselves, the middlemen Trump talked about.
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  And so, looking at this, as soon as we come out your state, as soon as the news breaks,
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  and it was in major British papers and some U.S. papers, but didn't get one, one millionth the attention it should have,
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  that Fauci cooked up these thousands of viruses, including COVID-19, and sought the Pentagon's approval to release it in China open air,
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  and that they had nanotech-simulant systems that burrow through the skin as microscopic glass crystals,
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  and then deliver the virus into the body, all of that now confirmed, which we'd speculated on.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  Well, now look at this headline.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  Chinese whistleblower claims COVID outbreak intentional happened in October 2019 at military world games.
[12:29.000 --> 12:40.000]  Well, we've been hearing that since last February, and we've been hearing that from Senator Cotton and others.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  And I don't doubt that Communist Chinese wouldn't release a weapon.
[12:44.000 --> 12:52.000]  I know the fact they were heavily invested in a joint operation with DARPA, with the U.S. military, with Fort Detrick, Maryland,
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  with Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  But we have the Pentagon and DARPA saying to Dasik and to Fauci, don't do these programs.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  We do have documents with the Chai comms going ahead with these programs in Dasik and others.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  They were seeking permission from both of the superpowers while they did this because they represent the Bill Gates globalist faction
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  that is now in control or partial control of the two factions.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  So it's multinational corporations trying to get rid of the nation state.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  And in the U.S., the nation state has not stood up to big tech in the globalist and has been taken over.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  I mean, Senator Rand Paul has a hearing with a medical doctor about natural immunity is much better than the vaccine.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  And YouTube says that is not what the U.N. said. Your Senate hearing is banned.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  We are under the globalist control.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  G.G. Ping is in charge of his country to a great extent.
[13:46.000 --> 13:55.000]  And he's a dictator and a bloodthirsty, but he says, hey, I'm in charge and has been arresting globalist front people
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  and kicking out foreign operatives that don't totally roll over and turn their companies like Apple has over to them.
[14:03.000 --> 14:11.000]  China has motives to release the weapon through Fauci, who's a China fall on the surface. So is Bill Gates.
[14:11.000 --> 14:21.000]  But now as you began to see the proof that it was lab made come out, you noticed our media suddenly said, OK, it was the Chinese that did it.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  And maybe they released it on purpose.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that's the globalist through the U.S. that they control more than China saying, hey, if you're about to say that we released it,
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  that is the globalist, we'll just say you released it.
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  So when I weigh all this and look at this and the motives and all of it and know the globalist are the most powerful group,
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  that tells me that they are the ones that got China involved, got China to agree to this stuff.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  The Pentagon said no. DARPA said no.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  And then when it was time to embarrass Trump, you saw Fauci come out and say, don't worry, he'll be challenged by a big pandemic.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Then they release it. They blame Trump. They blame America.
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  They say China's good. But they also had that in their hip pocket to blackmail China that, hey, you worked with us on this.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  If they didn't go along with what the globalist wanted.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  So now you see how that works. And Gigi Ping's calling their bluff and saying, we'll just have a nuclear war.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  So that's the best analysis I can give you. That's what I see in the information.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  But that is speculation with a massive amount of the pieces in place.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  But it could, when we get the other pieces, be something different than what we thought we were looking at.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  But overall, we know that they made it. It's artificial. The Chai comms were involved.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  The U.S. government was involved, but got cold feet.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  Maybe because they already had it. Some other element in the government actually released it and is now blackmailing the globalist in China.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  This is real thought here. This is the type of stuff going on in the back of my head. I don't even get into on air.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  But when we come back, we'll give you the latest on all this and tell you what we do know.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Tomorrow's news today on Alex Jones. This is the info war.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  Everybody, you know, tune in now. Be part of the victory.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  stay safe and cool in any power outage. Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:57.000 --> 17:02.000]  Hey, everybody. If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  Here's the thing. We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans,
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  survival soup beans. These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious,
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  The best part? We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to. It gets even better.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000]  Period. Go to soupbeansurvival.com at soupbeansurvival.com
[17:47.000 --> 17:56.000]  and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com at soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  the head of the Chinese military and said Trump might nuke you,
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  he tried to overthrow the U.S. government, but basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you
[18:11.000 --> 18:16.000]  if we launch an attack, which was the greatest reason in U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  People said, oh, Alex, it must not be true, and I might wait. Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence,
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.000]  he's a big insider globalist, he wouldn't have flipped this out unless they wanted to put it out
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  and say that Milley was a hero to set the precedent that you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  Network Deep State, basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  That's why he put five in, he's so incredibly weak, he's to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  Well, now Milley admits he did it. You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd taken control of the nukes.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then, and we covered it.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  See, I have a memory, folks. I remember all this stuff. That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  They even admit it. Now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  They need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[20:22.000 --> 20:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones on this live September 23rd, 2021 broadcast.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  Yes, thank you for joining us. Okay, so let me just slow down and get to the biggest issue facing our world.
[20:53.000 --> 21:03.000]  The threat of COVID-19, whether you think it's completely fraudulent or completely real, and we know what it is now. It's a group of attacks.
[21:03.000 --> 21:14.000]  They are using it to take control of our society to create a corrupt authoritarian world government with a world social credit score that tracks and traces everywhere you go,
[21:14.000 --> 21:24.000]  that decides where you can go, what you can do, that decides who is essential, who isn't essential, and that will say, oh, as part of reparations, you pay nothing for milk, but a white person pays $5.
[21:24.000 --> 21:36.000]  And that's being proposed. And again, it's not about empowering black people. It's about getting it set in stone that discrimination is okay, so we accept the global social credit score.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  We're not corrupting all the small businesses, saying they're not essential, so you get a universal basic income so they can dictate where that universal income can be spent.
[21:45.000 --> 21:56.000]  This is beyond just currency controls. This is deciding where you can spend that currency. It's about total control. The root of all evil is the love of money.
[21:56.000 --> 22:04.000]  Well, this is beyond the love of money. This is the control of money. This is next level. This is a hellish system.
[22:04.000 --> 22:21.000]  So continuing, we know Fauci funded by Gates through Peter Dasek on record created hundreds of Chimera COVID viruses, thousands of total deadly viruses over the last 15 years.
[22:21.000 --> 22:30.000]  In the U.S., but when that got banned because of lots of pressure, they moved to China. It's not just Wuhan, but more than 10 labs around the country.
[22:30.000 --> 22:37.000]  We now know from the documents that came out that they don't deny that DARPA and the Defense Department declassified when it was requested.
[22:37.000 --> 22:44.000]  Normally, they would not release that. They wanted it out. That they told Fauci, no, this will kill people. Basically, you're crazy.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  They said, we're shocked by this proposal. I showed you yesterday. They said, this will infect humans. What are you doing?
[22:49.000 --> 23:02.000]  You're going to put airborne super virus in the air and then put it into animals that then fly around human populations because we know that we get cold viruses from squirrels, from dogs, from everything.
[23:02.000 --> 23:10.000]  We share them. That's why you can't have a vaccine for them because there's always new pools for their development. You can't for smallpox because it's only in humans.
[23:10.000 --> 23:19.000]  There's no pools once everybody's inoculated. So that's what the science, you know, trust the science shows. When they say, we're not going to show you any facts. Just trust the science. You know, it's the opposite.
[23:19.000 --> 23:36.000]  So we know Fauci did it. Here's the 64 gazillion prize number, the $64 trillion question. Who does Fauci work for? Who has the power? Who stands to gain the most?
[23:36.000 --> 23:46.000]  Who controls the media? Who controls the currency? Who controls the countries? Who's who's shut up the UN? Who's shut up communist China?
[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  The Rockefellers who are the front of the Robert Baron families who created Operation Lockstep that plans all this. So I'm not defending Xi Jinping.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  I think the Communist Party should be removed overthrown. I love to see free market Christian capitalism.
[23:58.000 --> 24:10.000]  Chinese were highly Christian before they got overthrown, Buddhist, whatever. I like to see them be free. It'd be great. It'd be great for humanity. We'd probably beat the globalists if we could do that.
[24:10.000 --> 24:27.000]  But the globalists were smart. They went in there, took over to their anthropology analysis and set them up as the new communist slash Chinese civilization, which they would then slant all the business deals and all of the trade deals to where all development would go there.
[24:27.000 --> 24:38.000]  And the globalists would control that development so they could then control the whole planet. But China, again, at the last minute, just like tyrants always do, are fighting with the other wing.
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  So that's where we are. And so now they're bringing it out that not only did it happen at the Wuhan lab, but China's behind it.
[24:46.000 --> 24:58.000]  Right as the evidence comes out that it wasn't China, that it was the globalist who were attacking America and China and the whole world's freedom with it and propping up authoritarianism by releasing it.
[24:58.000 --> 25:12.000]  We weren't sure until now, was it a joint globalist Chinese attack? Well, no, it helped the Chai comms but also helped the globalists more because now everything's shut down here and they're the middlemen getting more money and power than the Chai comms get.
[25:12.000 --> 25:29.000]  That's what Trump talked about. He saw the numbers. They get, the globalists get about 45% of the wealth and power out of all Chinese transactions. The Chai comms might get 20%, 25%, and then the rest goes to the other respective countries and their populations.
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  So think about that. The globalists get almost half of everything that goes out of China.
[25:37.000 --> 25:44.000]  And so Xi Jinping wants to change that and he says, now we're going to have three children and we're going to arrest homosexuals and you're not going to make us like Americans.
[25:44.000 --> 25:56.000]  You're not going to have sissy men because he sees what they've done here. He's going to the other extreme and the left was still praising, oh, yes, arrest the gays, kill the Christians, kill the Buddhists, kill the, like, well, now you're not with us.
[25:56.000 --> 26:09.000]  Well, now Xi Jinping's bad. Nope, Xi Jinping. So here we are. The big question is who controls Fauci.
[26:09.000 --> 26:17.000]  And it's all right here in next segment is a long segment. I'm going to get into that there and I'm going to lay it all out. And this is the big enchilada.
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  We have the history. We have who did it. We have the motive. We have all the proof they made COVID-19 and more.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  And they're releasing the new screens. We've got it all. And it's all right here. So they're trying to say, oh, there's a rumor.
[26:29.000 --> 26:42.000]  A Chinese defector says he heard a rumor that at this military drill that they first planted the story a year and a half ago on that the Chinese government was going to release a bio weapon there.
[26:42.000 --> 26:57.000]  On to the Westerners with no evidence. But then we have the documents and the DARPA documents and the admissions and the Peter Dasik documents and the Dick and the Dick Cheney statements previously and all of it and Bill Gates and the rest of it all right there.
[26:57.000 --> 27:07.000]  Yeah, the Chinese are involved. That they were doing it. They were preparing it so they could blame it on the Chinese or the U.S. or whoever they wanted to.
[27:07.000 --> 27:18.000]  How they probably got a plan to blame it on some right winger or something. That way they can play it however they want and can move the goalpost.
[27:18.000 --> 27:26.000]  So the absolute documentation and incredible proof coming up next segment. Separately, we're not going to be on air if you don't support us and I'm not complaining.

[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  So let me just calmly go through this as best I can. I'm already giving the backstory.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  We're going to go back into that as well, but let's just get the 35,000 foot view.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  Here's RT, Associated Press, Washington Times, it's everywhere, Washington Post.
[33:43.000 --> 33:54.000]  COVID-19 appeared in the U.S. before Wuhan. Chinese scientists claim in new research paper.
[33:54.000 --> 34:08.000]  And we also have the IMF World Bank document saying in 2019, it was already seen in 2018 in the Italian sewer lines and it had already been identified and named COVID-19.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  That's mainstream news. We'll look more at that in a moment. Then there's this big story.
[34:13.000 --> 34:24.000]  Jamie White wrote about it from 4Wars.com. Chinese whistleblower claims COVID outbreak intentional happened in October of 2019 at military world games.
[34:24.000 --> 34:34.000]  And then they give no evidence. They say a Chinese detector defector heard rumors.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  Well, we don't have rumors. We have the documents. I'll show you in a moment.
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  CCP defector says China deliberately spread COVID at military event in 2019. This is all over every channel.
[34:50.000 --> 34:59.000]  But not about the documents from DARPA and the Pentagon about Fauci and Dasik wanting to release COVID-19 virus.
[34:59.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's the same virus. They describe all the insertions, the same virus, the same P Shuttle genes, the same HIV delivery system.
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  Continuing. Oh, let's look at this. A federal ban on making lethal viruses is lifted 2017.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  One of the things they slipped through on Trump.
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  Here's another one under Obama. Lab-made coronavirus triggers debate. The scientists, they moved it from North Carolina to Wuhan.
[35:29.000 --> 35:47.000]  But here it is. Here's the Proposal Volume 1 from Peter Dasik, found directly in run by Fauci, Dr. Peter Dasik, Ph.D., EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, 17th Floor, New York City.
[35:47.000 --> 35:57.000]  And you read this. It's to merge HIV with four animal coronaviruses and make it work and infect humans.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  And the bats fly over and they give it to you.
[36:02.000 --> 36:12.000]  Coronavirus contains HIV insertion, stoking fears over artificially created bio-weapon. That was February 1st of last year, 2020.
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  It was in zero hedge. It was on InfoWars. We had bio-weapons experts on. We had all the documents.
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  We knew that Peter Dasik and Fauci were involved then in gaining a function because they'd given speeches and admitted it.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  They'd been a big debate five years before.
[36:26.000 --> 36:39.000]  Well, here we are six and a half years later and we have the actual document where they made it all and where they proposed it to DARPA that creates the new weapons and makes the main decisions at the Pentagon.
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.000]  They go to Congress to get the funding, but that's the brain of the Pentagon, is DARPA, formerly ARPA that created the Internet and all the rest of it in 1961.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, and this has been released.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  So it's not a rumor of the Chinese whistleblower.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  And you read the whole article, oh, he's in Australia and, you know, he just says that, you know, he heard maybe they did it.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  Oh, wow. Well, funny, I've got Fauci right here doing it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:16.000]  And then I've got him running the UN response, running the American response, and members of the Senate can't criticize him or they get censored off YouTube.
[37:16.000 --> 37:28.000]  Or no, you can criticize at Xi Jinping all day, but you can't criticize who's in charge, Bill Gates and Fauci and Klaus Schwab and the globalists because they are in charge.
[37:28.000 --> 37:39.000]  And their granddaddies set up Mao Zedong and defeated Chiang Kai-shek and they run the planet.
[37:39.000 --> 37:46.000]  So here it is. See, this is the one independent, a few new U.S. newspapers with just dry headlines.
[37:46.000 --> 37:57.000]  Like, oh, yeah, Fauci and Dazsik sought money from the military to release it in China, but it wasn't for people.
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  The military said that'll probably infect humans. No, really, think so?
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  So that's their cover story. They wanted to get the Pentagon on board. They did get the Chinese government on board to make this.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's in the 900 pages came out two weeks ago that the intercept suit got.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  And so when that came out, that Fauci and Diz had gained a function, build it, do it, and that the Chinese were involved.
[38:23.000 --> 38:31.000]  And then when they announced that their government approving it, our government gets a foyer and says, you can actually have that.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  We said no to it.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  Now, our government is a consortium of globalists at the top. It has good people in it.
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.000]  And the globalists see America as its main enemy because the people might get control of the government again and then there goes their new order.
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.000]  Just like the Chinese people might overthrow Xi Jinping and that'd be if the new order, they set up a good system.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  It doesn't mean Xi Jinping is now in line with the globalists. He's not. And that's why you see all hell breaking loose.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  Oh, China could be the preeminent force and all this stuff as long as they didn't expand their military outside the South China Sea, but they did.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  So they broke their deal under Obama with the globalists, which is smart because you don't ever want to make a deal with them.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  They're even more evil than the Chai Combs.
[39:14.000 --> 39:22.000]  And so remember, Xi Jinping is paying people to have three children now instead of killing anyone over one baby.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Xi Jinping is putting homosexuals in prison.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  What does George Soros call Xi Jinping?
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  The number one threat in the world, the most evil man on earth.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  He calls him Hitler 2.0.
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.000]  Well, he didn't work for Hitler like you and I'm not don't like Xi Jinping.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  I'm explaining it. It's like in World War Two, Stalin and Hitler didn't like each other. I don't like Stalin. I don't like Hitler.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  I'm just explaining. There's a major split here and they admit it and it's real.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  And then magically they got Trump, who's a problem of the Chinese absolute respect.
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  He was very popular there with the people like he stands up for his people. He's going to get them more money and the Chinese showed the United States.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  Hey, 40-some percent of this goes to your middlemen, not even to the factories, not even to the workers or your people.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  We would like to have a better deal where the middlemen are cut out.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  And Trump said, I'll cut middlemen out. You're right. They'll only get 20 percent instead of 44 percent.
[40:20.000 --> 40:32.000]  And that's when Trump was at the washing machine factory, Mayflower, and said, I'm not going to be here soon.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  They're going to take me out because I'm not going to have these middlemen making more money than the Chinese people or the American people.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  I thought it was the Chinese. He said it's the middlemen. Remember I played that clip like 10 times?
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  Because Trump was like, wow. Yeah, Trump discovered on his own what we already knew.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  The globalist put Mao Zedong in power to kill 100 million of his own people, 86 million under him.
[40:56.000 --> 41:02.000]  They admit, force them off their farms, force them into slave factories and exploit them.
[41:02.000 --> 41:10.000]  They were the first robots. They were used as slave labor because they're tough, they're smart, but they will conform.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  They will work themselves to death. So you want to see the first robots that support Chinese people.
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.000]  And they want to make us robots too. That's Amazon's goal, where we conform under AI. It tells us what to do.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  Our police are already robots now with their body cams and GPS. That's where the whole world's going.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  Now there's the article that was in September of, I guess it updates each day. I don't remember the exact headline.
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  I scroll down. News Wars always gives the new headline. That was August 6, 2020.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  I have a lot of enemies out there right now. This might be the last time you see me for a while.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  A lot of very, very rich enemies and they're not happy with me and what I'm doing.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  You know, you got a really serious death threat that day.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  As much as you can say, Trump should have done better. He was naive about how bad it was.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  But he got educated and he's informed now.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  So they released it. They did it. The globalists did it.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  And now they're going to blame the Chinese because they want war with the Chinese Communist.
[42:09.000 --> 42:17.000]  And it's just a giant mess and it's exactly what you get before a huge new world war.
[42:17.000 --> 42:25.000]  And the left is now having to switch from worshipping Xi Jinping to saying he's the worst person on earth because the real Nazi collaborator said he's Hitler.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  And that's just how these people turn on a dime and are just robots.
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  The Democratic Party, liberals left us. They're out saying nobody at the FDA stepped down over these shots.
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  Nobody's died. It's all lies. Alex Jones is lying. And then it's all, of course, true what I say.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  It's just next level because they're just getting that monthly paycheck for the talking point.
[42:45.000 --> 42:53.000]  They're just soulless, losing their soul for that and endangering everybody, not knowing that the country was great because people weren't yes men in this nation.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  All right, I got all the other news. We'll hit it when we come back. Stay with us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:10.000]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden, coming out and announcing that 100 million Americans are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs,
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  we understand we know the blueprint of the UN. They've stated their plan. Contact tracers coming to your house, 10 forced injections a year,
[43:18.000 --> 43:26.000]  the destruction of your immune system, the depopulation of the planet, and the vaccine passport on your, quote, iPhone or droid,
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  tracking and tracing everything you do and telling you when you can go outside of your house or where you can go,
[43:31.000 --> 43:38.000]  not just for COVID-19, but for carbon taxes. So as I've said a thousand times, submission is death.
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  You give in to this just for your job or to be able to go to the bar or to be able to, quote, fly an airplane.
[43:44.000 --> 43:53.000]  Then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these apps on your phone to control where you go and what you do and dog train you right into total slavery.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  This is criminal, it's illegal, it's tyranny, and we must resist and not comply.
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  We're in an information war and the globalists are counting on the people being ignorant.
[44:02.000 --> 44:09.000]  That's why they're engaged in so much censorship because the truth is the antidote to their lies, to their hysteria, to their fear,
[44:09.000 --> 44:17.000]  to the controlled bio weapon they released and now the so-called vaccine that produces that same bio weapon inside the body.
[44:17.000 --> 44:24.000]  COVID land the lockdown is part one in a five parts mini series. It is a very powerful film.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  I'm very, very proud of this film. A highly respected director made the film.
[44:28.000 --> 44:36.000]  It's got over the top guests and experts, like Robert Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, myself and just so many others.
[44:36.000 --> 44:44.000]  I'm very proud to produce this film. It's available right now at infowarstore.com for nineteen ninety five and start shipping in early October.
[44:44.000 --> 44:52.000]  And for those that put in early orders now, you get a free copy of my seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  That gives you a whole pack story on how they built up to this takeover.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  Here's infowarstore.com.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  We're already halfway through September twenty twenty one.

[46:55.000 --> 47:24.000]  Male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. We're here. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  And the way I get out of the Phantom Zone out of this digital prison is you telling folks about the local radio station you're listening to
[47:36.000 --> 47:44.000]  and or how they can find us at freeworldnews.tv or band.video or the dreaded infowarstore.com.
[47:44.000 --> 47:52.000]  That's everything. Your action, your resistance, your will is the blood of our fight, the spirit, the heart of it, it's everything.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  Okay, Brandon Darby was testifying the state legislature because he's the editor and the head of Breitbart, Texas,
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  and just knows more about the border. Anybody else I know, he lives right on the border.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  He was scheduled to join us today, but the testimony's going over.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  And so he'll probably be on tomorrow and we'll even have some of that testimony for you when he joins us.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  Always a great guest and informative because I want to focus on the border and the collapsing of it and just how bad it is.
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  We have a bunch of news that I'm actually going to hit briefly at the start of the next hour that I had ready for when he came on.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  Of course, they're releasing 80-plus percent of the Haitians into the country.
[48:29.000 --> 48:35.000]  Some of them do a face scan and haven't been a database as a criminal. They are sent back.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  But the vast majority are being turned loose. That's mainstream news.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  We told you last week that was a lie that Biden was going to deport them.
[48:42.000 --> 48:50.000]  So that'll encourage more to come. They're building a permanent base at that bridge to then bring more in out of Haiti,
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  thousands a day, adding to the millions coming out of Latin America.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  And they say, after the COVID lockdown, we're all starving to death, so we have to come here.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  The globalists know what they're doing. They starved by the death of Latin America and the Caribbean and then they come here
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  and then they'll put on welfare and the country collapses.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  They're not being brought here to get strong, hard-working people. They're being brought here to be exploited and controlled and exploited us.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  So there you go.
[49:15.000 --> 49:22.000]  Probably told you 5,000 times in the last 20 months since last year when this whole COVID thing started.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  This is about imploding the Third World and then flooding us with migrants,
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  because the UN said in leaked documents in 2006, that's their battle plan.
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.000]  It was on Lou Dobbs back then. Remember when he had more viewers than Tucker Carlson or anybody else?
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  They fired him. Now he's been fired from Fox.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  The original OG that on the show, big listener of the show, we like Lou Dobbs.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  He started his own show again. Now continuing, though continuing, ladies and gentlemen, that's coming up.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  We also have Tucker highlights clip of Biden saying, white's becoming a minority is a source of our strength.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  Not just, oh, it's okay. We're all these other groups. No, no, whites are inherently bad. It's glad they're going away.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  This is the race-based politics. We're explaining where that goes and what's going to unfold all over the world.
[50:11.000 --> 50:17.000]  Gay Swedish priests is just one more case. Val's to stop performing marriage ceremonies for straight couples,
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.000]  even though his church does it for everybody. It's just all part of that anti-human cult. Don't have children.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  Also, new reports out. All the media saying you must eat bugs. You must drink sewage.
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  It was even in the major cover story in the Washington Post. I covered two days ago. There's new articles out on that.
[50:35.000 --> 50:46.000]  And so much more of the Democratic Party is in a giant fetish race with themselves to worship George W. Bush
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  and Liz Cheney. Just absolutely disgusting. That's all coming up and so much more.
[50:53.000 --> 51:02.000]  But since Brandon Darby cannot join us, we are opening the phones in the third hour for first-time callers.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  I'm going to give the number out in a few minutes.
[51:05.000 --> 51:18.000]  For first-time callers, specifically on the Wuhan lab, Fauci's plan to release live COVID-19,
[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  describes the exact virus, into bat populations to spread it to the general population,
[51:24.000 --> 51:33.000]  and even using nano glass particles to pierce the skin and then deliver the artificial virus into the body.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  And then thousands of other viruses they talk about. Hundreds of coronaviruses alone.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  They're even more lethal up to 10,000 times. I'm sorry. My brain dials things back.
[51:41.000 --> 51:46.000]  I was saying yesterday 100 times stronger. I'm sorry. I had the document I showed you two segments ago.
[51:46.000 --> 51:55.000]  It says 10,000 times stronger. I don't know if that's true. That's what they said they had.
[51:55.000 --> 52:04.000]  But I guess the original COVID had a one-tenth to one-percent rate of death or less than I guess 10,000 times stronger would be a lot more deadly.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  But again, it was meant to kill debilitated old people, then it mutated.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  That's what the FDA said on Saturday. I've been telling you that for a year.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  But maybe I'm wrong because a lot of people I talk to who are dialed in and the Pentagon haven't been telling me for six months or more.
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.000]  It was actually last year. It's over a year now. But now they've told me no, it is a synthetic protein crystal that replicates,
[52:25.000 --> 52:32.000]  but only has a certain half-life like a neutron bomb where it only races through three or four people and it stops.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  It's not classically communicable. It's totally programmed. And then that's why you see such high death rates.
[52:38.000 --> 52:45.000]  You can't breathe and it hurts so bad. Then you go get intubated and you die because that actually helps kill you.
[52:45.000 --> 52:52.000]  What you need is oral steroids, inhalable steroids, and I've remected to stop the crystal replication.
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  And so that's why they're battling because they're hitting us with a chemical attack, but it replicates.
[52:59.000 --> 53:06.000]  It's a simulation, a life-simulating nanotech, which they now admit they created.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  They've got different ones here. One that delivers it, one that makes it itself.
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.000]  And so I tend to roll my eyes at people that are high-level CIA or even headed up intelligence agencies,
[53:17.000 --> 53:23.000]  even if I think they're good people. And meanwhile, I just have a tendency to research stuff, open source my own self,
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  and be more right than they are usually. So I'm like, well, they're saying it's synthetic, they're saying it's this,
[53:27.000 --> 53:34.000]  and now here it is, and now we know why the Pentagon said that, because three years ago they were being approached by these people with this.
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  So that's why General Flynn was telling people that, because it's true. And I'm not knocking Flynn.
[53:41.000 --> 53:48.000]  I think he's as smart as I am or smarter. It's just you hear stuff like that and it's hard to believe.
[53:48.000 --> 53:59.000]  It's even hard for Alex Jones to believe. But yes, the globalists hit one city in India, one city in China,
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.000]  one city in Italy, and a couple cities in the U.S. hit the East Coast.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  And that's why early on, like 17 months ago, people were saying, 16 months ago, they were saying,
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  why is it only in certain areas and not others? Well, we learned. And then depending on sources I have,
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  not just Flynn, we're 100% sure when it only hit certain cities in Texas and Florida and then went out from there.
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  But it would hit like the same day, 300 miles apart. I mean, it's, they sprayed it on us.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  You could look how it was done. And so they were correct. I always said it was possible.
[54:32.000 --> 54:39.000]  But coming to grips with the fact that you know Fauci and Gates gave the order, I mean, they gave the order in China.
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.000]  And that little monster man almost killed my parents and killed people I know. And I'm pissed.
[54:45.000 --> 54:53.000]  So we're all victims of a bio attack. He's got stuff far worse. And are we going to just sit here and take it?
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  I don't want any violence against Fauci. I'll turn him into a victim. I'm saying to the FBI and the CIA and the Pentagon
[54:58.000 --> 55:06.000]  and to governors and to Senator Cotton and to Senator Cruz and to Senator Paul, saddle up men, come out and bring all this out
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  and just get the energy going to get this guy off our back. Are we all going to sit here and watch our kids die
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  and our parents die? Seriously? Seriously?
[55:19.000 --> 55:29.000]  The reason I couldn't believe what the Pentagon was telling me and the CIA people was, I couldn't believe that we're sitting here taking this.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.000]  It's one thing if it got out of the lab or they released it on purpose, but to be running around spraying us with it.
[55:36.000 --> 55:43.000]  I mean, I can't sit here and take this. And I know you can't sit here and take this either.
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.000]  We better do banner hangs. We better call on the talk radio. We better go to church and speak up. We better hand out the information.
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  We better get very aggressive in the Info War or they're going to release new ones that are even worse.
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.000]  And I said that 20 months ago. I said it before that. I said once they release the bio weapons, they're going to test to see how we behave,
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  get us locked down, then release more powerful ones and slowly close the news on us because I've read so many of their documents today.
[56:07.000 --> 56:15.000]  They don't imply all this, but don't go all the way. It's like a Bible paper out so thin. It's so thinly veiled you see right through it.
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  Hell, Dick Cheney talks about race specific bio weapons and releasing them to bring in world government control in the PNAC document.
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.000]  So all I know is this globalist consortium has the motive, the history. They did it. They had the blueprints.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  They have the documents and they sought to get DARPA and the Pentagon on board.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  And they at least on the surface said no. Hell no. The Chinese went along with it. Does that mean the Chinese did this?
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Well, they had a motive and a trade war to do it. Would they really pull that? China watched us drop atomic bombs on Japan.
[56:45.000 --> 56:53.000]  Would they really go that far? I don't know. No. No, it's the UN and the Rockefeller Combine that set all this up that are running it and big tech.
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.000]  And it was Facebook and Google that invested hundreds of millions in the Wuhan lab and this very project.
[56:59.000 --> 57:06.000]  They all wanted to be part of this takeover. They were all falling over each other to be involved and be the big super villains.
[57:06.000 --> 57:18.000]  They're the ones. Google, Facebook, Apple, Gates, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Democratic Party, the UN.
[57:18.000 --> 57:25.000]  They did it. They ran it. They launched the attack on everybody. And then that way we all hate each other and they get to divide China from the U.S.
[57:25.000 --> 57:31.000]  and they get to set up a police state and they get to give us a world ID and a microchip and all the tracker systems and a social credit score.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  And then when it came out that it was really them that did it, they blamed China.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  No, they did it and they're getting ready to release more on us. It's in their own documents.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  And are we going to sit here and let Fauci and Gates murder us and our families?
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  I have some key Bill Gates stuff coming up. I'll give you the toll-free number when we come back.
[57:46.000 --> 57:57.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss.
[57:57.000 --> 58:11.000]  Like everybody else has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[58:11.000 --> 58:24.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, transient.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[58:29.000 --> 58:39.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[58:39.000 --> 58:48.000]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[58:48.000 --> 58:54.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[58:54.000 --> 59:04.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[59:04.000 --> 59:14.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[59:14.000 --> 59:21.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[59:26.000 --> 59:35.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[59:35.000 --> 59:59.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  All right, I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment. I tend to be taking calls by the end of the second segment.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  And I said I got a lot of other news to hit, but really, like I said yesterday, the releasing of the bio weapon, the fear, releasing new variants to scare everybody,
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  killing millions of people worldwide, cutting off the treatments for whatever it is they released on us.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  All this premeditatedly, practicing the censorship, even censoring members of the Congress, the House of the Senate, governors, is a digital AI martial law takeover.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  And it's like a boa constrictor that unhinges its jaw to try to eat a deer or something, or wild boar.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  I mean, it's a big job for them, but they've got, they've got our head in their mouth and they're trying to swallow us down.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And we're still alive, folks. We can struggle out of this.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  But we got to recognize, hey, this is a snake biting us. This is really happening. We're about to be digested.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  And what's left of a spit out. So that's where we are. And I'm really sorry that's where we are.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  They really did it though. These mad scientists really did it.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  It's about global domination. It's about controlling the future. It's about getting all the incredible technologies for themselves like life extension.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And they do see the dumbed down, lackadaisical Hollywood controlled public that they helped put in that state and say, you know, these people are useless eaters.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  And a lot of the public really are useless eaters, but you morally can't kill them.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  And play God, especially when you made them like this, especially when the satanic force really greased the skids and led people into this.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  People could have easily been let out of this, but they let us into this.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  And you see how incredibly weak the servants of the system are.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  And then you just know the fundamental flesh level you don't want to be with the new order.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And then spiritually, it's just that there's no comparison to dark, worldly energy that is just pathetic that they think is power source compared to what King David talked about the quiet place of the most time.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And my problem with the peace of God is that you just want to be with God, but then you realize you've got to be with your children and your family in this process and that you're going to have to go through the fire.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  You're going to have to go through the grindstone.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And this is it.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  And, you know, every generation has the problems they got to face.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  But this is this is this is the big end.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  There have been a lot of periods in history where there's big change happening and this is the big kahuna.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  This is the mother of all crises.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  This is the metamorphosis.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  This is the big test.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  This is it.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  The next 20, 30 years, if it even lasts that long.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And again, you're going to realize on the other side of eternity, the total completion and total satisfaction of timelessness, or you're going to experience separation from that.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  And you're going to know for the time period while you're being positioned for which portal you're going to go through.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  That's how it happens.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Atheists, government scientists, people that take the drugs and do the do the DMT test on the IV drip.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  So it's longer periods that they come back and they become Christians.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  They say, no, I saw hell.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  I saw heaven.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I saw portals.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  It's the Buddhists, the Hindus, the atheists.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  They all see the same thing.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  The guardian angel there.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  They can't see it's got the hand on the shoulder.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  People that are dead 10 minutes, they come back and you're either sent back for a reason.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  A lot of times people get to go see heaven and that total feeling of completion and just total satisfaction.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  I've been allowed to see it three times.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And what you take back is totally starts rewriting your brain and it tells you, okay, do you want this?
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  We're going to start the rewrite and you say, yes, I want it.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And then the process begins and it's a long process.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  But my brain is being rewritten right now.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  It's unbelievable.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And I just wish all of you could experience this.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  I know a lot of you are right now at this time because God's going to really turn the heat up on the devil right now.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  If you get lined up with God, you're going to get to experience it.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  You're going to start being absorbed into the next level dimension now while your body's still here.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  It's incredible.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  And then you get very sad for everybody else that you know is going to be cut off from that for eternity.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  You've got to try to save these people now.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  That's why it's more important than ever that Imphal Wars stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products at 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  And that means all of these amazing products.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.

[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  And I thank you.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  All right.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rugby star.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  When I grow up, I want to defeat the globalist.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this live Thursday, September 23rd transmission.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  I want to give the number out and I want to specifically take your phone calls on what do you make of China threatening to nuke?
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  I don't know if you've heard this yet.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  Threatening to nuke Australia.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  What do you make of the DARPA documents, the Pentagon documents being released for three years ago?
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Peter Dazik and Bill Gates' funded group with Fauci came to them and said,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  we want you to fund us spraying the open population in China with a virus that invades their body through nanotech.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  That's basically COVID-19.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  It's the exact same virus.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  What do you make of that?
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Do you agree with me that, clearly, the globalists did this in Wuhan so they could blame America or China or whoever they wanted,
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  but it's clear they're the ones that did it to bring in their UN-centered corporate governance, world government.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Because they don't want America to run the planet or their own country.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  They don't want China to run the planet or their own country.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  They just set China up when they were funding them and helping take over economically with all their slave labor.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  No, it's the UN, it's the corporate governance forcing the lockdowns, saying small businesses and individuals are not essential.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  It's their attack.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  But what do you make of these documents regardless that they created the virus and thousands of others and hundreds of other deadly coronaviruses,
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  some of them thousands of times more powerful?
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  What is your view of where this needs to go?
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Do you agree with me this is the biggest news of the 21st century in the last 21 years?
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  That the globalists in the UN made this, released it, used it to take over, used it to censor,
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  and are now using it to set up a global carbon tax and our own governments aren't saying anything about it or doing anything about it
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  other than DARPA putting this information out when the foyer came through that they did not have to release.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  And I'm not lionizing DARPA and the Pentagon, I'm saying they did release this and this should be highly classified.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  But they want it to be known they didn't do it.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  So what do you think about this?
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I really want to get your take 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, first time callers.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I want to talk to you about this, I want to get your take on it.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And in case you just tuned in, let me hit the articles we hit yesterday and today.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Who on scientists plan to release enhanced coronaviruses in the bat caves before COVID outbreak?
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  That's the Daily Mail.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Who on scientists plan to release coronavirus particles in the cave bats?
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Leak papers revealed.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  That's Peter Dasek, London Telegraph.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  Fauci funded lab viruses 10,000 times stronger than usual.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Here's the actual name and the federal register of the last virus they added to the other four viruses, which is the HIV delivery system.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  We've got all the documents on that.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And then here's the project operation DARPA from Peter Dasek and Bill Gates talking about the gain of function.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Here's zero hedge on it. Who on scientists plan to release chimeric COVID spike proteins in the bat populations using skin penetrating nanoparticles.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Here's the DC sign from Wikipedia that they list in the Wuhan document as being the delivery system.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  It's rolling HIV insertion into the cells that are then taken by white blood cells to the lymph nodes so that it can kill all of your.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Team emphasize that our trainers of the killer tease.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Might want to read that for yourself.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And of course, the vaccine does the same thing as the virus because it makes your body create the spike protein that's the delivery that actually makes the body do this.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And that is.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  The DC sign protein that also ends up packing your testicles, your uterus and everything else.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  There it all is pretty unbelievable.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  There's another headline, Wuhan lab leak scientists plan to release souped up coronavirus in the bat cave before COVID outbreak.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  So total vindication but oh here's CNN with an article a few days ago.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  These four words are helping spread vaccine misinformation to your own research even the New York Times says do not ask questions.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Says reading too much is bad. Yes, especially it would see classified documents don't want to read those.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Just act like you're intellectual act like you're smart and just say that she's 100% effective never hurt anybody and no FDA scientists have resigned even though they have.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  I mean it's just incredible the line from these people but they're given talking points and paid to do it.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And that's how they operate but here's the actual document.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  This is a synopsis the actual document several thousand pages long a proposal volume one from three years ago.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And describes COVID-19 how to make it all the things to do the thousands of other viruses they've made all from eco health alliance a front group of Bill Gates and Fauci on record.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Remember they lie to Congress and said no such things going on.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Here's just the smoking guns on top of smoking guns.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  Again it's the equivalent of somebody calls the police and says I saw a man kill his wife with a hammer in their backyard in broad daylight and sticker in the shed.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And the police come and say hey can we speak to your wife no she's gone to the store.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Well mind if we take a look in your backyard no don't take a look in your backyard they see scratches on his chest they say they have reasonable suspicion probable cause they go ahead and push through put him in handcuffs go to the shed and she's dead with her brain speed out.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  You got a witness and saw it happen you got the dead body.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  This is worse than that it'd be like if he video taped it and talked about I'm going to kill my wife with a hammer when she gets home and I'm going to kill her and stuff her in the shed.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  It'd be like having a video he shot that he's proud of it and then he called the police himself and turned himself in.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  I mean it's just ridiculous.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Dolphine number to join us 877-789-2539 I want your take on all this. Meanwhile they've got the total police state takeover in the name of it.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Australia deploys counterterrorism squads with tanks against lockdown protest against running over people with cars and beating their heads open with clubs giving people subdermal hematomas and putting them into comas.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  While FBI's domestic terrorism task force here says questioning lockdowns as terrorism cases have more than doubled since May because they wildly expand the definition of domestic terrorism as any crime committed by a white person.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  I mean you talk about crazy town this is it.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  It's just a loot total complete crazy town so now that they're the police are attacking the crowds of people want to just go outside and walk across the state line to visit their family they're now running them over with cars beating women and children.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  I mean this is just all a giant orgy of evil.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  All run by Klaus Schwab in the UN as a beta test to show the world this to the whole rest of the world gets ready for these same actions which are already going on all over Europe and the UK and Canada.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And the police slam people the ground around to hurt them as bad as they can.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  We're daring to be outside and exercising free speech.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  All right, let's continue a Biden admin looking to house Haitians at Gitmo that's just a thing to make you think they're housing and they're releasing 80 plus percent of them.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  That's all BS Haitian migrants being released in the US on very large scale despite Biden's vow to send them back home report info wars.com from our team.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  The Haitians in question dropping their Chilean Brazilian other invocation at the border. This is systematic plan purposeful.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  We must secure our border now and Texas is unfortunately likely to have to do what the feds tyrannically refuse to do.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  You now have the Haitians hijacking buses and stealing them.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  That's mainstream news out of the Texas news Haitian migrants in custody of hijacked multiple buses.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Many migrants from border camps staying in the US. There's AP is AP.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And we told you they always do the same stuff. It's all there. We're going to be going over all of that.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  And I haven't even hit the other COVID news or Biden saying white people disappearing is a good thing.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  White's are inherently bad. We have the video of that.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  And then a CEO of Moderna says even young will need to take vaccine booster shots indefinitely.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Oh, the corporate head says so. Well, my God, he doesn't have a conflict of interest. Let me just do what the head of Moderna says.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Like Trump said, Moderna runs everything with Bill Gates worldwide now. They're just the boss.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Oh, drug companies run your life. That's all coming up.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  But first your phone calls from Liam, David, Ron, Jeff, Megan and David.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  And then after I take these calls, I'm going to wipe the final phone lines open and take calls from folks in Australia.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  And we got a big filmmaker joining us next hour.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  It's going to premiere some exclusive footage from the new film that now on preorder at infowarstore.com.

[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  On the Wall of Fire dot com.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns, they release the viruses,
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  they think you're stupid, and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  word for word with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  We cover it live weekdays 11am to 3pm at infowar's dot com four slash show.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Christ said my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  That's the only way that globalists can win this fight against humanity
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  and bring in this new dark age of tyranny is if the people don't know the truth.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  Now, my film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement has been out for 14 years
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  and I'm selling more of the film to Deity than I did back when it came out
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  because it shows the globalist plan for what we're currently seeing happen.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Well, guess what? You can get a copy of this film
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  and make all the copies you want to share it at infowarstore.com
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  for free when you order a new film we produced that's extremely important,
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  just like Endgame is, and that is COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  That's how we expose the globalist agenda is with the truth.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  So get your copy of COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown, part of a five-part,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  many series coming out of the next six months or over the next six months
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  and you can get a free copy of Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement with it.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  So both films, 1995, infowarstore.com.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Everybody grew up learning what tyranny looked like in history
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  and hypothetically in books like 1984.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  And now we see what's happening in the world.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  It's like governments are using 1984 meets Brave New World
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  as their blueprint for what they want to do.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  But, you know, they say all over the news that,
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  oh, we've always had forced inoculations in this country,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  and that's not true.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  If you go back about 125 years ago,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  there was some forced smallpox injection of black people
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  and then in the 20s under eugenics, poor blacks and poor whites
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  were both sterilized forcibly
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  and given experimental vaccines that killed a bunch of people
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  and then there were big revolts over it,
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  then the Supreme Court ruled that previous rulings were unconstitutional.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  But I just got given something that I actually knew about
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  and I was surprised I hadn't done a piece on it
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  that blew me away out of the New York Times from 1897
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  that we're going to cover in the last segment of this hour.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  But I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  And that is the new Project Veritas video
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  they dropped last night and more today
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  of high-level FDA regulators that look like 20-year-old kids
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  that, you know, have the effeminate thing
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  that the ruling class does now.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  And they sit there and talk about how they're going to blow dart
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  all the minorities and go door-to-door and jam needles
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  in the black people because they won't take their shot.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  And they go on to say mRNA is 100% safe, which it's not.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  They just lie and they giggle and laugh.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  It was like 30 minutes of it.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  I watched the whole thing last night. It was nauseating.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  There's actually a plan to go door-to-door
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  and make black people take the shots.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  So I'm going to be covering that.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Not just from this video, it turns out,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  it's right here in my hands with the New York Times
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  and they're proposing this again.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  And if all this seems next level, that's what tyranny is like.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  You just attacks you and does all these horrible things
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  and you can't believe what's happening because
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  you never lived under this before.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  But now you are.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  It's like most victims of crime, never been mugged,
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  never been robbed, never been raped.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  And when it starts happening, all people just can't believe
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  what's happening because it never happened before.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Well, it is happening.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  And if you just give into it, you'll be called a slave.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  I'm not giving into it.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  And one thing, if you were just a slave in the system
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  and do what it said, this thing wants your children's souls,
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  it wants their bodies, it wants control of your mind,
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  it wants to poison you.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  It wants to make you a living example of its power.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  It wants to make you a zombie, the undead.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And so I'm not going to be part of it.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  I know you aren't either, but this is the big epic fight.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  It's on now, folks.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  The monsters in the room, they flip the switch.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  It's on.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  All right, Seth, David, Tim, Ron, Conrad, Jack.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Caller's calling in from all over the place.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  David's calling first, replaced super lockdown.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Iceland, the place I always wanted to go,
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  but I guess you can't really get there now unless you want to be under living hell.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  David from Iceland, you're on the air.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Hey, how are you?
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Well, I mean, I'm here on air still desperately,
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  but watching civilization be swallowed up by the post-industrial world.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Yeah, you know, okay, for the record, we're not in lockdown in Iceland.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  We never got a lockdown.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  They didn't have to.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  We got 90, over 90% vaccinated rates among people.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  12, 12 to 16 year olds, we are 70% vaccinated.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  And like they update our hospital information every day.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  So right now we got 24 people in the hospital vaccinated and 12 that are unvaccinated.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  But what would they call unvaccinated are people who've only had one shot.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  So let me ask, I mean, you called in about something,
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  and I want to hear what you have to say, but I have a few questions.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Are people ready for their monthly booster shot or every two months
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  that actually does nothing for the study show other than destroy your white blood cells?
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  Well, you know, Alex, we, we did a big push of the the answer that the Johnson and Johnson shot.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And when they realized it doesn't work, people lined up and took their their Pfizer on top of it.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Yeah, so they're just going to, I mean, if it was five shots a day, they do.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  That's what you're saying.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  More than ready for it.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  And that leads me to my point, you know, I think for the most part, you keep saying,
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  oh, you know, there's a there's a peaceful way out of this.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  I don't think so.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  I think people are too stupid.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  And the few of us that aren't, we are, we are minority.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  And I think the only way out of this is violence because non violence is we're outnumbered with way, way too much just by the general population.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Well, I'll say this, trying to make people take the shots and violate the Nuremberg code is a serious military attack through the health system.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  And the police running over people with cars and splitting skulls of people that dare walk on the street at even broad daylight is beyond North Korea.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And we're we're watching every free country on Earth just fall right now.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  I mean, let that sink in.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  You've got to take an experimental shot or you can't get on an airplane.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  They're really trying to do that.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  And I mean, I think I saw one I've seen got some of the most draconian rules about can't come there unless you've had all the injections.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  And again, they don't even protect you, which it's all just a fraud.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  It's so incredible.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  That's it.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And I mean, you unified non compliances.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Sure, it's a solution, but it's not a viable one because there's not enough people unified where we're not unified.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  There's no unification to not comply.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  You know, and that's that's just a dream.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  It's a it's a smoke dream.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Like, I hear your brother, the never ending vaccines, they've now announced it's never going to stop.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  They've announced the head of Pfizer, the head of health minister in Australia, the head German minister.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  They said, this never ends.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  You never go out.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  You always wear masks.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  The shots never stop.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And they just laugh and the she'd go, I'll take more shots then I'll take more shots.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  And we're going to take your baby away from your man and force him inoculate.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  You're not allowed to be on the street in Australia.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  And these people are sick, sick authoritarians.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Let's let's roll the video of the man who's been pepper sprayed beaten his head rammed in and skull split by the police.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Here he is begging for mercy while they enjoy themselves.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  And let's show the woman having her child taken away from her.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  A woman dared come out in broad daylight.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  These people are so evil.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  They should be sent to a gulag.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  They're building them.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  They're calling it shielding in place of the healthy are going to be sent to camps.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  Here it is.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  It goes on.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  They grab her away, grab him away and take him away to the dungeon.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Here they go.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  Grabbing the child.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  How dare you be outside.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Now they're tugging the little boy away, ripping at him.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  They're the good guys.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  They follow their orders.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  They'll find people that follow orders and they'll take over our society.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  The exact traces are coming.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Into the van, lady.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  You don't walk on the street without a masking slave.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Of course, the cops don't have to wear their mask.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  The Emmys and Grammys don't have to wear theirs.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  The Oscars.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  But you do.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  You want to see evil folks.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  This is it.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  Australia's fallen.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Look how they enjoy it.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Those cops have got God to deal with.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I really feel sorry for their souls.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  They've got that satanic look on them.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  They're enjoying the power.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  They're on the winning team.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  They'll all be dead from cancer soon as well.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Stay with us.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going into a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  It hurts.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  It stinks.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I go to the doctor.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  They fix it.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  That's not negative.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  That's not living in denial.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  And so, yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  They stole the election.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  We can't get down about that.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  They're scared.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Look what happened.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  We're trying to suppress us, let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  We're going to win this together in the Fight Starts at infowars.com.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  We're in an information war and the globalists are counting on the people being ignorant.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  That's why they're engaged in so much censorship because the truth is the antidote to their lies,
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  to their hysteria, to their fear, to the controlled bio weapon they released,
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  and now the so-called vaccine that produces that same bio weapon inside the body.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  COVID land the lockdown is part one in a five-parts miniseries.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  It is a very powerful film.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  I'm very, very proud of this film.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  A highly respected director made the film.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  It's got over-the-top guests and experts on it, like Robert Kennedy, Junior, and Dr. Sherry Timpinning,
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  myself and just so many others. I'm very proud to produce this film.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  It's available right now at infowarsstore.com for $19.95.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  It starts shipping in early October.

[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  on how they built up to this takeover.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Here's infowarsstore.com.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  The great awakening is here.

[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  It's just incredible.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  And now the world is waking up that info wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on air.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  And I thank you all for your support, your prayers, and your word of mouth.

[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  Please take action.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  All the big giant scandals and deaths and illnesses and autoimmune diseases and cancer that previous contaminated vaccines had caused.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  I'd love to have clean vaccines at work, but they don't want to give us those.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  That's why the life expectancy of the average American's gone way, way down even before COVID came along.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  Now our life expectancy has gone down by another two years because they're killing us.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  And the more injections we take, the more COVID cases we have.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  I want to go back to your calls.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  I want to show TV viewers this photo.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  There's a bunch of these.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  But the board of patrol that's going in the water and saving kids out of it and stuff and what's really going on.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Versus when full grown men are running illegally into the U.S.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  and are not being stopped so they can see what's in their bags.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  Then they're calling them white supremacists whipping them with bullwhips like it's Jango.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  That's all Hollywood crap.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  If you try to go illegally to Mexico, they'll throw your ass in prison in a dirt floor cell.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  People are coming here because they know we're a more open free society.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  But you wonder why Europe would take 15 million Islamics into it in the last 10 years
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  and throw people out of their own section 8 housing old people to put them in.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  It's because they call them racists and they didn't accept them.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  And again, they bring in these foreign groups to be client groups they control.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Here it is official.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Many migrants, migrants, three legal aliens from border camps staying in U.S.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  and more will come.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  And again, the same globalist cut the economy off all over the world to make them come here.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And then they brag about it.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  This is a plan.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  This is an operation.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  This is what's going on.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  So most of the world isn't white.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  You want to invade a country that's already minority white but has some basic freedoms and bankrupted.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Well, no one that's white is allowed to enforce anything on somebody that's not.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  And so you totally collapse while the Haitians are hijacking buses.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  It's all a very desperate situation.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  Pentagon.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  We're aware of reports of Afghan refugees in U.S. facing food clothing shortages and raping women.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  But that's okay because they're brown.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Okay, the Chinese run giant slave camps with millions of Muslims and Christians and Buddhists on them.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Because again, they're Chinese.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  They're not white people.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  It's okay.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  If China and Nuxus were a white double country, we deserve it.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Look at this.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Reveal.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Dazik admits Fauci funded Chinese coronavirus research at conference featuring Hunter Biden linked pandemic group.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Hunter Biden was involved in all this too.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  I mean, all the big guys were involved in the bio weapon.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  That was 2017 admitting gain of function.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  They lied to Congress, but nothing's done.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And again, I'm going to go to this caller Conrad from Chicago wants to talk about solutions to the whole COVID takeover.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  And I'm going to hear what he has to say.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  I want to hear it, but you know what it is.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Why is them cooking this up and releasing the biggest story ever?
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Because they did it and they're not going to stop.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  They're going to release more and they're using it to take over.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  You arrest Fauci.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  You expose Dazik.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  You expose Gates.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  The whole house of cards comes down and it comes out how they did this to take over.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  And so their whole system is falls apart.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  You try to fight it with the ignorant public about the shots not working or lowering your immune system or killer T's and T lymphocytes and nano lipids.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  Might as well be talking Martian to them, but it comes out and we arrest the people in charge of it and roll the whole thing up.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Got a real shot at a lot better, peaceful future.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  If not, it's just hoping this is their takeover plan.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  This is everything.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  The lockdown caused the collapse of the third world caused the giant migrant surges.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Just like the Syrian war and the whole Arab Spring caused all the tens of millions to flood Europe.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  The globalists know what they're doing.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  They admit it and they've got blueprints and war games and we're sitting here watching and saying we need to wake up with their plan and get our leaders that aren't part of it to say no, but they don't do that.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  Oh, Biden's an idiot.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  That's why Afghanistan fell.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Biden's an idiot.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  That's why the borders got hundreds of thousands crossing every couple of weeks.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  No, he announced it.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  He did it.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  He put NGOs in to run it to bring in the majority of the country.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  It's a program.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  It's an operation.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Well, Biden's just inept.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  We should have had another president.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  He was put in there to be the front man.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  The people behind him aren't inept.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  They're damn evil.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  They're destroying us to build their new world order.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Conrad in Chicago, what do you think the solutions are?
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Yeah, so as I was saying, and as you agree that we're at war right now, so we're under attack.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  And the goal is to eliminate these people without making them martyrs.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Correct?
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  So there is a move to put together a bounty cryptocurrency.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  So it removes the risk for those that.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Oh, come on, sir.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  No, no, we're not.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  We're not.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  I'm not discussing on the show.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Cryptocurrency bounties on globalists.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Come on.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Oh, well, that's that.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  That is the solution because if you're under attack right now, you think that you can go
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  through the judicial system to actually get anything done.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  That would be naive to say the least.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Let me put you on hold.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  I want to say something right now.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Well, then, well, then everybody's going to lose society and lose our children and we're
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  going to collapse.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  They're going to win.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  You can't just go hang them and say they committed suicide or throw them off a building and say
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  they committed suicide or give them a drug and say they had a heart attack.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  They have their minions.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  They have their operation in place.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  We either expose them to the point and have grand juries and die them and others and then
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  start the dominoes going down for the whole thing to come out.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  If you just kill them, they'll turn into martyrs or they just die mysteriously or disappear
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  like Jimmy Hoffa.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Then we don't stop the whole network.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  They've got their people under them like shark teeth.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  One group of teeth gets pulled out, more roll forward.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  Yeah, I mean, I thought.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Through that and then seeing what happened during the election, the Supreme Court failing
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  miserably, all hope in the current judicial system is not where our hope should lie.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Jesus Christ, of course, but the fact is that.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I'll say this and I don't want this to happen.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Guys, listen, and people out there that want to do stuff like this.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  You know, what if a thousand people decided to be like the unabomber and go out and start
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  killing all the globalist?
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I'm not saying do that because it'll accelerate their timetable.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  They'll release a more deadly bio weapon at that point.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  We've got to have the public wake up so much to who they are and how they did it toward just
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  everyone wakes up and removes their support for the big corporations and the power structure.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  And then they won't be able to release the more deadly bio weapon because they know we'll get
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  organized and that they'll fail.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  They need us organized under their control to stay under lockdown when more deadly viruses are
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  released that will actually kill the majority of us.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  I said this 20 years ago.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  I said it 10 years ago.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  I said it a year ago because I really said this.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  I looked at every angle.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  If the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, the royalty that people all got killed tomorrow, their
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  operatives under them are going to release the doomsday virus and then it's all on.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Okay.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  And then everything falls apart at that point.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  And if we have a giant awakening, it means you want to go ahead and finish your point, Conrad.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Yeah, no, it's a parallel judicial system.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  It's not just vigil, vigilante justice.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  I'm talking about here.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  It is what people are proposing.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Bookline and sticker.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  It needs to be a parallel system or a complete reset, but I want to bet you all the tea in
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  India that the people proposing this on the quote dark web or whatever or FBI agents.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  Yeah, no, no, no, they're not.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  I'm not working with anybody.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  So, I mean, that's, that's not the, that's the thing.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Okay.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  The last point is using the no lie MRI technology, which is the highest form of accurate deceptive
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  lie detection out there right now.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  So I gotta go.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  I gotta go.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Listen, listen, I've really been honest about where I stand and where all this is going.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  And I'm out here boldly exposing and telling you they've cooked it up, telling you they
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  released it, telling you they had nano systems.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  And now it's all confirmed.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And we have to look changing.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  This is an inside job.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  We have to change our hearts and our minds, withdraw our support from the system, speak
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  out and warn everybody we can and let them know what's coming next.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  And that's how we're going to beat this.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  They're probably going to blow up a vaccine factory and blame it on us or go in and shoot
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  up doctors or whatever it's some, you know, chain store that's giving shots.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff they're going to do to then say, oh my God, everybody's
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  a terrorist that's against us.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  They're already saying that.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  That's all pre-programmed that we're going to do this because they know the logical thing.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  People figure this out.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Their loved ones die is to want to go kill whoever did it.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  And I'm just saying you got to be more Christ like in this whole approach because that they're
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  set up and ready for that.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  I mean, if there was just one globalist kingpin that was running all this, you could stop
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  it that way.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  You can't do that.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's an ideological thing.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  They made this move because they think we're weak.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  We've got to become strong again and rebuke them and expose them.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  Then they'll have no power.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Sunshine.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  I'm 59 years old in good health.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  I'm not working in the front line.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  So my time is not recommended to get vaccinated.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview saying,
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called mRNA vaccine that's really a gene therapy.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  He said, you know, he's 57 years old.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  He's healthy.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  He doesn't need it.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  It's at risk people, but that's not what is PR firms that have bought off the politicians
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  over 100 countries say.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  They say you've got to take it to have a job or leave your house or get on a plane or
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day to live in Australia.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  So remember, the White House is exempt.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Congress and their staff are exempt.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  The Postal Service is exempt.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  All these big corporate heads are exempt.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  They're not taking their poison vaccine.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  They're pushing it on you.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Wake up, folks.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Wake up.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  Christ said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  That's the only way the globalists can win this fight against humanity and bring in this
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  new dark age of tyranny is if the people don't know the truth.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  Now, my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement has been out for 14 years.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  And I'm selling more of the film today than I did back when it came out because it shows
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  the globalist plan for what we're currently seeing happen.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  We're going to get a copy of this film and make all the copies you want to share at infowarstore.com
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  for free when you order a new film we produced that's extremely important, just like in-game
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  is, and that is COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  That's how we expose the globalists to Chendik is with the truth.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  So get your copy of COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown, part of a five-part mini-series
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  coming out over the next six months, and you can get a free copy of in-game blueprint
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  for global enslavement with it.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  So both films, 9 to 95, infowarstore.com.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  When do chakras align with the endocrine system?
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  of the soul.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  dimensions of reality.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  free, and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  Get them both today
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  and
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  test it.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.520]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.720]  I'm going to say this again real slow for everybody.
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:23.720]  I don't care if you're an auto mechanic.
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:25.640]  I don't care if you're an airplane.
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:28.320]  Stewardess.
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:31.280]  I don't care if you're black or white.
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:32.320]  I don't care where you live.
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:34.880]  The decision has been made to depopulate.
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:40.400]  And the people that are doing it have said they are and they said
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:43.720]  they're going to do it with a virus scare, then clamp down so
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:45.760]  they can then carry out the real depopulation.
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:48.520]  So all these people submitting and thinking they're going to get
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:49.280]  back to normal.
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:50.800]  Notice it never went back to normal.
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:51.560]  It's a trap.
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:56.600]  And I understand why the general public cannot admit this to themselves.
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:47:58.880]  It's too frightening.
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:02.040]  And remember 15 days of flat in the curve and now here we are almost two years
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:05.200]  later and it's much worse and there's more death and more sickness because
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:06.800]  that's the cover for their attack.
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.680]  And so, you know, it won't matter soon anyway.
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:14.360]  So just record this and remember it and then give it to your friends and
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:18.880]  family so that when half the world population is dead, I don't know,
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:21.480]  it's going to be a year, five years, 10 years, but that's the plan.
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:23.520]  Maybe then people will listen.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:28.240]  I mean, I've really tried hard here and you'll build gates.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:29.640]  You know, Bill Gates said he would kill you.
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:30.360]  You know what?
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:33.360]  Before I go back to calls, let's play that short bill gates clip.
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:35.480]  Paul Watson did a whole video on the show yesterday.
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.760]  I never had time to get to it, but it's on Band-Aid video.
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.560]  But this is Australian TV just playing the clip of Bill Gates.
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:45.280]  And they say, well, what about you and Jeffrey Epstein?
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:48.640]  You know, flowing his airplane a bunch, live with him for a while, stayed
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:51.720]  with him in his house in Paris, London, New York, lied to the news,
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:54.640]  said he never did, gave him millions and millions of dollars.
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:57.160]  For all they're, you know, taking over in blackmailing scientists.
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:48:58.320]  So Bill Gates would control him.
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:00.600]  I mean, he worked for Bill Gates, basically, and others.
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:02.560]  And then Gates just said, well, he's dead.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.400]  Bill Gates, an awkward interview about Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:10.640]  So there's Watson's full report, but here's just a short clip of Gates
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:12.040]  just saying, hey, he's dead.
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:13.320]  I mean, basically saying we killed him.
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:13.800]  Here it is.
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.360]  Bill Gates gave a really weird interview today where he was asked
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:19.360]  about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:22.360]  I'll let him dig down from here.
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:27.960]  Is there a lesson for you, for anyone else looking, looking at this?
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:29.280]  Well, he's dead.
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:33.480]  So, you know, in general, you always have to be careful.
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:39.920]  You always have to be careful when you run a giant scientific
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:42.120]  blackmail rings, the kidnap children.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.560]  So just remember when it seems dark and it seems horrible.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:48.880]  That's one of their main kingpins.
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:51.800]  Even gets hin-packed on his own programs because they've told Gates,
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:54.440]  who's a high-level member of it, and for a while was the quarterback.
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:59.000]  They've said, go away, stop, stop it, and he won't go away.
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:02.480]  And so now they're telling him, go away, go away.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.080]  You're hurting us, but he won't go away.
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:09.040]  So, you know, there's a lot of competition with these guys.
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.560]  They all went like, it's a shark feeding frenzy to kill us and disease us
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:14.600]  and make money off us while they kill us.
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:17.520]  They have nothing but just, you know, they're just, you know,
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:20.480]  they have nothing but just, you know, there he is with another
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:23.360]  now-convicted pedo.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:28.640]  So TV viewers get to look at Bill Gates and all those little buddies.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.440]  I mean, these are just pathetic, monstrous men who suck the energy out
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:35.800]  of children or vampires, psychic vampires.
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:38.360]  OK, who's up next here?
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:42.080]  Let's go ahead and go to Nadia in North Carolina.
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.480]  Nadia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:48.200]  Yes. The reason why I'm calling is about Remdesivir.
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:52.760]  The people are afraid they think it's so deadly to get this COVID
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:56.320]  because when they go into the hospital, they start giving them Remdesivir.
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:50:58.240]  If they could, if they're on it.
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:02.720]  Yeah, Remdesivir turns your kidneys and your lungs off and kills you. Absolutely.
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:05.920]  My sister was in the hospital and I kept calling and calling
[1:51:05.920 --> 1:51:09.880]  and they were like very nasty to me, but I just kept doing it.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:14.040]  Oh, that's part of the plan is to lock you out so they can carry out the operation.
[1:51:14.040 --> 1:51:16.240]  The extermination.
[1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:19.320]  She's handicapped, you know, she couldn't really speak for herself.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:23.840]  And so I just said, check my sister's kidneys, get her off the Remdesivir.
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:28.280]  And I did that over and over again in three days after she was removed.
[1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:33.400]  They took her off the Remdesivir at Advent Health in Altamont Springs, Florida.
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:37.680]  And when they took her off of it in three days, she was out of ICU.
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:40.560]  And I'm hearing this all over.
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:45.960]  Oh, yeah. And then they try to block Regeneron, that is basically a miracle drug.
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:48.840]  Absolutely. Block the real thing that works, give me the poison.
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:49.920]  And who said do that?
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:54.480]  The little hit man whose name means the Grim Reaper in Italian, Fauci.
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:59.600]  Yep. And I had COVID as early as August of 2019.
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:02.240]  And I just used natural remedies and I got rid of it.
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:07.240]  You know, it was around years before that they've been releasing these for a while.
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:10.280]  And what do you make? That's what I get. I'm glad you called it.
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:11.480]  What do you make of?
[1:52:11.480 --> 1:52:12.880]  There's nobody's responded to this.
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:15.440]  So all the documents coming out that they indeed cooked it up,
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:19.480]  wanted to release it on the Chinese public, that it was COVID-19,
[1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:21.960]  specifically made by Fauci and Bill Gates.
[1:52:21.960 --> 1:52:24.160]  What do you make of that? Huge news coming up.
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:28.160]  14. I read something in 2014 in the NASA documents
[1:52:28.160 --> 1:52:33.760]  that they were planning on this to hit the elderly, to take out the elderly.
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:34.280]  That's right.
[1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:37.880]  They've been talking about getting rid of people for a long, long time.
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:39.520]  And they're our saviors.
[1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:40.240]  I appreciate your call.
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:42.600]  The guy that released it on us, the guy that made it,
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:46.600]  he's now tells us what we're allowed to hear and see on the Internet and on TV.
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:47.560]  He's our boss.
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:49.200]  Of course, you're the big mega banks.
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:50.960]  You're about to carry out this extermination.
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:52.920]  The guy quarterbacking you up is the expert.
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:55.800]  He's the savior. Too evil to fail.
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.960]  The irony is just incredible.
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:01.920]  So I guess we'll all just slowly keep getting new variants and new shots
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:05.680]  and the only way we're going to do this is we'll all die because we can't say no.
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:06.640]  We have to submit.
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:09.080]  We love to submit to little demonic men.
[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:11.120]  We love it. We enjoy it so much.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:12.800]  It's so liberal.
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:14.720]  Tim in Missouri, thanks for calling.
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:18.240]  Hi, Alex.
[1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:19.240]  Welcome.
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:21.560]  Oh, I got a lot.
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:23.760]  So I want to say thank you to begin with second ball.
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:27.480]  I'm a truck driver, so I've been traveling Ohio, Texas since this thing started.
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:30.040]  Two things.
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:35.520]  Have you looked into the patents for the coronavirus COVID-19 specifically?
[1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:37.800]  Yes, I have. Yep.
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:42.520]  So, you know, the World Health Organization holds all the patents on any research
[1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:48.440]  into the origins that hold all the patents into any research on a cure
[1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:51.320]  on vaccines on anything.
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:53.960]  Yes, it's a giant UN World Government tax.
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:55.520]  It's the COVID tax.
[1:53:55.520 --> 1:53:57.760]  OK, so China does the same thing.
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:01.640]  China has their own patents on the COVID-19 virus.
[1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:04.440]  And there was a video about 18 months ago.
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:06.680]  And I'm digging through my phone, trying to find it.
[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:11.000]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the CDC holds patents and makes money off of it.
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:13.080]  And then Fauci and Gates get part of the money.
[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:14.920]  But there's no conflict of interest.
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:20.120]  We have CEO Moderna says even young will need to take vaccine booster shots indefinitely.
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:21.320]  So now it's official.
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:22.480]  It doesn't protect you.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:26.840]  It erases your immune system, hurts you and is indefinite from the companies that make money.
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:28.360]  Total conflict of interest.
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:35.640]  Right. So Fauci, Gates and what's his name?
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:39.240]  The Philip guy, Barracks or Daschek.
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:41.640]  Their names are all over those patents.
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:42.280]  Of course they are.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:43.120]  Here's the thing.
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:50.560]  The video that was out that I can't find, it was a UK patent doctor or patent scientist
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:55.600]  and another female scientist that was on there talking about the injection that they were going to put out.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:03.160]  So this guy said, okay, if it's a naturally occurring virus, it's illegal in the patent
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:07.440]  office to hold a patent on it if it's natural, because you can't patent something natural.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:15.200]  So if it's engineered in a lab, it's considered a bio weapon, which is also illegal to patent.
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:19.680]  So either way, the patents are illegal on both sides from the who and the CDNP.
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:20.320]  Absolutely.
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.880]  Absolutely, but the FBI at the top and the federal judges are coddled snot nose rats.
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:32.000]  And so they would literally, the average FBI agent at the top would put gasoline on
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.200]  their daughter and let them on fire.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:37.600]  I've told to just like these Australian police are and so the shield's gone.
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:39.160]  We kill our babies.
[1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:40.160]  We kill our old people.
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:44.440]  And we're just, I mean, if we don't have a total repent, you know, repent to God and stop this.
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:46.240]  It's all over.
[1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:49.040]  I just want to ask everybody in the government, I'm not their enemies.
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:52.560]  I don't want to have some war with our hijacked government, but you guys are run
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:58.080]  by the most psychotic killers on earth and they have a green light, a free hand to just
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:55:58.960]  do all this to us.
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:04.360]  So I mean, okay, I guess we just are all so afraid of saying no and having to push back.
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:05.640]  We're all going to die instead.
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:09.160]  I was crazy as you lose everything by not standing up.
[1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:12.280]  They should be scared of not standing up, but they just can't do it.
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:13.280]  It's a spiritual thing.
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:18.000]  I've been, I've been screaming from the rooftops since the first day they started this
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:19.040]  two week lockdown.
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:21.200]  My wife couldn't understand while I was so upset.
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.360]  And I was like, they're going to try and exterminate us.
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:28.880]  This is not, you know, I told people that I told everybody, even some of my family
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:31.440]  are smart and they're like, oh, come on, it's not going to be, and I'm like, it's over.
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:32.400]  This is the takeover.
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:33.120]  Here's the documents.
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:33.800]  Exactly.
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:34.560]  I appreciate your call.
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:36.520]  And again, it's that people are good.
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:38.000]  Your family are nice people, I'm sure.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.160]  And they just, they're like, why would you want to do this?
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:41.480]  Well, because you're not a psychotic killer.
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:42.000]  That's why.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:44.120]  And so they better wake up.
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:46.440]  The next round is going to kill so many people.
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:47.600]  They're going to blame the unvaccinated.
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:48.280]  It's going to be hellish.
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:51.960]  I personally am boosting my immune system and everything I can, drinking more
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:56.040]  water, getting more sunlight, eating healthier foods and taking X2, deep
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:58.520]  breath, crystal iodine is one of the biggest missing links.
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:01.120]  One of the biggest elements that you've got to have.
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:02.800]  It's essential that people are deficient in.
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:04.360]  We have the best you're going to find anywhere.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:08.200]  X2, deep breath, crystal iodine, discounted in fullwarestore.com.

[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:34.600]  bowl on lobby, one women's shirt.
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:37.240]  I think it's the best looking shirt out there infowarstore.com.
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:42.160]  All it cost will be right back with more your calls and a special guest as well.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.440]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:51.440]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:55.800]  concentration camp in World War two that when they came for one group, he wasn't
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:57:56.440]  part of that group.
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:57.440]  So he didn't stand up.
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:00.040]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:00.800]  So he didn't stand up.
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:05.240]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:08.680]  Well, the global social credit score that China is putting in, it's banning people
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:10.160]  to three hours of video games a week.
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:13.400]  And if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:16.600]  Well, that's, that's being brought here and all over the world under the
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:19.320]  guise of COVID vaccine passports.
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:20.080]  They even admit it.
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:22.920]  Now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.200]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:26.880]  and what you can do.
[1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:28.720]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:29.840]  You'll accept that.
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:30.680]  You'll accept anything.
[1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:34.880]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and
[1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:38.080]  tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure, but they're all
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:40.280]  going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[1:58:40.280 --> 1:58:43.440]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will
[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:46.280]  be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalist.
[1:58:48.680 --> 1:58:54.600]  Globalist General Milley has revealed to the world that the United States is
[1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:58.800]  not a free republic, but it's run by a permanent state by network bureaucracy.
[1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:02.000]  The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.120]  He felt that he was safe to talk of an overseas phone line system that he
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:10.920]  knew was being watched by not just our government, the Five Eyes, the Russians
[1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:12.280]  and the Chinese.
[1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:16.000]  He wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.400]  was backed by the deep state.
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:20.400]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy.
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:22.360]  It sees the American people as its enemy.
[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:26.840]  It sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the Communist
[1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:31.040]  Chinese to threaten them basically and say, Trump may nuke you, but if he
[1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:34.840]  tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:38.960]  That's beyond treason, but it shows the type of anti-American sycophants
[1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:40.520]  living in their own fetid bubble.
[1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:41.880]  They try to get away with this.
[1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:45.760]  Milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life.
[1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:53.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:58.440]  All right, we got a special guest joining us and then I just got that audio.
[1:59:58.440 --> 1:59:58.960]  Thank you.
[1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:01.640]  Yeah, whenever I, whenever, I'm just going to give a cue to the guys there
[2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:02.600]  because they do a great job.
[2:00:02.600 --> 2:00:05.280]  Whenever I come in hot, you know, we're going to get rid of the bumper music.
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:10.040]  I've made that decision to just have kind of intros like that because we don't need it.
[2:00:11.960 --> 2:00:14.600]  And so if I jump the gun and scream, I'm going to jump the gun and
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.240]  I'm going to jump the gun and I'm going to jump the gun and I'm going to jump the gun.
[2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:21.960]  I'm going to jump the gun and I'm going to jump the gun and I'm going to jump the gun.
[2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:25.000]  So if I jump the gun and start talking over the music, just kill it.
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:31.480]  If there's a lot of coming up, you know, I'm already pretty mad right now.
[2:00:32.200 --> 2:00:39.080]  Now I need to take a break for a second because I'm not going to sit here and
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:40.680]  just watch these people murder us anymore.
[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:42.680]  Can we put an article up from info wars.com?
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:46.280]  It's a top story on info wars.com.
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:48.280]  It's about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.
[2:00:48.280 --> 2:00:54.280]  And it says right there, something really important here, I'll just show you off my phone.
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:58.280]  Facebook blocks Aussie orange vest from live streaming protest.
[2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:02.280]  I mean, you see, that's the final martial law, not what you communicate,
[2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:08.280]  not let the Tiananmen Square events that are happening where they've killed people in Australia,
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:12.280]  beating them, running them over the cars, attacking them, splitting their heads open.
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:16.280]  And then Big Tech doesn't just block Senator Rand Paul when he talks about natural immunity being better,
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:18.280]  which is a fact.
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:24.280]  They now block the Tiananmen Square level stuff going on because now they're going to get outright violence or kill in the Aussies.
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:28.280]  And you know what, when the Aussies kill them, they're going to say it's terrorism.
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.280]  They've already said it's terrorism to protest and they're going to treat you like terrorists.
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.280]  Well, you're the terrorist.
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:36.280]  And so here's what I'm going to do.
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:38.280]  We have a guest coming up.
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:44.280]  And we're going to be talking to him.
[2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:50.280]  We're going to be talking to that guest about solutions and where all this is going.
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:56.280]  But then I may just cancel guests tomorrow and open the phones up to Australia because they don't want these people heard.
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:00.280]  And we need to make it a big deal every clip you see to share however you can.
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  Because already CNN said three years ago they want to censor what you email and what you text message.
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:06.280]  That's already starting.
[2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:08.280]  They've got congressional hearings about it.
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:10.280]  I mean, the globalists are making their move.
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.280]  They don't want authoritarian control so they can have the biggest jet airplanes and the biggest houses.
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:18.280]  They're a eugenics based cult that want to kill.
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.280]  And I can sit here all day and I can talk about this.
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:32.280]  But when I look at Zuckerberg or any of these people and just how damn evil they are.
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:37.280]  And then I think about our Congress that even lets themselves be censored by big tech.
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:40.280]  And it's just disgusting.
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:46.280]  And so I don't like Gigi Ping but I do like him standing up to big tech.
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:52.280]  Just because he realizes they're just as predatory as he is and he has some sense of state control.
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:54.280]  Because you can say, oh, you're a libertarian.
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:03:06.280]  But what do you do when corporations are bigger than governments and have more power than that and have more members and are coming after your freedom and blacklisting you and attacking you and making alliances with all the other companies that you can't buy and sell and that you can't live.
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:10.280]  What are you going to do at that point?
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:14.280]  How are you going to operate?
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:16.280]  And the answer is you're not.
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:24.280]  You're either going to submit and let them slowly kill you or fight back and win and take the country back and take the world back.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  But that's just where we are, folks.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:33.280]  And it's a very, very hard road.
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:36.280]  But that's the way it is.
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:46.280]  You know, it's not fun that Hitler gets in power and launches a big war and kills a bunch of people or Mao Zedong takes over and kills a hundred million or war or what the Soviets did to their own people and everybody else.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:49.280]  I mean, it's not fun that humans act like this.
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:51.280]  And the Christian ethos tries to stop that.
[2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:55.280]  And that's why where you have real Christianity going on, you have such freedom and prosperity.
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:02.280]  But we've turned our back on that and we think, you know, the devilish stuff is cute and funny now show we're in trouble.
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:05.280]  After our guest leaves, we have time.
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:08.280]  I really want to take your phone calls and I'll try to take those calls from you.
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:10.280]  I've got a lot of other news here.
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:28.280]  We're also going to be hitting, but you know that the average person is so dumbed down and so hypnotized and so conceited and so demoralized that they're going to join in on killing us, even as they're dying.
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  Because the one thing they never do is admit to themselves they've been lied to or conned.
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:42.280]  There is a invincible ignorance about the proletariat and I can't join the globalist in killing them and enslaving them.
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:49.280]  But at the same time, it's very sad for the proletariat, but they will all die.
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:51.280]  And so will most of us.
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:52.280]  I don't mean to be negative.
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:04:54.280]  I just want you to know you and your family are all dead.
[2:04:54.280 --> 2:04:58.280]  Now she's going to kill you and your family.
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:31.280]  Each of our best selling products is 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:35.280]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:37.280]  And that means all of these amazing products.
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:40.280]  We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:44.280]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[2:05:44.280 --> 2:05:45.280]  Amazing.
[2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:46.280]  We've got knock out the sleep babe.
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:49.280]  We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well.
[2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:52.280]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula.
[2:05:52.280 --> 2:05:56.280]  All 50% off at infowarstore.com and it keeps us on the air.
[2:05:56.280 --> 2:05:57.280]  Take action.
[2:05:57.280 --> 2:06:18.280]  I thank you.
[2:06:18.280 --> 2:06:23.280]  All right, we are joined by Paul Wittenberg, a well known successful filmmaker.
[2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:29.280]  He did a great job on this new documentary that drops just in a few weeks,
[2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:34.280]  which is of course, Cobb and Land the Lockdown and Liberty Man, who will not go named,
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:37.280]  who helped finance the film for no profit of his own.
[2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:39.280]  In fact, he's even taken the expenses.
[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:41.280]  He 100% financed it.
[2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:49.280]  And now Paul Wittenberg and others are getting their money back for working on it for the last really year.
[2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:51.280]  And there's going to be five parts.
[2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:52.280]  Very well done.
[2:06:52.280 --> 2:06:54.280]  They interviewed everybody under the sun.
[2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:55.280]  Really, really amazing.
[2:06:55.280 --> 2:07:01.280]  And I want to play today four viewers in this hour.
[2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:05.280]  A lot of great clubs from the film, a lot of stuff that hasn't been seen yet.
[2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:07.280]  And yeah, there it is on screen.
[2:07:07.280 --> 2:07:10.280]  You get a copy of Cobb and Land part one for 1995.
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:11.280]  Authorized to make copies.
[2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:14.280]  We hope you do with a free copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:17.280]  because it's the backstory on how that we're planning it, their admissions,
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:20.280]  how they use a virus care to set up world government,
[2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:23.280]  a casual society control grid that I made 14 years ago.
[2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:24.280]  It's evergreen.
[2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:26.280]  We sell more in-game today than we sold when I released it.
[2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:30.280]  But I'm giving you a copy with Cobb and Land part one, as I want you to have it.
[2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:33.280]  Everybody that pre-orders gets a free copy of in-game.
[2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:38.280]  There will not be a free copy of in-game when the pre-orders end in two weeks.
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:40.280]  Then it starts shipping.
[2:07:40.280 --> 2:07:42.280]  But there you go.
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:44.280]  So we're going to be going over this.
[2:07:44.280 --> 2:07:46.280]  And it's, we got Robert Kennedy Jr. clips.
[2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:51.280]  We've got Andrew Wakefield, Sherry Tenpinney, Dr. Lee Merritt, Adele Bigtree,
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.280]  and so many others will let the director introduce these as we go.
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:07:58.280]  And again, we also have Liberty Man here.
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:08:00.280]  Great job on part one.
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:03.280]  And I know that we're getting ready to finish up part two.
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:05.280]  These are going to come out every few months at each other.
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:06.280]  And it's really key.
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:10.280]  These films are powerful. They're very good to watch, but also they're designed.
[2:08:10.280 --> 2:08:13.280]  I like the fact to educate people that have been in a trance.
[2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:19.280]  So congratulations on the great work that you've done here, Paul Wittenberg and Liberty Man.
[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:25.280]  So which one of you guys wants to give us your take on the film and the world first?
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:28.280]  Well, I appreciate you having us on the show, Alex.
[2:08:28.280 --> 2:08:34.280]  This film is the most important film that we've ever made at Frame in the World.
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:39.280]  And, you know, I really appreciate you partnering with us to make this film
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:45.280]  because, you know, with all the censorship, there's no better outlet than Info Wars
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:47.280]  to get this out there to the masses.
[2:08:47.280 --> 2:08:53.280]  And so we really appreciate you helping us spread this important message.
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:55.280]  Well, I mean, we're all in this globalist trap together.
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:57.280]  So thank you.
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:08:59.280]  Let's talk about the impetus of the film.
[2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:05.280]  I mean, I like to get both your takes first on Wow about what's unfolding.
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:08.280]  This is a work in progress. You guys were just finishing this a few weeks ago, you know,
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:12.280]  and then as you progress through the five parts, it's in real time.
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:21.280]  How have things changed since you guys started this project and then now where we are here today?
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:26.280]  Well, this project has just been changing the whole time.
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:31.280]  As you know, you know, new information has been coming out this whole time.
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:36.280]  So it's hard to, you know, keep up with everything and get it out there.
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:38.280]  But honestly, I think we've done a great job.
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:42.280]  We have a lot. We have a crew of like four people that have been working full time
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:46.280]  at getting this done and we're trying to, you know, get all the best clips out there
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:51.280]  and really make it impactful, powerful and just straight to the point
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:54.280]  and just wake up the everyday person.
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:58.280]  Absolutely. This film is a weapon against tyrants, Liberty Man.
[2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:03.280]  What is it like to be in the middle of this experiencing all of this together
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:07.280]  and to be on the tip of the spear fighting this?
[2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:12.280]  Well, it's, you really feel like you're living your life.
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:17.280]  You step outside of the plastic culture and you get on the battlefield
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:21.280]  and it's a really good feeling. It's exhilarating.
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:26.280]  And you just nailed it when you said the name Info Wars.
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.280]  There's a war on for your mind and it's truly what we're facing.
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:33.280]  You know, I'm part of some legal groups where people are trying to take action
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:37.280]  and file injunctions and lawsuits and things like this
[2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:40.280]  and they're bulletproof to it right now.
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:45.280]  They're just, it's a giant con game and they're keeping us on our heels
[2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:48.280]  just by, you know, flooding the zone.
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:54.280]  And so when you really get down into it, you know, for us to have any sort of resistance,
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:57.280]  you know, when you read that book, Total Resistance,
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:00.280]  they talk about how any effective guerrilla warfare,
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:05.280]  you've got to have a decent support of the local population to wage guerrilla warfare.
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:09.280]  But well, how do you get that support? Well, that's information war.
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:11.280]  It's winning over hearts and minds.
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:15.280]  So I felt that myself personally, 10, 11 years ago,
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:19.280]  it was your documentary films that really woke me up.
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:23.280]  And documentaries are pretty powerful.
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:25.280]  And, you know, you haven't made one in a while,
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:28.280]  so it was really great to partner with you and to get this, you know,
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:30.280]  as an Info Wars original series.
[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:35.280]  And I think Alex, it's going to really help us build the numbers of people
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:37.280]  that understand what's going on.
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:40.280]  One thing I want to say is as we've made this,
[2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:44.280]  it was startling when Paul and I would be talking about,
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:46.280]  you know, some clip that we saw last summer,
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:49.280]  when the lockdowns first launched, you know,
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:53.280]  and you go to find it and it's all, so much of it's now scrubbed.
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:59.280]  So the memory-holding of information is very, very aggressive now.
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:03.280]  And it hit us that, you know, we need to put this true history,
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:05.280]  the true narrative of what's going on.
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:10.280]  It has to be captured because in 5, 10 years, people are going to be going,
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:13.280]  well, how did this all happen? How did we get here?
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:15.280]  Why did, you know, what were people told at that period of time
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:18.280]  that the proper context of it, we know that the history books,
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:21.280]  the school textbooks are going to give their narrative.
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:25.280]  We had to capture the correct narrative.
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.280]  And so that was also a big motivation in putting this piece together.
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:33.280]  Wow. You guys are better spoken than I am.
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:35.280]  I love our conversations together and also making the film.
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:39.280]  And you're absolutely dead on that they now don't just memory-holding
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:43.280]  live time with the Google searches and others, but now even on YouTube
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:46.280]  and everywhere else they just disappeared things where you can't ever find it
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:49.280]  so you can't see their lives day to day.
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:53.280]  And that's literally 1984 where they would go back and re-edit the newspapers
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:57.280]  and then destroy the old newspapers, show that the only place truth existed
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:00.280]  was in people's memories and now they're actually doing it.
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:03.280]  And so that's why this five-part series for police departments and churches
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:06.280]  and universities and everywhere is going to be so critical
[2:13:06.280 --> 2:13:10.280]  because it's going to have the compendium of how this takeover took place
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:11.280]  and who these criminals are.
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:15.280]  And I can't wait to see the later parts where what do you guys make of it all coming out
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:18.280]  that they did make the virus at the lab, they approached the Pentagon
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:21.280]  about releasing it in China, and then that's just a minor footnote.
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:27.280]  I mean, that is wild.
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:33.280]  It is. I think, you know, when we look at the five-part series
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:38.280]  that we're building out here, when Paul was initially working on this project
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:40.280]  the title was The Great Reset.
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:46.280]  And when we looked at the outline, all the content, the topics we needed to address
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:49.280]  it became very clear that it was going to be a three-hour documentary.
[2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:53.280]  And then as we talked, it was just more and more things that had to be, you know,
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:55.280]  brought in into the scope.
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:58.280]  And so that's how it became a five-part.
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.280]  And in the whole strategy, what we want to do is really an episode one through three
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:09.280]  is provide people something that's geared to work for normies, really,
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:12.280]  that they can look at and go, yeah, I remember seeing that.
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:15.280]  Yeah, that's right. That's right. Nothing's too startling,
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:20.280]  but we've connected the dots for people so they can see it properly.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.280]  So we don't really go too deep down the rabbit hole in these first three episodes.
[2:14:24.280 --> 2:14:29.280]  Number four is all about the propaganda. And we felt that that was really important
[2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:31.280]  to show people how the media works.
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:35.280]  And in particular, the behavior sciences that's behind this,
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:40.280]  the Freudian, the Pavlovian psychology that's gone on.
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:43.280]  It's not an accident that they're constantly contradicting themselves
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:45.280]  and that they're changing the narrative, they're flip-flop.
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:49.280]  It's not an accident that they, you know, that's a ratcheting effect
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:52.280]  where they clamp down and then they ease off a little bit
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:55.280]  and then, you know, drop the hammer again and then ease it off.
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:58.280]  That's all conditioning. But episode five, Alex,
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:01.280]  is where we go real deep down the rabbit hole.
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:04.280]  And when I say real deep down the rabbit hole,
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:08.280]  it's to get into the true origins of this crisis
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:11.280]  and the real agenda that they're driving towards.
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:14.280]  We believe it's more than just a depopulation event.
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:18.280]  We believe that there's something a little bit more sinister at play
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.280]  that ties into the whole, you know, smart grid,
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:24.280]  if you will, the sustainable development agenda.
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:26.280]  Oh, I totally agree with you. I totally agree with you.
[2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:29.280]  They want to make us merge with machines.
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:31.280]  This is very alien.
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:33.280]  I mean, I talk to people at the Pentagon that are high-level
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:35.280]  and they go, no, this looks like an alien takeover.
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:37.280]  I mean, they don't know what's running it.
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:40.280]  These people want to end humanity but make something new.
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:43.280]  So I haven't seen what you guys are doing on part five yet.
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:45.280]  I can't wait to be involved in it.
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:48.280]  But I know we're already working on part three right now
[2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:49.280]  and part two is getting close to be done.
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:51.280]  Get part one. It ships out in two weeks.

[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:01.280]  Your voice counts.
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.280]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person,
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:07.280]  it changes the world.
[2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:09.280]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:11.280]  They know you're angry.
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:13.280]  And now to get around big tech,
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:15.280]  we're going to use every tool we've got.
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:17.280]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,

[2:16:56.280 --> 2:16:58.280]  If you're concerned about the power grid
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:01.280]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:04.280]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:06.280]  Here's why.
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:09.280]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:13.280]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:15.280]  when you need it most.
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:17.280]  And unlike gas generators,
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:19.280]  solar generators run quietly,
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:21.280]  emit no dangerous fumes,
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:24.280]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:27.280]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues,
[2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:29.280]  or just getting off the grid,
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:32.280]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:17:32.280 --> 2:17:34.280]  Even better, all this week,
[2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:38.280]  radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:42.280]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:44.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:46.280]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:50.280]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:53.280]  stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:56.280]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:18:02.280]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:04.280]  of the planet's ruling class,
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:06.280]  not in Communist China,
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:09.280]  not in Mexico, not in the United States,
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:10.280]  not anywhere.
[2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:14.280]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:16.280]  And that's done by design.
[2:18:16.280 --> 2:18:19.280]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:22.280]  will penalize and target any academics
[2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:25.280]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:27.280]  that founded the Bilderberg Group,
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:29.280]  the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations,
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:32.280]  the whole project with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:34.280]  Until 10 years ago, the media said
[2:18:34.280 --> 2:18:36.280]  the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg Group,
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:37.280]  didn't exist.
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:40.280]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head,
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:43.280]  shown the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab,
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:46.280]  and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:49.280]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide,
[2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:51.280]  we don't address the globalist head-on
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:53.280]  about the fact that they are a worldwide
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:55.280]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:18:57.280]  If we do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:19:00.280]  Finally, vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are both essential
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:03.280]  are getting the respect and the attention they deserve.
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:05.280]  We've got a great product, it's been out for six years.
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:08.280]  Winter sun, long before the big crisis came along,
[2:19:08.280 --> 2:19:10.280]  we were there saying, this is high quality,
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:13.280]  this will make you healthy, this will be better for you and your family.
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:16.280]  But what else doesn't get attention, and needs to be looked at,
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:18.280]  is vitamin B12.
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:20.280]  It is just as essential, it is just as important,
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:22.280]  and it is amazing.
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:24.280]  And it's not just about your immune system,
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:26.280]  it's about every part of your body.
[2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:29.280]  It's really a hormone, and it's what your building blocks
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:32.280]  of your entire body operate off of.
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:34.280]  So, these vitamins are essential.
[2:19:34.280 --> 2:19:37.280]  Vitamin D3, and of course vitamin B12
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:40.280]  go together like a horse, and carriage, do your own research.
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:43.280]  We've got the highest grades you're going to find out there,
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:45.280]  and they're taken under the tongue.
[2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:47.280]  It's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute,
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:50.280]  and let it sit, so your blood vessels absorb it.
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:52.280]  They're both available 50% off
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:54.280]  at infowarsstore.com together,
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:57.280]  or by themselves at 50% off and 25% off.
[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:00.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:30.280]  That are behind the amazing five-part series,
[2:20:30.280 --> 2:20:33.280]  part one out now, that is Covidland.
[2:20:33.280 --> 2:20:35.280]  Covidland.com takes you right to infowarsstore,
[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:38.280]  and I'm very honored to be involved in the production of the film,
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:40.280]  and to be the main place you can get it.
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:42.280]  Obviously, it's going to be put out later at Band-Aid Video,
[2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:44.280]  and everywhere else is going to be heavily censored and blocked.
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:46.280]  That's why DVDs are key with expanded information
[2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:49.280]  to make copies and get around the censors.
[2:20:49.280 --> 2:20:52.280]  Because you can sit there and see globalist propaganda
[2:20:52.280 --> 2:20:54.280]  over and over again, they've got to reapply it.
[2:20:54.280 --> 2:20:56.280]  Once you see how the trick works,
[2:20:56.280 --> 2:20:58.280]  and now they put the pressure on, take the pressure off.
[2:20:58.280 --> 2:21:01.280]  That's a psychological, trauma-based mind control system.
[2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:05.280]  People can get out of it by seeing the whole paradigm,
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:07.280]  like seeing a hidden image or a subliminal image.
[2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:09.280]  Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:12.280]  So our job is easy if we just take action.
[2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:15.280]  Hell is already here, and it's going to get a lot worse if we don't.
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:17.280]  So gentlemen, in the time we have in this hour,
[2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:19.280]  I want to, you guys are both very well-spoken,
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:21.280]  give you the floor here, Paul Wittenberg and Liberty Man,
[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:23.280]  the backer of the film.
[2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:25.280]  You've got a bunch of great clips.
[2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:27.280]  We've got people in the film.
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:29.280]  You guys tell us about it.
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:31.280]  All right, yeah, I wanted to just tell your audience
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:33.280]  just a little bit about the project.
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:38.280]  We started shooting this back in December of 2020.
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:40.280]  And so we have been going strong since then.
[2:21:40.280 --> 2:21:43.280]  We have interviewed 50 people for this series
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:46.280]  and traveled to 16 different states.
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:50.280]  So this is not just some shoddy production that we have put out.
[2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:53.280]  We have invested a ton of money and a ton of time
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:58.280]  into this production to really just be the seminal film
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:02.280]  to just wake up masses of people.
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:04.280]  And I got a copy of it right here.
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:05.280]  It's COVID Land.
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:07.280]  Guys, you can get it on band.video.
[2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:11.280]  It's a fantastic film that I'm very proud of.
[2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:14.280]  So I appreciate you, Alex,
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:18.280]  letting us be on your show today and to talk about it.
[2:22:18.280 --> 2:22:20.280]  I know you guys do have some clips.
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:22.280]  I don't know if we want to show those now,
[2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:23.280]  but we will.
[2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:26.280]  But listen, you need to stop thanking me, brother.
[2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:29.280]  You had a big film crew with super awesome cameras.
[2:22:29.280 --> 2:22:30.280]  Look how great your studio is.
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:32.280]  They need to come help me set up mine.
[2:22:32.280 --> 2:22:33.280]  You're a great filmmaker.
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:35.280]  You're a backer putting so much money to do this.
[2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:37.280]  I know how much you spent.
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:39.280]  So this is for everybody.
[2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:44.280]  This is the antidote to this alien, evil, anti-human, antichrist takeover.
[2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:46.280]  So, yeah, we got a bunch of clips here.
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:47.280]  Let's play the first clip.
[2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:49.280]  This is from part one.
[2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:51.280]  This is Robert Kennedy, Jr.
[2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:55.280]  How you're supposed to conduct a vaccine study versus what they did.
[2:22:55.280 --> 2:23:01.280]  You want to have a double-blind, randomized placebo testing without what that means.
[2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:07.280]  You give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase two, phase three trials.
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:10.280]  And you give 20,000 people a placebo,
[2:23:10.280 --> 2:23:16.280]  and then you really look at health outcomes for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:19.280]  A lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries,
[2:23:19.280 --> 2:23:21.280]  you're not going to see in four weeks.
[2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:23.280]  The cancer, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:27.280]  And many of the neurological injuries, you won't see for four weeks.
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:31.280]  If the experience with other vaccines is instructive,
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:35.280]  you look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule,
[2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:41.280]  and there's about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:42.280]  That's right.
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  Then they say, oh, it's safe and effective for us to science.
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:46.280]  Here's Andrew Wakefeld, totally vindicated.
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:49.280]  Now they admit the study claiming he was wrong was a fraud.
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:51.280]  Here is Andrew Wakefeld in the film.
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:57.280]  So the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use,
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:00.280]  has often been another vaccine,
[2:24:00.280 --> 2:24:06.280]  a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own right.
[2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:10.280]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine,
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:13.280]  a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:18.280]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo.
[2:24:18.280 --> 2:24:20.280]  Totally inappropriate.
[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:22.280]  This is not good science.
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:24.280]  It is not science at all.
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:29.280]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rate to these vaccines
[2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:36.280]  so that they can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:38.280]  That is the only concern.
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:39.280]  That's right.
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:41.280]  They were in trouble, and it came out years ago.
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:44.280]  Their own scientists wanted to stop the vaccines at the UN.
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:47.280]  That was the 2019 December meeting in Switzerland.
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:50.280]  And then right as that was going on, they released this to now be the savers.
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:54.280]  Can you guys speak to that?
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:24:59.280]  Well, it's amazing how Big Pharma found Jesus when COVID came along, right?
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:02.280]  Oh, yes.
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:08.280]  You know, even taking what, I mean, the FDA corruption is way out in the open now.
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:14.280]  There was a recent letter that was sent by the two executives that resigned.
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:16.280]  That's quite something.
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:24.280]  We now see them ramming through approvals, even when the expert panels are declining to approve certain drugs.
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:29.280]  You know, we saw with Pfizer, for instance, they started giving the vaccine to the control group.
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:32.280]  People were the trials were complete.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:36.280]  The corruptions, it's just really out in the open.
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:39.280]  You know, Wakefield is talking about aluminum as an adjuvant.
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:42.280]  That's sort of yesterday's vaccine.
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.280]  They're now putting even crazier things in these shots.
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:53.280]  Things that are really hidden in plain sight, which are much more toxic.
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.280]  And so, yeah, they've really got the jump on us with this.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.280]  And we're working hard to, you know, is that Mark Twain quote, right?
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:07.280]  He says the Lyle travel halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:12.280]  We've got a lot of catch up in it and informing people to do here.
[2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:14.280]  Because, and time is of the essence.
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.280]  A lot of people are getting hurt.
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:18.280]  Well, that's the thing.
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:21.280]  People ask, well, how are they going to then have people getting sick and dying,
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:25.280]  especially when natural cold viruses come along and they have this horrible autoimmune response to it?
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:26.280]  Is it so similar?
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:27.280]  They die.
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:29.280]  They're just going to say it's the unvaccinated would do variants.
[2:26:29.280 --> 2:26:30.280]  They're already doing it.
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:32.280]  We could predict they do that a year and a half ago.
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.280]  Now it's already happening.
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:36.280]  And the people that have taken the shots have like Stockholm syndrome, a lot of them.
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:40.280]  But I am seeing a lot of them understanding when they were told, wait, these shots didn't help me.
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:41.280]  I took the shots.
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:42.280]  I got to take more.
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:43.280]  We'll wait.
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:45.280]  I mean, so I am seeing that.
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:51.280]  How much hope do you guys have right now?
[2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:55.280]  It depends on what side of the bed I wake up on really.
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:56.280]  I see both sides of it.
[2:26:56.280 --> 2:27:00.280]  I see the side where a lot's baked into the cake at this point.
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:06.280]  There's a lot of vaccine injury, a lot still to be realized really.
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:11.280]  You can't have this much of the population taking something that's this damaging to their health.
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:19.280]  Now you can look at what Dr. Robert Young has recently put on his blog showing a microscopy of people's red blood cells,
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:21.280]  what it's doing to people's blood.
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:27.280]  And the fruits of that are going to continue to unfold for a time.
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:32.280]  And we've seen without even a real health crisis how people can be whipped into a panic.
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:35.280]  So what happens when there's a real health crisis?
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:46.280]  People have been so conditioned to outsource their thinking and to listen to the experts and the scientists and the officials and not think for themselves.
[2:27:46.280 --> 2:27:51.280]  And so there's just so many people that are in that CNN camp, if you will.
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:53.280]  They're going to take us for a ride.
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:59.280]  But on the other side, Alex, we can't give up hope and we have to fight the good fight.
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:01.280]  And there are a lot of people.
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.280]  I mean, sometimes when I'm feeling a little bit down, I'll go to Twitter.
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:20.280]  And there are just amazing people on Twitter that and the memes are just completely nail it in terms of calling out the fallacies and the contradictions and all the silliness that goes on.
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:21.280]  And that's right.
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:23.280]  All of us, we make films.
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:24.280]  Other people put out memes.
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:26.280]  People call to talk radio.
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:27.280]  You say something at church.
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:33.280]  You say something at the city council where we all hear our voices and know we're not alone and grow our numbers, which we're doing.
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:36.280]  That's why in Australia, in other areas, they're now saying it's terrorism to protest.
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:37.280]  No, they're the terrorists.
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:39.280]  We're going to come back with more clips.
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:44.280]  But I'm Sherri Timpinney, Dr. Lee Merritt, Dale Bigtree, and so many others.
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:51.280]  We're going to play clips from Peggy Hall, Tammy Clark, Dr. Anne Bukarek, if I'm saying that right, and so many others.
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:52.280]  Stay with us.
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:56.280]  Check out the new film, Hobanland.com.
[2:28:56.280 --> 2:29:04.280]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:04.280 --> 2:29:05.280]  Here's why.
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:09.280]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:14.280]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:23.280]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:32.280]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:38.280]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:42.280]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:44.280]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:52.280]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:58.280]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[2:29:58.280 --> 2:30:02.280]  We're in an information war, and the globalists are counting on the people being ignorant.
[2:30:02.280 --> 2:30:12.280]  That's why they're engaged in so much censorship, because the truth is the antidote to their lies, to their hysteria, to their fear, to the controlled bioweapon they released,
[2:30:12.280 --> 2:30:17.280]  and now the so-called vaccine that produces that same bioweapon inside the body.
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:22.280]  COVID-land the lockdown is part one in a five-parts mini-series.
[2:30:22.280 --> 2:30:24.280]  It is a very powerful film.
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:26.280]  I'm very, very proud of this film.
[2:30:26.280 --> 2:30:28.280]  A highly respected director made the film.
[2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:36.280]  It's got over-the-top guests and experts on it, like Robert Kennedy, Jr., and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, myself, and just so many others.
[2:30:36.280 --> 2:30:38.280]  I'm very proud to produce this film.
[2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:44.280]  It's available right now at infowarstore.com for $195 to start shipping in early October.
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:51.280]  And for those that put in early orders now, you get a free copy of my seminal film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement,
[2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:55.280]  that gives you the whole Pat story on how they built up to this takeover.
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:31:18.280]  Here's infowarstore.com.

[2:32:56.280 --> 2:32:57.280]  Please take action.
[2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:03.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:22.280]  You know, I cannot express to the listeners out there how important it is that you get all parts of this film that aren't out yet.
[2:33:22.280 --> 2:33:23.280]  Part one is about the ship.
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:24.280]  We've got the DVDs.
[2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:32.280]  They've been made here in the United States, and they're going to start shipping out at the end of the first week of October.
[2:33:32.280 --> 2:33:36.280]  So about two weeks out from that, every order gets a copy of in-game.
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:37.280]  It gives you the whole backstory.
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:38.280]  That's free.
[2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:40.280]  So two films.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:51.280]  And again, Liberty Man paid for the production of this and paid for us to be able to get the DVDs and for our end of the production.
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:55.280]  And I know that was a lot of funding to this operation.
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:34:00.280]  So I just think all the listeners out there need to know, just because you know all the angles of this,
[2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:05.280]  doesn't mean your neighbors, your friends, your family, and others don't.
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:06.280]  They're ignorant.
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:07.280]  You need to get it.
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:08.280]  You need to make copies of it.
[2:34:08.280 --> 2:34:11.280]  It's got a zero country code meaning it works all over the world.
[2:34:11.280 --> 2:34:14.280]  And you need to go out and go to a duplication place.
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:15.280]  We don't care.
[2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:18.280]  Make 10,000 copies in an amount of your somebody that's got money.
[2:34:18.280 --> 2:34:22.280]  We had that happen with in-game and road to tyranny and other documentaries.
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:24.280]  And this is better produced than mine.
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:28.280]  You know, over time, we got better cameras and better stuff, but it was still me directing it.
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:31.280]  So, you know, it's an Alex Jones style thing.
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:32.280]  I think in-game is the best movie I've made.
[2:34:32.280 --> 2:34:34.280]  But this is better.
[2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:37.280]  And I can't wait to see the other parts of the voiceover for part two.
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:39.280]  And now we're getting ready to work on part three.
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:42.280]  So it's about to get turned into a DVD as well.
[2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:45.280]  And that's the great part is every month and a half or so.
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:48.280]  These are going to be boom, boom, boom, boom, boom coming out.
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:52.280]  And it's just something that college students should see.
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:57.280]  You should go give this to your local police chief so they can watch it and see what's happening.
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:01.280]  Because believe me, they're going to remember all the stuff that has been memory holds.
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:11.280]  So, infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:15.280]  And also, you get an additional copy for 995.
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.280]  So for 2995, you'll get two copies of Covenland, part one, the lockdown, and two in-games.
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:25.280]  That way you can keep them yourself and then give them as gifts or donate them to the library
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:27.280]  or to the Rotary Club.
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:29.280]  You want to hit thought leaders.
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:32.280]  You never know where these messages in a bottle are going to go.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:38.280]  I mean, I'm not bragging when I say this, but when I talk to 95% of people that are activists now
[2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:42.280]  and taking action, infowar is either totally woke them up or had a hand in that.
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:45.280]  I've had Tucker Carlson say that to my face, you know, Joe Rogan.
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:48.280]  And that's an example of that now these guys are awake, been awake for many years.
[2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:50.280]  Now they're going to wake people up and you're going to wake people up.
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:52.280]  It's not like Alex Jones on one that can do this.
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:55.280]  I just did it at a level bigger than other people.
[2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:58.280]  And I didn't do it on purpose, but joking around and acting silly some.
[2:35:58.280 --> 2:36:03.280]  The system didn't take me serious and let us get 5 billion views on our own channels on YouTube
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:05.280]  before they took us down and other things.
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:07.280]  And billions and billions of views on Facebook.
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.280]  It was a joke to the elites.
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:11.280]  Now they saw people were actually listening so they took us down.
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:17.280]  But now, thank God, we got a good shot at them because that has spurred so many other people
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:18.280]  like ripples on a pond.
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:20.280]  But guys, I can rant forever.
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:25.280]  More points, you guys jump in here and tell me about some of the other people that are in the film.
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:33.280]  I know they'll dig big tree, Lee Merritt, Sherry Tenpenny and some of these other folks are will play these clips.
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:37.280]  Yeah, we have a ton of different people that are featured in the film.
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:40.280]  We have Del Big Tree, Eric Nipudi, Dr.
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:47.280]  Yeah, we're Griffin and Dr. Andy Wakefield, Alex Newman, Ty Bollinger, of course yourself.
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:50.280]  Dr. Simone Gold, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Chuck Baldwin.
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:55.280]  I mean, we have so many different people featured in these five episodes.
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:59.280]  And just to give your audience just kind of some insight in the different parts.
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:01.280]  Part one is called the lockdown.
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:03.280]  Part two is called the mask.
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:05.280]  Part three is called the shot.
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:10.280]  Part four is the propaganda and part five is the great reset.
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:20.280]  So we go through all the different topics and really just, you know, it's a great tool for waking people up.
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:22.280]  Well, what's happened with you has happened with me.
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:25.280]  I've been making in-game two or the great resets.
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:28.280]  What we were calling it before I learned yours was that and I said, oh, we're making this too.
[2:37:28.280 --> 2:37:32.280]  And I just, we always get lost in too much evil, too much of what they're saying.
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:35.280]  It's like, man, this could be a 10 hour thing or a mini series.
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:37.280]  And then I know you guys were making it and you reached out to us.
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:40.280]  And so it definitely needs to happen.
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:45.280]  And folks in-game and other films and other like loose change films I've been involved in have had such a big effect.
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:52.280]  And other great films like what Aaron Russo did and all these other great films have changed the world.
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:54.280]  And now people are hungry for this information.
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:57.280]  Aren't they, Liberty Man?
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:37:59.280]  They sure are.
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:01.280]  And I got to say kudos to Paul.
[2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:11.280]  He's put the information together in a way that I believe and the people that we've seen it, they echo this as well.
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:13.280]  That it really touches you deep.
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:15.280]  It hits you.
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:18.280]  There's a real emotional, it pulls on your emotional heart strings.
[2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:22.280]  And Paul and I have always joked, we're in the propaganda game here, right?
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:24.280]  We're putting out propaganda.
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:25.280]  It's got to be effective.
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:28.280]  Now, propaganda doesn't mean that it's lies and deceit.
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:30.280]  It's truthful.
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:32.280]  Everything we're putting out is very truthful.
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:38.280]  But it's propaganda in the sense that we're trying to reach people and have a certain effect on them.
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:45.280]  And the effect that we're trying to have is to wake them up, is to also get them to realize the situation that they're living in.
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:54.280]  But Paul, I got to say, there were several times when I was watching some of the clips or I would go through and kind of some of the rough edits.
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:58.280]  And even when they were rough edits, it was hitting me very emotionally.
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:06.280]  There were, you know, this first episode, a lot of the feedback is there's a certain part that people are brought to tears in it consistently.
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:08.280]  And is that the...
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:12.280]  Arian talks about people dying alone, how satanic that is?
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:15.280]  That's the part that really hits people hard, yeah.
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:17.280]  And I didn't know that.
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:18.280]  I mean, I hadn't talked to you before.
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:19.280]  That hits me the hardest.
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:21.280]  It makes me get a tears in my eyes when we're done.
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:27.280]  I see it because, again, you can't come see your family, but they put COVID positive people in the nursing homes to kill them.
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:32.280]  I mean, this is so damn premeditated.
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:35.280]  Yeah, there's a real human, a real impact here.
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:40.280]  I'll tell you what, let's play that clip.
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:43.280]  Let's play that clip with Brian Mashi.
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:45.280]  Is that how you pronounce it?
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:46.280]  Moshe.
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:47.280]  Moshe.
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:48.280]  So here's Brian Moshe talking about that.
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:49.280]  Here it is.
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:54.280]  To not allow these moms and dads in to be with their dying kids.
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:40:01.280]  To not allow family members to come in and to hold their parents' hand that one final time.
[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:09.280]  You know, to give dad a kiss on the forehead, you know, or to hug your mom one final time, you know, before she passes away.
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:17.280]  Like, that to me is literally the most inhumane aspect of this entire COVID situation.
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:22.280]  And the fact that we've had so many people now that have literally had to die alone.
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:29.280]  We've had so many family members that have had to say goodbye to their loved ones over face time.
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:34.280]  Because the hospitals were refusing to let family members inside.
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:40.280]  Meanwhile, their family members literally on their deathbed waiting to take their last breath.
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:48.280]  And we're keeping people, you know, outside for those last crucial moments of life that people will never get back.
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:57.280]  I can't think of anything more inhumane to be done to not only a patient, but to a patient's family.
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:03.280]  And again, radiolosures can't see this, but the cinematography, I mean, it looks like I guess as good as HBO.
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:05.280]  You really knocked it out of the park, Paul.
[2:41:05.280 --> 2:41:07.280]  Thank you.
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:10.280]  When we come back, we've got Dr. Ann.
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:12.280]  How do you pronounce that?
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:14.280]  I'm not good at all these names.
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:15.280]  I know who she is.
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:21.280]  That's coming up effects of elderly talks about how elders were isolated from loved ones and nursing homes.
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:23.280]  How mass stress your lungs and heart.
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:29.280]  Tammy Clark, TRT, Peggy Hall, the absurdity of wearing masks in banks and stores and schools.
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:31.280]  We've got Sherry Tenpinning.
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:35.280]  We've got Dr. Lee Merritt, Dale Big Tree and others on the other side.
[2:41:35.280 --> 2:41:38.280]  But we're going to break in about a minute and a half.
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:42.280]  What else do you think is the most powerful part of the film?
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:46.280]  Well, you know, I think it really does touch people.
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:53.280]  And that was one of the things we, we, we wanted to do in this film is actually, you know, get at the heartstrings.
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:58.280]  And so, you know, this film has a couple of parts that are very touching.
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:02.280]  Episode two, again, is even better than episode one.
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:06.280]  And then I think episode three, even how dues does all those.
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:11.280]  So, you know, there's a lot of different parts that really just touches you.
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:20.280]  And, you know, as a Christian, you know, we believe that, you know, this is a big deal because the mass are conditioning for the vaccine.
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:25.280]  And we believe that, you know, the vaccine will be conditioning for the mark of the beast.
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:40.280]  And so this is something that, you know, is, is serious that, you know, people need to wake up and realize that this agenda is, you know, taking us into world government.
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:42.280]  It's the end of the line, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:47.280]  They're going to kill a lot of people, but the process also take over a lot of people in their own admissions.
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:49.280]  That's the Clauswap set a chip in your body.
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:52.280]  They're going to control your body and make you a new life form.
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:56.280]  This is truly psychotic.
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:05.280]  On September 9th, 2021, the public president, Joe Biden publicly declared war against America.
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:13.280]  He then announced dictatorial powers on himself and announced forced inoculations against the American people.
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:19.280]  He is a puppet of the United Nations and the Rockefeller Combined of Corporations that put him in power.
[2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:23.280]  And he is making a very serious move against the American people.
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:31.280]  But the attack he's launched is being launched against every other western country on the planet by these corporations that have already enslaved the third world.
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:38.280]  What they're doing is illegal on its face, violates our federal and state laws, and the Geneva Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code.
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:40.280]  It's very, very simple.
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:47.280]  We have to decide whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover, whether we're going to stand up with our birthright and say no,
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:53.280]  and then prosecute these criminals for their crimes against humanity so other criminals in the future don't dare try it.
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:55.280]  The choice is up to us.
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:44:02.280]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.280]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:10.280]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:18.280]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:27.280]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:32.280]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:35.280]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:40.280]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:45.280]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:50.280]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:45:16.280]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:22.280]  Think about that because that's where we are.
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:31.280]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening, but it is happening now.
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:36.280]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's out of vaccines and gene therapy and it doesn't really work.
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:38.280]  So you got to take it every few months.
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:44.280]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID.
[2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:46.280]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:51.280]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:53.280]  And that's in mainline studies.
[2:45:53.280 --> 2:45:58.280]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:02.280]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:08.280]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:21.280]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:25.280]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:34.280]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled trance.
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:39.280]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:49.280]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:47:08.280]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:26.280]  Well, the next clip is Dr. Annie Bukachek talking about the effects on the elderly and just again people putting up with them becoming prisoners so you don't make them sick.
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:29.280]  But then again, they send the COVID patients in so they have mass death.
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:30.280]  They were intubating.
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:36.280]  They're making $50 plus thousand dollars off each person that they intubated 95% then died.
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:38.280]  And Rob did was in the hospital.
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:39.280]  They wouldn't give any medicine.
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:40.280]  Nothing got him out of the medicine.
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:41.280]  He got better.
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:42.280]  It's the same paradigm.
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:47.280]  So here she is talking about it in the film part one, COVID land, the lockdown.
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:58.280]  I would say probably the majority of people in these nursing homes, in assisted living, they live for the, the hugs, the touch, you know, the facial recognition of their family members.
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:01.280]  That's, that's the high point of their day or their week or their month.
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:02.280]  That's, that's what they live for.
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:04.280]  That's, that's what, that's what my mom lived for.
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:08.280]  And I had to have a patient who she's 91.
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:09.280]  She's in assisted living.
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:13.280]  When the lockdown happened, she had a very devoted daughter who used to come every day.
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:22.280]  And when they shut her off, that daughter off, within two days, my 91 year old patient stopped communicating before she, she was pretty feisty, fun, you know, person.
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:24.280]  She completely stopped communicating.
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:27.280]  She, she didn't make, you know, she'd stop making eye contact to stop talking.
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:32.280]  And then, and then eventually she stopped eating and eventually she stopped drinking fluids.
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:36.280]  And she died in certain, in my opinion, from the isolation of COVID.
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:39.280]  And there are many, many of those kind of cases across the country.
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:52.280]  And the other bizarre thing that, that, that 91 year old was robbed of is that when her, when they finally decided that her family members could come see her because we knew she was going to die within a day or two.
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:49:04.280]  The daughter was allowed to come in, the son from out of state was allowed to come in, but the daughter and son could only go in that room if they were gowned, gloved and masked.
[2:49:04.280 --> 2:49:10.280]  And this woman, this 91 year old woman who died in that room, she was in a room by herself.
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:13.280]  And the brother and sister could not go in together.
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:24.280]  And so, so that, those last moments of touch and facial recognition and hugs or, or even a clear voice that's not speaking through a mask.
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:27.280]  You know, my patient was, was, was robbed of that.
[2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:33.280]  And this is being played out by, I don't know how many, you know, senior citizens across the country.
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:35.280]  This is true satanic evil.
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:37.280]  They're, I know the globalists have studied them.
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:43.280]  And folks, if you ever said them, it just sounds, they drain the pain, they drain humiliation to them.
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:46.280]  It's a work of art to starve a child to death in a cage.
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:54.280]  It's a work of art to rape a woman and then, and it's a work of art to hurt families and to isolate people and to have minions carry it out for them.
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:56.280]  It's all about blasphemy in God's eyes.
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:49:57.280]  That's what this is.
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:00.280]  It's all about, it's all about defiling us.
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:02.280]  And I mean, that's my view on this.
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:07.280]  What do you guys think the filmmakers?
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:13.280]  Well, I think there is certainly a demoralization campaign that they're engaged in.
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:24.280]  They are trying to bring people to a point where there, there, any, any interest or love of liberty is, is completely gone.
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:27.280]  And so that, that obviously doesn't lead to good places.
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:34.280]  They are, they are, there's a degeneracy that was sort of inherent in our culture.
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:38.280]  The decadence was kind of doing that naturally, but I do agree, Alex.
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:40.280]  I mean, you just have to flick on the TV.
[2:50:40.280 --> 2:50:51.280]  I mean, in our family, you can't even watch any cable TV just because even the commercials are filled with filth.
[2:50:51.280 --> 2:50:55.280]  And so that, you know, it's not something we want our children to see.
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:51:00.280]  You know, we don't want to be totally like, you know, segregated off from society and whatnot.
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:05.280]  But, you know, you do want your children to enjoy that period where they're of innocence.
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:08.280]  And in today's world, it's very difficult.
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:12.280]  This is about the death of the death of innocence.
[2:51:12.280 --> 2:51:19.280]  It is, you know, we're, we're in that period where, you know, weak men create hard times.
[2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:21.280]  That's the stage that we're at.
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:33.280]  So I think, though, that, you know, we can draw a lot of hope in the fact that there are a lot of people that are, that are awake and that do want to resist this.
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:42.280]  I know personally, many people that are, that are well informed, but they're still perhaps clinging a little bit to this idea that there could be a return to normal.
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:50.280]  As they, of course, get these letters that say, hey, you're out of work unless you get the shot, or they're seeing people that go get the shot.
[2:51:50.280 --> 2:51:53.280]  And they're seeing the injuries and the effects of it.
[2:51:53.280 --> 2:51:55.280]  Things are getting real at this point.
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.280]  And I think people are coming to grips with the situation that they're in.
[2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:19.280]  So there has been a detachment that's been a bit of a process as well, just for people that are somewhat informed or informed to let go of the plastic culture and the conveniences and realize that as humans on this earth,
[2:52:19.280 --> 2:52:25.280]  we've never had it like that before where you can just, you know, have it so easy and convenient all the time.
[2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:27.280]  And that's being taken from us.
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:35.280]  And as more good people realize that, no, you know, you are not appointed onto this easy, fun filled life, you're going to face adversity.
[2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:39.280]  We are going to face adversity in this time, in this generation.
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:42.280]  And come to grips with that and get good with it.
[2:52:42.280 --> 2:52:45.280]  And then, you know, things start to switch from there, right?
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:48.280]  We can actually have a lot of good people start to organize.
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:49.280]  We're seeing that happen.
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:52.280]  And that's, of course, very encouraging.
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:53.280]  You're absolutely right.
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:57.280]  I want to play more clips from the film, but I just cannot encourage listeners enough to join the fight.
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:03.280]  If you want a tool to wake people up in game, again, just written magically six months ago, I'm like, we had 20,000 copies.
[2:53:03.280 --> 2:53:04.280]  Where'd it go?
[2:53:04.280 --> 2:53:06.280]  Oh, it all sold out.
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:10.280]  So I said, buy 40,000 and sell it $5 a piece.
[2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:13.280]  And then I mean, because my message is to get it out there, because people see the censorship.
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:15.280]  Now they're like, oh, we need DVDs again.
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:19.280]  People are making copies, they're handing them out, people are getting their old DVD players out.
[2:53:19.280 --> 2:53:27.280]  In the future, old text will be more important than ever, because they're going to have systems that basically won't even let you, you know, talk about freedom on the new hard drives or computers that are coming out.
[2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:30.280]  And so it's going to be a long, hard fight, folks, and people are figuring it out.
[2:53:30.280 --> 2:53:34.280]  They're digging in third dimensional warfare with bumper stickers, spray-painting things.
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:35.280]  Look, they're killing us.
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:36.280]  This is civil disobedience.
[2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:42.280]  Instead of talking about killing the globalist, we should be talking about doing civil disobedience stuff way before it ever has to get to that point.
[2:53:42.280 --> 2:53:46.280]  And we have to get up off our butts, like you said, and take action.
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:47.280]  You've made the film.
[2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:49.280]  You guys have done it.
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:51.280]  Paul Wittenberg, Liberty Man.
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:53:57.280]  Of course, Wittenberg's great site is framingtheworld.com, at Framing the World on Twitter.
[2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:03.280]  And again, you can find the DVD at infowarstore.com for part one of CoBinLand or CoBinLand.com.
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:05.280]  Text you to get a free copy of Endgame.
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:09.280]  When you get it, get a second copy for $9.95 and get two copies of Endgame.
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:14.280]  So that's two CoBinLand part ones and two Endgames at infowarstore.com.
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:18.280]  We're going to go right to the subpage from CoBinLand.com and help us spread the trailers.
[2:54:18.280 --> 2:54:21.280]  The second trailer went a few days ago from man.video.
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:23.280]  Help us take the clips, put them on your own channel.
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:26.280]  I mean, nothing's going to matter in the future if you don't fight back now.
[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:30.280]  The window's only going to close and then we're going to have the big confrontation.
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:35.280]  Those that have been chosen to be able to go to the next level and merge the machine, which is a fate worse than death.
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:41.280]  And those of us that are going to be killed and, you know, God says no flesh will be spared unless he intervened.
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:43.280]  It's all going to happen. We're going to make it through it.
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:46.280]  Some of us are. Hopefully our children will.
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:48.280]  But I've already resigned. I'm not worried about it.
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:50.280]  I'm just giving full energy against these enemies.
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:54.280]  And guys, have you not felt, I don't know your own personal life, spiritual or whatever,
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:55:00.280]  but obviously you're drawn to fight this, that it's something's happened just the last few months as this evil came into the world.
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:06.280]  Just the last few I have got more energy, more focused, more discernment and more total commitment.
[2:55:06.280 --> 2:55:12.280]  I've never felt such total commitment now that I felt the last two months.
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:14.280]  Yeah, I can I can relate to that.
[2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:25.280]  I just ever since this happened, you know, back in March of 2020, I just have been going nonstop because, you know, I believe this is the most important message right now.
[2:55:25.280 --> 2:55:30.280]  We have to get the truth out about what's happening right now.
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:34.280]  And so this film does empower people to fight back.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:36.280]  And that's what we really want to emphasize.
[2:55:36.280 --> 2:55:44.280]  And so every at the end of every episode, we really try to empower people that, you know, this is the time to fight.
[2:55:44.280 --> 2:55:50.280]  You know, if we don't stand up now, I mean, our future is very dim.
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:53.280]  And comments from you, Liberty Man.
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:56:05.280]  You know, Alex, if you think back 911, and you know this better than anybody, you were awake before that, but you got to see what that false flag did in terms of building a truth movement.
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:12.280]  How much that was the blowback when they when they do these kind of big operations, there's this blowback that it wakes people up.
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:22.280]  And also with the vaccine, you know, it's often said that the anti vaxxers are really not anti vaxxers, they're former vaxxers, people that learn the hard way.
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:35.280]  So if you think about the brazen tyranny that they're engaging in, the human rights violations, the damages that they're causing to people, the lies that they're engaged in, they're going for broke.
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:37.280]  They're clearly in their end game.
[2:56:37.280 --> 2:56:39.280]  There's no doubt about that.
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:44.280]  But it is having a huge knock on effect of waking up a lot of people.
[2:56:44.280 --> 2:56:46.280]  And that's really encouraging.
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:57:00.280]  So I do wake up now and I just have this, you know, bring it kind of attitude, like, you know, come in, come and take it kind of attitude where, you know, I'm not, I'm not, you know, it seems like a lot of people are brainwashed these days.
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:03.280]  I think they're supposed to live forever.
[2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:10.280]  And, you know, I'm of the opinion that no, I have a spiritual life beyond this physical life.
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:16.280]  And I'm not, I'm not going to experience that second death. So I know where I'm going when I die.
[2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:26.280]  And that's, you know, that's, that's a good place to get to, because then you can just get on the battlefield, lean in, trust God, ask him to lead, guide and direct you and let the chips fall where they may.
[2:57:26.280 --> 2:57:32.280]  And just, you know, when you, when you kind of get to that place, you start living and things start working.
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:40.280]  Exactly. And you know, it's about a continuum of humanity and our spiritual life. That's beautifully said. Play a few more clips. I'm going to let you amazing guys go.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:47.280]  And I'm going to get to some of these callers that held them. We got a guest host hanging over.
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:58.280]  I'm 59 years old in good health. I'm not working in the front line. So my type is not recommended to get vaccinated.
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:12.280]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview saying, oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called mRNA vaccine that's really a gene therapy.
[2:58:12.280 --> 2:58:22.280]  He said, you know, he's 57 years old. He's healthy. He doesn't need it. It's at risk people, but that's not what is PR firms that have bought off the politicians over 100 countries.
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:31.280]  They say you've got to take it to have a job or leave your house or get on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day if you live in Australia.
[2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:39.280]  So remember the White House is exempt. Congress and their Stafford exempt. The Postal Service is exempt. All these big corporate heads are exempt.
[2:58:39.280 --> 2:58:47.280]  They're not taking their poison vaccine. They're pushing it on you. Wake up, folks. Wake up.
[2:58:47.280 --> 2:58:58.280]  Christ said, my people perish for lack of knowledge. That's the only way the globalists can win this fight against humanity and bring in this new dark age of tyranny is if the people don't know the truth.
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:11.280]  Now, my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslaved Man, has been out for 14 years, and I'm selling more of the film today than I did back when it came out because it shows the globalist plan for what we're currently seeing happen.
[2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:27.280]  Well, guess what? You can get a copy of this film and make all the copies you want to share it at infowarstore.com for free when you order a new film we produced that's extremely important, just like Endgame is, and that is COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown.
[2:59:27.280 --> 2:59:42.280]  That's how we expose the globalist agenda is with the truth. Get your copy of COVID Land Part 1, The Lockdown, part of a five-part mini-series coming out in the next six months or over the next six months, and you can get a free copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslaved Man with it.
[2:59:42.280 --> 2:59:58.280]  So both films, $9.95, infowarstore.com.
[2:59:58.280 --> 3:00:12.280]  All right, final segment with our guests, and then I'm going to do another segment to talk to DR, Dr. Greg, Chris, John, and Trent, who I appreciate holding over in the last hour.
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:24.280]  I'm going to have a great guest host who's going to be taking over Kate Dahle of the KateDahleShow.com. Gentlemen, I really want to play the rest of these clips and get final comments from you, but here's Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Lee Merritt, and Dale Bigtree.
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:27.280]  Let's play those back to back.
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:43.280]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental. It's never been given to human beings before. Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human beings before.
[3:00:43.280 --> 3:01:04.280]  There are no long-term studies. We don't know what's going to happen inside your body, somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection, or four to six months, or even two years. We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer, how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[3:01:04.280 --> 3:01:17.280]  My conclusion, after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks, I've determined that if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:50.280]  Is it just a healthy person whose body so absolutely kicked this virus's butt that they never had any symptoms? Even so, the body already killed that virus, and maybe there's some floating fragments that a test could pick up, but are they infectious?
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:02:07.280]  Either way, there's still questions on whether or not an asymptomatic carrier even exists, and beyond that, does an asymptomatic carrier spread the disease at all? And almost every study around the world has said that we don't see any evidence of spread from asymptomatic carriers.
[3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:24.280]  Now, that may not seem like a big deal to your average person, but if asymptomatic carriers do not spread this illness, or if they happen to be just a false positive from a bad study, either way, if they're not spreading, then we never should have locked down the world.
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:37.280]  Then masks are totally irrelevant. We can go back to the way we've practiced medicine since polio and smallpox, which is we quarantine sick people, not healthy people. That's what the PCR test did.
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:49.280]  The PCR test set up this false positive that had us start quarantining healthy people for the first time in world history.
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:58.280]  Man, great sound, great video, even better content, because that's over the top. And by the way, Dr. Lee Merritt is coming up with the guest host.
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:09.280]  And so I'm going to hurry as fast as I can for these guys to go because you want to hear everything she has to say and tell people to tune in right now however you're listening. Gentlemen, both of you, about a minute, final comment.
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:20.280]  Well, I really appreciate you giving us this opportunity, Alex. And remember, guys, go out, get your copy of this first episode. Episode two is in post sound right now.
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:34.280]  And so that should be out totally and ready to go late November. And so guys, just support this film series. And again, I appreciate it, Alex.
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:42.280]  We're in a boat together that they're poking holes in. We're trying to patch it together. So I must ask the listeners for their own good and for my good, get the film.
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:56.280]  And I want to thank the gentleman Liberty, may I know his real name, for financing this and doing a first rate job. All the 50 people you interviewed, all the crew, you did a first rate job, and you put out a million dollar production out of your own pocket.
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:07.280]  And now, again, you're trying to raise money for the people that actually volunteered their time, like the directors, everybody can get paid and you're supporting info war. So thank you so much, Liberty man.
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:09.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:04:09.280 --> 3:04:12.280]  30 seconds. Anything else?
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:29.280]  Really quick. You know, getting the DVD, we've seen some people saying, well, DVD, well, you know, hey, the 1990s is calling. Hey, people like if they're going to memory hold things like crazy and you can't expect that band on video is going to be around forever.
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:36.280]  You know, 10 years from now, you're going to want your own copy of this to show show your kids.
[3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:49.280]  Absolutely. It's vital to archive things now. We've got to make a bigger issue out of that. You're dead right. Thank you so much, sir. Get the film at covidland.com now, your free copy of in game covid land pre orders all get a copy of in game.
[3:04:49.280 --> 3:04:57.280]  The opportunity ends in about a week and a half, two weeks to start shipping out and you start making copies. We'll be right back. Thank you.
[3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:06.280]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to communicate, then you don't have a future.
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:17.280]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population and America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN globals directed great reset.
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:29.280]  That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy. That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products and 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:39.280]  That's only about 1213 days as the time we're taping this and that means all of these amazing products. We have ultra 12 highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:48.280]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue. Amazing. We've got knock out the sleep pay. We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well.
[3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:56.280]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at infowarstore.com and it keeps us on the air. Take action and I thank you.
[3:05:56.280 --> 3:06:16.280]  Dr. Lee Merritt is one of the best guests you can get. She's hardcore. She gets us as a war and she's going to be the guest with Kate Dowley coming up just a few minutes and I had loaded phones.
[3:06:16.280 --> 3:06:26.280]  I'm going to try to jam them in this call, but I'm going to call those callers back tomorrow. But I saw one person saying they're a doctor. Caller is doctor on Bill Gates, Microsoft and vaccine.
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:31.280]  So I wanted to get Dr. Greg's quick comments here on air. Thanks for holding Greg.
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:52.280]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I would like to give you some information on physician intimidation that's been going on that I haven't seen. But also just one quick parallel that I haven't come across, but I thought was kind of interesting as I was thinking about the perpetual gene therapy that proposed to perpetuate forever now.
[3:06:52.280 --> 3:07:06.280]  You were talking about Bill Gates earlier and I find it interesting that it's very similar to the way that he gained so much power and became one of the richest people in the world with the Windows operating system.
[3:07:06.280 --> 3:07:26.280]  He introduced his operating system that was intentionally flawed and always required updates and a new version. Otherwise, it would no longer work. It would become infested with viruses. You couldn't run the latest software and you're perpetually on the hook to continue to buy product.
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:40.280]  Have you come across that parallel? I mean, I have personally thought of that myself and I've seen people go. This is the same guy that sold his computers that broke all the time. So he had to buy patches and absolutely this is the ultimate medical
[3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:50.280]  tyranny where they give you something that destroys your immune system makes you sick. And then they blame the people that were smart enough not to take it for the ones making you sick. So they're just praying on the medically ignorant.
[3:07:50.280 --> 3:08:03.280]  Yeah, I thought that was an interesting parallel. But the main thing I wanted to let you and the listeners know about is the intimidation that's being handed out to physicians across the country.
[3:08:03.280 --> 3:08:22.280]  A few weeks ago, the Federation of State Medical Board, which is a body who is involved in interstate licensing and applications for licensing, issued a statement basically saying if there's any, of course, they parse the words carefully, but if there's any false information
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:34.280]  given out or if there's any any questionable dissemination of information that they could get involved in in limiting or eliminating physician licensure.
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:47.280]  Well, that's right. In California, they've said if you give more than five vaccine waivers, we're going to take your license. But so many doctors are saying no, they can't get them all. But yeah, whatever the UN and Fauci says, the guy that cooked us up now, they admit that's why he's got to go down.
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:52.280]  Whatever he says, the medical boards then bow down to these are sick people.
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:09:09.280]  So this was the Federation of State Medical Board several weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago, there was a joint statement put forth by the American Board of Family Medicine, the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Pediatrics.
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:28.280]  And basically, they say that any misinformation regarding this virus, it could be very dangerous and that that could be subject to, again, removal of licensure or limiting your licensure.
[3:09:28.280 --> 3:09:42.280]  And in that same statement, which you can, you'll be able to find that and read that the only assertive statement that they made was that the vaccine was safe, effective and widely available.
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:53.280]  And it's proposed that any information that might question that could be used to eliminate your board certification.
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:10:01.280]  It's crazy because it was never properly approved. It's not safe. They have warnings on it about heart attacks and microcharitis. That's incredible, isn't it?
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:14.280]  It is incredible. And apparently, if that might come across their statement that this is safe, then you could be subject to disciplinary action. And this is actually being carried out.
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:16.280]  My local hospital is.
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:26.280]  Oh, what you ought to do is sue them and then show them the possible adverse reactions from October of last year from the FDA's own website. Do you know about that?
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:33.280]  Um, no, I haven't, I haven't done deep into that one, but put it back on screen guys, I'll read it to him.
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:43.280]  FDA Safety Surveillance Cup of 19 vaccines working list of possible adverse event outcomes. And it says all the stuff that actually happened later so that they know.
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:53.280]  Yeah, unfortunately, you know, most physicians are generally compliant people, especially to organizations that are sort of oversight.
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:59.280]  And they put lackeys in a lot of those boards that tell the line of a big farmer that's taken over medicine.
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:12.280]  And most people want to enjoy their quiet life that they've worked hard to achieve. So, you know, it's really only when push comes to shove and people are out of the job that I think that you're going to you're going to find people pushing back on a mass scale from the.
[3:11:12.280 --> 3:11:21.280]  And you're also going to have people exiting the main line doctors and coming to people like you regardless and so we appreciate you sir. Thanks for holding Dr. Greg for that information.
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:23.280]  All right, Dr. Lee.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:26.280]  Merritt is about to be interviewed.
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:36.280]  You do not want to miss this information with the great talk show host that is here taking over Kate dally show.com is her website and Kate.
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:41.280]  Thank you so much for taking over we really appreciate you can't wait to watch the interview.
[3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:45.280]  Thank you.
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:48.280]  And here she is live go ahead take.
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:54.280]  Thank you so much Alex really appreciate that and wow your last segment. Wow.
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:12:00.280]  Well, you know, I'll tell you what Dr. Lee Merritt one of the most powerful frontline doctors.
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:10.280]  And I am just a pleasure to call her a friend. What can I say she's been on my show multiple times Alex you've interviewed her and and let me tell you Dr. Lee Merritt frontline doctor.
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:17.280]  We're going to really talk and and center today on how to stay out of the hospital.
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:23.280]  What can you do this this episode is going to change lives and I welcome Dr. Lee Merritt.
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:34.280]  She's been a private practice since 1995 orthopedic spinal surgery and also past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:43.280]  I just love the scale. She just speaks the truth. What can I say and the medical rebel.com is the website. Welcome Dr. Lee Merritt. How are you.
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:45.280]  Nice to see you Kate.
[3:12:45.280 --> 3:12:56.280]  You too. I am so glad you're joining me because my inbox is flooded with messages of how do what do I do and usually people are already in the hospital.
[3:12:56.280 --> 3:13:06.280]  Usually people are freaking out because their loved one is being vented against their will because they are shut out of the hospital because they are the doctors will not listen to them.
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:15.280]  And if I told you how many emails you'd be floored about how many countrywide have been coming in with the same exact story. And this is so disturbing.
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:26.280]  So really the goal is how can we keep people out of the hospital as fluent and cold season and pneumonia season. Yes we actually still have those things are coming into play.
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:35.280]  And everyone thinks they have covid so they go to the hospital and get tested. And and then of course they get on the covid train the covid track which is just horrible medication.
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:43.280]  So what do you tell people. What do you say to them to say keep them out of the hospital. Dr. Merritt.
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:57.280]  Well I think first of all I think we're in a very close crisis right now and people need to take this seriously. You know I still get people calling me who need help but they have nothing at home.
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:10.280]  They've not stopped up. They don't have the right equipment. So I'm going to tell you I was just talking to my local hardware guy and I've heard the story that truckers are going to strike on or stop moving things on October 1st.
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:19.280]  Well I don't know if that's true but I can tell you that they at the hardware store he says we can't get truckers to move things right now. So we're out we're running out of things.
[3:14:19.280 --> 3:14:29.280]  And I think that's a you know harbinger of things to come here shortly so people should not wait. Personally I think everybody needs and they need some equipment in the house.
[3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:42.280]  The pulse oximeter and a nebulizer. That's been just so valuable in keeping people out of the hospital because one of the problems with whatever this bio weaponized disease is.
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:54.280]  We can call it COVID but keep in mind we don't really know too much about this except we do have some principles for treatment and one of the things we're seeing is that people's oxygen drops more than we would predict looking at them.
[3:14:54.280 --> 3:15:02.280]  So we needed pulse oximeter especially to do telemedicine. That really is useful so go get some equipment. That's number one.
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:16.280]  Number two the FDA has just stopped shipments of ivermectin coming into the country. Now you know we're at war with our own government. Japan has just said we're going to do FDA.
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:31.280]  I mean we're going to ignore all the FDA and WHO and we're going to use ivermectin. India is using ivermectin. There are multiple countries now where ivermectin is not only approved but you know that is the official policy.
[3:15:31.280 --> 3:15:36.280]  And yet we are at the point of not letting our people get it who are desperate. Think about that.
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:50.280]  El Salvador they actually get the COVID kit and it has ivermectin in it and vitamin C and all these wonderful things. We're going to come back from a break in just a moment. You're not going to want to miss this because this actually can save your life or loved one's life.
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:16:17.280]  Make sure to stay with us.
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:38.280]  Hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture. Me too. But listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:45.280]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that I certainly do.
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:55.280]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:17:02.280]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com. No cures or treatments there.

[3:18:57.280 --> 3:19:07.280]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in World War II that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:11.280]  And then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[3:19:11.280 --> 3:19:15.280]  And finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up.
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:23.280]  The Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again.
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:30.280]  Well that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports. They even admit it.
[3:19:30.280 --> 3:19:37.280]  Now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:41.280]  That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll accept anything.
[3:19:41.280 --> 3:19:47.280]  So again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:20:08.280]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:21.280]  Hi there. I'm Kate Daly from The Kate Daly Show. So glad you could join me today because what an important episode this is.
[3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:28.280]  If you would like to save a life or save your own this is the episode you need to share with every family member and friend.
[3:20:28.280 --> 3:20:38.280]  My guest is frontline doctor one of my favorites Dr. Lee Merritt the medical rebel dot com. And let me just say you're fantastic doctor.
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:49.280]  I absolutely adore you because you're willing to speak the truth and we have a lot of people out there wondering what to do and you just talked about two very important things to acquire to have at home.
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:55.280]  And I would get these in a hurry. I really would. I would make sure you have these two items. You'll probably help a friend or a family member or yourself.
[3:20:55.280 --> 3:20:58.280]  Those two items again Dr. Merritt.
[3:20:58.280 --> 3:21:05.280]  Pulse oxymeter to check your blood oxygen level just goes on your finger and a nebulizer.
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:13.280]  And the other one I guess is a thermometer. I'm kind of surprised how many people don't have a basic thermometer and I wouldn't get a battery thermometer.
[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:19.280]  You know I still have my dad's old mercury thermometers and I'm I'm hanging on to them for their dear life.
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:25.280]  But they've taken the North gear away from us but they still have non battery thermometers that work. So yeah I would do that.
[3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:32.280]  And and then the other thing the next first step I would take like I said get some ivermectin however you can get it.
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:39.280]  Overseas pharmacies might be able to get it to you but the FDA has had now has the US Postal Service interdicting this at the border.
[3:21:39.280 --> 3:21:46.280]  So sometimes it gets through sometimes it doesn't. It takes at least a month or more to get it over from overseas so get it now.
[3:21:46.280 --> 3:21:55.280]  The other thing is if you're on medications right now that are critical say a heart medicine or a or a blood pressure medicine something you can't do without you better stock up.
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:04.280]  Now your insurance will say oh you can only have this month or these 90 days but you can pay cash and don't let them tell you you can't.
[3:22:04.280 --> 3:22:10.280]  If you need to go I love the independent pharmacies there's so much better to work with but Walgreens has been OK.
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:21.280]  I haven't had a problem with them and Walmart there. I'm not saying all of them are bad but but you need to stock up and even if you have to pay cash if you're like if you need insulin for sure any of those critical medicines.
[3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:33.280]  And by the way medicine if you save it the Army did a study and medicine actually doesn't expire except for a couple EpiPens and tetracycline type drugs but everything else.
[3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:42.280]  The Army study showed they lasted 30 years and they still hadn't they hadn't become bad after it's kept at a reasonable temperature.
[3:22:42.280 --> 3:22:51.280]  So and then then we know about the supplements that matter and I've got them listed and why you take them on my website but just to keep in mind they're not expensive.
[3:22:51.280 --> 3:23:03.280]  Vitamin C vitamin D zinc selenium in acetyl cysteine corcitin lysine and either betaine or dimethylglycine. That's my list of absolutely essential medications.
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:15.280]  And by the way the WHO lists Iver Mectin as one of the essential medications for world health. Doesn't that tell you something and we are a country that can't get it.
[3:23:15.280 --> 3:23:30.280]  Nobel Prize winner 2015 because of its safety and efficacy and so it's important to take also you want to speak to a doctor or frontline doctor at my free doctor dot com or the frontline America's frontline doctors or go to the medical rebel dot com.
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:38.280]  But the but the dose in the first first several days needs to be a little a little heavier right with Iver Mectin little bigger.
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:47.280]  So we started out giving about 12 milligrams to everybody. And then we realized that's not enough. So now if you're sick. Now this is not prophylaxis but if you're sick.
[3:23:47.280 --> 3:24:00.280]  The dose now ranges from 0.4 milligrams to 0.6 milligrams per kilogram per day. And unfortunately even if you get your doctor to prescribe it at a pharmacy.
[3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:11.280]  My experience is that they only have three milligram tablets and to get enough. It's very expensive. Now they've raised the prices and often the pharmacies are out and their warehouses are out.
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:23.280]  So we're in big trouble. I'm telling you get what you can now. However you get it. Yeah. The essential medications don't you think that's something people are talking about the horse paste the veterinary use one.
[3:24:23.280 --> 3:24:25.280]  And did you want to comment on that.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:37.280]  Sure. I mean I used to not ever say go out and get veterinary medicine. But I'm going to tell you not only can people not afford the pharmaceutical dose of Iver Mectin sometimes if they don't have insurance.
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:50.280]  But it's also not available. So in I have no problem with that. I found out at least this is what I've been told that the Iver Mectin for cattle comes right off the same production line as the Iver Mectin for humans.
[3:24:50.280 --> 3:25:05.280]  They could put other things in it. But as far as I know reading the labels I think I think it's OK. And now I can't. This is not official medical advice. Now I will tell you the injectable what I like is the injectable one percent solution is for IV.
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:12.280]  Now you're not going to inject it in yourself. You're going to take it oral and it tastes bad. But who cares at this point. You know.
[3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:24.280]  I think we we're in a wartime situation here and we need to act like it. I just I'm going to say that. And I really like now Scott Kessler Center at Bard's FM has a great idea.
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:31.280]  Then and it's you know I had this idea several people kind of came all this up together. But when I was talking to him he'd really thought it out in detail.
[3:25:31.280 --> 3:25:40.280]  Just like you have food co-ops and people buy organic food and non GMO food and food co-ops have a medical co-op and get some equipment.
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:48.280]  Yeah I do too. So for example you have a friendly nurse or retired physician that you want to get in here and that can help put in IV.
[3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:58.280]  You haven't his point is have that the evidence there's evidence that a hyperbaric oxygen chamber can keep people from progressing that can really help people that are sick.
[3:25:58.280 --> 3:26:06.280]  And there are other things you know just have durable medical equipment the things that you all everybody doesn't need an IV.
[3:26:06.280 --> 3:26:13.280]  Holder in their house but if you had a co-op that had these things and everybody participated in your area that were like minded.
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:20.280]  You could really stock up with a lot of things and then when somebody needed it they you know pay for the service pay for the use but it could be nominal.
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:26.280]  I think that's a great idea and I think he's going to be talking about on his show this week but I think it's a good idea.
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:35.280]  You know I there's a couple things I tell people to do after our experience and that is when you start getting sick and you can feel it starting to go into your your chest a little bit.
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:40.280]  So you know it might be something a little deeper than the first thing I would do is go find a IV nutraceutical clinic.
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:43.280]  These are private businesses no doctor no script.
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:48.280]  Go get a vitamin C infusion of glutathione vitamin C and and zinc.
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:27:01.280]  And that's the first thing because you'll feel better immediately usually and and then also order maybe BUDESINIDE for the nebulizer because BUDESINIDE and these are things the hospitals are refusing to do now.
[3:27:01.280 --> 3:27:09.280]  Absolutely refusing to their patients by the way and BUDESINIDE is on page 205 of the 341 page protocol says it's amazing.
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:16.280]  Just says that too few people were in the study of course but it's doing great things and you can get that from your doctor for the nebulizer right.
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:26.280]  Right you can and some doctors I mean most doctors that's not one of those hot button medicines like a hypermectin and hydroxychloride and so most doctors will prescribe that.
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:39.280]  The other thing though is like the Browns thing at the Brownstein protocol or Dr. McColl is protocol using what you can do without a prescription is a drop of hydrogen peroxide and a 30 percent.
[3:27:39.280 --> 3:27:48.280]  I mean I mean a drop of iodine in a solution that's two parts water or three parts water to one part hydrogen peroxide that seems to work very well.
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:28:00.280]  But the point here is if you if you have ivermectin or hydroxychloric when at home and you start getting sick the earlier you implement it the less medicine you'll need and the quicker you get over it.
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:09.280]  One of the problems that we were seeing all the people doing telemedicine is that people now they're getting a little it's kind of different this year they're kind of getting a little bit sick.
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:20.280]  And so they don't think it's worthwhile calling a doctor and they kind of putz around for 10 days and they're just slowly getting worse but finally when they need one then they're about ready to drop off that cliff.
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:27.280]  It seems to go you know not very serious not very serious and won't you lose your oxygen carrying capacity so don't like to.
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:38.280]  We're going to come right back more with Dr. Lee Merritt and of course the frontline doctors the medical rebel she has right on her website Dr. Lee Merritt how to get hydroxychloroquine.
[3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:46.280]  So we'll be right back you can go to Kate dally radio dot com for the podcast you can go to Kate dally radio dot com for show notes all of this will be in show notes there.
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:56.280]  And so visit the site and we will be right back don't go anywhere you're not going to want to miss this next segment as well this could save your life.
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:10.280]  You know listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this together.
[3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:15.280]  And you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey I got great products please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:25.280]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:32.280]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out and open our credibility is going up.
[3:29:32.280 --> 3:29:34.280]  That's why we've got to be taken off there.
[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:36.280]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:36.280 --> 3:29:40.280]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:29:40.280 --> 3:29:45.280]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:45.280 --> 3:29:47.280]  Because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready.
[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:53.280]  So thank you all and get an info war store dot com get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and so much more.
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:29:55.280]  They're wonderful products and they support the info war.
[3:29:55.280 --> 3:29:56.280]  Thank you.
[3:29:56.280 --> 3:30:12.280]  In late August info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:30:12.280 --> 3:30:16.280]  Now ladies and gentlemen storeable food has always been something that's important to have.
[3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:23.280]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration self defense and a relationship with God.
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:27.280]  But now more than ever you need to get your storeable food orders in now.

[3:31:58.280 --> 3:32:05.280]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart even my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[3:32:05.280 --> 3:32:21.280]  I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[3:32:21.280 --> 3:32:32.280]  And now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled.
[3:32:32.280 --> 3:32:49.280]  20 and I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[3:32:49.280 --> 3:32:59.280]  This is the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:08.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:08.280 --> 3:33:19.280]  I welcome back a deli here from the K deli show.
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:32.280]  Thank you Alex for having me and I have such an important guest before I come back to Dr. Lee Merritt because we're talking about the things that you need to have right now in your home to help others and help yourself.
[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:42.280]  I want to play this from Bill Gates. This is Bill Gates Munich 2017 February telling us what was coming by the way.
[3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:47.280]  Please welcome Mr. Bill Gates.
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:34:06.280]  We also face a new threat that the next epidemic has a good chance of originated on a computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus or a contagious contagious and highly deadly strain of flu.
[3:34:06.280 --> 3:34:27.280]  So the point is that we ignore the strong link between health security and international security at our peril. Whether it occurs by the quirk of nature at the hand of a terrorist epidemiologists show through their models that a respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[3:34:27.280 --> 3:34:34.280]  And there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[3:34:34.280 --> 3:34:39.280]  Yeah he's the quirk of nature and he's the terrorist. He just didn't tell you that.
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:50.280]  Well that was from Bill Gates 2017 and it's a little scary isn't it to to think that these people are at the helm never elected over our health and education but never elected.
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:35:05.280]  My guest is Dr. Lee Merritt frontline doctor the medical rebel dot com you're going to want to go to her site such valuable information. You know let's I wanted to I want to ask you a question to Iver Mekton and hydroxychloroquine can you take them together.
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:07.280]  Should you take you can.
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:18.280]  Yeah you can take them together. I'm not sure that you need to but you know we we we did say that hydroxychloroquine works really great early on.
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:25.280]  And Iver Mekton works pretty much any time but certainly later we don't see as much benefit from hydroxychloroquine as we do Iver Mekton.
[3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:28.280]  That's really kind of the rule of thumb that people are going by.
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:43.280]  But keep in mind because the psychopaths running this outbreak did not do what they should have done to really help us understand the disease and what we're really dealing with like doing autopsies of the dead.
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:51.280]  That would have been very nice. We don't really completely know what we're dealing with and that's why I was going to say we left out antibiotics.
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:36:05.280]  But I think having some doxycycline zithromycin some antibiotics around the house is a great thing also because don't get snockered into the idea is all viral viral viral.
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:15.280]  One of the things that happens after people have been debilitated and sick from one thing is you can get a secondary bacterial infection or even even worse.
[3:36:15.280 --> 3:36:25.280]  I'm going to tell you years ago probably we've all become infected thanks to a different bio weapon here with mycoplasma a crystalline form of mycoplasma that can be reactivated.
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:30.280]  So we're learning lots of things about our medical history we didn't appreciate.
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:37.280]  And I know that's kind of scary. But that may also be happening. We're seeing a bunch of mycoplasma like diseases crop up.
[3:36:37.280 --> 3:36:45.280]  So you have to have antibiotics sometimes. Absolutely. And you know the shedding off of the vaccine the spike proteins.
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:51.280]  I mean what is that causing is that causing a lot because I'm seeing vaccinated and unvaccinated getting sick.
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:55.280]  So I'm sorry that they're playing this card to the Hilton hospitals and I don't believe it.
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:03.280]  By the way that's a good thing to bring up. Don't believe the diet tribe that it's just the unvaccinated getting sick.
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:11.280]  Because it turns out that they're not labeling you as vaccinated unless you're two weeks past your last dose.
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:14.280]  So you could have had one dose and you're not vaccinated in their mind.
[3:37:14.280 --> 3:37:18.280]  And then you have another dose and you're still not vaccinated until you go two weeks out.
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:25.280]  And the other thing we're discovering is yeah I mean so so when they say they're unvaccinated well not by normal definitions.
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:32.280]  And we have we're seeing the damage from the vaccines if you're going to have a brain bleed or our Guillain Barre or things.
[3:37:32.280 --> 3:37:37.280]  It tends to happen within four to seven days after the vaccine where they would not consider you vaccinated.
[3:37:37.280 --> 3:37:44.280]  That's a good way to get rid of all the complications of the vaccine. So don't let anybody be snockered about that.
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:51.280]  Absolutely. I take an NAC and a quercetin every day.
[3:37:51.280 --> 3:37:55.280]  And I was wondering about that. You might want to let people know.
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:37:58.280]  You know if you're sick do you triple dose double dose those things.
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:06.280]  And what do they do as far as being an antiviral as far as being you know what why would you recommend NAC and quercetin.
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:15.280]  Well quercetin is just a good anti-inflammatory. I mean NAC actually helps produce glutathione in the brain and other places.
[3:38:15.280 --> 3:38:18.280]  You can't you know unless I like the idea and I did this too.
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:25.280]  I went down to one of the chelation areas in town in Omaha and had IV glutathione.
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:31.280]  And because I had gotten shed on and I really think that's one of the things that can help.
[3:38:31.280 --> 3:38:37.280]  It's an oxidant. It's an antioxidant. I mean so it really helps I think degrade what we're dealing with.
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:44.280]  The issue is don't think you're going to just suddenly take these things when you get sick and it's going to do you the best.
[3:38:44.280 --> 3:38:49.280]  What you really need to do is live an anti-inflammatory lifestyle starting now if you haven't been doing it.
[3:38:49.280 --> 3:38:55.280]  And that is key is your diet. I really like a couple books.
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:39:03.280]  The Wheat Belly book by cardiologist William Davis and I like Grain Brain by Dr. Perlmutter who's a neurologist.
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:09.280]  He talks about all the different ways that our food is damaging us and it makes us inflammatory.
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:20.280]  If you're over your weight standards you have more inflammation in the body and that means you're likely to succumb if you get sick with these diseases.
[3:39:20.280 --> 3:39:30.280]  Because this gives you an inflammatory overshoot. That's one of the ways that the way people die is they get so much inflammation in their lungs that they cannot oxygenate.
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:37.280]  That's one of the pathways. So being shed on by somebody that's vaccinated is a real thing.
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:43.280]  And I know my experience. I mean I had a nosebleed and I never get nosebleeds ever in my life.
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:55.280]  So this is a massive nosebleed first time and I'd been having some other symptoms that I felt were just like viral symptoms after I was in close contact with somebody for a long period of time that was vaccinated.
[3:39:55.280 --> 3:40:01.280]  So it happened about four to five days afterwards. The issue there is and I have this on the website.
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:07.280]  I would treat it fairly aggressively because I think it's the spike protein.
[3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:21.280]  And I and I've come to this conclusion. Nobody knows for sure. But we know from the autopsies that have happened that if you you know people that die of COVID for example that their spike protein or die after the vaccine.
[3:40:21.280 --> 3:40:32.280]  There's spike protein in the hair follicles. So you're leaching out the spike protein in your sweat in your saliva in bodily fluids.
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:41.280]  And so my experience was I managed to transfer that to my husband who then got classic COVID. I mean he had all the all the classic signs.
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:47.280]  So I think it's spike protein and we should. And so I have on the website how to deal with spike protein.
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:57.280]  Now the vaccine is a different story. If you take the vaccine and you have remorse you have a different thing you're dealing with because you also have all the products of the vaccine that we know about.
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:41:03.280]  We don't know about most of them because they don't have to tell us isn't that wonderful when you do things under emergency use authorization.
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:10.280]  It's great. You can just tell us the very littlest part of the vaccine and you have to tell us the rest. But these are not vaccines.
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:23.280]  They actually call them viral based genetic therapies. And we found the FDA's warning to their researchers in 2015 about the viral based genetic therapies.
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:29.280]  They say these things people that take them can shed and they can shed up to 10 weeks. Most of them stop at 10 weeks.
[3:41:29.280 --> 3:41:36.280]  But if you're elderly or immune compromised you might shed forever. And you'll love this one because it just tells you keep in mind.
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:45.280]  They've rolled these these agents these genetic agents out on the whole world. They want to vaccinate 7.8 billion people and they don't know what the shed particles are.
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:53.280]  They say it's just not sickening. It could be genetic. It could be infectious. We don't know. And it could be recombinant. I love that.
[3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:57.280]  We could be some Frankenstein nanoparticle. There's there's a couple of things.
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:05.280]  Butesonide is a steroid and it was the steroid recommended by Dr. Richard Jewel. And it's an amazing steroid.
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:11.280]  You can get the butesonide and the nebulizer just to have that also comes in an inhaler. But the nebulizer is better.
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:18.280]  And then also N.A.C. I've heard that the FDA is going to be taking that off the shelf that you might not be able to get that past January.
[3:42:18.280 --> 3:42:27.280]  So I would recommend stocking up on that. I don't even think Amazon even sells it anymore. And so I would make sure N.A.C. and the proper name for N.A.C. Dr. Merritt.
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:35.280]  Anacetyl cysteine. Anacetyl cysteine. And doesn't that say something that the FDA every time we find something that works there against it.
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:46.280]  They take it away from us. I remember them. I know. In fact, when we come back in just a moment, I'm Kate Daly.
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:52.280]  And honestly, Dr. Lee Merritt, you're not going to want to miss two seconds of this. Come on back.
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:56.280]  The Kate Daly show. Kate Daly, your host. And you can go to the.

[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:57.280]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[3:43:57.280 --> 3:44:06.280]  General Lee, it's General Milley. I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the U.S. government two days ago on January 6th.
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:13.280]  I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attack's coming.
[3:44:13.280 --> 3:44:22.280]  That is from the transcript. Then he called Pelosi Schumer and others to say, I'm loyal to you. I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons.
[3:44:22.280 --> 3:44:27.280]  When Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time, and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie.
[3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:37.280]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened. Hell, she bragged back on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous person.
[3:44:37.280 --> 3:44:45.280]  So we're all these other Democrats. So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows publicly.
[3:44:45.280 --> 3:44:56.280]  Remember, these people literally hate you and your family. Now they're injecting you with poison soft kill injections. Wake up America or be destroyed.
[3:44:56.280 --> 3:45:03.280]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:09.280]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[3:45:09.280 --> 3:45:17.280]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:45:17.280 --> 3:45:23.280]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:45:23.280 --> 3:45:32.280]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:45:32.280 --> 3:45:39.280]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family.
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:46.280]  And they're also funding our operation info wars store.com info wars store.com is incredible.
[3:45:46.280 --> 3:45:52.280]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others.

[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:05.280]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future.
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:11.280]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population.
[3:46:11.280 --> 3:46:16.280]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN globals directed great reset.
[3:46:16.280 --> 3:46:21.280]  That's why it's more important than ever that info wars stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy.
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:29.280]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products and 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.

[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:03.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:03.280 --> 3:47:05.280]  Thank you.
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:38.280]  And there's a couple of questions I have for you.
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:42.280]  Before I do that, I want to play the clip from Dr. David Martin.
[3:47:42.280 --> 3:47:45.280]  He is the founding CEO of MCAM Inc.
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:50.280]  Which is the international leader in intellectual property and financial risk.
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:53.280]  Just listen to what he has to say for just a moment.
[3:47:53.280 --> 3:48:01.280]  We took the actual genetic sequences that were reportedly novel
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:13.280]  and reviewed those against the patent records that were available as of the spring of 2020.
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:21.280]  And what we found, as you'll see in this report, are over 120 patented pieces of evidence
[3:48:21.280 --> 3:48:30.280]  to suggest that the declaration of a novel coronavirus was actually entirely a fallacy.
[3:48:30.280 --> 3:48:33.280]  There was no novel coronavirus.
[3:48:33.280 --> 3:48:42.280]  The statement that was made by Peter Daschik in 2015 reported in the National Academies of Press publication,
[3:48:42.280 --> 3:48:46.280]  February 12, 2016, and I'm quoting,
[3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:55.280]  We need to increase public understanding of the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus vaccine.
[3:48:55.280 --> 3:49:01.280]  A key driver is the media and the economics will follow the hype.
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:06.280]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[3:49:06.280 --> 3:49:12.280]  Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process.
[3:49:12.280 --> 3:49:16.280]  End quote.
[3:49:16.280 --> 3:49:25.280]  When you go to the hospital right now, most likely you will be positive for COVID-19 because the test has ratcheted up to 40 magnifications.
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:31.280]  And the problem with that is that you get on the COVID train and you can't get off of the COVID train.
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:39.280]  So I'm getting desperate emails from people all over the country who they cannot control what happens to their loved one when they go to the ICU.
[3:49:39.280 --> 3:49:47.280]  And when they get to the ICU, they're given, I call it rem deathivir, rem deathivir and dex as a steroid.
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:52.280]  And there's an antibiotic they're giving them. I'll probably murder the name. I'm the name murderer.
[3:49:52.280 --> 3:50:02.280]  But as far as the drugs that they're giving, the rem deathivir actually failed the Ebola study and had a 54% mortality rate.
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:08.280]  They took it off that and Fauci chose it for the drug around the country to treat COVID.
[3:50:08.280 --> 3:50:13.280]  So what happens is your organs fail, right, Dr. Merritt? And they can. And kidney damage.
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:19.280]  And so I call it the Kevorkian method. Well, at least Kevorkian smiled and asked.
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:27.280]  But as per mission. But as far as that goes, you're given this protocol. You cannot now ask for vitamins.
[3:50:27.280 --> 3:50:32.280]  You can't ask for butasinide. You can't ask for any of these things they will deny you.
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:35.280]  And if you speak up, sometimes they're throwing people out of the hospital.
[3:50:35.280 --> 3:50:44.280]  So in order to stay away from having to go down the COVID train to having to get and feel like you have no rights or no control over this.
[3:50:44.280 --> 3:50:49.280]  Dr. Merritt is here to describe what you can do if you're sick so that you can avoid that.
[3:50:49.280 --> 3:50:55.280]  Dr. Peter McCullough was talking about this, that the awesome Dr. Peter McCullough, he was saying, why are we not treating this?
[3:50:55.280 --> 3:50:59.280]  Why are we not telling people what to do at home so they don't have to go to the hospital?
[3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:06.280]  So I have a couple of questions for you. I tell people to go get the IV, the vitamin push, to help them.
[3:51:06.280 --> 3:51:11.280]  And then also, NAC and quercetin, right? These are helpful. Ivermectin.
[3:51:11.280 --> 3:51:15.280]  If you had to choose between Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which one would you choose?
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:20.280]  Well, the Ivermectin works kind of all, there's like 20 ways it works against this.
[3:51:20.280 --> 3:51:24.280]  And so it works all parts of the disease, not just at the beginning.
[3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:29.280]  So I think I would, if I had to choose one, I'd choose Ivermectin.
[3:51:29.280 --> 3:51:35.280]  Now, you know, your point about the people need to understand that the hospitals are now owned by NIH.
[3:51:35.280 --> 3:51:42.280]  That's what is causing this. Remdesivir was actually developed at our bio weapons lab at USAMRAD.
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:47.280]  And the NIH has part of the patent rights. So they get money from it.
[3:51:47.280 --> 3:51:53.280]  I would quit taking advice from people that are making a profit off this pandemic.
[3:51:53.280 --> 3:51:59.280]  You know, if the pandemic went away and somebody makes less money, they're not the people you should be listening to.
[3:51:59.280 --> 3:52:04.280]  And they're having an incredibly bad outcome or ratio in the hospital.
[3:52:04.280 --> 3:52:09.280]  But again, good outpatient care, and you don't have to go down with these things.
[3:52:09.280 --> 3:52:13.280]  But again, you have to remember, sometimes you're going to need antibiotics,
[3:52:13.280 --> 3:52:16.280]  but being as healthy going into it makes a big difference.
[3:52:16.280 --> 3:52:20.280]  Be within your weight standards, eat an anti-inflammatory diet.
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:25.280]  You know, every time you, unfortunately, every time you eat bad oils,
[3:52:25.280 --> 3:52:30.280]  and you get them when you go out to restaurants, even good restaurants, you're going to get some bad oils.
[3:52:30.280 --> 3:52:35.280]  And the percentage to which you eat bad oils is the percentage your lipid membranes,
[3:52:35.280 --> 3:52:39.280]  which are made of oil, including your brain, are made of cholesterol from these oils.
[3:52:39.280 --> 3:52:44.280]  When you eat bad oils, they become intercalated into your lipid membranes.
[3:52:44.280 --> 3:52:47.280]  And so the percentage you take in is the percentage of you that's not normal.
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:50.280]  It makes you inflame these bad oils.
[3:52:50.280 --> 3:52:55.280]  It's a real simple, there's a real simple eating suggestion that I've heard years ago,
[3:52:55.280 --> 3:53:02.280]  the big workout guru, I'm blanking on his name now, he was in the 50s and 60s,
[3:53:02.280 --> 3:53:06.280]  it was a big workout guru, and he said, if man made it.
[3:53:06.280 --> 3:53:07.280]  Who?
[3:53:07.280 --> 3:53:08.280]  Jacqueline?
[3:53:08.280 --> 3:53:10.280]  You said that.
[3:53:10.280 --> 3:53:12.280]  Yeah, Jacqueline, I don't know.
[3:53:12.280 --> 3:53:14.280]  Jacqueline, yeah.
[3:53:14.280 --> 3:53:17.280]  Yeah, he said, if man made it, don't eat it.
[3:53:17.280 --> 3:53:21.280]  You know, and it's like, we have artificial wheat that's not really wheat.
[3:53:21.280 --> 3:53:22.280]  It's not genetically wheat.
[3:53:22.280 --> 3:53:24.280]  We make all sorts of things about it.
[3:53:24.280 --> 3:53:27.280]  My great grandparents, they ate very little wheat.
[3:53:27.280 --> 3:53:30.280]  But now 75% of the average American diet is made of wheat.
[3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:35.280]  That's why I recommend wheat belly, because you'll learn all the things that does to your body that are not good.
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:37.280]  And it is a huge producer of inflammation.
[3:53:37.280 --> 3:53:43.280]  So if you wanted to do one thing, there he is, I love him, lived into his knowledge.
[3:53:43.280 --> 3:53:47.280]  So I'm doing fingertips push-ups at 92.
[3:53:47.280 --> 3:53:51.280]  So, you know, man made things.
[3:53:51.280 --> 3:53:56.280]  Now we've just heard, and this is possible, I do believe this is possible,
[3:53:56.280 --> 3:54:03.280]  that they can put this toxic nanoparticle spike protein wrapped in a lipoprotein coating into lettuce
[3:54:03.280 --> 3:54:06.280]  and into salad greens that are pre-packaged.
[3:54:06.280 --> 3:54:11.280]  The more you can eat natural foods that are not pre-packaged, that don't come, you know,
[3:54:11.280 --> 3:54:13.280]  the better off you are.
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:17.280]  So with three, with a couple of minutes left, what supplement should they be taking?
[3:54:17.280 --> 3:54:22.280]  How much zinc should you be taking just to maintain your health to keep sickness at bay?
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:24.280]  How much vitamin C a day?
[3:54:24.280 --> 3:54:27.280]  And you want to talk about the, it's a liposomal vitamin C?
[3:54:27.280 --> 3:54:30.280]  Liposomal vitamin C, I love liposomal vitamin C.
[3:54:30.280 --> 3:54:32.280]  And I use the Mercola liposodium.
[3:54:32.280 --> 3:54:34.280]  I don't get any kickback from him.
[3:54:34.280 --> 3:54:35.280]  I just happen to like his.
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:39.280]  Now I don't know if Alex has a liposomal vitamin C, but liposomal is the way to go.
[3:54:39.280 --> 3:54:46.280]  Because what it does, it goes through your lipid membranes so you could take big gobs of it
[3:54:46.280 --> 3:54:49.280]  and you won't get diarrhea like you would with normal vitamin C.
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:51.280]  I've used it when I started getting sick.
[3:54:51.280 --> 3:54:56.280]  It just took 10 gram bolus and it didn't give me diarrhea and I got over it right away.
[3:54:56.280 --> 3:54:58.280]  You know, I went to the gym that night.
[3:54:58.280 --> 3:55:05.280]  But what you need to do generally is, and I take, it's more expensive than regular vitamin C.
[3:55:05.280 --> 3:55:09.280]  So I take a, I take a gram of that in the morning with my other supplements.
[3:55:09.280 --> 3:55:14.280]  Then during the day, I take little doses of some cheaper, chewable vitamin C or whatever you like.
[3:55:14.280 --> 3:55:17.280]  Keep it by your computer, your workstation, whatever you do.
[3:55:17.280 --> 3:55:19.280]  And periodically just take one.
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:23.280]  So over the course of the day, you know, get, yeah, get three or four grams a day.
[3:55:23.280 --> 3:55:24.280]  Yeah, sure.
[3:55:24.280 --> 3:55:26.280]  I mean, how much should you be taking?
[3:55:26.280 --> 3:55:27.280]  5,000 a day or?
[3:55:27.280 --> 3:55:29.280]  That wouldn't be too much.
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:31.280]  Now, whether you need that much, I can't prove.
[3:55:31.280 --> 3:55:37.280]  Certainly what the, what the art, what they call the RDA, which is the government's recommended daily allowance.
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:40.280]  In anti-aging medicine, we call that the recommended death allowance.
[3:55:40.280 --> 3:55:41.280]  So don't listen to them.
[3:55:41.280 --> 3:55:44.280]  The number one supplement is vitamin D.
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:48.280]  And this has just drove me crazy that the, that the CDC didn't recommend this.
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:53.280]  Vitamin D is an absolutely fabulous, all-purpose thing.
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:55.280]  It's not really a vitamin, it's a hormone.
[3:55:55.280 --> 3:55:56.280]  Which one?
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:55:57.280]  D or D3?
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:55:58.280]  Does it matter?
[3:55:58.280 --> 3:55:59.280]  D3.
[3:55:59.280 --> 3:56:00.280]  It's D3.
[3:56:00.280 --> 3:56:01.280]  I take 10,000 units a day.
[3:56:01.280 --> 3:56:02.280]  I take 10,000 units a day.
[3:56:02.280 --> 3:56:05.280]  Nobody's ever overdosed on 10,000 units a day.
[3:56:05.280 --> 3:56:08.280]  And you need your levels above 60.
[3:56:08.280 --> 3:56:09.280]  Not just 30.
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:10.280]  About 60.
[3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:11.280]  Okay.
[3:56:11.280 --> 3:56:12.280]  Right.
[3:56:12.280 --> 3:56:16.280]  To keep you out of the ICU or dead with this disease, the Indonesian shown 30 will help.
[3:56:16.280 --> 3:56:19.280]  30 makes you in the category that you're going to walk away from this.
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:25.280]  It was the number one variable that you could affect that they found in their hospital,
[3:56:25.280 --> 3:56:30.280]  800 people, that if you had your D above 30, you didn't end up in the ICU or dead.
[3:56:30.280 --> 3:56:33.280]  But you're better off, the anti-cancer effect kicks in over 55.
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:35.280]  So keep it above 60.
[3:56:35.280 --> 3:56:37.280]  The other one is zinc, as you said.
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:42.280]  And some, you know, if you've been taking it for a long time, you probably do 30 milligrams
[3:56:42.280 --> 3:56:44.280]  a day, but everybody's deficient in zinc.
[3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:48.280]  So if you haven't been taking it and suddenly you've got COVID religion and you want to
[3:56:48.280 --> 3:56:52.280]  get healthy, probably take 50, you know, right now.
[3:56:52.280 --> 3:56:55.280]  And certainly if you say take 50.
[3:56:55.280 --> 3:56:56.280]  Wow.
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:57:00.280]  How much on quercetin?
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:02.280]  Well, at least 500.
[3:57:02.280 --> 3:57:04.280]  I mean, if you take it twice a day, you can do 500.
[3:57:04.280 --> 3:57:06.280]  You could do once a day.
[3:57:06.280 --> 3:57:09.280]  And NAC somewhere between 600 and 1,000.
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:15.280]  But again, if you were sick or recently vaccinated or got shed on and you took twice a day, it
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:16.280]  wouldn't be a problem.
[3:57:16.280 --> 3:57:18.280]  The one that you can't take.
[3:57:18.280 --> 3:57:23.280]  Go ahead, go ahead, the one that we can't take.
[3:57:23.280 --> 3:57:24.280]  Don't take too much selenium.
[3:57:24.280 --> 3:57:26.280]  That's the one you can take too much of.
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:27.280]  Okay.
[3:57:27.280 --> 3:57:28.280]  All right.
[3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:31.280]  Dr. Lee Merritt, themedicalrebel.com, get to her site.
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:33.280]  What an amazing frontline doctor.
