[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:47.000]  It has become one of those annoying reminders of impending doom that we all choose to ignore,
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  but like any disease, it is always best to catch it early while the symptoms are still growing.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  We are all aware of it. We are in a covert war with China.
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  Sure, the Chinese suck-ups in our government wouldn't admit it even if we were under imminent attack.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  The reason that we're in the crisis that we are today is not because of anything that China did,
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  it's not because of anything the WHO did.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, as you say, the events really got underway here now. We can see President Xi Jinping standing
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  on the gate of heavenly peace, symbolically above the portrait of Mao Zedong, who of course proclaimed
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  the foundation and the beginnings of the People's Republic of China on the 1st of October 1949.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  This is a celebration force of 70 years of communist party control of China.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  And the media would gaslight you into a corner if you let them, as Kellan McBreen revealed,
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  China Daily, a Chinese state-run media outlet, is currently paying multiple U.S. news agencies millions of dollars
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  to publish CHICOM propaganda.
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  According to Justice Department documents, Time Magazine, The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  and Foreign Policy Magazine are all currently receiving money from the Chinese outlet.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  For example, as part of a $700,000 advertising campaign paid for by China Daily,
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  Time published 75 online articles from the outlet in the past year.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  The lucrative deal resulted in Time posting content promoting a Chinese drone maker
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  that provided products to surveil Uyghurs being held captive,
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  an article promoting China's five-year plan, and several other pro-China pieces.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  However, unlike the Wall Street Journal who once took money from China Daily,
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  Time Magazine failed to disclose the fact that the outlet is funded by the Chinese government,
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  as we experience a soft kill strategically tearing our country apart.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  Socialism used to be a really scary word in the United States.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  It helped fuel the Red Scare when Congress carried out massive witch hunts
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  to weed out suspected American communists and traitors after each World War.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  They want to replace individual rights with total government domination.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  So is this political zeitgeist that's upsetting the status quo of that
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  or the future of politics in America?
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  Tell me what democracy looks like!
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  This is what democracy looks like!
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  I can give you about 20 million reasons why socialism doesn't work.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  That's how many people lost their lives under Joseph Stalin,
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  and a lot of them starved to death.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  I mean, I'm sure Ms. Bernicke, if she would go read a little history,
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  she would understand that.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  Before she reaches a final conclusion, though,
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  I would suggest that she may want to visit North Korea.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  I hear it's lovely this time of the year.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  China is eating our lunch and the sack it came in.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  China is going to eat our lunch?
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  Come on, man! Last night, I was on the phone for two straight hours
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  with Xi Jinping, and you all know with what I do.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  These folks, and it was a good conversation.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  I know him well.
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  We spent a lot of time together over the years I was vice president.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  But, you know, we don't get moving.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  They're going to eat our lunch.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Every single federal employee, U.S. media organization,
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  Hollywood celebrity, or professional athlete
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  supporting the Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  because the point of no return grows on the horizon every day.
[04:38.000 --> 05:01.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  Being given free will, being given consciousness,
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean,
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband,
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL,
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  don't worship all the things in the system,
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  While you still have it, while you still have it.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  We are living in a time when the globalists are engaged in a massive revolution
[06:32.000 --> 06:40.000]  to roll out their pedophilia, their forced abortion, their animal human spliced clones,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  franken food on the store shelves that are part insect, part animal.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  It's all being rolled out now and they call it the revolution.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  I told you 16 months ago, I said this is a globalist takeover, a revolution.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  I said, yes, it's a great reset.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  And now they're all over the news saying, oh, we're doing this to lower carbon.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  Oh, we're going to do lockdowns all the time.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  We're going to tell you where you can go and what you can do and if you can have a car
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  or maybe you can only travel outside your country three times in your life.
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  Everything will be given to you in carbon rations and carbon credits
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  that are tracked through a global social credit score.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  Talk about a dystopic nightmare.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  It makes that episode of Black Mirror that came out five, six years ago look like Disneyland
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  compared to what this is going to be like.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  And let's explain this.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  People go, oh, we reported 15 years ago on the plan for a global social credit score being built in China.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Black Mirror came out six years ago.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  I had people all the time go, oh, you got that from that Black Mirror episode.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  And sure enough, now I'm seeing on Twitter, Alex Jones got animal human hybrids from the new show Sweet Tooth.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  No, I got it from research.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  And again, it isn't about I got this, I got that.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  It is about the fact that this is all preplanned.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  And then they roll out this stuff in movies and TV shows to condition people so they accept it in the future.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  And that's what this is.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  So let me drop a giant bomb show on you.
[08:17.000 --> 08:26.000]  Because while I'm going through these literally hundreds of articles a day, I see huge giant stories that are hiding in plain view,
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  but that they have phrased away where it doesn't sound like a big deal.
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  Because on a scale of one to ten, trying to make you take experimental inoculations is a ten when they're actually hurting and killing people on a scale of ten.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  I mean, that's as bad as it gets.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  And what comes with that is what the UN kept saying the last 16, 17 months.
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  Our holy grail is to go into houses, test people with PCR tests and take those away that we say have COVID.
[08:52.000 --> 08:59.000]  And they set the machines at 40 cycles, meaning 94% of the tests are false.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  And of course, it's even worse than that.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  So they're allowed to come with a squad of contact tracers.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  They don't even know that you've been falsely put on the list.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  But oh, somebody near you may have had COVID.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  They come the computers there.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  It's given an order. It's like a hacked voting machine to say you've got COVID and then you disappear.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  And you've seen the arrest all over the world.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  You've seen the families taking.
[09:21.000 --> 09:33.000]  You've seen in Texas men gassing up their car and police slamming them down in the concrete or in New York, black people being grabbed and beaten and slammed by white cops and black cops.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  And if that was a white cop doing over a gun the guy had, oh, the white cop would be bad.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  But if you're beating a black man's head in over not wearing a mask, well, you're a hero.
[09:42.000 --> 09:55.000]  So you see, this is the system saying violence and incarceration and attacks on those who are not following this UN directive.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  Well, those are okay.
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  But if you're chasing someone that just robbed a bank, well, that's that's that's police brutality.
[10:04.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's what this whole system and this entire takeover is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  And so let me give you this huge piece of news.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  In fact, this news is so big.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  I'm going to wait till the next segment because I need to be wearing a sports jacket to talk about something this bad, this evil, this big.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  I was looking at my closet and I was thinking, I'm going to put a sports jacket on today.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  I'm like, no, it's kind of hot in the office today.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  I'm going to put a sports jacket on.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  This is important stuff, though.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  I don't want to put that thing on.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  It's just a sign of respect, a sign of how long to have a three piece food on this is so important.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's like we're going to a funeral here.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  What I'm going to tell you when we come back that is hiding in plain view and is blood curdling.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  And if we stop this, we stop it all.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  So that's coming up next segment and it's just as big as them announcing a week and a half ago, two weeks ago.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Oh, yeah, it's legal to splice humans and animals. And by the way, we're doing it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's just as big.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  It's a key ingredient for the recipe of hell on earth.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  So that is coming up next segment.
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  And the minute I saw the headline out of Reuters today, I knew what I was going to read.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  And sure as hell, it's what I thought.
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  And it's all going to make a lot of sense when we come back.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  And again, we already have all the documents we knew that were going to do this. We knew it was coming.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  But how are they going to make you take these vaccines like Bloomberg and CNN say, well, we just need to make people for their own good.
[11:36.000 --> 11:43.000]  And then Owen Schreuer goes back to visit family in St. Louis, goes and picks up a golf game.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  And the older men he's playing at golf quit and refused to play halfway through the course because they couldn't bully him into taking the experimental deadly shot.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  Which both guys admitted they both got super sick when they took.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  He said one took Johnson and Johnson, the other took Moderna.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  One of them couldn't get out of bed for a week.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  But man, he did it to keep everybody safe, even though they admit it doesn't keep you safe and doesn't work.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  And oh, there's new variants.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Sorry, more shots.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  Simply incredible.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  Yeah, all these folks are losing their jobs.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  You name it for not taking the vaccines.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  What's better than losing your life?
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  Because this is the battle.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  This is the super state wanting in your body.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  So we're going to come back and hit the giant news.
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  Let me just get to this now because I never talk about this and it's such a key part of the battle against the globalist.
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  And if the listeners of this show get excited about this, we will change the world for the better, which we do on a consistent basis because of all of you.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  So overhead shot please for TV viewers.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  I want to show folks this.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  I came up with this idea a few weeks ago.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  I guess about a month ago, but we had a snafu getting this because we've been using the same bumper sticker company for about 15 years.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  And I had an idea brainstorm and I said, I want these bumper stickers made.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  I'm going to sell them at cost in a bumper sticker activist pack to get the word out.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  And here they are.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  Mask are for slaves and criminals in full wars.com.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Vaccines kill in full wars.com.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Al shows us right in full wars.com.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Freedom lives in full wars.com.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  Arrest Fauci in full wars.com.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Arrest Bill Gates in full wars.com.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  COVID-19 as a hoax in full wars.com.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  Legalize freedom than in full wars.com.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  And then life is fiery with its beauty and I'll show them quote from my Magellan rant in full wars.com.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Now let you see this bumper sticker of your TV viewer.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  Notice it looks a little different.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  It's printed a little bit different.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  It's a front peeler and on a back peeler and all the others aren't.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  And we always have high quality stuff.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  So these stickers are better than this one.
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  Notice that we had a high quality supplier with you know the you know the best thickest best stickiest ones.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  They last the longest.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Now these are high end bumper stickers.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  This is a piece of piece of junk.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  But you know what it has more value than all these because the place that did it just got my business.
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  I'm going to try to get them to upgrade their printing because they are for free speech.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  It went all the way to the owner of the company and the company we've used for 15 years.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  Said we will not print masks are for slaves and criminals.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  Because they had the people in there on their floor wearing masks and they thought I was insulting them calling them slaves.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Isn't that the perfect microcosm of Stockholm syndrome.
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  You're being enslaved by the UN a global medical cartel fouching gates that want you dead on record.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  They're doing all of this.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  And then you see a bumper sticker because they told us about a third of their crew threatened to quit.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  And they thought they were being called slaves.
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  They were wearing masks.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Well you are a slave.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  You've been bullied in wearing a mask.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  It doesn't protect you.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  It's a cult.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  You're you're you're you're muscled.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  Hell they got laws against muscling prisoners.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  Federally in the state level.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  Unless they're spitting inviting people you can't do that.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  There's laws.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  You can't do it to people on death row.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  So I'm saying.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  A massacre for criminals covering their face and slaves.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  They wouldn't print it.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  Oh well how about this then.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  Chains.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  Are for slaves.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  How about that.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  And if you were wearing chains would you get mad at me and say well he's calling me a slave.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Yeah you've been enslaved.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  You're a captive.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  You're wearing chains just like wearing a gag.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  Just like wearing a face covering to dehumanize you.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  So you can find the sticker pack at infowarstore.com.

[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  Granny Do Right.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  Granny Do Right.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  Go ahead.
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  Yeah.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  First of all let me say I love your products.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  I am a granny and for all the seniors citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  the sun like me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  you know well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  situation but when I started taking it I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  over a period of time I started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  is wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  Again I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  and their attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  and this comes out of the open I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of you've been turned off by
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  it me too believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God and just God's
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  universe that God created that is so essential and and God created the universe for us to
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  have communion with God through and to have life and so that's what Info Wars is really
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  all about so thank you all for your word of mouth thank you for spreading the word about
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  Info Wars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases we'll be taking off the air
[18:57.000 --> 19:17.000]  so thank you for the support infowarstore.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  you
[19:57.000 --> 20:12.000]  Monday through Friday we are here live in defense of Liberty well the show headline
[20:12.000 --> 20:18.000]  today that they had for Harrison Smith's American Journal was so good I didn't change it for
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.000]  today's broadcast and it really says it all the great awakening is here but it's really
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  up to us whether we can stop the great reset together the great awakenings here will it
[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  defeat the great reset only you can decide humanity is approaching the event horizon
[20:36.000 --> 20:45.000]  choose a side and face your destiny now we have a very important guest joining us coming
[20:45.000 --> 20:55.000]  up in the second hour judge Joe Brown who I've been a fan of for a long long time and
[20:55.000 --> 21:02.000]  I was out with Joe Rogan last night at a great comedy club and was recommended I'm going
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  to send Brown's info over to Joe so he can get him on his podcast but he has really
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  exposed Joe Biden as an eyewitness to Joe Biden basically saying blacks aren't human
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  and then I found news articles with with Biden saying and I mean Biden was a famous tail end
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  of like Senator Robert Byrd but this guy's an eyewitness to it because he was in a DC
[21:23.000 --> 21:32.000]  think tank and so got up got up close when when Biden was just going national and just
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  going superstar level the Democratic Party and so we're going to be showing documentation
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  to back up what Brown said because Brown said that on a big podcast and got like 10 million
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  views but it was all Brown's just making that up he didn't say all that well we'll we'll
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  back up what he said coming up because it's important to see how ridiculous Joe Biden
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  is because I mean he's always been a racist and that means they're actually using race
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  to control people and now he's trying to teach the brown people how to be racist and he's
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  doing a good job and so that's that's what he's doing it's race based politics to control
[22:10.000 --> 22:19.000]  people it's very cynical it's very Machiavelli it's very evil all right let me hit this
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  giant news now again when I saw this I got mad at myself because I knew that's where this
[22:24.000 --> 22:30.000]  was going we understood it we've said it we warned it but I never specifically pointed
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  out why France why Germany why Australia why New Zealand and now Canada is basically leading
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  the way down the rat hole on and so the reason this is important no matter where you live
[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  is this is where the UN is standardizing this setting this up they admit we played the UN
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  director of emergency response say this and say that Canada is the model so the UN is
[22:57.000 --> 23:06.000]  piloting and running this model in Canada for citizens and non-citizens alike that you've
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  got to pay over four thousand dollars to be locked up in a government facility first it
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.000]  was hotels now it's secret facilities you get driven in a bus and you stay there 14 days
[23:17.000 --> 23:25.000]  and get this you cannot leave your room it's solitary confinement I was talking to Craig
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  one of the top rappers in the world few weeks ago when he invited me out to a show where
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.000]  he won in like 60 seconds but he was explaining to me that he can't go back to Australia because
[23:34.000 --> 23:41.000]  when his other family goes back they just lock you up for two weeks and that in the
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  his hometown is still locked down right now and it's the same thing you cannot leave the
[23:46.000 --> 23:56.000]  room even one hour people in maximum security prisons get out one hour a day or more this
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  is stronger than maximum security prison so the holy grail in fact guys pull it up I should
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  have told you it's my fault the things Ryan director of UN emergency global emergency
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  response says the goal is getting in the home and taking people out of it and there's all
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  the folks about get in the home take the kids take the parents take people to facilities
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  and if the UN directed can control policy and control what you can read online and control
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  what doctors can prescribe outside of law as a mass veto over Congress the governors
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  the legislators I mean this is this is power this is global governance I haven't gotten
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  to the big enchilada yet because if I just throw it out there nobody cares guess what
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  Prado just said oh if you're vaccinated you don't have to go to quarantine even though
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  the vaccine doesn't protect you even though they admit you quit have all these boosters
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  even though a lot of people that are getting a shot or actually shedding the virus and
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  actually getting other people sick and that's all confirmed now remember that was a
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  conspiracy theory six months ago when it all started people taking the shots now it's
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  confirmed in Germany just passed a law saying you can shed on people and the and there's
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  no liability on the corporation the doctors or the individuals that do it because we're
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  quote shedding artificially created microorganisms on the people that pull out a sunny stack
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  guys thanks I forgot to cover that properly think about the magnitude so here it is ladies
[25:24.000 --> 25:33.000]  and gentlemen this is Reuters Canada prepares to ease quarantine rules for vaccinated travelers
[25:33.000 --> 25:39.000]  what does the headline really say when you read the article Canada prepares to lock up
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  the unvaccinated see first oh we locked everybody up now the trustees that let Bill Gates and
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  the UN put their experimental Franken shop it's already killed and maimed so many oh
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  you get free mobility if you have the shot which we knew they were going to do with the
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  vaccine passport and in all of this but here's how they do it you want to cross our border
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  whether you're a citizen or not you're a prisoner in our country in your country you pay for
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  unless you agree to take whatever new shots they want Gates says he wants you to take
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  hundreds of new ones they're saying oh mRNA so great we're going to cure the flu we're
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  going to cure the cold when they actually know in their genetic testing that all these
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  viruses we share with each other share genetic material with each other and that that's part
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  of our immunity and that when you take these vaccines even classic ones it lowers your
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  immunity to everything else it may teach you immunity to that one exact thing but it lowers
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  your immunity everything else and now they're saying with a new mRNA vaccines it actually
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  causes it when you come in contact with a similar virus to have a huge autoimmune response or
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  allergic response and kill you not to mention attack proteins in your body I mean this is
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  saying you can travel in and out of the country you're a special little slave because you've
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  taken your shots that is what they're trying to duplicate everywhere that's why we need
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  Governor Abbott is getting better digging out of that hole he was in and Governor DeSantis
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  and others to pass laws not just executive orders saying this will not be allowed this is
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  bullying and intimidation into all of us here it is Canada prepares to ease quarantine rules
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  for vaccinated travelers Bloomberg and it says at first they're going to you know make you
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  stay half as long and still pay and then you know they may just arbitrarily change but
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  then we'll probably completely stop it you see there but oh you don't have your little
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  digital ID thing on your passport integrated into the computer system the backbone the matrix
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  of the global social credit score the world ID that G.G. Ping and Claus Schwab have called
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  for that will then be a chip and they're going to take a deadly mRNA gene therapy to be able
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  to travel you'll take a chip and Schwab says you will accept it on National Friends TV
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  I mean this is like a science fiction alien takeover locking you down making you take
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  chips take gene therapies that kill your ass
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  Show you
[28:35.000 --> 28:59.000]  My
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  as negative as times are right now and as depressing as a thing should be
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.580]  You have to understand that this is all a test.
[29:07.580 --> 29:13.540]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[29:13.540 --> 29:18.820]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[29:18.820 --> 29:21.940]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[29:21.940 --> 29:23.820]  And it really does come down to that.
[29:23.820 --> 29:28.180]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[29:28.180 --> 29:32.460]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[29:32.460 --> 29:36.060]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[29:36.060 --> 29:41.620]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[29:41.620 --> 29:45.900]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[29:45.900 --> 29:51.180]  DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[29:51.180 --> 29:55.180]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.860]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[29:58.860 --> 30:03.140]  Several of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[30:03.140 --> 30:07.700]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[30:07.700 --> 30:12.940]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[30:12.940 --> 30:13.940]  system.

[31:01.980 --> 31:31.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:31.820 --> 31:38.820]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, if you're keeping me early, I have a chance to see this.
[31:38.820 --> 31:46.820]  I'm going to ask the crew to post this, infowars.com, let it turn me loose, let it set me free,
[31:46.820 --> 31:51.820]  a little bit better than it used to be.
[31:51.820 --> 31:56.820]  Live wire, come on baby, got to play with me.
[31:56.820 --> 32:03.620]  Joe Rogan this morning sent me this clip and I tried to find it online so we could duplicate
[32:03.620 --> 32:08.100]  it without putting a bunch of stuff out but here it is so I guess we can remake this meme
[32:08.100 --> 32:12.940]  but this has been taken down, I guess at the time Joe screenshotted it late last night,
[32:12.940 --> 32:22.100]  it was still up but you notice it says a tagged Joe Rogan, Fauci now recommends face mask over
[32:22.100 --> 32:27.060]  your eyes so you can't read his leaked emails.
[32:27.060 --> 32:36.460]  Now obviously that's a joke but oh, look at what Twitter did, missing content, the same
[32:36.460 --> 32:44.620]  information was reviewed by independent fact checkers in another post, Instagram excuse
[32:44.620 --> 32:49.620]  me, so it's Instagram, teleprompter free folks, I get things wrong a little bit and the crew
[32:49.620 --> 32:52.780]  does talk me when I get stuff wrong, thank you, there's a big conspiracy they're telling
[32:52.780 --> 32:55.940]  me what to say but they do pop in a few times on the show and I'm getting something wrong,
[32:55.940 --> 33:02.700]  thank you Instagram, so Fauci now recommends face mask over your eyes so you can't read
[33:02.700 --> 33:09.540]  his leaked emails, missing context, the same information was reviewed by independent fact
[33:09.540 --> 33:18.860]  checkers in another post and so I guess they've taken this down because you're not allowed
[33:18.860 --> 33:30.900]  to make a joke about Lord Fauci and Naomi Wolf, the leading feminist, wakes up, becomes
[33:30.900 --> 33:42.020]  pro-gun, has the great awakening, becomes pro-constitution and says that we're going
[33:42.020 --> 33:47.260]  under martial law, that it's a corporate world government takeover, force inoculations, contact
[33:47.260 --> 33:52.380]  tracers and says we're all in deep danger of total fascistic takeover under the guise
[33:52.380 --> 33:59.340]  of the left, which is totally true, so she's born again as Ronald Reagan, she's a very
[33:59.340 --> 34:05.860]  smart lady, she's come on our show quite a bit and now she's banned on Twitter and I'm
[34:05.860 --> 34:10.740]  told she's getting banned on the platforms for saying that this is tyranny, oh you're
[34:10.740 --> 34:17.140]  not even allowed to say you don't like lockdowns, remember during the lockdowns last year?
[34:17.140 --> 34:24.020]  They were saying oh we're taking down thousands of groups of individuals a day who just simply
[34:24.020 --> 34:28.820]  try to say they don't want a lockdown, oh that's going against medical advice, what
[34:28.820 --> 34:32.460]  type of crazy cult do we live in here?
[34:32.460 --> 34:36.740]  Naomi Wolf banned from Twitter, go back to that place that's the one in Guardian, Naomi
[34:36.740 --> 34:44.180]  Wolf banned from Twitter for spreading vaccine myths, oh really so you define this as a myth
[34:44.180 --> 34:48.100]  and you don't look at what she got banned for, she got three warnings, I remember seeing
[34:48.100 --> 34:51.780]  it in the news when she would get suspended for a week and then a month and it was saying
[34:51.780 --> 34:58.020]  things like these lockdowns are wrong, these lockdowns don't protect you, here's a study,
[34:58.020 --> 35:02.780]  these vaccines are hurting people, they're not approved, they've been given emergency
[35:02.780 --> 35:09.340]  authorization, oh that's true, but you know what, we don't know the last thing she got
[35:09.340 --> 35:12.980]  banned for, we just know they said well you're just banned and no one can see what you said
[35:12.980 --> 35:16.540]  anymore, we just deleted all that and the millions of people that wanted to hear what
[35:16.540 --> 35:22.020]  she had to say, you just can't anymore because you know, we know best, remember Twitter also
[35:22.020 --> 35:28.300]  said oh we want free and open internet worldwide, it's a human right to have access to the internet,
[35:28.300 --> 35:32.620]  anyone that takes their way is a tyrant and should be taken out of office and put in prison
[35:32.620 --> 35:38.860]  and so it was one of the top trending things on Twitter over the weekend, okay well then
[35:38.860 --> 35:44.300]  why did you ban Alex Jones and they listed a bunch of other people, it's just asinine
[35:44.300 --> 35:51.860]  but see they throw it in your face how oxymoronic all this is, so we're going to be covering
[35:51.860 --> 35:55.900]  the war on men, we're going to be covering tyranny in America, we're going to be covering
[35:55.900 --> 36:02.500]  it from a legal perspective with former judge Mr. Brown when he comes in studio and I'm
[36:02.500 --> 36:12.500]  really looking forward to that because again the mainstream media was saying that Joe Biden
[36:12.500 --> 36:22.740]  made it up, that's right they're saying that it's not true, Joe Biden never said anything
[36:22.740 --> 36:27.260]  racist or bad, it's all just lies except we have all the original news articles and even
[36:27.260 --> 36:32.740]  USA Day fact-checked it and said well it's true, how much USA Day fact-checked is it
[36:32.740 --> 36:39.540]  true if the hospital says you have COVID they get more money, yeah $53,000 more and if you
[36:39.540 --> 36:47.780]  die even more, there it is fact-checked, 1977, Biden said without orderly integration his
[36:47.780 --> 36:59.900]  kids would grow up in a racial jungle, well I mean is that what you wanted so that you
[36:59.900 --> 37:03.820]  could then play people off against each other because I'm not for segregation I'm not for
[37:03.820 --> 37:10.700]  apartheid any of that but the left did all this on record to then even create more division
[37:10.700 --> 37:16.340]  later the way they did it was designed to replace one evil with another, this is very
[37:16.340 --> 37:21.460]  systematic they know exactly what to do it's like apartheid was a bad thing and they got
[37:21.460 --> 37:26.980]  rid of it and put it in communism and now they admit South Africa is ten times worse
[37:26.980 --> 37:32.660]  so it's out of the oven into the frying pan or out of the frying pan into the fire and
[37:32.660 --> 37:37.340]  the left is now pushing racial conflict and racial division and it's exploding and racial
[37:37.340 --> 37:43.660]  violence is exploding and we have to recognize that and realize that when Joe Biden says
[37:43.660 --> 37:51.460]  white supremacy is the number one threat in America that he means to brand pro-gun, pro-american,
[37:51.460 --> 37:57.740]  pro-father, pro-family individuals as racists to then target them politically with the same
[37:57.740 --> 38:06.020]  type of sanctions, the same type of harassment, the same type of persecution that I have enjoyed
[38:06.020 --> 38:12.060]  but see I intended to take them on so I intended to be persecuted I made the decision a long
[38:12.060 --> 38:19.620]  time ago to not feel sorry for myself and to enjoy the pain and after a while pain becomes
[38:19.620 --> 38:23.300]  actually enjoyable I'm not a masochist I'm not a state of masochist in the classical
[38:23.300 --> 38:27.860]  term I like I like pleasure hell I got a few extra pounds on me because I love food and
[38:27.860 --> 38:33.420]  I sure do you know love the fact that God gave us women but at the same time ladies
[38:33.420 --> 38:40.900]  and gentlemen I am I guess a masochist or a state of masochist when it comes to fighting
[38:40.900 --> 38:46.140]  tyranny because you got to go through the pain to get to the place where we defeat
[38:46.140 --> 38:52.460]  all these fake white shoe boys which is a well-known term for about 80 years meaning
[38:52.460 --> 38:57.820]  Harvard and Yale graduates that don't have any real skill but all set up their own little
[38:57.820 --> 39:03.180]  gangs and cliques and we are ruled by white shoe boys and so the New York Times and others
[39:03.180 --> 39:10.740]  said that I said white Jew boys rule America wow again they take everything real turn into
[39:10.740 --> 39:17.940]  something racial or religious to distract from the real meaning but that's how the system
[39:17.940 --> 39:23.220]  operates ladies and gentlemen is where someone's trying to bring you together they inject division
[39:23.220 --> 39:31.500]  they did retract the white Jew boy quote though because the court transcript said white shoe
[39:31.500 --> 39:38.740]  boy but you see now if someone is offended by even how something sounds like this I had
[39:38.740 --> 39:45.860]  a bumper sticker made that's brand new every order gets one thrown in the package all supplies
[39:45.860 --> 39:52.580]  last of this will be some other sticker masks are for slaves and criminals meaning you know
[39:52.580 --> 39:57.380]  masks is what criminals wear when they're breaking in your house and it's also for slaves as
[39:57.380 --> 40:01.940]  they make them wear gags over their faces it's illegal to do that to prisoners but here
[40:01.940 --> 40:07.380]  it is you're doing it you're accepting if you back to your old ammonia and the people
[40:07.380 --> 40:12.380]  packing this at the factory wouldn't pack it wouldn't print it we had to go get another
[40:12.380 --> 40:16.780]  company to print this sticker after 15 years with this company because people wanted to
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.240]  be offended by the fact that you are a slave of medical tyranny wearing that mask you should
[40:21.240 --> 40:26.060]  say no to that you should have a right to say no to that here I am pointing out your
[40:26.060 --> 40:33.420]  chains you're like don't you say I got a ball and chain on see none are so enslaved as those
[40:33.420 --> 40:38.980]  who cannot see that they are that's what comes down to oh you don't call me a slave while
[40:38.980 --> 40:45.180]  you're wearing a gag over your dirty mouth breathing in your own bacteria and filth smells
[40:45.180 --> 40:52.140]  like a dirty diaper by the way you can get all these stickers for $9.95 with in game at
[40:52.140 --> 40:58.340]  the same price you get in game for $9.95 the film you get all the stickers with that border
[40:58.340 --> 41:04.700]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[41:04.700 --> 41:12.020]  they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech and
[41:12.020 --> 41:17.380]  everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[41:17.380 --> 41:24.500]  total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that
[41:24.500 --> 41:29.380]  ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them
[41:29.380 --> 41:35.020]  so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside
[41:35.020 --> 41:42.500]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[41:42.500 --> 41:48.180]  that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we understand
[41:48.180 --> 41:52.740]  the keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[41:52.740 --> 41:57.980]  info wars and have that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together.
[41:57.980 --> 42:02.180]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast hell I've been
[42:02.180 --> 42:06.300]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that but let me tell you the
[42:06.300 --> 42:10.580]  new world order is breathing down our neck the big globalist publications are coming
[42:10.580 --> 42:14.420]  after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down so please pray to keep
[42:14.420 --> 42:18.980]  info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well at
[42:18.980 --> 42:24.540]  the same time go to info wars store dot com while you still can and get a book get a film

[42:34.140 --> 42:40.020]  the globalist but I can't do it if you don't support us so pray for us word of mouth tell
[42:40.020 --> 42:44.500]  folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich you

[42:54.940 --> 43:01.700]  all of it is pro human and pro god thank you so much I've been thinking a lot lately about
[43:01.700 --> 43:07.100]  playing devil's advocate on there about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist
[43:07.100 --> 43:10.860]  that the public so done down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from
[43:10.860 --> 43:16.740]  them that were poisoning them that were sterilizing them than they deserve to be killed yes that's
[43:16.740 --> 43:21.140]  the position of the globalist they play god and they think because we don't stand up they
[43:21.140 --> 43:26.220]  have a right to do this to us you know I've told you that the globalist have tried to
[43:26.220 --> 43:31.580]  harm me they try to get me to join them but metaphysically at a spiritual level I have
[43:31.580 --> 43:35.620]  the Holy Spirit I'm going to show you God and I know that God does not like that so
[43:35.620 --> 43:41.140]  I cannot join the enemy but I'll tell you at a selfish level I get very very mad at
[43:41.140 --> 43:44.820]  people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting
[43:44.820 --> 43:50.540]  power on them whether you're just a steelworker or a school teacher or a khenry kistinger you're
[43:50.540 --> 43:56.820]  not God and treating other people like they're animals your God is something that the real
[43:56.820 --> 44:03.060]  God of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact the bio pros are the new non-gmo pollution

[45:01.940 --> 45:03.940]  are listening to the alex jones show
[45:31.940 --> 45:59.060]  we're back all right here's the deal uk basically is announced that it's never going to end
[45:59.060 --> 46:03.300]  the lockdown that it will simply tighten it then loosen it tighten it and loosen it but
[46:03.300 --> 46:08.900]  it's permanent now we knew that that was always the plan the un admitted it that and again
[46:08.900 --> 46:14.220]  by the time they're done tightening it they will be able to send in contact tracers that
[46:14.220 --> 46:21.380]  are a new global medical arm like the peace corps but with law enforcement power to take
[46:21.380 --> 46:26.140]  you away to a secret facility and then of course you will be intubated instead of killing
[46:26.140 --> 46:30.740]  you with a guillotine you will be killed with intubation and they've already gotten these
[46:30.740 --> 46:38.140]  facilities in england and in europe and in australia and in canada to murder homeless
[46:38.140 --> 46:42.740]  people we've had whistleblower nurses on the shot video their charts everything and they
[46:42.740 --> 46:47.020]  take them in and then they say okay well we're going to intubate you because you came in here
[46:47.020 --> 46:50.620]  and you've tested positive for covid even though you don't even have trouble breathing
[46:50.620 --> 46:56.060]  and then they kill them and then now they have been corrupted and now they have a hospital
[46:56.060 --> 47:00.620]  that's murdered a bunch of people and that's why you see key hospitals and key cities in
[47:00.620 --> 47:05.980]  canada but also in other areas but also in blue cities in the u.s. like new york where
[47:05.980 --> 47:10.580]  they're actually killing people and once they've gotten them to kill somebody for the system
[47:10.580 --> 47:14.380]  now they're signed on to the corruption now they can be tested to carry out all sorts of
[47:14.380 --> 47:19.740]  horrible behavior and then people like governor northam go on tv three years ago and says
[47:19.740 --> 47:23.860]  well we make a decision with the mother not with a state or anybody whether a newborn
[47:23.860 --> 47:30.460]  baby is viable and if the mother doesn't want the child or we convince her she doesn't
[47:30.460 --> 47:35.700]  need to have the child then we do that we do not resuscitate and then we keep the baby
[47:35.700 --> 47:41.820]  comfortable or we keep we keep it comfortable now resuscitation doesn't mean that the heart
[47:41.820 --> 47:46.180]  stopped and the baby's dead it's a legal term that they're creating in the bioethics boards
[47:46.180 --> 47:53.460]  of new law that we accepted it becomes law and then it's what it is as eugenics because
[47:53.460 --> 47:56.660]  you heard about how they used to sterilize poor people and how they'd actually quietly
[47:56.660 --> 48:00.740]  kill really deformed children when they were little and you can argue well that's a nice
[48:00.740 --> 48:06.380]  thing to do and the Spartans did it and you know things like that in the old days of grandma
[48:06.380 --> 48:10.980]  wasn't too much pain on the wagon train and was begging to die well you know somebody
[48:10.980 --> 48:18.980]  might just let her throw but this is being decided on by the state and by the system
[48:18.980 --> 48:23.620]  and they're coming out and saying we're all obsolete period and robots are replacing us
[48:23.620 --> 48:26.900]  so when you sign on to getting rid of little kids and you sign on to getting rid of old
[48:26.900 --> 48:31.380]  people like Bill Gates wants to do and class law wants to you've signed on to getting rid
[48:31.380 --> 48:36.500]  of yourself and not having value on human life so we need to value human life not value
[48:36.500 --> 48:40.780]  it and I know this audience gets that but we have to get that out to the general public
[48:40.780 --> 48:47.180]  and warn them because the system that's going in worldwide is coming here next with a more
[48:47.180 --> 48:50.780]  deadly virus they're going to release they wanted a controllable one that they owned
[48:50.780 --> 48:55.820]  that they controlled that is synthetic so would scare the scientist but they are going
[48:55.820 --> 49:02.020]  to release things far much worse I believe in the near future if the public in the world
[49:02.020 --> 49:08.540]  accept this and accept the control that they brought out if they get about 80% vaccination
[49:08.540 --> 49:15.340]  injection if they can get US cities to stay locked down and get other cities to accept
[49:15.340 --> 49:25.940]  it around the world they're going to launch something much much much bigger but I've got
[49:25.940 --> 49:30.940]  to say at first they were running the tables on us at first it was a football game going
[49:30.940 --> 49:37.820]  in to the locker room at halftime they were 23 points ahead we had no points on the board
[49:37.820 --> 49:44.420]  now we're going into the last three minutes of this phase this game and I'd say we are
[49:44.420 --> 49:49.500]  about seven points ahead of them on the board and we've got the ball but things can change
[49:49.500 --> 49:54.020]  with a few minutes left and remember there's always another battle another war another
[49:54.020 --> 49:59.740]  go round but the world's really starting to have a learning curve go up on Fauci ran it
[49:59.740 --> 50:03.980]  with Gates they controlled it they made it they lied about it they blocked good therapies
[50:03.980 --> 50:07.660]  they killed millions of people they sent sick people into nursing homes to get a higher death
[50:07.660 --> 50:12.980]  rate these are some diabolical people and what does diabolical come from in the Latin
[50:12.980 --> 50:21.700]  Diablo diabolical means of the devil and if this hidden Diablo baby I don't know what
[50:21.700 --> 50:31.020]  is this is bona fide Satanism Satan sets up evil that's based on murder and dehumanization
[50:31.020 --> 50:36.900]  and devaluing life and then puts a price on devaluing yourself so you sell out yourself
[50:36.900 --> 50:42.940]  to devalue others so that God can be pushed away from you so Satan can get full control
[50:42.940 --> 50:49.060]  of you because you're the real target the productive smart intelligent per person if
[50:49.060 --> 50:58.540]  Satan can get you boy whoo he's doing good good good so that's a question for all of
[50:58.540 --> 51:05.180]  you what side you want to be on you don't want to fail this test like Bill Gates did
[51:05.180 --> 51:09.100]  and you know that's a good point about Elon Musk we don't have monolithic thinking around
[51:09.100 --> 51:15.100]  here and I've got some big problems with Elon Musk Greg Reese that's one of our best reports
[51:15.100 --> 51:19.460]  he did one basically saying he's a total fraud and a lot of what's in there I think has been
[51:19.460 --> 51:24.340]  totally proven some of it not completely because I'd say even if he's a con artist he's been
[51:24.340 --> 51:28.820]  extremely successful he's certainly smart but he wants to colonize space he wants a
[51:28.820 --> 51:34.700]  human exploration and he wants to colonize Mars I like that I mean I like Elon Musk
[51:34.700 --> 51:40.100]  way more than I like Bill Gates or you know his big rival Jeff Bezos who wants to be the
[51:40.100 --> 51:46.660]  first guy in space so he could show off in that cool but there's real competition between
[51:46.660 --> 51:50.220]  these billionaires that you know they're still globalist at the end of the day or that there's
[51:50.220 --> 51:53.860]  an even more powerful force behind there that they don't go along with it they get destroyed
[51:53.860 --> 52:00.580]  but I like him saying I'm against course inoculations I'm not taking the vaccine I like him coming
[52:00.580 --> 52:08.740]  out I'm saying beware those that warn you of AI gods or beware those that tell you to
[52:08.740 --> 52:15.300]  bow down to AI gods and so I like those things that Elon Musk does but I'm not going to sit
[52:15.300 --> 52:19.660]  there and tell Greg hey why don't you add those positive things into your piece about
[52:19.660 --> 52:25.060]  him and kind of leave it open as a question because he has said let's put in kiosk at
[52:25.060 --> 52:30.100]  the mall where you get brain chips but then he says beware AI well it's like saying be
[52:30.100 --> 52:34.660]  where heroin kids and then dropping pellets of you know capsules of heroin out at the
[52:34.660 --> 52:43.020]  playground telling kids it's sugar candy so that's a whole other area he's just the older
[52:43.020 --> 52:51.660]  I get the more careful I am about when I say somebody's absolute pure evil and he may well
[52:51.660 --> 52:56.580]  be absolute pure evil I mean his girlfriend acts like a damn demon hopping around him
[52:56.580 --> 53:02.860]  but that's kind of an immature thing that a lot of young people do so again I'm really
[53:02.860 --> 53:07.540]  just talking about this because it's an interesting debate inside my head and that's a good thing
[53:07.540 --> 53:11.180]  to have kind of like a debate about his hell of shows a good guy or a bad guy they could
[53:11.180 --> 53:15.980]  take things out of context I've done and show me being a wild man and trying to have fun
[53:15.980 --> 53:20.300]  and let my hair down and say man this guy's a crazy person we shouldn't listen to him
[53:20.300 --> 53:24.340]  he shouldn't be a leader I mean you know this this this this guy's a wild man well I'm not
[53:24.340 --> 53:29.580]  trying to be your leader I'm trying to get you to be a leader and you to take action
[53:29.580 --> 53:37.060]  and say no to the New World Order okay Judge Joe Brown is coming up he's here in town came
[53:37.060 --> 53:40.620]  into town to be on our show he should be on the show about 1215 or so because he's almost
[53:40.620 --> 53:44.420]  here but I don't want to rush him in here we'll just keep him into the third hour today
[53:44.420 --> 53:50.220]  really want to pick his brain a whole host of issues extremely excited about the fact
[53:50.220 --> 53:54.900]  that he's going to be here extremely excited about the fact that he's going to be exposing
[53:54.900 --> 53:58.980]  Joe Biden separately I want to tell all the viewers and listeners about something very
[53:58.980 --> 54:04.020]  exciting that will fund the info or that's a very important thing and fuel your body

[54:46.860 --> 54:51.540]  because we can't offer these anywhere near 50% off because I didn't put a lot of markup
[54:51.540 --> 54:57.980]  into these a lot of money went into these and I still have it at a low price because

[59:52.700 --> 1:00:03.180]  **** info wars tomorrow's news today
[1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:07.980]  there's over a hundred of these i've seen clearly one Fauci wrote 2008
[1:00:07.980 --> 1:00:15.180]  german study finds lockdown had no effect on stopping spread of coronavirus and other
[1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:20.220]  similar studies another german study as well where they talk about mask having no effect
[1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:24.620]  another swedish study just came out last week though there's so many of these studies
[1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:29.180]  that studies here in the us show areas that had lockdowns had higher death rates people
[1:00:29.180 --> 1:00:35.580]  weren't dirty mask growing bacteria in them bacterial pneumonia and not going outdoors of
[1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:41.260]  course suicide and drug use exploded and alcoholism and family violence at lury children's hospital
[1:00:41.260 --> 1:00:47.340]  emergency room physicians are seeing a 50 increase in mental health visits every day we see at least
[1:00:47.340 --> 1:00:53.180]  10 children or youth if not more so while children are not getting as sick as adults with
[1:00:53.180 --> 1:00:59.660]  SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 there is another contagion that is threatening them
[1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:04.860]  but that's the plan make us depressed make us alone scientists at center of Wuhan leak
[1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:10.540]  controversy put in charge of the Lancet task force to investigate the virus that's breaking
[1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:18.140]  all over the news today but of course here we were last year saying it and this big report from a
[1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:24.220]  month ago in the smoking gun report that's just one footnote in it just just pointing out that
[1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:29.260]  that you can either get it all from us up front or then to watch it doled out slowly
[1:01:29.260 --> 1:01:33.580]  where then everybody's just confused about what went down continuing twitter suspends
[1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:39.500]  organization for announcing they will release more Fauci emails how dare a public figure
[1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:44.060]  who's trying to keep us locked down and inject us with secret injections be subject to foyer
[1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:49.500]  requests and freedom information act look senator this keeps happening first it was the russia hoax
[1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:55.900]  that the media said was not true and they banned posts about it then it was in a fake impeachment
[1:01:55.900 --> 1:02:02.700]  trial then it was the COVID treatment hydroxychloroquine we couldn't talk about that then it was the
[1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:09.420]  origins of COVID that they had egg on their face we're also not allowed to talk about election 2020
[1:02:09.420 --> 1:02:16.220]  look at this timeline about the face facebook Fauci censorship on march 15th zuckerberg emails
[1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:22.620]  Fauci suggesting that they partner on COVID-19 information hub and then in april 16th 2020
[1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:29.740]  facebook post steps that it is taking it changes its policy quote to combat COVID-19 related
[1:02:29.740 --> 1:02:37.820]  misinformation it claims february 2021 facebook announces it will be removing more false claims
[1:02:37.820 --> 1:02:45.660]  about COVID-19 and vaccines may 25th Fauci admits to modest collaboration as we just heard and then
[1:02:45.660 --> 1:02:51.980]  on may 26th suddenly facebook has to change its policy again saying it will no longer remove the
[1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:59.260]  claim that quote important video i mean let's go back with judge brown my enemies are your enemies
[1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:05.340]  they're the globalistic extremists they're a consortium of bad scientists pedophiles control
[1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:11.740]  freaks devil worshipers vampires wherever you want to call them that are highly predatory
[1:03:12.540 --> 1:03:18.380]  and are setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and
[1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:27.260]  electromagnetic radiation to change the very dna of the human species to mutate us into a form
[1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:33.100]  that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom line is they want to play god they
[1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:39.020]  are playing god and the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out so many
[1:03:39.020 --> 1:03:43.660]  other people want to be positive they want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited
[1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:47.340]  amounts of what's happening with the world order but at the end of the day it's all about the
[1:03:47.340 --> 1:03:52.460]  population it's all about world government it's all about the end of the human system as we know it
[1:03:52.460 --> 1:03:55.980]  and on its ashes a nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around and stop it
[1:03:55.980 --> 1:04:11.900]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:04:25.980 --> 1:04:37.900]  so
[1:04:41.420 --> 1:04:45.420]  well it's hard to turn off this song shows my playlist of music
[1:04:45.420 --> 1:04:59.340]  bring it up for a minute don't stop at the top of the song good stuff
[1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:01.980]  that means bill gates and pouchy getting their ass arrested
[1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:12.540]  that means exposing their whole anti-human program and you know judge brown's gonna be joining us
[1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:19.420]  coming in here at the next segment who is really crusading against the attack on the family the
[1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:24.620]  attack on the nuclear family and more and he's coming at the same fight we are just from a
[1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:30.140]  little bit different angle because anybody that's awake knows what's going on so judge joe brown the
[1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:39.020]  judge joe brown show dot com and at twitter judge joe brown tv is in studio with us and i'm trying to
[1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:44.780]  get him on the joe rogan show i was out with joe last night a comedy show it was crazy and so
[1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:49.740]  joe's gonna be watching today i'm gonna send him the show regardless and so this message needs to
[1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:59.260]  get out to large audiences as it will do here today so i'm very very excited about all of that
[1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:04.380]  all right i mentioned this last hour and it dovetails with this really frightening out of
[1:06:04.380 --> 1:06:10.220]  control news out of canada that is designed to come here next and that is this particular
[1:06:10.220 --> 1:06:14.220]  document that i noticed the printer cut off so maybe we can actually pull it up out there
[1:06:15.180 --> 1:06:23.820]  but german court and then a german government has passed a law saying that vaccines can leech
[1:06:24.540 --> 1:06:32.620]  microorganisms into you and that someone who's been vaccinated can infect you with a vaccine
[1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:36.700]  and there's no liability for the government the vaccine maker or the person that got you sick
[1:06:37.900 --> 1:06:41.660]  i wonder why california and other places are passing laws where you can infect somebody with
[1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:49.420]  hepatitis or hiv knowingly and not get in any trouble these people are absolutely out of control
[1:06:49.420 --> 1:06:55.020]  and how are they given inoculations without consent to young people to to 12 year olds 10
[1:06:55.020 --> 1:07:02.140]  year olds in canada and places in california very very dangerous we're going to be talking about
[1:07:02.140 --> 1:07:08.940]  that but but here's this news canada prepares to ease quarantine rules for vaccinated travelers
[1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:13.420]  oh but those that don't have a vaccine even though your doctor tells you you shouldn't
[1:07:13.420 --> 1:07:16.620]  take it because of health problems because once you've had a bad reaction to a vaccine
[1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:20.460]  you're not supposed to ever take them again that that was mainline science but now big pharma runs
[1:07:20.460 --> 1:07:26.620]  to you and they say oh no you've got to just take this regardless or you get locked up in a quarantine
[1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:33.740]  center so how you translate that headline properly is unvaccinated to be locked up in government camps
[1:07:35.740 --> 1:07:42.220]  that's really what that headline says now let's shift gears in that same subject area to something
[1:07:42.220 --> 1:07:48.860]  really big here's that meme i was talking about earlier that instagram fat checked and took down
[1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:56.300]  it was a joke fouchy now recommends wearing a face mask over your eyes so you can read his
[1:07:56.300 --> 1:08:03.500]  leaked emails and they fact checked it and said oh this isn't true it's a joke
[1:08:06.860 --> 1:08:15.980]  but i can tell you this they certainly don't want us reading those emails because what we knew
[1:08:15.980 --> 1:08:21.260]  is there you remember the major indian institute the top one india that had access to a crisper
[1:08:21.260 --> 1:08:29.100]  machine and they paid the the the company that owns the crisper machine to scan the the the
[1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:36.860]  sequence of the covid virus and it was five viruses combined with six insertions now the
[1:08:36.860 --> 1:08:41.580]  british government says they scanned it and it's man made yeah a virus has been engineered it's
[1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:48.380]  very obvious you can actually see the p shuttle p shuttle gene injection point where they use a
[1:08:48.380 --> 1:08:52.460]  gene gun it's not done all delicately at a microscopic level they fire a bunch of these
[1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:58.060]  viruses in together and then hope that like one mixes together right then with an electron microscope
[1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:04.940]  they look at them and then parcel them out then they inject that into a pig if the pig gets sick
[1:09:04.940 --> 1:09:11.180]  they know they've got it they drain the pig's blood intervenously give it to other pigs
[1:09:12.700 --> 1:09:16.380]  and then if those pigs get sick then they keep draining the blood this is on record
[1:09:16.380 --> 1:09:24.060]  and that's how they the the pig is the biological factory to then make the virus at a massive scale
[1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:30.300]  so they want you to believe that they're able to just do this under a microscope now this
[1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:36.700]  is all done using biological systems they're just like alchemists mixing things together
[1:09:36.700 --> 1:09:42.380]  and seeing what happens seeing what comes out on the other side so we we covered that we'll
[1:09:42.380 --> 1:09:47.660]  guess what's in the new emails more coming out every day in 2020 indians scientists discovered
[1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:53.420]  cuba 19 was engineered with AIDS-like insertions email show falchi called it outlandish which
[1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:58.780]  led to the published study being withdrawn by folks that he requested demanded it be withdrawn
[1:09:58.780 --> 1:10:03.580]  and the people that wrote the landed study say this was all bull worked at the lab and ran the
[1:10:03.580 --> 1:10:10.300]  program peter dazik but they had his name taken off too well maybe like if the police arrested you
[1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:16.380]  you for drunk driving and then you wrote the police report on the candy similarity of unique
[1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:23.660]  inserts in 2019 covid spike protein to hiv one and here's the original study that he got pulled
[1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:30.940]  okay here's a few minutes of judge joe brown in that super viral interview he did with the
[1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:38.140]  famous basketball player of the same name no relation also mr brown so great hour plus long
[1:10:38.140 --> 1:10:42.860]  we've got a posted info wars dot com last time i saw i was like 10 million views uh but uh he's
[1:10:42.860 --> 1:10:46.540]  gonna be in studio with us coming up here's some of what he said and we'll be back with the man
[1:10:46.540 --> 1:10:52.780]  himself who witnessed joe biden's incredible racism in studio it they'd never integrate the
[1:10:53.580 --> 1:11:02.780]  little rock high school they had wildest there who was wheeled in and they had bird former brand
[1:11:02.780 --> 1:11:08.220]  dragon to the clan and they were talking about this young man who had a stupid looking duck tail
[1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:15.980]  like he was back in the 1950s was the last true yellow dog dixie crat and they were talking about
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:23.980]  joe biden who got up there and when the speech he gave i mean i was really offended i heard it
[1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:31.740]  right outside the state capital building in dover which was a rundown ransack old house 250 years old
[1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:39.100]  and he said negro children are like roaches if they're allowed to integrate the schools they
[1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:45.900]  will infest them and they will never be gotten out negro joe biden said that yeah i heard it
[1:11:45.900 --> 1:11:57.180]  wow so he said negroes were animals and they turned the streets into jungles and he and senator
[1:11:57.180 --> 1:12:04.460]  eastland had a plan where they could put all of these negro animals in zoos now we talk about
[1:12:04.460 --> 1:12:13.740]  the 94 crime bill that wasn't shit the 91 was bad the 97 was really bad 81 was the one where
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:21.180]  where one rock got you five years which due to some other stuff biden and spenis and eastland
[1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:29.660]  did it wasn't five years with parole they abolished federal parole so you get five years you get 60
[1:12:29.660 --> 1:12:35.980]  months and you get released with all good and honor time at 56 months from federal custody
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:44.700]  and in there was that was the 81 when then there was a 79 in the 77 so let's give blame
[1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:50.940]  where blame is due that bastard has been a racist dog and he used to talk about he understood the
[1:12:50.940 --> 1:13:00.140]  negro because he was raised in delaware and he said delaware was a proud slave owning state
[1:13:00.140 --> 1:13:07.900]  that basically copped out by not going with the south during the rebellion as it should have
[1:13:07.900 --> 1:13:14.620]  because they were too close to dc to not be intimidated so i'm listening to this racist dog
[1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:21.340]  i kept up with him because i was practicing criminal law and federal criminal trials became
[1:13:21.340 --> 1:13:28.540]  almost a lynch thing because of what is allowed by the way if you ever get interrogated by the feds
[1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:34.140]  never say i don't know what happened i don't know anything about it because you will get convicted
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:40.540]  on one count of an indictment saying making an annoyingly false statement to a federal investigator
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:45.980]  you know why because they tell you what you're there for so you know what you're there for so
[1:13:45.980 --> 1:13:51.820]  when you say i don't know nothing about it you did because they told you what the feds you say hi
[1:13:51.820 --> 1:14:00.540]  you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've talked about
[1:14:00.540 --> 1:14:04.540]  has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care about
[1:14:04.540 --> 1:14:08.860]  that i care about beating the new world border and it's because we have so much credibility they

[1:15:48.300 --> 1:16:06.300]  33533139, 33533139, 33533139, 33533139 that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:25.300]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[1:16:25.300 --> 1:16:29.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:39.300]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Judge Joe Brown, who I've been watching for years on TV and I know like you have,
[1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.300]  is even cooler in person than I thought.
[1:16:41.300 --> 1:16:45.300]  I had an idea this would be a great guy to hang around a campfire with, and he's awesome.
[1:16:45.300 --> 1:16:50.300]  Great Tennessean here, but listen, we only got him for an hour or so, so I want to just get right to the meat potatoes.
[1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:53.300]  You ought to hear the stuff just during the last four minute break.
[1:16:53.300 --> 1:16:59.300]  Talking to this guy, he eyeballed what was picked up in newspapers in the 70s and 80s before everything was,
[1:16:59.300 --> 1:17:02.300]  you know, filmed or put on TV or later put on the Internet.
[1:17:02.300 --> 1:17:08.300]  Like this headline, integrating black students would turn schools into a jungle, a racial jungle.
[1:17:08.300 --> 1:17:11.300]  I don't want my children to grow up in a jungle, and it goes on.
[1:17:11.300 --> 1:17:14.300]  Joe Biden's long career is a racist.
[1:17:14.300 --> 1:17:18.300]  There were fine people on the KKK supporting side.
[1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:20.300]  That's a quote by him.
[1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:21.300]  Just unbelievable.
[1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:24.300]  Biden blasted over racist comments about black entrepreneurs.
[1:17:24.300 --> 1:17:28.300]  Joe Biden said on Zoom call with black Americans, this country is doomed.
[1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:31.300]  It's doomed not just because of African Americans.
[1:17:31.300 --> 1:17:33.300]  I mean, he just can't even hide it.
[1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:38.300]  Fact check in 1977, Biden said without orderly integration, his kids would grow up in a racial jungle.
[1:17:38.300 --> 1:17:40.300]  That's USA today.
[1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:46.300]  When I saw Judge Joe Brown, and I went over to his bio and take two hours with a very interesting person,
[1:17:46.300 --> 1:17:48.300]  we wouldn't have time to talk.
[1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:55.300]  But the media attacked him on that interview with the former, you know, top basketball player, Kwame Brown, went viral.
[1:17:55.300 --> 1:17:57.300]  They tried to say, where's he get his info?
[1:17:57.300 --> 1:17:58.300]  He's making that up.
[1:17:58.300 --> 1:18:01.300]  Well, no, he saw it with his own eyes as you just said during the break.
[1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:03.300]  So, Judge, great to have you here.
[1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:04.300]  All right.
[1:18:04.300 --> 1:18:05.300]  I'm glad to be here.
[1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:06.300]  Yes, sir.
[1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:08.300]  Somebody trying to get sense out to the public.
[1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:10.300]  Yes, sir. Well, you got a lot to say.
[1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:12.300]  So they're not calling you a liar.
[1:18:12.300 --> 1:18:14.300]  They're just saying, wonder why he says that?
[1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:15.300]  That's really silly.
[1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:16.300]  Well, you were there.
[1:18:16.300 --> 1:18:17.300]  Okay.
[1:18:17.300 --> 1:18:23.300]  You know what you're looking at when you see that it's a classic propaganda technique of flipping the script.
[1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:30.300]  You know, you've been propagandizing the public to get into deep, deep into dysfunction and self-hatred.
[1:18:30.300 --> 1:18:31.300]  I don't like it.
[1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:36.300]  But on the top of your hand, President Joe Biden.
[1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:37.300]  Okay.
[1:18:37.300 --> 1:18:46.300]  I was present in Delaware, Dover, on an occasion, I believe is right, circa the 72, 73.
[1:18:46.300 --> 1:18:50.300]  I was working with this DC think tank as an intern.
[1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:51.300]  So I was there.
[1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:57.300]  So I heard this commotion outside of the state capital and out in the little area they had outside.
[1:18:57.300 --> 1:18:59.300]  They had a stage set up.
[1:18:59.300 --> 1:19:01.300]  James Eastland was there.
[1:19:01.300 --> 1:19:02.300]  Sprickland was there.
[1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:04.300]  John B. Stennis was there.
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:11.300]  Their bird was there and they had this character up there with a duck tail hairdo, some young guy.
[1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:20.300]  And they introduced him as quote, the last and newest of the yellow dog Dixie crats.
[1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:29.300]  And Biden got up there and started talking about the glorious history of Delaware, how it was a proud slave holding state,
[1:19:29.300 --> 1:19:37.300]  and how it copped out so many words by staying with the union because it was so close to DC.
[1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:48.300]  They got coerced apparently, but he knew the Negro and he's launched into the overriding question today is what to do with the Negro.
[1:19:48.300 --> 1:19:59.300]  And he got into calling something a lot worse about young black children than what's in that 1977 article five years later.
[1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:02.300]  He said young Negro children are like roaches.
[1:20:02.300 --> 1:20:07.300]  And if you ever let them integrate into a school, they'll infest them and they'll never get them out.
[1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:13.300]  And in that jungle thing, when I heard him, he had it slightly changed around.
[1:20:13.300 --> 1:20:19.300]  He said Negroes are animals and they turn our streets into jungles.
[1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:27.300]  And if elected, I promised to do everything I can to put them in zoos to make the streets safe.
[1:20:27.300 --> 1:20:29.300]  And I'm looking at this guy.
[1:20:29.300 --> 1:20:35.300]  I had an Afro out to here, you know, this is 19 early 1970s.
[1:20:35.300 --> 1:20:39.300]  I had come in from Los Angeles and I'm going, what the devil is this?
[1:20:39.300 --> 1:20:46.300]  You know, a serious throwback, serious throwback and then see nobody called anybody Negro.
[1:20:46.300 --> 1:20:50.300]  Then it was black or African or Afro American.
[1:20:50.300 --> 1:21:03.300]  And then I ran into him over the seceding years when I was practicing criminal law and I know that it got a lot worse trying to deal with federal cases in 1981.
[1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:20.300]  When he came up with that cockamamie scheme to get the animals off the streets and into the zoos, as he put it, when they introduced an act that made one rock get you five years in the federal penitentiary.
[1:21:20.300 --> 1:21:29.300]  And that wasn't just five years because they wrapped, there was five years because they wiped out federal parole and probation.
[1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:33.300]  So somebody got a one rock five year sentence.
[1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:41.300]  What wound up happening is he did about 56 to 58 months before he was released from federal custody.
[1:21:41.300 --> 1:21:42.300]  And he was bragging about that.
[1:21:42.300 --> 1:21:48.300]  He used to say, one rock, one rock, we'll get you five years, we'll get you five years in a federal penitentiary.
[1:21:48.300 --> 1:21:57.300]  And to boil that down, if white lawyers were using 10 times the amount of cocaine, they might go to jail for a year or maybe a plea bargain, maybe just probation.
[1:21:57.300 --> 1:22:07.300]  But if you were using crack that was introduced by the CIA into black neighborhoods, then less cocaine would send you to prison longer because it was a drug that was associated with black people.
[1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:14.300]  Yeah, it's like $60 worth of crack would get you the same sentence as 10 grand worth of coke powder.
[1:22:14.300 --> 1:22:16.300]  Now, let me say something about that.
[1:22:16.300 --> 1:22:17.300]  You said CIA plot.
[1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:22.300]  I don't know if it's CIA plot, but I know damn well something's wrong with the crack equation.
[1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:27.300]  See, crack is refined cocaine.
[1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:30.300]  They used to do what they call free basis.
[1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:38.300]  In other words, put it in a spoon, et cetera, heat it up, let the impurities burn off, and then they'd shoot it up or whatever they want to do with smoke it.
[1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:46.300]  But it's like a 55 gallon drum of 93 octane fuel being cheaper than a 55 gallon drum of crude oil.
[1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:51.300]  It doesn't make any sense unless there's somebody subsidizing the pipeline.
[1:22:51.300 --> 1:23:03.300]  And I've had DEA for agent friends who have retired and said, you know what, it just doesn't make any sense as to how you get that rocks cheaper.
[1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:06.300]  They're selling a Ferrari cheaper than a Ford F-150.
[1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:07.300]  Yeah.
[1:23:07.300 --> 1:23:08.300]  And how does it get into the country?
[1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:10.300]  It doesn't come into the country as rocks.
[1:23:10.300 --> 1:23:12.300]  It comes in as powder.
[1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:14.300]  But we do know about Iran Contra.
[1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:27.300]  What's that Iran Contra and the Stinger missiles that are still on the counter for there, about 1,700 of those floating around somewhere in the world to shoot down somebody's airliner on approach or on takeoff.
[1:23:27.300 --> 1:23:28.300]  And it has happened.
[1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:29.300]  It has happened.
[1:23:29.300 --> 1:23:30.300]  And we don't deal with that.
[1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:38.300]  That's that other thing about that assault on the Second Amendment with, we're going to have to cut with machine guns and their assault rifles out of the...
[1:23:38.300 --> 1:23:43.300]  Well, assault rifles are, by definition, they are machine guns.
[1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:51.300]  Not just something that is a semi-automatic AR, which doesn't sound stand for assault rifle, it stands for armillade.
[1:23:51.300 --> 1:23:54.300]  It's been around for 50, 60 years.
[1:23:54.300 --> 1:24:01.300]  And the real stuff comes in with the shipments of drugs that they can't stop with the war on drugs.
[1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:02.300]  Exactly.
[1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:07.300]  I wonder, Judge, they admit millions and millions of, quote, Chinese assault rifles since the 90s have been brought in.
[1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:08.300]  Where do they go?
[1:24:08.300 --> 1:24:09.300]  They're not sold in gun shops.
[1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:10.300]  No, they're not.
[1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:15.300]  You can't just walk in and buy a machine gun as per the popular press.
[1:24:15.300 --> 1:24:24.300]  And by the way, there's an interesting thing Bush appointed to the federal bench in California just issued an opinion this week saying that...
[1:24:24.300 --> 1:24:25.300]  I wanted to ask you about that.
[1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:26.300]  Yeah.
[1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:27.300]  I actually have that, sir, right here.
[1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:28.300]  We're going to go to break.
[1:24:28.300 --> 1:24:29.300]  Wow.
[1:24:29.300 --> 1:24:30.300]  I could talk to this guy all day.
[1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:32.300]  It's almost like he's a famous talk show host.
[1:24:32.300 --> 1:24:33.300]  Wow.
[1:24:33.300 --> 1:24:35.300]  Judge Joe Brown's here with us.
[1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:38.300]  And I want to finish up with Biden because that's important to get on the record.
[1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:42.300]  I mean, you know, he's in all these newspapers and all these articles saying it.
[1:24:42.300 --> 1:24:44.300]  We know he did it, but you're an eyewitness to it.
[1:24:44.300 --> 1:24:45.300]  And I've not seen that yet.
[1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:49.300]  So we'll be right back with Judge Joe Brown on our show.
[1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:51.300]  Yes, sir.
[1:24:51.300 --> 1:24:54.300]  Yes, sir.
[1:24:54.300 --> 1:24:59.300]  Granny Do Right.
[1:24:59.300 --> 1:25:00.300]  Granny Do Right.
[1:25:00.300 --> 1:25:01.300]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:25:01.300 --> 1:25:02.300]  Go ahead.
[1:25:02.300 --> 1:25:03.300]  Challenge.
[1:25:03.300 --> 1:25:05.300]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:25:05.300 --> 1:25:10.300]  I'm a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:15.300]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:25:15.300 --> 1:25:21.300]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:22.300]  actually.
[1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:24.300]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:29.300]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:25:29.300 --> 1:25:32.300]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:35.300]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:41.300]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:42.300]  This is working.
[1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:43.300]  This is wonderful.
[1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:48.300]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:54.300]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:25:54.300 --> 1:26:03.300]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at infowarstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com

[1:26:54.300 --> 1:27:00.300]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:06.300]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God
[1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:10.300]  and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:17.300]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:21.300]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:25.300]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean,
[1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:30.300]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[1:27:30.300 --> 1:27:31.300]  the beauty of music.
[1:27:31.300 --> 1:27:35.300]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic,
[1:27:35.300 --> 1:27:39.300]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[1:27:39.300 --> 1:27:42.300]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL,
[1:27:42.300 --> 1:27:44.300]  don't worship all the things of the system,
[1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:47.300]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[1:27:47.300 --> 1:28:16.300]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:29.300]  All right, Judge Joe Brown's here with us.
[1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:32.300]  He says, you'll ride shotgun, ride it in the next hour, maybe even take some calls.
[1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:34.300]  Wow, this guy's fun to talk to.
[1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:35.300]  He's really smart, too.
[1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:37.300]  And I agree with everything he's saying during the breaks.
[1:28:37.300 --> 1:28:38.300]  He wants to go all over the place.
[1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:40.300]  This guy's almost as out of control as I am.
[1:28:40.300 --> 1:28:41.300]  I love it.
[1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:43.300]  So Judge Joe Brown's here with us.
[1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:44.300]  I know you're sick of talking about Biden.
[1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:46.300]  I'm sick of looking at him.
[1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:48.300]  That stupid, you know, mullet he's got and all the rest of it.
[1:28:48.300 --> 1:28:54.300]  But it's important because people that try to expose his racism are being censored and blocked on Twitter,
[1:28:54.300 --> 1:28:58.300]  Facebook, YouTube, Google, Instagram.
[1:28:58.300 --> 1:29:01.300]  And people tried to claim that, well, you didn't have any proof of what you said,
[1:29:01.300 --> 1:29:06.300]  even though I just showed USA&A and everybody having the same quotes basically you said,
[1:29:06.300 --> 1:29:08.300]  but you saw stuff that was even worse.
[1:29:08.300 --> 1:29:13.300]  Specifically, though, if I saw Trump say anything like that, I wouldn't have voted for him.
[1:29:13.300 --> 1:29:18.300]  But they called him a white supremacist, all these horrible names with no proof.
[1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:20.300]  Then we had proof with Biden.
[1:29:20.300 --> 1:29:24.300]  Not just your eye witness testimony, but others and it's on record in transcripts.
[1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:28.300]  Hell, he said this stuff in Congress that, well, you know, the KKK is good, too.
[1:29:28.300 --> 1:29:33.300]  So he went to, he was big buddies with the grand Cyclops or whatever it's called.
[1:29:33.300 --> 1:29:34.300]  Robert Byrd.
[1:29:34.300 --> 1:29:42.300]  So just on the subject, on the record, Judge, what do you make of this and what do you make of the attempts to defend him
[1:29:42.300 --> 1:29:46.300]  while they call Donald Trump and Republicans Nazis?
[1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:50.300]  Do you swear or affirm the evidence you give here that they will be the truth, the whole truth,
[1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:51.300]  and nothing but the truth will help you?
[1:29:51.300 --> 1:29:52.300]  I do.
[1:29:52.300 --> 1:29:53.300]  Okay.
[1:29:53.300 --> 1:29:55.300]  Now, eye witness, let's get on with this.
[1:29:55.300 --> 1:30:00.300]  Let's deal with the collateral effects of what this, I call him a jackass and an idiot.
[1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:05.300]  Well, I guess that donkey they have up there for the Democratic Party, that's a jackass, right?
[1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:06.300]  So chief jackass.
[1:30:06.300 --> 1:30:07.300]  Okay.
[1:30:07.300 --> 1:30:09.300]  Let's get into this.
[1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:15.300]  The bad thing is what he has done that is not readily apparent.
[1:30:15.300 --> 1:30:28.300]  He sponsored legislation that you get in the 1977, 79, 81, 87, 91 and 94 crime bills that allows federal prosecutors
[1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:32.300]  to use the criminal process of the federal law.
[1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:33.300]  I'm looking at you, Judge.
[1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:34.300]  I'm looking at you on that model.
[1:30:34.300 --> 1:30:35.300]  You look right over there.
[1:30:35.300 --> 1:30:36.300]  Yeah.
[1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:37.300]  So I just want to see what it looks like.
[1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:38.300]  You look good.
[1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:39.300]  Yeah.
[1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:41.300]  So anyway, old man's up there upholding.
[1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:51.300]  Anyway, what happens is that it now allows the federal attorneys in various districts to
[1:30:51.300 --> 1:30:57.420]  use the criminal process to persecute people, to bring criminal charges they know cannot
[1:30:57.420 --> 1:31:04.180]  be sustained for the specific purpose of financially bankrupting or ruining these people so they
[1:31:04.180 --> 1:31:06.220]  can not continue on.
[1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:10.900]  And that's not what America is supposed to be about that bill of rights.
[1:31:10.900 --> 1:31:15.260]  We think of the bill of rights as containing all of these criminal rights, but they're
[1:31:15.260 --> 1:31:16.260]  not for criminals.
[1:31:16.260 --> 1:31:18.140]  They never were set up that way.
[1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:22.220]  They were designed to keep the federal government from being you and that's important.
[1:31:22.220 --> 1:31:25.300]  You're saying it's one thing to just be a racist and not like this group of that group.
[1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:26.300]  That's bad enough.
[1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:27.980]  But he's actually trying to take all our rights.
[1:31:27.980 --> 1:31:28.980]  Yes.
[1:31:28.980 --> 1:31:38.100]  Like if you could imagine what those German fascists, the national German socialist workers
[1:31:38.100 --> 1:31:48.620]  party types did over a 15, 20 year period to try and take control of Germany.
[1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:55.100]  You can see the same thing inherent in the assault on the bill of rights that is slowly
[1:31:55.100 --> 1:32:02.380]  but surely allowing the federal government to acquire mechanisms to be used for persecution
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:07.260]  if you have the wrong people in office and we have the wrong people in office and they
[1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:09.860]  do not need to be doing what they're doing.
[1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:11.300]  This is classical tyranny.
[1:32:11.300 --> 1:32:12.300]  This is tyranny.
[1:32:12.300 --> 1:32:18.380]  The first amendment was never designed to prevent somebody from feeling uncomfortable.
[1:32:18.380 --> 1:32:24.900]  And now you can't say anything against certain groups if they feel discomforted.
[1:32:24.900 --> 1:32:30.660]  We have this thing where we have come to depend upon Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.
[1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:31.660]  That was my next question.
[1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:32.660]  Let's introduce that.
[1:32:32.660 --> 1:32:37.180]  You did a big viral interview with a famous basketball player with the same last name.
[1:32:37.180 --> 1:32:38.180]  Kwame Brown.
[1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:39.180]  Absolutely.
[1:32:39.180 --> 1:32:40.180]  Millions of views per platform.
[1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:41.180]  Then you saw it.
[1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:42.180]  Tell me what you got.
[1:32:42.180 --> 1:32:45.740]  I've seen this happen to me on Joe Rogan and other big top shows.
[1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:47.260]  Explain what you witness yourself.
[1:32:47.260 --> 1:32:48.260]  Okay.
[1:32:48.260 --> 1:32:50.140]  Kwame Brown is an interesting person.
[1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:55.540]  He is a single parent father raising his children all by himself.
[1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:57.540]  And he's not just in the basketball.
[1:32:57.540 --> 1:32:58.860]  He's in the business too.
[1:32:58.860 --> 1:33:04.060]  And he actually has a concern with manhood, womanhood, childhood, and doing the right
[1:33:04.060 --> 1:33:05.060]  thing.
[1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:06.060]  That's how we got put together.
[1:33:06.060 --> 1:33:07.060]  He's a good man.
[1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:08.060]  Yes.
[1:33:08.060 --> 1:33:09.900]  And he was on my show just this last week past.
[1:33:09.900 --> 1:33:11.620]  So we were on each other's shows.
[1:33:11.620 --> 1:33:16.820]  We got in there and we had gotten 46,000 views when it was live, okay?
[1:33:16.820 --> 1:33:22.300]  And the most that we have for Biden was 21,000.
[1:33:22.300 --> 1:33:26.660]  And I think Trump got 47,000 views one time when it was live.
[1:33:26.660 --> 1:33:30.100]  And then we quickly ramped up to a million, made it in a half.
[1:33:30.100 --> 1:33:31.660]  And then I noticed something peculiar.
[1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:34.740]  We had 2.6 million views within hours.
[1:33:34.740 --> 1:33:42.620]  And then all of a sudden YouTube started showing 2.1, 1.9, 1.6, 1.1.
[1:33:42.620 --> 1:33:48.700]  Not somebody came on view unless you are now under my power as a Jedi master.
[1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.460]  You did not see that, you know?
[1:33:51.460 --> 1:33:53.700]  But that's what they try to do.
[1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:54.700]  There you go.
[1:33:54.700 --> 1:33:55.700]  We're up.
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:33:59.380]  And they didn't want it validated because if you get 2 million views in a couple hours,
[1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:03.860]  this will go to 100 million, 200 million, when they see a zeitgeist, they kill it.
[1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:04.860]  That's very rare.
[1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:05.860]  But it's happening to me.
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:06.860]  It's happening to you.
[1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:07.860]  And I've seen it in real time.
[1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:08.860]  We've done screenshots.
[1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:09.860]  Exactly.
[1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:10.860]  That was going to go to 100 million views.
[1:34:10.860 --> 1:34:13.820]  They've come together in racism, bring back to family.
[1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:14.820]  It was powerful.
[1:34:14.820 --> 1:34:16.020]  The interview was incredible.
[1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:19.580]  And because it was lightning in a bottle, they said, because when they suppress the
[1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:23.540]  views, it suppresses the rating, because when you get that top view, it sends you to the
[1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:24.540]  top of the chart.
[1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:27.500]  So it's not just about making people feel like, oh, you didn't get those views.
[1:34:27.500 --> 1:34:32.220]  It's about not letting you go to the blue ribbon spot at the top, which then makes it
[1:34:32.220 --> 1:34:33.220]  bigger and bigger.
[1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:34.220]  Well, OK.
[1:34:34.220 --> 1:34:35.220]  Let's take my show.
[1:34:35.220 --> 1:34:36.220]  15 years.
[1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:41.100]  I started out with Paramount and CBS, they were all affiliates of Viacom.
[1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:47.340]  They brought in a very interesting individual named Roger King, who had benefited from his
[1:34:47.340 --> 1:34:54.860]  father's work in syndication, King World, not King World, yeah, King World.
[1:34:54.860 --> 1:34:58.660]  And Roger King was a football player, big guy.
[1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:04.580]  And he brought in Oprah Winfrey, who he had discovered, and Dr. Phil, who he had discovered,
[1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:07.100]  and they gave him me and Judge Judy.
[1:35:07.100 --> 1:35:11.980]  So for the last four or five years of the show, when he was running this set, I was
[1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:18.420]  beating Oprah damn near every week in the year with ratings, Phil, every single week.
[1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:19.980]  I remember when you were number one.
[1:35:19.980 --> 1:35:20.980]  Yes.
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:25.140]  And see, but they did not want a straight black man to be the number one TV show in
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:26.140]  America.
[1:35:26.140 --> 1:35:31.780]  Because you're patriotic, you're parental, and that's not what they want.
[1:35:31.780 --> 1:35:36.580]  No, I see what I was trying to do is public peace, dignity, and order are important.
[1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:42.020]  Duty on our obligation, responsibility, accountability, dependability, making where you live a better
[1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:47.100]  safer, more secure place filled with economic prosperity, ethics, morality, and sense of
[1:35:47.100 --> 1:35:49.540]  purpose is important.
[1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:56.420]  Men should be men of peace and order who can be brave and courageous when necessary.
[1:35:56.420 --> 1:36:01.940]  So what happens is that we find people who are trying to tamp that down and switch us
[1:36:01.940 --> 1:36:08.420]  into a country of licentiousness, hedonistic pursuit, and the devil with those things that
[1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:12.580]  humans have stood up for throughout our sojourn on this planet.
[1:36:12.580 --> 1:36:15.340]  It is disgraceful.
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:16.900]  I'm black, okay?
[1:36:16.900 --> 1:36:21.420]  And I remember in the 60s when black people had a real problem with self-love.
[1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:25.380]  We were deep into self-hate because we had been downed in all the media.
[1:36:25.380 --> 1:36:30.900]  You never saw us except in a subservient, very insulting role.
[1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:35.540]  So we decided to be, I'm black and I'm proud, black power.
[1:36:35.540 --> 1:36:41.540]  And that was a way to bootstrap your own mind up until you started thinking well.
[1:36:41.540 --> 1:36:46.700]  Now we have these people who are so deep into self-hate, self-loathing that they hate what
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:49.300]  they are and they hate what they want to be.
[1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:54.260]  And now we have them juxtaposed on the educational system.
[1:36:54.260 --> 1:37:01.340]  So we have them looking like Harlequin women, masquerading is such, and they're teaching
[1:37:01.340 --> 1:37:06.340]  our children how to read and read stories to them, and that is just inculcating them
[1:37:06.340 --> 1:37:07.340]  with...
[1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:08.340]  And there's a large agenda.
[1:37:08.340 --> 1:37:10.340]  We're going to come back and talk about that because your main push is the family and that
[1:37:10.340 --> 1:37:11.740]  is the most important push.
[1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:16.940]  There is an open push to have men dress as women come talk to our children before even
[1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:17.940]  a...
[1:37:17.940 --> 1:37:20.580]  I haven't talked to my children when they're five years old about sex, but they want a
[1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:25.300]  weird dude and a wig to talk to my children at age five about sex when my children haven't
[1:37:25.300 --> 1:37:26.300]  even thought about that.
[1:37:26.300 --> 1:37:31.060]  Have you seen that thing that's making the circulation on social media?
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.260]  It's a first grade teacher in New York.
[1:37:34.260 --> 1:37:35.260]  Who?
[1:37:35.260 --> 1:37:36.260]  Teaching kids how to shake their ass.
[1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:37.260]  Yeah.
[1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:38.260]  No.
[1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:39.260]  Not through the how to masturbate.
[1:37:39.260 --> 1:37:43.820]  So he's got video and everything else and they've got a little cartoon thing and now
[1:37:43.820 --> 1:37:45.300]  they've got a play that...
[1:37:45.300 --> 1:37:46.300]  See, I didn't even...
[1:37:46.300 --> 1:37:47.300]  Oh my God.
[1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:48.300]  It's like...
[1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:49.300]  Hold on, John.
[1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:50.300]  Oh God.
[1:37:50.300 --> 1:37:51.300]  I don't want to get humorous.
[1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:52.300]  I mean, it's like...
[1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:53.300]  Wow.
[1:37:53.300 --> 1:37:54.300]  How do you do your homework?
[1:37:54.300 --> 1:37:58.420]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with
[1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:02.140]  the globalist attack on humanity and all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[1:38:02.140 --> 1:38:06.580]  you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:38:06.580 --> 1:38:10.180]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that no public doesn't get to see and let
[1:38:10.180 --> 1:38:15.780]  me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[1:38:15.780 --> 1:38:22.500]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[1:38:22.500 --> 1:38:26.620]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[1:38:26.620 --> 1:38:29.260]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:38:29.260 --> 1:38:33.580]  You fund us, you support M4.com, you get rate policy at the same time.
[1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:38.540]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:43.380]  you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:38:43.380 --> 1:38:48.700]  That's our job, so please keep us on air, so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be
[1:38:48.700 --> 1:38:51.220]  the shock groups for the information war.

[1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:32.900]  Triple H, 253, 33139 is the Indian Power Store hotline.
[1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:36.700]  Triple H, 253, 3139 is the Indian Power Store hotline.
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:40:00.420]  By all remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[1:40:00.420 --> 1:40:04.860]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:40:04.860 --> 1:40:06.860]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:40:06.860 --> 1:40:11.900]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:13.940]  products to the everyday consumer.

[1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:55.180]  Thebiopros.com.
[1:40:55.180 --> 1:41:02.180]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:03.500]  that this is all a test.
[1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:09.460]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:41:09.460 --> 1:41:14.740]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:19.020]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[1:41:19.020 --> 1:41:20.020]  down to that.
[1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:24.100]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:28.380]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:41:28.380 --> 1:41:31.980]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:37.540]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:41:37.540 --> 1:41:41.980]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[1:41:41.980 --> 1:41:47.140]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:41:47.140 --> 1:41:50.820]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan
[1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:57.580]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:41:57.580 --> 1:42:16.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:22.420]  Judge Joe Brown used to have high ratings in Oprah Winfrey that they tried to suppress
[1:42:22.420 --> 1:42:23.420]  the show.
[1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:28.060]  I remember watching it and hearing about it and now here he is in studio with us, hosts
[1:42:28.060 --> 1:42:32.980]  his own shows multiple times a week, does all these big viral interviews, we're very
[1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:33.980]  blessed to have him.
[1:42:33.980 --> 1:42:34.980]  I'd say this guy is something else.
[1:42:34.980 --> 1:42:37.020]  You're really missing out during these four minute breaks.
[1:42:37.020 --> 1:42:42.500]  But he mentioned this, I didn't even know about it, but here it is, report New York Dalton
[1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:48.380]  School teachers, that's where Jeffrey Epstein taught, teaches six year olds about masturbation
[1:42:48.380 --> 1:42:56.140]  with a disturbing cartoon judge who handed a drag queen story hour sponsor arrested
[1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:58.020]  on child porn charges.
[1:42:58.020 --> 1:43:02.540]  So you just brought that up, we just backed up what you said, Judge give us your take
[1:43:02.540 --> 1:43:03.540]  on this.
[1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:09.980]  Okay, well that judge, his honor, if I can say that, with a little distaste in my mouth
[1:43:09.980 --> 1:43:14.580]  was also a drag queen and he was head of one of their associations.
[1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:20.660]  He was doing this, teaching children and having them sitting in his lap and then lo and behold
[1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:22.780]  he gets arrested for kiddie porn.
[1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:28.780]  Now this thing, see, what is this?
[1:43:28.780 --> 1:43:34.060]  I remember and I'm in my 70s, I remember all of the little ditties and things that went
[1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:38.300]  on when I was in the first, second, third grade stays in your mind, you know, all of
[1:43:38.300 --> 1:43:42.260]  those little things, what's going to stay in these kids minds and this thing about
[1:43:42.260 --> 1:43:49.900]  masturbation, wow, that is the school teaching you about sex when your parents don't even
[1:43:49.900 --> 1:43:51.620]  do that in the first grade.
[1:43:51.620 --> 1:43:52.620]  This is pedophilia.
[1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:55.420]  Okay, can you see this thing, Johnny, do your homework.
[1:43:55.420 --> 1:43:57.580]  No, mother, I don't want to do it anymore.
[1:43:57.580 --> 1:44:04.300]  Johnny, please, mother, but it's sore, I've done it five times, please, you know, a little
[1:44:04.300 --> 1:44:08.060]  humor in there, but that's how ridiculous this mess is.
[1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:10.340]  So what are we going here?
[1:44:10.340 --> 1:44:16.060]  I agree with you because I didn't even find out about that till I was like 10 or 11 that
[1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:17.900]  took over all my time.
[1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:21.940]  Imagine five-year-olds, I mean, they're literally perverts trying to have first contact with
[1:44:21.940 --> 1:44:23.740]  you about a sexual experience.
[1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:25.580]  That is, that's pedophilia, this is-
[1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:30.420]  See, I don't want to get on homosexuals, they have a right to do what they want to do, but
[1:44:30.420 --> 1:44:37.660]  this LGBTQ thing is a cult and it's becoming the official state religion.
[1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:43.940]  I mean, the parents can't opt out of this kind of thing, they have no choice, the children
[1:44:43.940 --> 1:44:49.940]  are made to sit through there, and it's like you had a religion where the government imposes
[1:44:49.940 --> 1:44:50.940]  it on the citizens.
[1:44:50.940 --> 1:44:52.260]  And that violates the First Amendment.
[1:44:52.260 --> 1:44:56.900]  That is certainly a violation of the First Amendment, but you can't even say anything
[1:44:56.900 --> 1:44:59.060]  against it without getting censored.
[1:44:59.060 --> 1:45:03.340]  Man, where's this guy been all my life, it's like I'm in my own brain right now.
[1:45:03.340 --> 1:45:10.300]  And then you have this thing here where, for God's sake, you've got school districts that
[1:45:10.300 --> 1:45:14.420]  pass stuff out to children telling them how to get around their parents.
[1:45:14.420 --> 1:45:20.860]  I've seen brochures people have given me where it instructs the kids to go to Wal-Mart or
[1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:28.020]  Walgreens or CVS pharmacy and you can get one of these loaded credit cards and put your
[1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:34.860]  money up cash and get 50, 60, bill it up to $100 and it tells you sites where you can
[1:45:34.860 --> 1:45:38.100]  get these adult toys and it tells you...
[1:45:38.100 --> 1:45:39.100]  Or abortion pills.
[1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:41.580]  No, not abortion pills, it's worse than that.
[1:45:41.580 --> 1:45:46.980]  I ought to get these dildos so that they can practice insertion so when they have their
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:50.740]  first homosexual experience, it'll be a pleasant one.
[1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:55.460]  And if they can't do that, they tell them how to go shop for cucumbers, for God's sake.
[1:45:55.460 --> 1:45:56.460]  Wow.
[1:45:56.460 --> 1:46:00.260]  Well, you told me about this, I didn't know about it, but what else is going on, Judge?
[1:46:00.260 --> 1:46:04.460]  I'll show you how to use hair conditioning as a lubricant.
[1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:09.260]  I mean, what are you giving this to children for and telling them how to do it so they're
[1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:10.260]  paying for it?
[1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:14.900]  If a man was doing this at the park, he'd get put in jail because it's a rainbow flag
[1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:16.460]  and the teachers, it's happening.
[1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:23.260]  Yes, see, now there is this thing that Josef Goibles, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi member
[1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:28.500]  minister of propaganda came up with, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler knew, if you tell
[1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:33.780]  a lie long enough and loud enough, you can get anybody to believe it and swear to it.
[1:46:33.780 --> 1:46:39.580]  Now the truth is an implacable enemy of the lie and Goebbels warned over and over again,
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:46.140]  the truth must be suppressed so it does not interfere with the popularity of the lie.
[1:46:46.140 --> 1:46:50.180]  So what we have right now is a suppression of truth.
[1:46:50.180 --> 1:46:57.420]  You have a U.S. president, for God's sake, who has been suspended from social media because
[1:46:57.420 --> 1:47:00.860]  he simply states an unpopular position.
[1:47:00.860 --> 1:47:04.860]  They declare it not to be true, therefore, we won't let you see it.
[1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:10.300]  Well, the whole American thing is all about freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom
[1:47:10.300 --> 1:47:14.220]  to assemble and petition for redress of grievance.
[1:47:14.220 --> 1:47:19.100]  And even if you don't agree with a point, the consensus that develops from being able
[1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:23.100]  to hear all sides is what makes this country what it is.
[1:47:23.100 --> 1:47:28.740]  It's important and it's necessary and when you have the only means available for communication
[1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:35.020]  with the masses of people, where social media becomes the soapbox on which the person stood
[1:47:35.020 --> 1:47:40.580]  to advocate down on the corner, down in the park, down in front of the church or town
[1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:43.640]  hall and you take that away, where are you going here?
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:47.980]  So you only have one position allowed and one of the things that you seek to do when
[1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:53.740]  you have propaganda is convince the majority of the people that they are in the minority.
[1:47:53.740 --> 1:47:57.740]  In other words, you become reticent and reluctant.
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:47:59.100]  They bully you in the submission.
[1:47:59.100 --> 1:48:00.380]  Well, it's not even bullying.
[1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:04.860]  You just don't want to say anything because I don't want to be the outside freak here.
[1:48:04.860 --> 1:48:09.340]  Everybody else thinks this way, but I think that way when actually everybody else is thinking
[1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:11.500]  that way and you've got a situation.
[1:48:11.500 --> 1:48:13.100]  You're saying it's gaslighting.
[1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:14.220]  It is gaslighting.
[1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:17.180]  And see, it's flipped the script.
[1:48:17.180 --> 1:48:18.180]  You have terminology.
[1:48:18.180 --> 1:48:19.740]  So you're flipping the script back.
[1:48:19.740 --> 1:48:20.740]  Yeah.
[1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:23.420]  It's like you've got things like homophobic.
[1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:26.460]  Homophobia is ridiculous.
[1:48:26.460 --> 1:48:30.660]  Straight people don't have an unreasoning fear and phobia of homosexuals.
[1:48:30.660 --> 1:48:31.660]  They just don't like them.
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:32.660]  They think it's detestable.
[1:48:32.660 --> 1:48:33.660]  Detestable.
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:39.260]  Well, we just don't want you teaching our five-year-olds, I had a real sexual and homosexual.
[1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:40.260]  Stay away from my kids.
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:43.100]  In other words, what you do in your own bedroom is your own damn business.
[1:48:43.100 --> 1:48:48.340]  Get your freak on if you want to, but when you start trying to barge in somebody else's
[1:48:48.340 --> 1:48:51.820]  living room with their children, family, and themselves in there.
[1:48:51.820 --> 1:48:52.820]  They are judged.
[1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:54.220]  They are beating us over the head with it.
[1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:55.220]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[1:48:55.220 --> 1:49:00.580]  I mean, it's like, for God's sake, I got on an airplane coming here and I'm in first
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:06.460]  class and they have these screens right in front of you on the seat back and I turned
[1:49:06.460 --> 1:49:11.380]  it on and for this month's special, everything on there for movies, just about except three
[1:49:11.380 --> 1:49:13.820]  or four of them had some gay thing.
[1:49:13.820 --> 1:49:14.820]  Oh yeah.
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:20.060]  And now Prado in Canada says it's going to be the whole summer is gay pride.
[1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:21.060]  Well, yeah.
[1:49:21.060 --> 1:49:22.060]  And let's talk about it.
[1:49:22.060 --> 1:49:23.060]  So they're forcing the menu.
[1:49:23.060 --> 1:49:24.780]  It's one thing to have a gay thing on the menu.
[1:49:24.780 --> 1:49:25.780]  No, no, no.
[1:49:25.780 --> 1:49:26.940]  It's you're going to do this.
[1:49:26.940 --> 1:49:29.900]  You're going to hear about what we do in our bedrooms.
[1:49:29.900 --> 1:49:30.900]  That's weird.
[1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:31.900]  And then look at this.
[1:49:31.900 --> 1:49:32.900]  Let's say gay pride.
[1:49:32.900 --> 1:49:34.500]  That's their business.
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:40.940]  But psychologically, something is way wrong when you manifested by having men standing
[1:49:40.940 --> 1:49:47.220]  on a float down on their or down on their knees and they've got on leather chaps and
[1:49:47.220 --> 1:49:51.700]  nothing else and everything's hanging out or they say, they say, bring your children
[1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:52.700]  to a game.
[1:49:52.700 --> 1:49:53.700]  Yeah.
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:54.700]  Right.
[1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:55.700]  Like blues blues.
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:56.700]  Well, I've seen the videos of these things.
[1:49:56.700 --> 1:49:59.300]  These these like people stabbing themselves and crapping on the street.
[1:49:59.300 --> 1:50:00.300]  Yeah.
[1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:03.700]  I mean, this is like, it's a burlesque and it does not show pride.
[1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:06.700]  It's a psychological manifestation of self hate.
[1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:07.700]  Like look at this.
[1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:11.580]  There's a child here, somebody needs to be in jail for this.
[1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:16.180]  They bring that little boy when he was up to seven and eight and nine and he's now 11
[1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:19.620]  and he dances half naked in front of men that throw money at him.
[1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:23.620]  And then the people in the video have already committed suicide or died that actually are
[1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:24.620]  with him.
[1:50:24.620 --> 1:50:25.620]  Yeah.
[1:50:25.620 --> 1:50:26.620]  That somebody needs to be locked up.
[1:50:26.620 --> 1:50:27.940]  Look at this.
[1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:28.940]  That's a burlesque.
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:29.940]  Does a woman look like that?
[1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:30.940]  Well, that's mind control.
[1:50:30.940 --> 1:50:31.940]  That's a little victim.
[1:50:31.940 --> 1:50:32.940]  But does any woman look like that?
[1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:35.540]  See, it's not only for the children.
[1:50:35.540 --> 1:50:38.180]  The thing is, that's a boy.
[1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:43.140]  They're trying to make it a girl, but you see how they portray femininity.
[1:50:43.140 --> 1:50:45.140]  That is also impacting girls.
[1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:50.500]  Well, let's have a guy that handles that little boy.
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:53.060]  Just committed suicide or he died of an overdose.
[1:50:53.060 --> 1:50:56.260]  He famously cut up his gay boyfriend with a chainsaw.
[1:50:56.260 --> 1:50:57.260]  Yeah.
[1:50:57.260 --> 1:50:58.860]  And then see, look at that.
[1:50:58.860 --> 1:50:59.860]  Why are they doing this?
[1:50:59.860 --> 1:51:00.860]  We shot this in Austin.
[1:51:00.860 --> 1:51:03.180]  Look, look at this.
[1:51:03.180 --> 1:51:06.900]  Why are you showing this horrid burlesque to children?
[1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:12.740]  And the other thing is, see, there's a difference between being sexy and just being trashy.
[1:51:12.740 --> 1:51:18.580]  And my other thing is, is women need to be protected from this because this gives a very
[1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:20.780]  bad image of women.
[1:51:20.780 --> 1:51:22.900]  Women do not dress like that.
[1:51:22.900 --> 1:51:23.900]  That's right.
[1:51:23.900 --> 1:51:26.180]  Now, gross obese men are posing as women.
[1:51:26.180 --> 1:51:32.020]  And I'll never forget when Cuomo on CNN said five years ago, women were complaining saying,
[1:51:32.020 --> 1:51:37.660]  they don't want the coaches to shower with our 10-year-old girls and see their genitals.
[1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:42.060]  And he said, if your daughter sees a man's penis and doesn't think a woman's beautiful,
[1:51:42.060 --> 1:51:44.820]  that's mind control, she's a bigot.
[1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:48.380]  So if your 10-year-old girl doesn't want to be in the shower with a coach that calls
[1:51:48.380 --> 1:51:52.780]  himself a woman, but is really a man, is really a pervert, then you're bad.
[1:51:52.780 --> 1:51:54.540]  I mean, that is mind control.
[1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:55.540]  Yes.
[1:51:55.540 --> 1:51:56.760]  I mean, look at this.
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:58.460]  Women don't look like that.
[1:51:58.460 --> 1:52:00.900]  This is a parody of womanhood.
[1:52:00.900 --> 1:52:03.140]  But you see, it's an abomination of women.
[1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:04.140]  Yes.
[1:52:04.140 --> 1:52:09.140]  And that is, when you take it all together, that destroys the family.
[1:52:09.140 --> 1:52:16.900]  It's like, take BLM, BLM until some black people, not far right, Republicans got on
[1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:20.060]  them about the con they were running on the public.
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.420]  And you get through there what we believe in.
[1:52:22.420 --> 1:52:23.420]  Hold on.
[1:52:23.420 --> 1:52:24.420]  Stay there.
[1:52:24.420 --> 1:52:25.420]  We're doing the whole next hour.
[1:52:25.420 --> 1:52:26.420]  BLM, the Second Amendment.
[1:52:26.420 --> 1:52:29.860]  We're going to get back in the attack on the family and how we fight back with Judge
[1:52:29.860 --> 1:52:30.860]  Joe Brown.
[1:52:30.860 --> 1:52:31.860]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:34.460]  Hour number three straight ahead today.
[1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:37.860]  You don't want to miss this until everybody you know to it right now.
[1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:43.300]  That's how these shows get around the center.
[1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:48.100]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:52:48.100 --> 1:52:50.820]  from beta testing to operational.
[1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:55.580]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:52:55.580 --> 1:52:56.580]  takeover.
[1:52:56.580 --> 1:52:59.980]  The good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working
[1:52:59.980 --> 1:53:04.620]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:05.740]  Humanity is strong.
[1:53:05.740 --> 1:53:06.740]  We're incredible.
[1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:10.220]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:53:10.220 --> 1:53:12.900]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:17.140]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[1:53:17.140 --> 1:53:18.940]  others is absolutely essential.
[1:53:18.940 --> 1:53:23.380]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:27.060]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:29.060]  also funding our operation.
[1:53:29.060 --> 1:53:30.060]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:31.060]  Infowarsstore.com is incredible.
[1:53:31.060 --> 1:53:36.700]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:39.180]  back in like bodies, vasobites, and others.
[1:53:39.180 --> 1:53:44.700]  So get them today at infowarsstore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:53:44.700 --> 1:53:48.100]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:53:48.100 --> 1:53:52.340]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:53:52.340 --> 1:53:56.300]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist
[1:53:56.300 --> 1:53:59.940]  publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:53:59.940 --> 1:54:04.220]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air, and please support the local states you're
[1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:05.220]  listening to as well.
[1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:11.380]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:16.260]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:17.740]  in the face of this thing.
[1:54:17.740 --> 1:54:19.860]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:54:19.860 --> 1:54:24.180]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:54:24.180 --> 1:54:29.580]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:34.820]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarsstore.com.
[1:54:34.820 --> 1:54:39.340]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:44.380]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:54:44.380 --> 1:54:47.660]  Thank you so much.
[1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:50.220]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:23.380]  The judge has a big announcement coming up next segment that I actually magically brought
[1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:24.380]  up.
[1:55:24.380 --> 1:55:25.380]  I didn't even know.
[1:55:25.380 --> 1:55:30.860]  So that is coming up next segment, but finishing up with a sexual assault on children, on their
[1:55:30.860 --> 1:55:36.100]  minds, on their innocence, with the rainbow flag attached to it, a lot of convicted pedophiles
[1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:41.060]  are now being caught at schools, elementary schools, at libraries.
[1:55:41.060 --> 1:55:45.180]  They come, the children still in their laps, they read to them, and it's these horrific
[1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:49.980]  looking obese men dressed like clowns saying, this is femininity, and you're right, it's
[1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:53.020]  not just an assault on children, it's an assault on women.
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:57.460]  It's when I first met you today, you said, Alex, it's the attack on the family that's
[1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:00.660]  going to unify humanity, and I'm, that's why I'm unified.
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:04.060]  I've always been unified and love everybody, but I know there's all sorts of weird stuff
[1:56:04.060 --> 1:56:06.380]  goes on, people get mad at each other, that happens.
[1:56:06.380 --> 1:56:11.580]  But all that's a side issue compared to this evil assault on the family, where is it coming
[1:56:11.580 --> 1:56:12.580]  from?
[1:56:12.580 --> 1:56:13.580]  Are you stating?
[1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:16.220]  Let's get some history here.
[1:56:16.220 --> 1:56:21.700]  55 years ago, when I was on UCLA's campus, I heard the beginnings.
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:24.220]  You had a coalition that was forming.
[1:56:24.220 --> 1:56:28.660]  You had what we call the beta boys, the white guys that couldn't get along in the white
[1:56:28.660 --> 1:56:34.500]  man's world, because essentially they wound up being nerds, webs, and all of that other
[1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:38.380]  stuff that came into being the term applied.
[1:56:38.380 --> 1:56:43.540]  Then you had the feminist who hated the fact that they weren't men, then you had the lesbian
[1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:50.060]  men who hated men, you had the homosexuals who was scared of men, and they sort of formed
[1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:57.020]  the coalition, and they wound up embracing those who were transvestites, as they were
[1:56:57.020 --> 1:56:59.300]  called in.
[1:56:59.300 --> 1:57:03.820]  That didn't give them the ballast, but there was an anti-war thing, and the popular thing
[1:57:03.820 --> 1:57:09.500]  was, hey, babe, you know, like we got to stop war, babe, and like, you know, the man thing,
[1:57:09.500 --> 1:57:14.580]  big bed, is like a war thing, so we need to change the way we raise boys to men, so we
[1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:19.860]  raise the black girls, and they will emote, and cry, and shout, and let it all hang out
[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:26.540]  instead of being so uptight in starting war, and, sisters, we must raise our children to
[1:57:26.540 --> 1:57:30.340]  be like us, so we are sought, and all that nonsense.
[1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:35.380]  So when you put that ballast in the anti-war thing, which I assume was driven by that
[1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:41.540]  concern, with greetings from your president, you're here by order to report to your local
[1:57:41.540 --> 1:57:46.860]  induction center for a pre-induction physical pursuant to your being declared a 1A.
[1:57:46.860 --> 1:57:54.220]  All right, people didn't want a free year-long, all-expense paid vacation in sunny Vietnam,
[1:57:54.220 --> 1:57:57.500]  so we had that ballast added.
[1:57:57.500 --> 1:58:03.380]  There was another thing that went on, Hollywood studios that did movies were going bankrupt
[1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:05.420]  because of color television.
[1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:10.300]  What had happened was your typical theater experience, which is you walked in any time
[1:58:10.300 --> 1:58:11.300]  you want.
[1:58:11.300 --> 1:58:18.340]  As an adult, you paid 50 to 75 cents, you got to see two movies, a subfeature, and three
[1:58:18.340 --> 1:58:21.460]  or four cartoons, and you sat as long as you wanted left.
[1:58:21.460 --> 1:58:27.460]  They came up with the bright idea of doing one show that lasted as long as people would
[1:58:27.460 --> 1:58:32.020]  come instead of two new movies every Thursday and Sunday.
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:36.820]  They started appealing to certain minorities by going to the lowest common denominator
[1:58:36.820 --> 1:58:39.660]  to get the cash flow out of that.
[1:58:39.660 --> 1:58:44.620]  As a black man, I know I did not like these black exploitation movies where they started
[1:58:44.620 --> 1:58:48.100]  glorifying dysfunction as the norm, which was bad.
[1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:54.100]  Instead of aspiring to be a businessman, an upstanding father, a member of the community,
[1:58:54.100 --> 1:59:01.140]  pimps, holes, drug dealers, gangsters, robbers, burglars, and thieves were glorified and made
[1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:03.500]  the heroes.
[1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:07.780]  You took the trash element and you made them very important.
[1:59:07.780 --> 1:59:16.340]  Now, they dedicated themselves to a 25-year, 50-year, and we're at the 50-year,.75 and
[1:59:16.340 --> 1:59:17.860]  100-year programs.
[1:59:17.860 --> 1:59:23.500]  They talked about how they would have a secret party that they could...
[1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:24.500]  Hold on.
[1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:26.940]  You're laying the total knowledge on people because I've studied all this, but you've
[1:59:26.940 --> 1:59:27.940]  lived it.
[1:59:27.940 --> 1:59:31.740]  I've been on there for 27 years, this is the next level, because you've given everybody
[1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:36.580]  the gestalt of all your knowledge and then to how they did it in their secret program,
[1:59:36.580 --> 1:59:37.580]  where it's leading us.
[1:59:37.580 --> 1:59:41.460]  We're back in 60 seconds with Judge Joe Brown.
[1:59:41.460 --> 1:59:42.660]  I am blown away.
[1:59:42.660 --> 1:59:47.340]  This is exactly what we're facing, and he's telling it all to stay with us.
[1:59:47.340 --> 1:59:52.220]  I don't even know if we get where it was.
[1:59:52.220 --> 1:59:57.540]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[1:59:57.540 --> 2:00:01.580]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[2:00:01.580 --> 2:00:04.820]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[2:00:04.820 --> 2:00:08.020]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[2:00:08.020 --> 2:00:10.460]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:00:10.460 --> 2:00:15.220]  They play God, and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to
[2:00:15.220 --> 2:00:16.220]  us.
[2:00:16.220 --> 2:00:18.940]  I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me.
[2:00:18.940 --> 2:00:23.900]  They've tried to get me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have
[2:00:23.900 --> 2:00:24.900]  the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:24.900 --> 2:00:28.580]  I have the connection with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join
[2:00:28.580 --> 2:00:29.580]  the enemy.
[2:00:29.580 --> 2:00:34.380]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[2:00:34.380 --> 2:00:38.780]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power over it.
[2:00:38.780 --> 2:00:44.580]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:49.140]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[2:00:49.140 --> 2:00:56.140]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[1:44:32.080 --> 2:01:22.740]  but I don't tell people it's one of the best interviews ever for no reason.
[2:01:22.740 --> 2:01:27.780]  Judge Joe Brown is blowing me away right now because I've studied all this stuff, but he
[2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:31.500]  lived it and saw it, and to hear him, it's just taken us to the next level.
[2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:36.100]  So he's been on fire the last hour he was on, but that little five-minute segment, some
[2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:40.300]  stations don't care that they air news there, and of course he had to just do a grand slam
[2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:41.300]  at that point.
[2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:46.260]  So I asked him to recap what he was saying, and he just got to the point where he's there
[2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:47.980]  with the, he's witnessing on the campus.
[2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:53.860]  The Socialist, the Communist, and their secret plan to take over society, to end war by ending
[2:01:53.860 --> 2:01:54.860]  the family.
[2:01:54.860 --> 2:01:58.740]  And you see, Black Lives Matter goal is to get black men to transition to women and
[2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:00.540]  to end the nuclear family.
[2:02:00.540 --> 2:02:03.900]  That's not what your friend says to you, folks, and headlines like the nuclear family was
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:04.900]  bad.
[2:02:04.900 --> 2:02:05.900]  Let's get rid of it.
[2:02:05.900 --> 2:02:08.740]  Well, you see what, this is the enslavement of everybody.
[2:02:08.740 --> 2:02:11.060]  So Judge, you're on fire, my friend.
[2:02:11.060 --> 2:02:12.060]  Please continue.
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:13.060]  Okay.
[2:02:13.060 --> 2:02:14.780]  Let me approach it this way in a recapitulation.
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:19.060]  Right now, BLM took down their manifesto, which is Black Lives Matter.
[2:02:19.060 --> 2:02:24.340]  But when you got into the manifesto, the first point was, we are for the destruction of the
[2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:26.340]  traditional nuclear family.
[2:02:26.340 --> 2:02:27.540]  They tell you that.
[2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:29.180]  That's their point one.
[2:02:29.180 --> 2:02:34.940]  Then it's going, we are to destroy cisgender privilege in the family.
[2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:40.100]  Cisgender means normal people, men and women, mother and father, and you see this assault
[2:02:40.100 --> 2:02:43.220]  on motherhood, so you're not supposed to say mother anymore.
[2:02:43.220 --> 2:02:46.100]  You're supposed to say birth parent.
[2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:47.600]  That's absolutely preposterous.
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:49.100]  But how did we get there?
[2:02:49.100 --> 2:02:54.380]  Well, 57, 55 years ago, I heard this on UCLA's campus.
[2:02:54.380 --> 2:02:57.540]  We had a setup where everybody could get the mic down in the park.
[2:02:57.540 --> 2:03:01.180]  We had Meyerhoff Park at the foot of the UCLA stairs going up.
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:03.180]  So they would preach.
[2:03:03.180 --> 2:03:10.780]  And there was a coalition between the beta, soy boy type, nerds, duds, we...
[2:03:10.780 --> 2:03:11.780]  That's big tech.
[2:03:11.780 --> 2:03:12.780]  Later.
[2:03:12.780 --> 2:03:13.780]  You know, this kind.
[2:03:13.780 --> 2:03:17.980]  There were white guys who couldn't make it in the white man's world because they just
[2:03:17.980 --> 2:03:18.980]  couldn't cope.
[2:03:18.980 --> 2:03:22.780]  They didn't match the macho imagery and disposition.
[2:03:22.780 --> 2:03:28.380]  You had the feminist who hated the fact that they weren't men, and you had lesbians who
[2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:29.380]  hated men.
[2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:31.780]  You had homosexuals that were scared of men.
[2:03:31.780 --> 2:03:35.860]  And you had a lot of other people, but that wasn't enough to really get it going.
[2:03:35.860 --> 2:03:42.300]  You had this thing with the war, and you had women preaching all the time that war was
[2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:43.300]  a man thing.
[2:03:43.300 --> 2:03:49.780]  And the way you stop war is we must raise our boys like girls so they learn to cry to
[2:03:49.780 --> 2:03:52.500]  him out to shout to let it all hang out.
[2:03:52.500 --> 2:03:58.100]  Gee, man, we got to teach the boys, man, like they're the girls so they don't get uptight,
[2:03:58.100 --> 2:04:02.640]  man, and get it building up and get war.
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:08.340]  So you got this unisex child clothing, unisex child rearing, no war, toys, cap guns, water
[2:04:08.340 --> 2:04:09.340]  pistols, BB guns.
[2:04:09.340 --> 2:04:13.940]  Target doesn't have boys and girls sections, but of course my daughter, the daughters, it
[2:04:13.940 --> 2:04:17.340]  could be the girls here or the boys there, she goes right to the girls.
[2:04:17.340 --> 2:04:18.340]  She's designed that way.
[2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:19.340]  Yeah.
[2:04:19.340 --> 2:04:23.780]  So girls like to shop, guys like to get outside, but you're supposed to kill that all.
[2:04:23.780 --> 2:04:28.740]  So anyway, what happens is that added the ballast to this movement to get things going
[2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:35.300]  because people didn't want to spend one year on a free, all expense paid vacation in sunny,
[2:04:35.300 --> 2:04:37.660]  hot, humid Vietnam.
[2:04:37.660 --> 2:04:42.940]  Now that has kind of evaporated since we don't have the draft anymore.
[2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:46.980]  Now they pledged to take control of the entertainment industry.
[2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:50.940]  They wanted to get control of the news industry and they would determine to get in control
[2:04:50.940 --> 2:04:51.940]  with politics.
[2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:52.940]  And what would you call them?
[2:04:52.940 --> 2:04:53.940]  Transhumanist, communist?
[2:04:53.940 --> 2:04:54.940]  It just...
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:57.060]  It was a coalition.
[2:04:57.060 --> 2:04:58.060]  It wasn't any...
[2:04:58.060 --> 2:05:00.900]  That's what Clinton called it, according to Larry Nichols, they called it our broken
[2:05:00.900 --> 2:05:01.900]  coalition.
[2:05:01.900 --> 2:05:06.940]  Yes, it's like tune in, turn on, turn on, tune in and drop out.
[2:05:06.940 --> 2:05:11.540]  In other words, you just drop out and you lose all your standards and instead of saying
[2:05:11.540 --> 2:05:17.500]  duty out of obligation, which were looked at as bad terms because they lived to war,
[2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:18.500]  you were...
[2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:21.980]  And so that's why in Austin, the mayor goes, we want homelessness and needles and feces.
[2:05:21.980 --> 2:05:23.100]  We want to collapse.
[2:05:23.100 --> 2:05:24.100]  That's virtuous.
[2:05:24.100 --> 2:05:25.100]  He was taught that.
[2:05:25.100 --> 2:05:26.100]  Yeah.
[2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.180]  See, what they wanted was, it's all about you.
[2:05:29.180 --> 2:05:30.180]  Don't have anything.
[2:05:30.180 --> 2:05:31.180]  Be...
[2:05:31.180 --> 2:05:32.700]  And even the army picked it up wrong.
[2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:34.900]  Be all you can be is their slogan.
[2:05:34.900 --> 2:05:42.060]  I got a standing ovation from an assembly of officers and men in the Corps of Engineers
[2:05:42.060 --> 2:05:43.500]  when I said, that's wrong.
[2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:49.060]  Instead of saying, be all you can be, because you can be a damn fool, be all you ought to
[2:05:49.060 --> 2:05:50.060]  be.
[2:05:50.060 --> 2:05:51.740]  And that's the standard that we ought to have.
[2:05:51.740 --> 2:05:53.260]  Well, that's just like that army of one.
[2:05:53.260 --> 2:05:54.260]  You're not an army of one.
[2:05:54.260 --> 2:05:56.460]  You've got to be together or you're going to lose.
[2:05:56.460 --> 2:05:59.660]  Yeah, we are a social species.
[2:05:59.660 --> 2:06:02.420]  We don't operate as one.
[2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:05.100]  We're not the tigers stalking through the jungle.
[2:06:05.100 --> 2:06:07.300]  We are the lions in a pride.
[2:06:07.300 --> 2:06:08.300]  Exactly.
[2:06:08.300 --> 2:06:09.300]  We're lions.
[2:06:09.300 --> 2:06:10.300]  We're not tigers.
[2:06:10.300 --> 2:06:11.300]  Yeah.
[2:06:11.300 --> 2:06:12.300]  So anyway, it is what it is.
[2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:17.620]  So when they took control of the movie industry, that's when we really got the propaganda
[2:06:17.620 --> 2:06:18.620]  machine going.
[2:06:18.620 --> 2:06:26.700]  Now, the American movie industry had been looked at and analyzed by the Nazis as an
[2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:29.740]  ideal propaganda engine the best in the world.
[2:06:29.740 --> 2:06:35.700]  And I'm sure since I learned that in political science, some of these people that were in
[2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:43.340]  this 25, 50, 75, and 100 year plan that they had envisioned, they saw an opportunity to
[2:06:43.340 --> 2:06:50.060]  take over from those who were driving the movie industry into bankruptcy because they
[2:06:50.060 --> 2:06:56.220]  traditionally, well, they kept on with the tradition of two movies that changed every
[2:06:56.220 --> 2:06:57.220]  thing.
[2:06:57.220 --> 2:07:01.340]  There was no dying order being taken over by the left that actually infiltrated it.
[2:07:01.340 --> 2:07:03.380]  Just like academia, law enforcement.
[2:07:03.380 --> 2:07:09.180]  They came up with this one movie that lasts as long as people would come to see it instead
[2:07:09.180 --> 2:07:10.660]  of every Thursday and Sunday.
[2:07:10.660 --> 2:07:14.300]  You got two new movies, cartoons, et cetera, at every movie house.
[2:07:14.300 --> 2:07:15.860]  You paid 50 cents.
[2:07:15.860 --> 2:07:16.860]  And that's true.
[2:07:16.860 --> 2:07:18.900]  The TV was more leftist before movies.
[2:07:18.900 --> 2:07:20.220]  Well, it's not the television.
[2:07:20.220 --> 2:07:21.540]  It's those that controlled it.
[2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:23.620]  The TV was driving it out of business.
[2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:26.260]  So what happens is they brought these new guys in.
[2:07:26.260 --> 2:07:29.860]  I'm saying you're absolutely right because the radicalization happened in TV first.
[2:07:29.860 --> 2:07:30.860]  Yeah.
[2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:31.860]  You.
[2:07:31.860 --> 2:07:32.860]  Fresh ideas come in.
[2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:34.780]  So the fresh ideas brought this other stuff.
[2:07:34.780 --> 2:07:39.020]  So they started glorifying this function, pimps, holes, prostitutes.
[2:07:39.020 --> 2:07:40.140]  Even Bill Mars said that.
[2:07:40.140 --> 2:07:45.540]  He said, it's not new thinking to say we crap in the kitchen and eat in the bathroom.
[2:07:45.540 --> 2:07:49.340]  Just because like, hey, let's get rid of the family and cut our, you know, let's take drugs
[2:07:49.340 --> 2:07:50.340]  and kill ourselves.
[2:07:50.340 --> 2:07:51.420]  That's not new thinking.
[2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:53.540]  We already stopped doing that because it doesn't work.
[2:07:53.540 --> 2:07:54.640]  That does very bad.
[2:07:54.640 --> 2:08:00.540]  So what happens is we get not the Nazis started in 1920.
[2:08:00.540 --> 2:08:05.220]  By 1940, we had his worldwide disaster called World War two going.
[2:08:05.220 --> 2:08:08.620]  That's 20 years, but they only had 20 years.
[2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:14.580]  We have had 55 years of the same sort of propaganda, negative propaganda.
[2:08:14.580 --> 2:08:20.420]  And just imagine what's happened with us when it has slipped into our subconscious minds
[2:08:20.420 --> 2:08:21.420]  our lexicon.
[2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:25.940]  You said the same propaganda used to keep black Americans down is now being used to
[2:08:25.940 --> 2:08:26.940]  everybody.
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:27.940]  Yes.
[2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:30.900]  And it's exactly that.
[2:08:30.900 --> 2:08:37.540]  We have this situation now where, okay, homophobia, toxic masculinity.
[2:08:37.540 --> 2:08:38.540]  That's one.
[2:08:38.540 --> 2:08:40.580]  They said, all masculinity is toxic.
[2:08:40.580 --> 2:08:47.300]  What we have to do is step by step change the masculine perception of masculinity so
[2:08:47.300 --> 2:08:48.300]  that.
[2:08:48.300 --> 2:08:49.740]  And they admit they've been doing that.
[2:08:49.740 --> 2:08:50.740]  Yes.
[2:08:50.740 --> 2:08:51.740]  How's it though?
[2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:54.620]  So how are they going to say everybody thinks they want it?
[2:08:54.620 --> 2:08:57.700]  They didn't really, but they've been conditioned to want it.
[2:08:57.700 --> 2:08:58.700]  Back in the fifties.
[2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:03.660]  They had this thing on television where they had these subliminal ads that would flash
[2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:04.660]  on so quick.
[2:09:04.660 --> 2:09:07.300]  The conscious mind would be aware of it.
[2:09:07.300 --> 2:09:11.260]  Drink Coke, smoke, coo smoke, Chesterfield's and people that have a craving.
[2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:17.140]  FCC got on it, but they view sophisticated methods to put that in to the person's mind.
[2:09:17.140 --> 2:09:19.260]  So well, now they're telling men be feminine.
[2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:20.260]  Men think that.
[2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:23.340]  You see, that's why we have so much damn violence.
[2:09:23.340 --> 2:09:25.740]  See masculinity is not toxic.
[2:09:25.740 --> 2:09:26.740]  What they're doing.
[2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:27.740]  No, exactly.
[2:09:27.740 --> 2:09:28.740]  Masculinity keeps order.
[2:09:28.740 --> 2:09:29.740]  Yeah.
[2:09:29.740 --> 2:09:35.140]  It's about the business of being in charge so that where you are is a better say for
[2:09:35.140 --> 2:09:36.140]  more secure place.
[2:09:36.140 --> 2:09:37.140]  You're a guardian.
[2:09:37.140 --> 2:09:38.140]  Yes.
[2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:39.900]  Now masculinity isn't just picking people's ass for no reason.
[2:09:39.900 --> 2:09:40.900]  Here's the other thing.
[2:09:40.900 --> 2:09:42.980]  We were talking about getting the stake.
[2:09:42.980 --> 2:09:43.980]  That's asserting ourselves.
[2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:46.100]  It's the top of the food chain.
[2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:49.780]  We are the apex predator on this planet.
[2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:53.700]  There is nothing we can't kill and we kill each other just like a.
[2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:54.700]  No, you're right.
[2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:55.700]  It's a ritual to go eat cow.
[2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:56.700]  Yeah.
[2:09:56.700 --> 2:09:57.700]  Yeah.
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:09:58.700]  But see, we are the best killers this planet.
[2:09:58.700 --> 2:09:59.700]  We're going to conduct that ritual tonight.
[2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:00.700]  Yeah.
[2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:01.700]  We are.
[2:10:01.700 --> 2:10:03.900]  And I'm going to talk to you about it's all spent off on that too in a bit.
[2:10:03.900 --> 2:10:09.300]  But anyway, see, we're the best killers on this planet and part of masculinity and what
[2:10:09.300 --> 2:10:14.260]  it does is inculcate, socialize and acculturates young boys.
[2:10:14.260 --> 2:10:19.580]  So they become very familiar with that killer that's in them, that beast.
[2:10:19.580 --> 2:10:21.100]  So you know how to handle it.
[2:10:21.100 --> 2:10:23.300]  You dealt with bullies as you've grown up.
[2:10:23.300 --> 2:10:25.060]  You become a man.
[2:10:25.060 --> 2:10:26.900]  You get in control of yourself.
[2:10:26.900 --> 2:10:31.940]  You know, there are places you can do this, places you can't do this.
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:36.500]  And you look in the mirror and every morning you ask yourself, have you been a proper man?
[2:10:36.500 --> 2:10:38.660]  Are you going to be one for the day?
[2:10:38.660 --> 2:10:40.220]  And you do what you're supposed to do.
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:45.420]  Now you take that away and you get all of these idiots shooting these schools up in
[2:10:45.420 --> 2:10:46.420]  a.
[2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:47.420]  I'm telling you, I'm sold.
[2:10:47.420 --> 2:10:48.420]  I'm not going to stop away.
[2:10:48.420 --> 2:10:53.660]  I'm past the browns telling us because they don't have masculinity.
[2:10:53.660 --> 2:11:03.180]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:11:03.180 --> 2:11:10.940]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality specifically
[2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:17.980]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:18.980]  in males.
[2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:24.980]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[2:11:24.980 --> 2:11:29.820]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:11:29.820 --> 2:11:37.180]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in
[2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:42.340]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:43.780]  What are you waiting for?
[2:11:43.780 --> 2:11:45.780]  Go to the info store.
[2:11:45.780 --> 2:11:53.380]  It's never been a better time than right now super male vitality at infostore.com again.
[2:11:53.380 --> 2:11:57.260]  I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist
[2:11:57.260 --> 2:12:02.020]  and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:05.980]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[2:12:05.980 --> 2:12:09.460]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[2:12:09.460 --> 2:12:10.460]  a break.
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:11.460]  The statinism is out in the open.
[2:12:11.460 --> 2:12:12.460]  I've always been a Christian.
[2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:16.420]  Now, the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:17.420]  And I get it.
[2:12:17.420 --> 2:12:18.420]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[2:12:18.420 --> 2:12:23.820]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it, me too.
[2:12:23.820 --> 2:12:29.500]  Believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[2:12:29.500 --> 2:12:35.100]  that God created that is so essential and God created the universe for us to have communion
[2:12:35.100 --> 2:12:37.100]  with God through and to have life.
[2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:38.940]  And so that's what info wars is really all about.
[2:12:38.940 --> 2:12:40.540]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[2:12:40.540 --> 2:12:44.180]  Thank you for spreading the word about info wars and thank you for supporting us to keep
[2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:49.100]  us on air by visiting infowarstore.com because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases
[2:12:49.100 --> 2:12:50.420]  we'll be taking off the air.
[2:12:50.420 --> 2:12:56.060]  So thank you for the support infowarstore.com.
[2:12:56.060 --> 2:13:12.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:12.820 --> 2:13:20.380]  Judge Joe Brown is on fire and the show's always on fire, but fire is now on fire.
[2:13:20.380 --> 2:13:21.380]  And we're all simpatico here.
[2:13:21.380 --> 2:13:24.860]  We got the producers and crew bringing in articles for Joe Brown and he knows about
[2:13:24.860 --> 2:13:26.900]  it all and I'm not just in his ass, it's true.
[2:13:26.900 --> 2:13:29.820]  He knows about a lot more of this than I do and I always get impressed by that because
[2:13:29.820 --> 2:13:34.660]  I study basically all day long on addiction information and that's what I've seen is first
[2:13:34.660 --> 2:13:40.140]  they attack masculinity, the judge was saying, then they attack femininity so they can define
[2:13:40.140 --> 2:13:43.140]  everything and take control of it and make it political.
[2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:47.500]  He was explaining the secret third party in America and then one of our producers, a nice
[2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:51.340]  lady that works here brought in this article, vagina owners.
[2:13:51.340 --> 2:13:56.580]  So now these weird men that claim they're women and want to go out and say they're women
[2:13:56.580 --> 2:14:02.340]  and want to approach children because a child's afraid of a man, but not as afraid of a woman.
[2:14:02.340 --> 2:14:09.860]  These are predators are calling it vagina owners and menstruators and attacking women
[2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:14.820]  and finally Naomi Wolf and all the top feminists go, wait a minute, we're women, we got our
[2:14:14.820 --> 2:14:15.820]  own thing.
[2:14:15.820 --> 2:14:16.940]  Don't take over our space.
[2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  Now they're understanding how sick and evil this is, judge.
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:22.700]  Let's see, this is a good thing.
[2:14:22.700 --> 2:14:29.060]  They formed this coalition with these people to get what they wanted.
[2:14:29.060 --> 2:14:33.420]  Now they're beginning to see the inherent contradictions in some parts of it.
[2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:40.420]  They're calling women, menstruators, breed, breed, breeders.
[2:14:40.420 --> 2:14:41.420]  That's like an N word.
[2:14:41.420 --> 2:14:42.420]  They're attacking them.
[2:14:42.420 --> 2:14:43.420]  Yeah.
[2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:48.180]  And then the other thing they call us norms and oh my God breeders and boomers and all
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:50.540]  of this other, well, not boomers, but breeders.
[2:14:50.540 --> 2:14:52.700]  No, no, yeah, yeah, because we have kids.
[2:14:52.700 --> 2:14:53.700]  Yeah.
[2:14:53.700 --> 2:14:55.580]  In other words, how disgusting.
[2:14:55.580 --> 2:14:58.020]  So they're trying to flip the script on that.
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:14:59.820]  Now they've attacked masculinity.
[2:14:59.820 --> 2:15:02.540]  It's now toxic to hear them declare it.
[2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:03.540]  Now they're attacking.
[2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:05.180]  Listen, I'll tell a story.
[2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:09.220]  My parents have a friend who was a business guy, a nice guy, he's gay, quite homosexual.
[2:15:09.220 --> 2:15:13.700]  He died a few years ago and I had just had my first born child and he was his birthday
[2:15:13.700 --> 2:15:17.300]  party and he invited me to his birthday party downtown at a restaurant bar that he ran
[2:15:17.300 --> 2:15:18.300]  it out.
[2:15:18.300 --> 2:15:19.300]  Well, I'm a nice guy.
[2:15:19.300 --> 2:15:22.020]  I'm not against, you know, somebody that's gay or whatever, homosexual.
[2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.980]  I'll go to his party and they come in and see me.
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:28.620]  It's all a bunch of men and a few women there and my parents are there, they're old family
[2:15:28.620 --> 2:15:35.540]  friends and he's literally there and they go, oh, you had a, you had a, oh, that's gross.
[2:15:35.540 --> 2:15:40.140]  And ooh, there's these homosexual members saying it's so gross that you have a child
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:41.140]  and had a son.
[2:15:41.140 --> 2:15:44.460]  And I said, you know, you're a weirdo as I'm leaving and I left, but I'm saying what
[2:15:44.460 --> 2:15:45.460]  you just said.
[2:15:45.460 --> 2:15:46.460]  These people are crazy.
[2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:47.460]  Yeah.
[2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:51.420]  Now, I mean, you go to their party to be nice to them and they say, you're bad because
[2:15:51.420 --> 2:15:53.740]  you have a woman and you had a child.
[2:15:53.740 --> 2:15:54.740]  That's Satanic.
[2:15:54.740 --> 2:16:02.660]  Now, see, LGBTQ's site used to say eight or nine out of every 10 people in Hollywood
[2:16:02.660 --> 2:16:04.780]  were practitioners or followers.
[2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:11.100]  So what you're talking about is part of the instrumentality of Hollywood and that is
[2:16:11.100 --> 2:16:19.020]  something you have to grasp me, you need to grasp it because a lot of what you get through
[2:16:19.020 --> 2:16:23.820]  the screen is produced by people who have an agenda to push that.
[2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:29.980]  Now, this other point that we raised when we were talking before about the parties,
[2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:36.060]  there are three national political parties that have influence on what happens.
[2:16:36.060 --> 2:16:39.580]  Two of them are official and one of them is not.
[2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:46.780]  You have the jumbos, that's the elephants, that's the Republicans, you have the jackasses,
[2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:52.020]  that's the donkeys, that's the Democrats, and you have the rainbows and you see somebody
[2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:58.340]  can be a jackass in a rainbow or a jumbo in a rainbow and the jumbos and the jackasses
[2:16:58.340 --> 2:17:01.180]  get to creating confusion and politics.
[2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:02.420]  It's a fifth column.
[2:17:02.420 --> 2:17:03.420]  Yes.
[2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:09.780]  And the fifth column rainbow part, they get together and they work to do stuff behind
[2:17:09.780 --> 2:17:16.820]  the scenes because they are myopic or blinded because they're too deep into self-hate.
[2:17:16.820 --> 2:17:22.220]  They help hate what they are and they hate what they want to be and that is a very bad
[2:17:22.220 --> 2:17:23.220]  thing.
[2:17:23.220 --> 2:17:26.540]  Explain that because you really gave me an epiphany where you explain it because it's
[2:17:26.540 --> 2:17:30.900]  the big tech nerds that came up with this scheme because they looked and said, okay,
[2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:34.820]  it's a white man's world which had its own issues, humans are perfect, so instead of
[2:17:34.820 --> 2:17:37.980]  the Christians trying to unify everybody, which we were going on that process towards
[2:17:37.980 --> 2:17:44.300]  real success, they then came in with a scientific plan to attack our very biology and make us
[2:17:44.300 --> 2:17:45.300]  basically artificial.
[2:17:45.300 --> 2:17:46.300]  Yes.
[2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:52.140]  What I used to hear, but I haven't heard in 50 years, is they used to pray for the development
[2:17:52.140 --> 2:17:55.580]  of effective human cloning.
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:18:01.180]  I hadn't cloned anything then, but they have into the interim and the thing that you hear
[2:18:01.180 --> 2:18:11.220]  secretly is, if they perfect cloning, they won't need men anymore because men are unfortunate
[2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:15.580]  necessity for the generation of the next.
[2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:16.580]  I'm so impressed.
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:19.220]  I've never interviewed anybody that gets it like I do.
[2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:20.220]  Oh my God.
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:21.220]  Now.
[2:18:21.220 --> 2:18:23.580]  I've got to stop right now because let's explain this.
[2:18:23.580 --> 2:18:26.980]  And then next, what you say we don't need men, then we don't need women, then humans
[2:18:26.980 --> 2:18:28.380]  are a corporate production.
[2:18:28.380 --> 2:18:35.180]  Have you noticed the trend toward androgynous people sexless, okay?
[2:18:35.180 --> 2:18:36.180]  That's the idea.
[2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:37.580]  Fluid gender.
[2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:42.500]  One of the characteristics, one of the fallouts behind that was 50 years ago, they started
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:49.260]  what I thought was a peculiar assault on medicine, technology, and science, which was way up
[2:18:49.260 --> 2:18:50.660]  on a pedestal.
[2:18:50.660 --> 2:18:55.620]  And then it dawned on me, I said, you can't have this kind of faux science that says there
[2:18:55.620 --> 2:18:57.860]  are fluid genders, 120.
[2:18:57.860 --> 2:19:02.060]  They were bullying science to get control, just like bullying police to get control.
[2:19:02.060 --> 2:19:06.780]  So when you listen to this science supports fluid gender, you got maybe four or five out
[2:19:06.780 --> 2:19:11.980]  of a hundred scientists and medical people that I finally found my guru right here.
[2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:13.540]  My God.
[2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:14.540]  That's what's wrong.
[2:19:14.540 --> 2:19:22.060]  See that propaganda when you control the engines of communication, when you control all of
[2:19:22.060 --> 2:19:28.980]  the effective forums and you censor anything to the contrary, you can get everybody believing
[2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:29.980]  this.
[2:19:29.980 --> 2:19:39.580]  See, for 120 years, the average human on the planet Earth has to a great extent been shaped
[2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:43.100]  by what he or she sees in the movies.
[2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:51.460]  In the 30s, 20s, now, whatever, what they see in the movies is how they get their ideation.
[2:19:51.460 --> 2:19:54.780]  The movie industry, the television industry, social and mainstream.
[2:19:54.780 --> 2:19:56.660]  It's like a baby duck imprints.
[2:19:56.660 --> 2:19:58.580]  Yeah, it imprints, exactly.
[2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:02.180]  And that becomes the voice of the village.
[2:20:02.180 --> 2:20:07.140]  And see, there's no effective parenting now because parents can't do what they need to
[2:20:07.140 --> 2:20:08.300]  do to parent.
[2:20:08.300 --> 2:20:09.460]  You can't touch a kid.
[2:20:09.460 --> 2:20:10.980]  He calls the police.
[2:20:10.980 --> 2:20:13.220]  They grab the bag.
[2:20:13.220 --> 2:20:17.980]  Well, you see, you know what this whole thing about parenting is, is you impose an artificial
[2:20:17.980 --> 2:20:25.220]  pain on the child because if he did not deal with what you tried to instruct him to do
[2:20:25.220 --> 2:20:26.420]  or her to do.
[2:20:26.420 --> 2:20:27.420]  He'd get run over.
[2:20:27.420 --> 2:20:28.420]  No.
[2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:32.220]  There was something very large with a large appetite, large size, long face.
[2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:33.220]  It would eat you.
[2:20:33.220 --> 2:20:34.220]  Yes, it would eat you.
[2:20:34.220 --> 2:20:35.220]  You'd be a nice snack.
[2:20:35.220 --> 2:20:39.180]  Well, you were using the sabertooth tiger analogy that if the baby didn't learn, don't
[2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:41.300]  sneak outside the cave at night, you'll get eaten.
[2:20:41.300 --> 2:20:42.300]  Yeah.
[2:20:42.300 --> 2:20:43.300]  I don't want to beat you up, but you didn't listen.
[2:20:43.300 --> 2:20:44.700]  Let me give you a taste.
[2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:47.860]  Just like my dad never wanted to speak with a third fortile and went out in the road,
[2:20:47.860 --> 2:20:48.860]  almost got killed.
[2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:49.860]  He beat the hell out of me.
[2:20:49.860 --> 2:20:53.300]  And I learned, hey, I go out on that road, I get in pain, instead of dying, I live.
[2:20:53.300 --> 2:20:54.300]  Yes.
[2:20:54.300 --> 2:20:55.300]  Yeah, that's it.
[2:20:55.300 --> 2:21:03.500]  See, and we have this sickness that is pervading us, this society, because we live in a unique
[2:21:03.500 --> 2:21:10.060]  safety bubble that has never been in existence before in human history.
[2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:14.420]  It is a safety bubble where you don't have to worry about anything eating you.
[2:21:14.420 --> 2:21:15.900]  The government protects you.
[2:21:15.900 --> 2:21:18.940]  If you're a total failure, you still get fed.
[2:21:18.940 --> 2:21:23.620]  You get not into being able to support your children.
[2:21:23.620 --> 2:21:26.540]  You have children to support yourself.
[2:21:26.540 --> 2:21:29.180]  You see, you don't have to be educated.
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:30.260]  You can get along.
[2:21:30.260 --> 2:21:31.260]  You can sit on us.
[2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:35.860]  I get, and you get, that they're creating an artificial globalist bubble to anesthetize
[2:21:35.860 --> 2:21:37.540]  us so they can actually eat us.
[2:21:37.540 --> 2:21:38.540]  Well, take us over.
[2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:39.820]  But there's other thing, too.
[2:21:39.820 --> 2:21:43.260]  Right now, this is causing a diplomatic miss.
[2:21:43.260 --> 2:21:45.060]  We are flying on the second...
[2:21:45.060 --> 2:21:46.060]  Hold on, judge.
[2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:47.060]  Oh, my gosh.
[2:21:47.060 --> 2:21:48.060]  Judge Joe Brown, man.
[2:21:48.060 --> 2:21:49.060]  Woo!
[2:21:49.060 --> 2:21:50.060]  Infowars.com.
[2:21:50.060 --> 2:22:00.380]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person.
[2:22:00.380 --> 2:22:01.660]  It changes the world.
[2:22:01.660 --> 2:22:04.220]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:22:04.220 --> 2:22:05.780]  They know you're angry.
[2:22:05.780 --> 2:22:10.060]  And now, to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:22:10.060 --> 2:22:11.060]  we've got.
[2:22:11.060 --> 2:22:15.260]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[2:22:45.780 --> 2:22:54.860]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:57.060]  What are champions made of?
[2:22:57.060 --> 2:23:05.860]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:23:05.860 --> 2:23:32.860]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:23:32.860 --> 2:23:56.740]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[2:23:56.740 --> 2:24:00.260]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[2:24:00.260 --> 2:24:07.700]  Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[2:24:07.700 --> 2:24:12.700]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[2:24:12.700 --> 2:24:13.700]  COVID-19 frankenshot.
[2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:16.460]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[2:24:16.460 --> 2:24:24.260]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC at NIH refused to take the frankenshots.
[2:24:24.260 --> 2:24:25.820]  They don't trust it.
[2:24:25.820 --> 2:24:27.140]  You shouldn't trust it.
[2:24:27.140 --> 2:24:29.940]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:33.140]  This is an attack on the American people, on the people of the world.
[2:24:33.140 --> 2:24:36.500]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[2:24:36.500 --> 2:24:39.380]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:43.820]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse
[2:24:43.820 --> 2:24:44.820]  to take the vaccines.
[2:24:44.820 --> 2:24:45.820]  That's right.
[2:24:45.820 --> 2:24:49.620]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine.
[2:24:49.620 --> 2:24:50.620]  You should either.
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:52.740]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:58.220]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:25:01.700]  they encourage people to live in tents and he's just homeless, and he used drugs and
[2:25:01.700 --> 2:25:03.980]  alcohol and engaged in cutting crime.
[2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:09.020]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course, a great reset,
[2:25:09.020 --> 2:25:11.740]  they want to lower expectations.
[2:25:11.740 --> 2:25:14.100]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:16.860]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:20.340]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[2:25:20.340 --> 2:25:22.100]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:24.260]  They have huge private mistakes.
[2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:25.860]  They are separate from us.
[2:25:25.860 --> 2:25:28.380]  Their children go to private tutors.
[2:25:28.380 --> 2:25:29.380]  They admit this.
[2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:34.220]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually
[2:25:34.220 --> 2:25:36.860]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[2:25:36.860 --> 2:25:42.180]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot, autonomous cars,
[2:25:42.180 --> 2:25:43.180]  and trucks.
[2:25:43.180 --> 2:25:44.580]  This is all their admitted plan.
[2:25:44.580 --> 2:25:48.100]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta.
[2:25:48.100 --> 2:25:49.100]  It's gone operational.
[2:25:49.100 --> 2:25:50.100]  It's a post-human future.
[2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:55.460]  You better find out about it right now.
[2:25:55.460 --> 2:26:02.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:26:25.460 --> 2:26:29.820]  I'm from that.
[2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:36.460]  Judge Joe Brown is in the house and he's going to be on the American Journal tomorrow morning.
[2:26:36.460 --> 2:26:38.220]  They're going to take that today and more.
[2:26:38.220 --> 2:26:41.900]  We're very excited to have him here in Austin, Texas down from Tennessee.
[2:26:41.900 --> 2:26:49.140]  Sir, you were continuing with this takeover of the human system, the final revolution
[2:26:49.140 --> 2:26:50.140]  will.
[2:26:50.140 --> 2:26:54.220]  And what these organizations are doing and how now even feminists are waking up to it.
[2:26:54.220 --> 2:26:55.860]  How do you recommend we fight it?
[2:26:55.860 --> 2:26:57.380]  How do you recommend we resist it?
[2:26:57.380 --> 2:27:04.860]  Well, see, understand that ordinary normal people, the norms that they call us, breeders
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:09.060]  as they call us, we are the overwhelming majority.
[2:27:09.060 --> 2:27:10.620]  Now this is what's happening.
[2:27:10.620 --> 2:27:19.260]  If you take any survey statistically, about 5.6% really actually less of our system is
[2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:24.420]  into actively practicing the LGBT stuff.
[2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:31.780]  For 55 and above, depending upon whose stats you read, it's one and a half to maybe somewhat
[2:27:31.780 --> 2:27:33.780]  less than 2%.
[2:27:33.780 --> 2:27:40.700]  But to show you how the propaganda is working from 25 to 18, it's 16%.
[2:27:40.700 --> 2:27:45.580]  And there's an interesting characteristic that is not interesting, but a tragic set
[2:27:45.580 --> 2:27:48.500]  of characteristics that flowed from that.
[2:27:48.500 --> 2:27:53.660]  We have for the last 20 years, and this is from the U.S. Department of Defense from some
[2:27:53.660 --> 2:28:00.860]  white papers they came up with in 2011, analyzing the first decade of the 21st century.
[2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:06.940]  They were determined to find out why people weren't coming in that tough, even though
[2:28:06.940 --> 2:28:09.060]  they could make them physically strong.
[2:28:09.060 --> 2:28:11.660]  You had to bring the toughness in.
[2:28:11.660 --> 2:28:14.740]  They determined that there were not enough fathers in the family.
[2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:22.820]  And they noted that 42% of the American population 35 and under was born out of wedlock, and
[2:28:22.820 --> 2:28:29.540]  somewhere around 80%, 20 and under were born out of wedlock because of last lack of fathers.
[2:28:29.540 --> 2:28:32.980]  And then those statistics have not changed.
[2:28:32.980 --> 2:28:38.940]  And we find this for the last 20 years on average, all ethnic groups, not just black
[2:28:38.940 --> 2:28:44.820]  or some minority, but all ethnic groups, only 28% of each year's high school graduates
[2:28:44.820 --> 2:28:53.780]  are male, only 32% to 34% of the undergrads in America are male, and only 36% of the grad
[2:28:53.780 --> 2:28:57.660]  students are male, and this is the ridiculous one.
[2:28:57.660 --> 2:29:00.300]  Only 44% of the workforce is male.
[2:29:00.300 --> 2:29:01.620]  And explain that.
[2:29:01.620 --> 2:29:03.540]  This is seismic.
[2:29:03.540 --> 2:29:07.780]  They're not just teaching that white people are bad and evil and deserve to be cut out.
[2:29:07.780 --> 2:29:12.620]  They're saying males in general are bad, and it's good that most of college graduates
[2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:13.620]  are women.
[2:29:13.620 --> 2:29:14.620]  That's not empowering women.
[2:29:14.620 --> 2:29:18.180]  Those are women being married off to the state, off to the system.
[2:29:18.180 --> 2:29:19.460]  It's the end of the human system.
[2:29:19.460 --> 2:29:20.460]  Yeah.
[2:29:20.460 --> 2:29:23.380]  And so you get a dynamic that is really bad.
[2:29:23.380 --> 2:29:26.420]  You get what they call developmental bipolar.
[2:29:26.420 --> 2:29:30.260]  Myself and a lady clinical psychologist came up with that.
[2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:32.500]  In other words, it impacts the women too.
[2:29:32.500 --> 2:29:38.820]  They find themselves in a quandary if they follow along with what they've been acculturated
[2:29:38.820 --> 2:29:41.340]  to under the new system.
[2:29:41.340 --> 2:29:47.180]  Women feel nice, rewarded, and they feel good about themselves if there are certain things
[2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:50.020]  done that women naturally respond to.
[2:29:50.020 --> 2:29:53.460]  But they've been taught that those things are demeaning.
[2:29:53.460 --> 2:29:57.060]  They've been given an alternative set of standards to respond to.
[2:29:57.060 --> 2:29:58.060]  Exactly.
[2:29:58.060 --> 2:29:59.060]  They're very genetics.
[2:29:59.060 --> 2:30:00.060]  Want something?
[2:30:00.060 --> 2:30:01.060]  They're told that's bad.
[2:30:01.060 --> 2:30:02.060]  That's bad.
[2:30:02.060 --> 2:30:03.660]  They're given an alternative.
[2:30:03.660 --> 2:30:08.580]  And when they get and accomplish those things, they feel flat.
[2:30:08.580 --> 2:30:09.900]  They don't feel anything.
[2:30:09.900 --> 2:30:12.460]  So they're caught in this muddle of this.
[2:30:12.460 --> 2:30:14.940]  And the left says get deeper into the lie.
[2:30:14.940 --> 2:30:15.940]  That will reward you.
[2:30:15.940 --> 2:30:16.940]  Yes.
[2:30:16.940 --> 2:30:20.540]  And the solutions are actually the causes of the problem to begin with.
[2:30:20.540 --> 2:30:23.980]  Now, why is it that white women are the most mentally ill group in the world?
[2:30:23.980 --> 2:30:28.460]  Statistically, they are totally depressed killing themselves because they embrace this.
[2:30:28.460 --> 2:30:29.660]  They killed their own role.
[2:30:29.660 --> 2:30:30.660]  They killed who they are.
[2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:36.660]  In other words, let's say, what is the most fundamental aspect of a woman?
[2:30:36.660 --> 2:30:39.340]  What's the most fundamental aspect of a man?
[2:30:39.340 --> 2:30:44.780]  Well, if you get real primitive or you get back to some closely associated relatives.
[2:30:44.780 --> 2:30:45.780]  What you get?
[2:30:45.780 --> 2:30:46.780]  It isn't even relevant.
[2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:47.780]  I mean, the word's primitive.
[2:30:47.780 --> 2:30:48.780]  You're right.
[2:30:48.780 --> 2:30:49.780]  It's what we are.
[2:30:49.780 --> 2:30:50.780]  Yeah.
[2:30:50.780 --> 2:30:51.780]  Well, yeah.
[2:30:51.780 --> 2:30:52.780]  I'm just saying so.
[2:30:52.780 --> 2:30:53.780]  You're using their term.
[2:30:53.780 --> 2:30:54.780]  You're right.
[2:30:54.780 --> 2:30:58.420]  You can go to the zoo and watch the baboons or the chimps, and you can see the same thing.
[2:30:58.420 --> 2:31:00.620]  You can see any animal.
[2:31:00.620 --> 2:31:05.540]  And what happens is we've got sexual reproduction.
[2:31:05.540 --> 2:31:13.260]  So one half of that species gets pregnant and gives birth.
[2:31:13.260 --> 2:31:17.940]  One half impregnates, provides, protects, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:31:17.940 --> 2:31:19.440]  So then we sort of...
[2:31:19.440 --> 2:31:21.900]  Well, the entire species is built around procreation.
[2:31:21.900 --> 2:31:22.900]  Yeah.
[2:31:22.900 --> 2:31:23.900]  That's what we are.
[2:31:23.900 --> 2:31:24.900]  Isration.
[2:31:24.900 --> 2:31:25.900]  Yeah.
[2:31:25.900 --> 2:31:26.900]  Yeah.
[2:31:26.900 --> 2:31:27.900]  So an attack on that isn't an attack on our existence.
[2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:32.540]  It's a fundamental role of a woman is to be a mother.
[2:31:32.540 --> 2:31:41.580]  And everything that is physiologically going into that, the middle thing that marches in
[2:31:41.580 --> 2:31:47.420]  lockstep with that, to encourage it, the culture, is under assault.
[2:31:47.420 --> 2:31:51.940]  Men we're supposed to protect it from those things that might find us a handy and tasty
[2:31:51.940 --> 2:31:55.660]  snack, and we're supposed to provide.
[2:31:55.660 --> 2:32:00.060]  But you see, men are no longer supposed to provide, and women are no longer supposed
[2:32:00.060 --> 2:32:02.900]  to appreciate motherhood, they're supposed to depreciate it.
[2:32:02.900 --> 2:32:06.060]  That's the thing growing up in Texas, I'm old enough to remember when like, men weren't
[2:32:06.060 --> 2:32:07.580]  trying to act fancy about it.
[2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:12.140]  They weren't knowing how to do electrical and fixing things and raising crops and working
[2:32:12.140 --> 2:32:15.380]  hard at cleaning guns and cooking dinner when mom was taking care of it.
[2:32:15.380 --> 2:32:16.380]  Yeah.
[2:32:16.380 --> 2:32:19.580]  And saying, because the men just do to do it, instead now men just lay around.
[2:32:19.580 --> 2:32:20.580]  Yeah.
[2:32:20.580 --> 2:32:23.540]  And see, you have to start early with both.
[2:32:23.540 --> 2:32:24.540]  I'm not a woman.
[2:32:24.540 --> 2:32:29.580]  I don't even get it, but I love them and I die for them.
[2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:31.820]  But let's just focus on the men.
[2:32:31.820 --> 2:32:35.220]  You have to start telling a male child, act like a man.
[2:32:35.220 --> 2:32:36.220]  That's not what men do.
[2:32:36.220 --> 2:32:37.620]  So what's wrong with you?
[2:32:37.620 --> 2:32:38.620]  Man up.
[2:32:38.620 --> 2:32:39.620]  Don't do that.
[2:32:39.620 --> 2:32:41.100]  Men don't do that, young man.
[2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:43.220]  Men do not act like that.
[2:32:43.220 --> 2:32:44.220]  Okay.
[2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:45.220]  Act like a man.
[2:32:45.220 --> 2:32:47.980]  And you hear that over and over and over, but you never hear it now.
[2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:50.020]  And you know why it's important?
[2:32:50.020 --> 2:32:51.900]  The Titanic is going down.
[2:32:51.900 --> 2:32:55.980]  There are a limited number of lifeboats and it's supposed to be women and children in
[2:32:55.980 --> 2:32:56.980]  the lifeboats.
[2:32:56.980 --> 2:33:00.060]  First, men stay on the ship and go down in the icy water.
[2:33:00.060 --> 2:33:01.060]  Big tech.
[2:33:01.060 --> 2:33:02.060]  Exactly.
[2:33:02.060 --> 2:33:04.180]  They learned how they don't want to take care of the women.
[2:33:04.180 --> 2:33:05.180]  Exactly.
[2:33:05.180 --> 2:33:06.180]  Yeah.
[2:33:06.180 --> 2:33:07.820]  This is about pimping the women.
[2:33:07.820 --> 2:33:12.980]  And then you got this new phenomenon, the ones that are masquerading as a woman saying,
[2:33:12.980 --> 2:33:13.980]  I am a woman.
[2:33:13.980 --> 2:33:18.900]  Oh, no, you get your butt out of that lifeboat, let the real ones in and you see what's the
[2:33:18.900 --> 2:33:19.900]  problem.
[2:33:19.900 --> 2:33:20.900]  And the feminists are figuring that out.
[2:33:20.900 --> 2:33:21.900]  Exactly.
[2:33:21.900 --> 2:33:22.900]  They're being thrown out of the lifeboat.
[2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:23.900]  Yeah.
[2:33:23.900 --> 2:33:27.500]  And see this here where they're trying to attack women, this is going to break them up.
[2:33:27.500 --> 2:33:31.140]  This is actually a good thing.
[2:33:31.140 --> 2:33:36.700]  Drag queens running against women in women's track meets, wrestling against women in women's
[2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:37.700]  wrestling.
[2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:40.540]  That's beating women up in boxing matches.
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:41.540]  Yes.
[2:33:41.540 --> 2:33:45.580]  And see feminists fought long and hard to get women's sports.
[2:33:45.580 --> 2:33:47.460]  They used to lament.
[2:33:47.460 --> 2:33:53.380]  Why is it only the boys that get to have sports and get full scholarships to college
[2:33:53.380 --> 2:33:55.820]  just because they can play a sport?
[2:33:55.820 --> 2:33:57.700]  Why can't women have women's sports?
[2:33:57.700 --> 2:33:59.660]  By the way, look at this demonic man beating a woman up.
[2:33:59.660 --> 2:34:02.660]  Oh, this is ridiculous.
[2:34:02.660 --> 2:34:05.340]  This is just absolutely ridiculous.
[2:34:05.340 --> 2:34:06.340]  That's a man.
[2:34:06.340 --> 2:34:07.340]  That's right.
[2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:08.340]  I know it.
[2:34:08.340 --> 2:34:09.340]  Now, see what happens?
[2:34:09.340 --> 2:34:10.840]  Why is he getting accolade?
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:14.020]  That's not enough to prevail in a men's contest.
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:15.020]  That's a fraud.
[2:34:15.020 --> 2:34:16.020]  That's a fraud.
[2:34:16.020 --> 2:34:21.540]  This is supposed to be reserved for women so they can get the scholarships and the accolades.
[2:34:21.540 --> 2:34:22.540]  Which I say they should.
[2:34:22.540 --> 2:34:25.820]  But you see, when you have this, you're just stripping it away.
[2:34:25.820 --> 2:34:26.820]  You're making it a boy.
[2:34:26.820 --> 2:34:29.740]  You've robbed the women, and now this fat ass Frankenstein.
[2:34:29.740 --> 2:34:30.740]  Yeah.
[2:34:30.740 --> 2:34:34.180]  Now, see, here's the deal.
[2:34:34.180 --> 2:34:37.900]  She got defeated.
[2:34:37.900 --> 2:34:41.660]  The woman got defeated by a man.
[2:34:41.660 --> 2:34:42.660]  But that's supposed to be a woman.
[2:34:42.660 --> 2:34:46.940]  You would normally call that violence and abuse of it wrong, but now, oh, it's beautiful.
[2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:53.940]  This guy, the just one, ranked about 360 second in men's track.
[2:34:53.940 --> 2:34:56.900]  And now they rank him number one in women's track.
[2:34:56.900 --> 2:35:03.420]  See, if you can't make the varsity, sit your behind in the stands and cheer like everybody
[2:35:03.420 --> 2:35:04.420]  else.
[2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:05.420]  You don't need to try and see.
[2:35:05.420 --> 2:35:06.420]  I couldn't make varsity track.
[2:35:06.420 --> 2:35:07.420]  I just sat in the stands.
[2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:13.020]  I played football, but I couldn't run track, you know, so I just cheered my team on, you
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:14.340]  know, you just call yourself a woman.
[2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:15.340]  Now you're right.
[2:35:15.340 --> 2:35:17.700]  Now the football is that that wrestling.
[2:35:17.700 --> 2:35:19.940]  I got a personal thing about that.
[2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:23.380]  I was in a parking lot.
[2:35:23.380 --> 2:35:24.380]  I think it was low.
[2:35:24.380 --> 2:35:25.380]  It was one of these big hardware.
[2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:26.380]  Hold on, judge.
[2:35:26.380 --> 2:35:27.380]  One more segment.
[2:35:27.380 --> 2:35:30.540]  Maybe we're going to take over into the next hour, but we got to get this guy some lunch.
[2:35:30.540 --> 2:35:31.940]  This guy is on fire.
[2:35:31.940 --> 2:35:32.940]  Woo.
[2:35:32.940 --> 2:35:33.940]  A judge.
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:34.940]  Joe Brown, baby.
[2:35:34.940 --> 2:35:39.060]  Oh, and we're going to talk about your new company that I'm very excited about.
[2:35:39.060 --> 2:35:41.020]  I promise when we come back.
[2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:42.020]  Man, I am excited.
[2:35:42.020 --> 2:35:45.660]  I've done a lot of big interviews with Trump and everybody else, but I think I'm going
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:47.500]  to say this is the best interview ever.
[2:35:47.500 --> 2:35:48.500]  Wow.
[2:35:48.500 --> 2:35:49.500]  We'll be right back.
[2:35:49.500 --> 2:35:52.500]  Stay with us.
[2:35:52.500 --> 2:35:54.500]  The equation is very simple.
[2:35:54.500 --> 2:36:01.900]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[2:36:01.900 --> 2:36:07.340]  military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been
[2:36:07.340 --> 2:36:13.740]  in control in the third world, they have status absolute total despotism and de-immunization.
[2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:20.700]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[2:36:20.700 --> 2:36:23.660]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:36:23.660 --> 2:36:29.180]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[2:36:29.180 --> 2:36:36.620]  down, and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:39.460]  that threatens their monopolies of control.
[2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:43.540]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:36:43.540 --> 2:36:49.180]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:50.180]  So we double your efforts.
[2:36:50.180 --> 2:36:56.180]  We're all in this together.
[2:36:56.180 --> 2:36:59.180]  Randy Dewwright, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:36:59.180 --> 2:37:00.180]  Go ahead.
[2:37:00.180 --> 2:37:02.780]  Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:37:02.780 --> 2:37:08.300]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:13.780]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:37:13.780 --> 2:37:19.780]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:37:19.780 --> 2:37:23.100]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:37:23.100 --> 2:37:27.140]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:37:27.140 --> 2:37:30.740]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:37:30.740 --> 2:37:33.860]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:37:33.860 --> 2:37:39.380]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:40.380]  This is working.
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:41.380]  This is wonderful.
[2:37:41.380 --> 2:37:45.260]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore.
[2:37:45.260 --> 2:37:53.340]  You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:37:53.340 --> 2:37:58.660]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat

[2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:56.020]  My enemies are your enemies.
[2:38:56.020 --> 2:38:58.020]  They're the globalistic extremists.
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:04.660]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[2:39:04.660 --> 2:39:09.860]  vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting
[2:39:09.860 --> 2:39:16.820]  up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic
[2:39:16.820 --> 2:39:24.220]  radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:28.180]  can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:33.100]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:35.500]  going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:39.460]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to
[2:39:39.460 --> 2:39:43.260]  not only cover limited amounts of what's happened in the World Order, but at the end of the
[2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:46.620]  day it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[2:39:46.620 --> 2:39:51.180]  end of the human system as we know it, and on its ashes a nightmare being built, only
[2:39:51.180 --> 2:39:56.500]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[2:39:56.500 --> 2:40:11.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:41.780]  All right, Judge Joe Brown is here, he's going to be on
[2:40:41.780 --> 2:40:46.580]  the American Journal tomorrow, and we're just so honored that he came here, and I've always
[2:40:46.580 --> 2:40:50.460]  loved the show and I used to see it, I saw him attacking for being traditional and just
[2:40:50.460 --> 2:40:56.100]  promoting what works, you know, like we breathe oxygen, that's traditional, we love God, that's
[2:40:56.100 --> 2:41:00.500]  traditional, but you have just blown me away today and hearing you get into all these points
[2:41:00.500 --> 2:41:01.500]  that are so true.
[2:41:01.500 --> 2:41:04.740]  Then I went to the bathroom real quick, I came back and you were explaining that the
[2:41:04.740 --> 2:41:10.300]  old south for all the tissues was actually the old Elizabethan English and stuff people
[2:41:10.300 --> 2:41:15.260]  don't know, I mean, it's great to run into my, it doesn't be right about you, okay.
[2:41:15.260 --> 2:41:21.180]  The southern drawl is a fossilized edition of Latin English language as it was spoken
[2:41:21.180 --> 2:41:29.100]  in Shakespeare's time, Hamlet, is this a dagger that I see before me, handle toward
[2:41:29.100 --> 2:41:35.740]  my hand, come let me clutch thee, I see thee not, but yet I see thee still, you know, that
[2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:42.100]  sounds like gibberish to the modern ear, but if you say, is this a dagger that I see before
[2:41:42.100 --> 2:41:48.540]  me, handle toward my hand, come let me clutch thee, I see thee not, but I see thee still,
[2:41:48.540 --> 2:41:53.020]  see it makes more sense than you can understand it, because it's something contemporaneous
[2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:59.580]  to southern drawl, you see, but back to this other thing, it's a personal thing I have
[2:41:59.580 --> 2:42:10.500]  about this boys and women sports, I was walking from my car to a Lowe's hardware outlet and
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:15.260]  somebody said Uncle Joe and I looked over and there was this beautiful young lady with
[2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:22.940]  a full armed shoulder cast and a strut and I didn't recognize her until I realized that
[2:42:22.940 --> 2:42:27.860]  I hadn't seen her since she'd been 11 years old and she was a good friend's granddaughter,
[2:42:27.860 --> 2:42:35.100]  so she was telling me how she had translated being a martial artist into a scholarship
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:42.140]  at a university for women's wrestling, so she was crying about being made to wrestle
[2:42:42.140 --> 2:42:47.540]  this boy and she was told that if she did not wrestle him, she would lose her scholarship
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:53.820]  and the team was forfeit, so one of her team members, another woman suffered three fractured
[2:42:53.820 --> 2:43:00.740]  ribs and a fractured jaw wrestling this punk and this guy that she had to wrestle did
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:05.300]  a compound fracture on her arm and she'd had three operations and for those that don't
[2:43:05.300 --> 2:43:11.260]  know, that means snapped a bone out of her skin and she was crying, taking the pain medication,
[2:43:11.260 --> 2:43:15.140]  she couldn't focus on her studies, she was worried about becoming a cast.
[2:43:15.140 --> 2:43:17.460]  What are we used to do with people that broke women's arms?
[2:43:17.460 --> 2:43:24.300]  Put them in jail, up onto the dog on jail and she just couldn't, you know, it was like
[2:43:24.300 --> 2:43:32.540]  destroying her life and she said that was not fair, that was just not fair and it isn't,
[2:43:32.540 --> 2:43:40.460]  so why do you allow this because somebody has the sickness to say I hate me, I don't
[2:43:40.460 --> 2:43:47.420]  want to be what I am, I want to be something else, so I have deluded myself and my society
[2:43:47.420 --> 2:43:52.380]  has helped me delude myself by saying you can do this and now I get to break women's
[2:43:52.380 --> 2:43:53.380]  arms.
[2:43:53.380 --> 2:44:01.060]  Yes, and the compound is 25 years ago, I was on this advisory board for the Board of Education
[2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:07.620]  around here, where I am up in Memphis, Shelby County, well 30 years ago and what happened
[2:44:07.620 --> 2:44:12.220]  was I was sitting in on a proceeding where they were disciplining five male homeroom
[2:44:12.220 --> 2:44:17.580]  teachers for having the demerit of telling their boys that they're strong and in girls,
[2:44:17.580 --> 2:44:23.260]  they should never hit them, so some parents of some daughters were upset that they had
[2:44:23.260 --> 2:44:26.340]  told these boys they were stronger than girls.
[2:44:26.340 --> 2:44:27.340]  To control their power.
[2:44:27.340 --> 2:44:32.020]  Yes, but they felt that was insulting to the girls, so my response was look, I don't work
[2:44:32.020 --> 2:44:38.140]  for this, I'm not elected at this, but I invite you to the last Thursday in the month sessions
[2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:43.620]  where I have appeals from law court convictions for domestic violence, come on in and watch
[2:44:43.620 --> 2:44:46.780]  it and you tell me if this isn't the fact.
[2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:53.220]  So it's still a boy, still the boy's musculator, still the boy's skeletal system, and it is
[2:44:53.220 --> 2:44:58.540]  unfair to let these boys do what they do to girls and it upsets the paradigm.
[2:44:58.540 --> 2:45:03.740]  And like you said though, it's not just that we're physically almost twice as strong, it's
[2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:05.580]  that we have an initiative to kill.
[2:45:05.580 --> 2:45:07.140]  Yeah, we know how to break stuff.
[2:45:07.140 --> 2:45:13.940]  The other thing is our mission is to protect womanhood and yet you turn it into a physical
[2:45:13.940 --> 2:45:19.100]  thing where they can destroy individual members of that womanhood.
[2:45:19.100 --> 2:45:21.980]  That is wrong and I don't care, we don't need to allow it.
[2:45:21.980 --> 2:45:27.740]  Now I'm not on against homosexuality, if you want to do it, get your freak on.
[2:45:27.740 --> 2:45:29.260]  But don't try to force it on us.
[2:45:29.260 --> 2:45:35.820]  I say corrupt everybody else and then there's another thing and okay, a little wild, but
[2:45:35.820 --> 2:45:41.820]  from 18 to 25, there are more boy virgins than there are girl virgins, that drives that
[2:45:41.820 --> 2:45:43.820]  whole in-sale movement.
[2:45:43.820 --> 2:45:45.460]  Now when you've got a society-
[2:45:45.460 --> 2:45:48.260]  Yeah, why is almost every mass shooter an in-sale?
[2:45:48.260 --> 2:45:51.860]  Yeah, that's like, what are you doing?
[2:45:51.860 --> 2:45:57.700]  What are you putting up and see, we are about to have that safety bubble pop.
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:45:59.500]  The world is getting more peaked.
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:02.020]  I agree, the veneer of civilization is peeling away.
[2:46:02.020 --> 2:46:03.020]  Yeah.
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:04.020]  Why is that happening?
[2:46:04.020 --> 2:46:10.780]  The problem is, is what we have is a culture developed when everybody knew everybody, you
[2:46:10.780 --> 2:46:15.820]  know, people were relatives, everybody was a remote relative or somebody you associated
[2:46:15.820 --> 2:46:16.820]  with.
[2:46:16.820 --> 2:46:17.820]  Everybody was looking out.
[2:46:17.820 --> 2:46:22.900]  Yeah, and we had these things that developed because of the mutual love aspect, altruism.
[2:46:22.900 --> 2:46:24.980]  I will die for my brothers.
[2:46:24.980 --> 2:46:29.860]  I'll die for the guy next to me in the slit, trench or the foxhole.
[2:46:29.860 --> 2:46:32.300]  You know, I will die to defend-
[2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:34.220]  Now we have all these selfish people-
[2:46:34.220 --> 2:46:39.460]  Yeah, and now once we take it away, it's going to be almost impossible to regenerate that.
[2:46:39.460 --> 2:46:43.940]  Well, China is all about, they put you in prison if you're homosexual, I'm not saying
[2:46:43.940 --> 2:46:47.260]  do that, but they're all unified ready for war, we're all divided.
[2:46:47.260 --> 2:46:49.420]  Okay, let's take China.
[2:46:49.420 --> 2:46:56.740]  The People's Republic of China instituted a quote, man-up campaign this year.
[2:46:56.740 --> 2:47:02.420]  And one of the problems that they are facing is an interesting one, when families could
[2:47:02.420 --> 2:47:07.940]  only have one child, the women chose to abort a lot of the female fetuses.
[2:47:07.940 --> 2:47:13.500]  So now they have an impasse of three women for every five men who have-
[2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:15.180]  So now they have a three-child policy?
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:20.180]  Yeah, so now they're coming up with then two now threes to redress that particular-
[2:47:20.180 --> 2:47:23.620]  Meanwhile, the army makes men wear red shoes, high heels.
[2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:25.620]  Oh, God.
[2:47:25.620 --> 2:47:27.740]  How abusive is that?
[2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:30.740]  That's a cult.
[2:47:30.740 --> 2:47:39.780]  Oh, that's, that's, oh, that's too much.
[2:47:39.780 --> 2:47:45.260]  By the way, one other thing too, I don't, I don't like people that are so ashamed of
[2:47:45.260 --> 2:47:51.340]  themselves that they have to get changes made, that's just not my kind of person.
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:57.620]  But for every one of these sex change operations that the government pays for in the military,
[2:47:57.620 --> 2:48:01.220]  that's the cost of two rhino-mine resistant vehicles.
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:09.980]  So that means anywhere from 11 to 20, 25 young men and women are now subject to maiming or
[2:48:09.980 --> 2:48:13.180]  death because you get somebody-
[2:48:13.180 --> 2:48:14.180]  Well, that's my issue.
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:17.020]  In Travis County, they make you pay for abortion and sex change.
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:18.020]  Well, the sex change-
[2:48:18.020 --> 2:48:21.020]  So I live here, I'm finally, actually I'm so in my house right now, I'm gonna move
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:24.580]  outside the county finally, so I don't pay for abortion and sex change.
[2:48:24.580 --> 2:48:26.820]  Because why should, okay, you want to chop your genitals off?
[2:48:26.820 --> 2:48:27.820]  Do it.
[2:48:27.820 --> 2:48:28.820]  Don't make me pay for it.
[2:48:28.820 --> 2:48:29.820]  Yeah.
[2:48:29.820 --> 2:48:30.820]  But to do it, see, we have to pay for it.
[2:48:30.820 --> 2:48:36.260]  And see, the other thing is, while they're in service, they spend more time in medical
[2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:42.700]  rehabilitation than they do serving in uniform when they get these operations.
[2:48:42.700 --> 2:48:43.700]  Well, they're-
[2:48:43.700 --> 2:48:44.700]  It's mutilation.
[2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:45.700]  Yeah.
[2:48:45.700 --> 2:48:49.940]  The multiple mutilations they would pay for devices.
[2:48:49.940 --> 2:48:55.580]  Who rhinos that would keep our service personnel protected in an environment where-
[2:48:55.580 --> 2:48:57.580]  Here's how about armored vehicles for those general rhinos.
[2:48:57.580 --> 2:48:58.580]  Yeah.
[2:48:58.580 --> 2:49:02.060]  Where their main threat is IEDs, improvise the closest sites.
[2:49:02.060 --> 2:49:05.260]  Judge, we got five more minutes this final segment that Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:49:05.260 --> 2:49:08.620]  I don't want to cut it to him, but you've been amazing.
[2:49:08.620 --> 2:49:11.980]  Tell us, you also want to hit the Second Amendment and this judge is really-
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:12.980]  Oh, God, yeah.
[2:49:12.980 --> 2:49:13.980]  I mean, it's all-
[2:49:13.980 --> 2:49:14.980]  This is just a good thing.
[2:49:14.980 --> 2:49:20.180]  We have one California judge, not California, but sitting in the District Ninth Circuit
[2:49:20.180 --> 2:49:21.180]  that-
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:22.180]  What is California?
[2:49:22.180 --> 2:49:23.180]  You're right.
[2:49:23.180 --> 2:49:24.180]  Yes, sir.
[2:49:24.180 --> 2:49:27.380]  Appointed by George W. Bush, who was one of the better things he did.
[2:49:27.380 --> 2:49:28.380]  This guy wrote-
[2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:29.380]  I agree.
[2:49:29.380 --> 2:49:30.380]  Bush did some good here.
[2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:31.380]  Yeah.
[2:49:31.380 --> 2:49:32.380]  He did a very intelligent opinion.
[2:49:32.380 --> 2:49:37.900]  And one of the things, if you take out the fact that he is talking about the Second Amendment
[2:49:37.900 --> 2:49:43.620]  in guns, what he says in terms of the holding language is brilliant.
[2:49:43.620 --> 2:49:50.260]  He said, even though a state government may have a bright idea that they want to impose
[2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:57.780]  on the citizens for their own good, if the Constitution says no, you can't do it.
[2:49:57.780 --> 2:50:04.740]  And their desire to save the public from so-called assault rifles, AR-15s, which are actually
[2:50:04.740 --> 2:50:12.100]  armillite 15s, is misspaken because the Second Amendment imposes a guarantee.
[2:50:12.100 --> 2:50:16.340]  And that guarantee does not need to be licensed to exercise.
[2:50:16.340 --> 2:50:22.700]  It is for the purpose, in modern terms, of being able to wage an asymmetric war if somebody
[2:50:22.700 --> 2:50:24.180]  decides to take over-
[2:50:24.180 --> 2:50:27.060]  He said, defend your house and the homeland.
[2:50:27.060 --> 2:50:28.060]  Yes.
[2:50:28.060 --> 2:50:30.060]  Defend the house and homeland.
[2:50:30.060 --> 2:50:34.140]  And see, when you are free people, it's not safe being free.
[2:50:34.140 --> 2:50:35.660]  And there's collateral damage-
[2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:36.660]  Exactly.
[2:50:36.660 --> 2:50:43.660]  All right, Judge Brown in studio.
[2:51:07.660 --> 2:51:10.260]  People are really, really away from the establishment.
[2:51:10.260 --> 2:51:15.260]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[2:51:15.260 --> 2:51:17.780]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[2:51:17.780 --> 2:51:22.140]  You fund us, you support M4.com, you get rate policy at the same time.
[2:51:22.140 --> 2:51:27.100]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[2:51:27.100 --> 2:51:31.940]  you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:51:31.940 --> 2:51:32.940]  That's our job.
[2:51:32.940 --> 2:51:38.580]  Please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock groups for the
[2:51:38.580 --> 2:51:39.580]  information war.
[2:51:39.580 --> 2:51:45.060]  Fund us at M4store.com.
[2:51:45.060 --> 2:51:47.220]  What are champions made of?
[2:51:47.220 --> 2:51:53.180]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:48.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:52:53.180 --> 2:53:04.700]  Alright, Judge Joe Brown doesn't want to talk about it, but I'm making it because he called
[2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:10.180]  me privately. It's not out yet, but I will definitely eat Judge Joe Brown BBQ. Tell me
[2:53:10.180 --> 2:53:17.620]  about this. Oh yeah, I had this other side thing. Judge Joe Brown BBQ. You be the judge.
[2:53:17.620 --> 2:53:24.980]  I was and I adjudicate that it is good. We'll have seasonings, recipes, we have sauces and
[2:53:24.980 --> 2:53:31.820]  the three of them are great. It's regular, OG and hot and we have chicken links and we'll
[2:53:31.820 --> 2:53:41.820]  have some of that near meat, beyond meat links and we will have some BBQ pits, cookers
[2:53:41.820 --> 2:53:48.180]  and such like to use either charcoal, propane, gas. Let me get you BBQ and you said, oh yeah,
[2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:53.940]  I'm going to watch it. Oh yeah, I love BBQ. Sir, you said you're flying out tomorrow afternoon,
[2:53:53.940 --> 2:53:58.940]  but you're going to come back tomorrow. Yes, I will be back. We are going to be back. Yes, sir.
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:54:02.940]  Okay. We have like three minutes left, four minutes left. You were making some huge points
[2:54:02.940 --> 2:54:09.780]  about everything. I have a sneaking suspicion and this is kind of a prediction. You can see
[2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:15.900]  that the mainstream media is trying to infer that Biden is perhaps a little senile and that gives
[2:54:15.900 --> 2:54:21.980]  him a face so they're saving face so they can carry out their plan, which is to resign. So,
[2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:29.180]  Mrs. Comella Emhoff becomes president and under the operation of the 20th Amendment,
[2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:37.180]  Nancy Pelosi becomes vice president if you can wrap your mind around that thought. Mrs. Emhoff.
[2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:45.660]  Now, why do we have Mrs. Hillary Clinton, Mrs. Nancy Pelosi, Mrs. Sarah Palin, but we got Ms.
[2:54:45.660 --> 2:54:53.900]  Comella Harris instead of Mrs. Comella Harris. Is that a feminist statement involved in this to
[2:54:53.900 --> 2:55:01.340]  reject this institution of marriage which 50 years ago was portrayed as an institution of
[2:55:01.340 --> 2:55:08.460]  female enslavement, another example of this mess. And frankly, I don't trust that woman. I was in
[2:55:08.460 --> 2:55:13.540]  California when she was out there and it was all sorts of corruption and bribery and extortion
[2:55:13.540 --> 2:55:19.060]  that was going on. And personally, as somebody that's been involved with the criminal law for 50
[2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:26.820]  years, I would say if there's a more reprehensible, unprincipled and dishonest segment of the human
[2:55:26.820 --> 2:55:33.500]  population, it is career prosecutors. Not all of them, but she was like the queen of that. Yeah,
[2:55:33.500 --> 2:55:39.220]  from people. I mean, like she had a particular animus towards black people. Oh, yes. Horrible.
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:46.620]  And she's not black. She's what you call a Hindu Tamille Brahman. And anthropologically,
[2:55:46.620 --> 2:55:53.580]  guess what that group is called? They're called Indo Aryans. See, she is what an Aryan is. It's
[2:55:53.580 --> 2:55:59.180]  not blonde haired blue eyed Hitler and his boys told a lie for the benefit of the German public
[2:55:59.180 --> 2:56:04.140]  that Aryans are blonde haired blue eyed from the far north. No, they are far away. I ran,
[2:56:04.140 --> 2:56:10.500]  actually means Aryan. Yeah, they're from India. They're swarthy, the dark skin with dark coarse
[2:56:10.500 --> 2:56:19.740]  hair and dark eyes, just like Camilla Harris. And being from Jamaica does not make you. You
[2:56:19.740 --> 2:56:23.940]  showed the photos on the interviewer on why she have such a hard on like they said she was the
[2:56:23.940 --> 2:56:27.500]  worst prosecutor you ever like. Oh, yeah, just attack black people. Like what what is the point?
[2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:31.740]  Oh, well, see, from some of my colleagues out there, they tell me that she does war
[2:56:31.740 --> 2:56:37.540]  short skirts. So the judges protected her. And she'd get away with a lot of stuff she
[2:56:37.540 --> 2:56:42.420]  wasn't supposed to do as a prosecutor. And she was unprincipled too much power corrupt,
[2:56:42.420 --> 2:56:48.740]  absolute power corrupt, absolutely. And career prosecutors do not have enough people looking
[2:56:48.740 --> 2:56:52.420]  over their shoulders. What's that? What's that woman's name that's white with blonde hair that
[2:56:52.420 --> 2:56:59.900]  says she's black? That's almost like what she's like. Well, exactly. And it's a shame because
[2:56:59.900 --> 2:57:07.020]  Indians are fine people. I wonder about how she disregards and this is her own people by saying
[2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:13.460]  she's something else. So exactly, why is she not proud of who she is? Now, this woman looks more
[2:57:13.460 --> 2:57:20.260]  black than Camilla Harris does. If you've ever met any Hindu brahman cast. If you look at a
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:25.260]  collection of Hindu brahman cast women, they look just exactly like that's where she said she's
[2:57:25.260 --> 2:57:32.340]  an elitist. Yeah, that's the upper class. Yes, they have castism in India where if you're an
[2:57:32.340 --> 2:57:37.780]  untouchable at the bottom and you brush up against one, you have to be decontaminated. All
[2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:42.700]  right, Judge Joe Brown, we are blown away your podcast and radio shows. Just Google Judge Joe
[2:57:42.700 --> 2:57:46.860]  Brown. You're amazing. And you're so amazing to be here with us. We look forward to having you
[2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:53.900]  back on tomorrow. You'll also be on the morning show and out. The entire new world order system is
[2:57:53.900 --> 2:57:59.900]  about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim. So
[2:57:59.900 --> 2:58:04.780]  you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny
[2:58:04.780 --> 2:58:11.420]  we have being given free will being given free will being given consciousness is literally the seed
[2:58:11.420 --> 2:58:18.020]  of an entire universe, an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact
[2:58:18.020 --> 2:58:22.780]  you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of
[2:58:22.780 --> 2:58:27.900]  your life, your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the
[2:58:27.900 --> 2:58:33.460]  fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic. And that itself is what
[2:58:33.460 --> 2:58:39.660]  God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist. Don't worship the NFL. Don't worship
[2:58:39.660 --> 2:58:44.460]  all the things of the system. But worship the things of God because we're made by God. And
[2:58:44.460 --> 2:58:49.180]  appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it while you still
[2:58:49.180 --> 2:59:19.020]  have it. Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to
[2:59:19.020 --> 2:59:28.140]  Paul Joseph Watson. Hello, everybody. And we are back with the Summit News Hour from
[2:59:28.140 --> 2:59:34.380]  live here from London, where it's 25 degrees outside 77 Fahrenheit, you American listeners.
[2:59:34.940 --> 2:59:39.980]  Summer has finally arrived. But we still see hordes of people walking around suffocating
[2:59:39.980 --> 2:59:44.460]  themselves in face masks outside, even though there's literally no law, no rule that says
[2:59:44.460 --> 2:59:49.740]  they have to do that because they're part of the cult. They're part of the cult that once this
[2:59:49.740 --> 2:59:54.780]  lockdown to never end to continue forever. And that's precisely what it looks like is going to
[2:59:54.780 --> 3:00:01.820]  happen here in the United Kingdom with the news that this easing of restrictions, this total
[3:00:01.820 --> 3:00:08.860]  lifting of restrictions, the supposed freedom day of 21st of June here in a couple of weeks time
[3:00:08.860 --> 3:00:17.020]  is, surprise, surprise, not going to happen. And we predicted it every turn of the way.
[3:00:17.020 --> 3:00:21.660]  Headline out of lockdown skeptics.org says lockdown can be extended by between two weeks
[3:00:21.660 --> 3:00:27.580]  and a month following grim briefing to ministers by Whitty and Valance. Grim briefing, by the way,
[3:00:28.540 --> 3:00:34.940]  and we featured this story weeks ago, by the same people who were literally caught, not just caught
[3:00:34.940 --> 3:00:42.060]  but admitted to the fact that they use in their own words, and this is out the telegraph, psychological
[3:00:42.060 --> 3:00:48.380]  mind control, unethical and totalitarian methods to brainwash the public into complete
[3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:54.780]  complaints by scaring them by putting out information and narratives that made out as if the threat
[3:00:54.780 --> 3:01:00.380]  from coronavirus was way worse than it actually was. And of course, that translated in the polls,
[3:01:00.380 --> 3:01:07.420]  which were later conducted, which found that the average Brit found that 100 times more people
[3:01:07.420 --> 3:01:13.340]  in the United Kingdom had died from COVID-19 than had actually died. That was at a point last summer,
[3:01:13.980 --> 3:01:18.300]  similar in America, in fact, even worse in America, where the average American thinks
[3:01:18.300 --> 3:01:24.780]  225 times more people have died from COVID in the US than actually have, again, because of their
[3:01:24.780 --> 3:01:31.660]  fear-mongering manipulative media. These scientists, the same ones that we're listening to, the same
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:37.580]  ones who say we cannot end the lockdown, admitted that they wanted to, quote, ramp up the fear,
[3:01:38.220 --> 3:01:43.420]  again, that's a quote, that's their words, in order to enlist this unquestioning mass
[3:01:43.420 --> 3:01:49.980]  compliance from the public, they admit using, or they admit weaponizing behavioral psychology
[3:01:49.980 --> 3:01:55.900]  as a form of population control. They admit all that, and they admit doing it for the past year,
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:01.580]  and yet we're still listening to them. Why are we still listening to them when they've admitted
[3:02:01.580 --> 3:02:08.060]  to brainwashing, psychologically manipulating the public to support measures which are completely
[3:02:08.060 --> 3:02:15.660]  out of bounds? Not correlated to the actual data, but that doesn't matter, because on Monday,
[3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:20.300]  the Prime Minister's spokesman said, and not for the first time, it still remains there is nothing
[3:02:20.300 --> 3:02:24.860]  in the data to currently suggest step four of the lockdown roadmap can't go ahead at the earliest
[3:02:24.860 --> 3:02:32.700]  date. Unfortunately, reports today are far more pessimistic about a June 21st unlock. This is due
[3:02:32.700 --> 3:02:38.700]  to a fairly grim briefing given to ministers by the government's scientific advisors, the same ones
[3:02:38.700 --> 3:02:44.460]  who've got it spectacularly wrong, the same ones who admitted brainwashing, weaponizing behavioral
[3:02:44.460 --> 3:02:49.500]  psychology to manipulate the public, and yet this government is still listening to them.
[3:02:51.500 --> 3:02:55.820]  The Times reports Britain's roadmap freezing lockdown could be delayed by a fortnight with
[3:02:55.820 --> 3:03:01.980]  cabinet ministers increasingly pessimistic. And then we have this, forget about a fortnight,
[3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:09.420]  Guardian reports Sunak could accept four week delay to ending COVID restrictions in England.
[3:03:09.420 --> 3:03:13.900]  Rishi Sunak is willing to accept a delay of up to four weeks to the final stage of England's
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:18.380]  reopening roadmap. The Guardian understands that the government considers extending restrictions
[3:03:18.380 --> 3:03:26.220]  beyond 21st of June. They move the goalposts at every available opportunity. So again, people say,
[3:03:26.220 --> 3:03:33.100]  why can't you wait two weeks? It's just two weeks. Oh, but then it's four weeks. 15 months ago,
[3:03:33.100 --> 3:03:40.220]  we were told three weeks to flatten the curve. This was March 2020. Just remain under lockdown
[3:03:40.220 --> 3:03:47.420]  for three weeks. It'll all be over three weeks to protect the NHS. We've had several lockdowns
[3:03:47.420 --> 3:03:54.700]  since now we're here at a stage 15 months later, where they're saying, we just need two more weeks.
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:59.900]  Oh, no, we actually might need four weeks. Maybe we'll need a couple of months. Maybe we'll need
[3:03:59.900 --> 3:04:05.420]  three months. Then we're into autumn. Then we have the flu season coming back. Oh, look, we've
[3:04:05.420 --> 3:04:13.820]  discovered this scary new variant or scary. Now we need to wait until Christmas. The same pattern
[3:04:13.820 --> 3:04:19.420]  that happened last year, it never ends. It is never going to end until the majority of the
[3:04:19.420 --> 3:04:25.020]  British public stand up and tell them that they're not going to listen anymore. Doesn't seem to be
[3:04:25.020 --> 3:04:30.780]  the case right now, given what the polls say, which is still 70, 80% of the public. We probably
[3:04:30.780 --> 3:04:35.260]  want to remain under lockdown for years to come. So long as they can sit on their arses and collect
[3:04:35.260 --> 3:04:41.820]  furlough money, get paid by the government to do nothing, pretty big incentive. So they're still
[3:04:41.820 --> 3:04:48.300]  trying to scare us with this Indian variant. The Indian variant has a lower hospitalization rate
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:54.780]  compared to the British variant, which they tried to scare us with a few months ago. Only 1% of this
[3:04:54.780 --> 3:04:59.660]  Indian variant or Delta variant as they're now calling it, because it's racist to say Indian,
[3:04:59.660 --> 3:05:10.060]  and that's more important. Only 1% of cases, 126 out of 12,383 were hospitalized. And even in the
[3:05:10.060 --> 3:05:15.420]  regions you have to understand, Blackburn and Bolton in the northwest of England, where you have
[3:05:15.420 --> 3:05:21.980]  these large Muslim populations who completely ignore social distancing, they have giant families,
[3:05:21.980 --> 3:05:25.660]  they don't care, they go and see each other, have been doing all throughout lockdown.
[3:05:25.660 --> 3:05:31.420]  Most of them don't take the vaccine, which is their right to do. But even in those pockets,
[3:05:32.620 --> 3:05:38.460]  the variant infection rates are falling. The hospitalization rates are falling. The deaths
[3:05:38.460 --> 3:05:44.140]  are falling to the point where we have now zero deaths per day on numerous days over the past
[3:05:44.140 --> 3:05:48.860]  couple of weeks. And yet these sage government advisors, the same ones who've been caught lying
[3:05:48.860 --> 3:05:56.140]  to us time and time again, are still unwilling to relinquish that power and they never, ever will.
[3:05:57.180 --> 3:06:03.100]  Look at this headline that we had earlier today. Norwegian health chief scolded for saying COVID-19
[3:06:03.100 --> 3:06:08.700]  pandemic nearly over. A Norwegian public health professional received a massive official backlash
[3:06:08.700 --> 3:06:12.780]  after he suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic was, quote, nearly over,
[3:06:12.780 --> 3:06:19.820]  jittering by the country's plummeting case numbers. So he made the fatal error. This is Preben Avisland,
[3:06:19.820 --> 3:06:25.020]  a Norwegian institute of public health chief physician. He made the fatal error of tweeting
[3:06:25.020 --> 3:06:34.140]  a graph that showed the hospitalization rates in Norway were going down. He gave people hope.
[3:06:34.140 --> 3:06:40.940]  I mean, how dare he? He actually gave people hope and said to them, soon you'll be able to return
[3:06:40.940 --> 3:06:46.620]  to your normal lives. He said, quote, here in Norway, the pandemic is almost over. We can start
[3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:51.260]  preparing for an everyday life where the Corona has very little place in our lives. He said,
[3:06:51.260 --> 3:06:55.980]  very few hospitalized and only several thousand cases of infection are discovered every week.
[3:06:55.980 --> 3:07:01.020]  The numbers are declining rapidly at the same time as more and more people are being vaccinated.
[3:07:01.900 --> 3:07:06.940]  So he basically said the hospitalization cases are rapidly declining. Norway is a country that
[3:07:06.940 --> 3:07:14.220]  only ever had 800 total coronavirus deaths. And what happened to this Norwegian public health
[3:07:14.220 --> 3:07:20.700]  official? Oh, he was crucified. He was crucified for saying to the public, this could be coming to an
[3:07:20.700 --> 3:07:26.860]  end by the very people who never want it to come to an end because they're drunk on the power,
[3:07:26.860 --> 3:07:33.180]  the scientific dictatorship that has seized control of the West in light of this COVID scandal.
[3:07:33.180 --> 3:07:37.660]  The prime minister came out and said that people should keep complying with what they are ordered
[3:07:37.660 --> 3:07:43.660]  to do by the authorities. Matt Gilbert, the head of the emergency medicine department at the
[3:07:43.660 --> 3:07:49.180]  University Hospital of North Norway, accused of its land of, quote, sabotaging the fight against
[3:07:49.180 --> 3:07:55.420]  the pandemic. So this guy is even parroting a consensus view that people need to get the vaccine.
[3:07:55.420 --> 3:08:00.780]  And look, the cases are going down. It's looking like it's pretty good news. There was a forest fire,
[3:08:00.780 --> 3:08:05.900]  there was a forest fire, but there's only little pockets of fire to put out. He gave the population
[3:08:05.900 --> 3:08:11.100]  hope that they get their normal lives back before the end of the summer. And now he's basically
[3:08:11.100 --> 3:08:17.660]  being canceled by the medical establishment, by the government in Norway, for daring to suggest
[3:08:17.660 --> 3:08:23.660]  that people may get their freedoms returned to them in the next few weeks. What does that tell
[3:08:23.660 --> 3:08:29.740]  you about the scientific dictatorship that's taken control of the West in light of this COVID
[3:08:29.740 --> 3:08:35.020]  scandal? It proves to you that they never, ever want to relinquish power and never will do so
[3:08:35.020 --> 3:08:41.180]  until enough people stand up and resist and stop complying. Not happening yet. We hope to see it
[3:08:41.180 --> 3:08:46.380]  happening over the next few weeks when people finally finally realize they're not going to get
[3:08:46.380 --> 3:08:53.260]  their summer back. We'll be back. Summit.News. Don't go away. As negative as times are right now
[3:08:53.260 --> 3:09:00.540]  and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test. This experience,
[3:09:00.540 --> 3:09:08.540]  this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out the third
[3:09:08.540 --> 3:09:14.220]  dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to. And it
[3:09:14.220 --> 3:09:19.500]  really does come down to that. So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good
[3:09:19.500 --> 3:09:25.180]  in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of
[3:09:25.180 --> 3:09:32.940]  us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful
[3:09:32.940 --> 3:09:37.580]  thing. And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[3:09:37.580 --> 3:09:43.980]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:47.900]  you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the
[3:09:47.900 --> 3:09:52.860]  image of God, the creator of the universe. The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning
[3:09:52.860 --> 3:09:58.860]  you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out
[3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:04.540]  of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is
[3:10:04.540 --> 3:10:08.220]  we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[3:10:08.220 --> 3:10:13.900]  decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong, we're incredible and
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:18.140]  if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God
[3:10:18.140 --> 3:10:23.260]  for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared
[3:10:23.260 --> 3:10:28.060]  is essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[3:10:28.060 --> 3:10:32.540]  info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great
[3:10:32.540 --> 3:10:38.300]  products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation info wars store.com.
[3:10:38.300 --> 3:10:42.700]  Info wars store.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the
[3:10:42.700 --> 3:10:47.420]  supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others. So get them today at info
[3:10:47.420 --> 3:10:55.980]  wars store.com. And I thank you for being part of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[3:10:55.980 --> 3:11:13.900]  show. You're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson. So we've reached
[3:11:13.900 --> 3:11:17.820]  the point 15 months later where they're still saying they're going to extend the lockdown when
[3:11:17.820 --> 3:11:23.580]  literally no people are dying. The hospitals are empty. The flu's disappeared miraculously. I'm sure
[3:11:23.580 --> 3:11:30.620]  that will make a roaring return over the winter and the autumn months. Huffington Post reports
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:37.340]  Michael Gove would bet on June 21st relaxation of COVID rules. Note that term relaxation. We were
[3:11:37.340 --> 3:11:43.820]  told the British public that all rules would be lifted social distancing, mask wearing rules on
[3:11:43.820 --> 3:11:49.180]  how many friends you're allowed to meet inside. Everything across the board would totally be
[3:11:49.180 --> 3:11:54.860]  lifted. That would be the new freedom day. We already had a freedom day last year on July the 4th.
[3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:59.100]  That went really well, didn't it? Now we're still under some form of lockdown.
[3:11:59.820 --> 3:12:05.100]  So they've changed the language. They've moved the goalpost every available opportunity. And now
[3:12:05.100 --> 3:12:10.620]  they're saying, well, then there may be a relaxation. No, you said for months that this would be the
[3:12:10.620 --> 3:12:17.100]  end of it. So now they just changed the language and give us a couple of freedoms back and then
[3:12:17.100 --> 3:12:22.140]  take them away again when the autumn months arrive. Michael Gove has told colleagues that if you were
[3:12:22.140 --> 3:12:27.180]  betting money would bet on a relaxation of England's COVID rules on June 21st, Gove made the comments
[3:12:27.180 --> 3:12:32.380]  during a ministerial meeting on Monday. Boris Johnson prepared to make a decision on whether to
[3:12:32.380 --> 3:12:37.660]  proceed with so-called freedom day. It's not freedom day because they're not going to lift the
[3:12:37.660 --> 3:12:42.620]  restrictions. They've lied about it all along. They also lied about the vaccine passport. Said
[3:12:42.620 --> 3:12:51.180]  there would never be a domestic vaccine passport. That's complete BS, BBC, sport reports, Euro 2020
[3:12:51.180 --> 3:12:56.460]  fans at Wembley Games are required to show proof of vaccination or negative tests before entry.
[3:12:56.460 --> 3:13:01.340]  So they're rolling out the vaccine passport for domestic events like they said they would never
[3:13:01.340 --> 3:13:08.860]  do. Meanwhile, the debunked conspiracy theory that the fact checkers and the mainstream media
[3:13:08.860 --> 3:13:14.540]  and social media networks vilified a band people for for the best part of the past 12 months,
[3:13:14.540 --> 3:13:20.300]  that the virus leaked deliberately from the Wuhan Institute of Virology continues to be proven
[3:13:20.300 --> 3:13:25.020]  in triplicate over and over again. We've got a video here. I'll come back and talk about the
[3:13:25.020 --> 3:13:32.220]  latest on this after Chinese government scientists filed COVID vaccine patent before pandemic began.
[3:13:32.220 --> 3:13:38.300]  Let's go to this clip right now. Here it is. A Chinese government scientist who worked closely
[3:13:38.300 --> 3:13:45.420]  with researchers at the Wuhan lab filed a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine well before the disease
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:51.740]  became a global pandemic. Can't think of why that could possibly be. You send Zhu, who worked for the
[3:13:51.740 --> 3:13:57.020]  People's Liberation Army, lodged the paperwork on behalf of the Chinese political party on February
[3:13:57.020 --> 3:14:03.020]  24, 2020, according to the Australian newspaper. That date was just five weeks after China first
[3:14:03.020 --> 3:14:07.180]  confirmed human transmission of the coronavirus. Zhu is also said to have worked closely with
[3:14:07.180 --> 3:14:12.300]  scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including Xi Zhengli, the deputy director of the
[3:14:12.300 --> 3:14:17.660]  lab who is famous for her research on coronavirus in bats. Turns out Mr. Zhu, who also had close
[3:14:17.660 --> 3:14:23.260]  ties to the University of Minnesota and the New York blood center, came to an unfortunate
[3:14:23.260 --> 3:14:29.900]  untimely end. Three weeks after he filed the patent, he was dead and his death was only recorded by a
[3:14:29.900 --> 3:14:35.660]  single Chinese media outlet. We'll belong nothing to see here. Another disappearing act took place
[3:14:35.660 --> 3:14:41.100]  over the weekend, where Dr. Christian Anderson yeeted his own Twitter account. Anderson was the
[3:14:41.100 --> 3:14:46.780]  virologist who emailed Dr. Fauci in January 2020 to tell him that the COVID-19 virus looked like
[3:14:46.780 --> 3:14:52.220]  it had been engineered in a lab. Now he's gone completely dark on Twitter after deleting thousands
[3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:57.900]  of posts and terminating his entire account completely. Again, nothing suspicious about
[3:14:57.900 --> 3:15:04.140]  that whatsoever. Now yet another major scientific study has come to the same conclusion that fact
[3:15:04.140 --> 3:15:10.140]  checkers and mainstream media outlets derided as a debunked conspiracy theory. The same conclusion
[3:15:10.140 --> 3:15:14.540]  that you weren't allowed to voice on any major social media platform for the best part of the
[3:15:14.540 --> 3:15:19.020]  last year. According to Dr. Stephen Key and Berkeley physics professor Richard Muller,
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:24.860]  quote, the most compelling reason to favor the lab leak hypothesis is firmly based in science.
[3:15:24.860 --> 3:15:29.820]  The scientist added that COVID-19 has a genetic footprint that has never been observed in a
[3:15:29.820 --> 3:15:35.740]  natural coronavirus. The research points to the genome sequencing of the virus CGG CGG,
[3:15:35.740 --> 3:15:41.500]  which is one of 36 sequencing patterns observed but does not occur in nature. The scientist said,
[3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:47.180]  quote, the CGG CGG combination has never been found naturally. That means the common method of
[3:15:47.180 --> 3:15:53.580]  viruses picking up new skills called recombination cannot operate here. Last week emails from Dr.
[3:15:53.580 --> 3:15:58.300]  Fauci released under the freedom of information act request revealed that the same guy who thanked
[3:15:58.300 --> 3:16:03.980]  Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory had not only funded the Wuhan lab, he was later tasked
[3:16:03.980 --> 3:16:10.380]  by the WHO with conducting the investigation into it. Dr. Peter Dajak was also hired by
[3:16:10.380 --> 3:16:16.860]  Facebook as a fact checker and tasked with the responsibility of censoring conspiracy theories
[3:16:16.860 --> 3:16:22.220]  concerning the hypothesis that the virus leaked from the lab. Even after all this came to light,
[3:16:22.220 --> 3:16:28.620]  Medical Journal The Lancet still appointed Dajak as the leader of a task force to investigate the
[3:16:28.620 --> 3:16:34.700]  origins of the coronavirus. Again, this is all just one huge coincidence and doesn't clearly
[3:16:34.700 --> 3:16:40.060]  indicate in any way that the same people responsible for leaking the virus from the lab
[3:16:40.060 --> 3:16:44.940]  then try to cover it up. How could anyone even dare to draw such a conclusion?
[3:16:44.940 --> 3:16:54.060]  So, again, they were already working on the vaccine. This guy mysteriously died three months
[3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:59.580]  later. Now we have this report, again, out of Summit.News. A different virus leaked from another
[3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:05.820]  Chinese bio facility at the same time as COVID-19 in the wake of renewed focus on the plausibility
[3:17:05.820 --> 3:17:09.500]  of the Wuhan lab leak of COVID-19. It has been noted that there was an outbreak of a different
[3:17:09.500 --> 3:17:14.540]  virus from another Chinese bio facility at around the same time. Reuters report last year
[3:17:14.540 --> 3:17:19.260]  that Brookha Lois, a bacterial disease with blue-like symptoms, has infected more than 6,000
[3:17:19.260 --> 3:17:24.780]  people in a single outbreak in northwestern China. The report further noted that usually
[3:17:24.780 --> 3:17:29.260]  caused by contact with humans, the outbreak in Longzhou, the capital of Gansu province,
[3:17:29.260 --> 3:17:33.660]  was due to a leak at a vaccine plant according to Longzhou's Health Commission.
[3:17:33.660 --> 3:17:37.500]  People are still being treated at hospital even though the outbreak happened a year ago.
[3:17:38.540 --> 3:17:43.740]  Now we learn that they're literally planning in China to build dozens more of these bio weapons
[3:17:43.740 --> 3:17:51.020]  research facilities over the next few years. What could possibly go wrong? Meanwhile, video,
[3:17:51.900 --> 3:17:57.740]  WHO advisor says China engaged in massive cover-up of COVID outbreak. This is a leading
[3:17:57.740 --> 3:18:01.580]  advisor for the World Health Organization, which again said there was no human-to-human
[3:18:01.580 --> 3:18:07.580]  transmission of COVID on January 14th, outright amplifying fake Chinese propaganda,
[3:18:07.580 --> 3:18:12.300]  but we should trust them now. He said that China is still engaged in a massive cover-up of the
[3:18:12.300 --> 3:18:17.580]  coronavirus pandemic, calling for a full investigation to be conducted. Jamie Metzl urged
[3:18:17.580 --> 3:18:21.660]  that the Chinese have engaged in a massive cover-up that is going on until this day,
[3:18:21.660 --> 3:18:27.020]  involving destroying samples, hiding records, placing a universal gag order on Chinese scientists.
[3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:33.020]  Some of the same scientists, by the way, who were trying to warn that coronavirus actually did have
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:38.460]  humans-to-human transmission, they were hunted down by the Chinese government, banned by social
[3:18:38.460 --> 3:18:44.540]  media networks in the West. And he says they're imprisoning Chinese citizen journalists asking
[3:18:44.540 --> 3:18:49.340]  the most basic questions, which again they did at the start of the pandemic, and Facebook and
[3:18:49.340 --> 3:18:54.700]  Twitter facilitated their silencing because they're such moral arbiters of truth.
[3:18:56.300 --> 3:19:01.180]  Another headline here, yet another scientific study concludes COVID is likely lab-engineered.
[3:19:02.060 --> 3:19:05.980]  This is Dr Stephen Key and Berkeley physics professor Richard Muller,
[3:19:05.980 --> 3:19:10.700]  dangerous conspiracy theorist by the sound of it, who revealed the findings in the Wall Street
[3:19:10.700 --> 3:19:15.180]  Journal, noting that quote, the most compelling reason to favor the lab leak hypothesis is
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:21.660]  firmly based in science. They point out COVID-19 has a genetic footprint that's never been observed
[3:19:21.660 --> 3:19:26.220]  in a natural coronavirus. The research points to the genome sequencing of the virus,
[3:19:26.780 --> 3:19:34.220]  which is one of 36 sequencing patterns observed, but does not occur in nature. So every scientific
[3:19:34.220 --> 3:19:39.820]  fingerprint that they've analyzed suggests that this was deliberately manufactured and released
[3:19:39.820 --> 3:19:44.460]  from this lab. We couldn't talk about it for a year, we were called crazy conspiracy theorists,
[3:19:44.460 --> 3:19:49.420]  we were banned, derided, ostracized, and we were proven right, yet again, we'll be back.
[3:19:50.060 --> 3:19:54.540]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:55.260 --> 3:20:00.860]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:20:00.860 --> 3:20:06.220]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together. And it gets old having to come to you
[3:20:06.220 --> 3:20:09.980]  and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air. But it's true,
[3:20:09.980 --> 3:20:13.500]  we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:14.140 --> 3:20:18.140]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:20:18.140 --> 3:20:21.980]  everybody else, they crippled all the other groups, and we're still here. And as this whole
[3:20:21.980 --> 3:20:26.540]  new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got
[3:20:26.540 --> 3:20:30.220]  to be taken off there, that's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these
[3:20:30.220 --> 3:20:35.180]  other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been
[3:20:35.180 --> 3:20:39.660]  proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think
[3:20:39.660 --> 3:20:44.860]  stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020
[3:20:44.860 --> 3:20:48.700]  election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products, and they support the
[3:20:48.700 --> 3:20:54.540]  info. We're thanking you. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:20:54.540 --> 3:20:58.860]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell
[3:20:58.860 --> 3:21:03.420]  you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming
[3:21:03.420 --> 3:21:07.900]  after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars
[3:21:07.900 --> 3:21:12.620]  on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well. At the same time,
[3:21:12.620 --> 3:21:18.780]  go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some
[3:21:18.780 --> 3:21:24.220]  supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need
[3:21:24.220 --> 3:21:29.340]  your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you
[3:21:29.340 --> 3:21:34.940]  don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[3:21:34.940 --> 3:21:40.700]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:40.700 --> 3:21:46.140]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[3:21:46.140 --> 3:21:51.500]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god. Thank you so much.
[3:21:51.500 --> 3:21:54.620]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[3:21:54.620 --> 3:21:59.260]  Hey Alex, welcome. I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason,
[3:21:59.260 --> 3:22:03.260]  and amongst all this stupidity. Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you
[3:22:03.260 --> 3:22:09.980]  for a year, okay? I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never
[3:22:09.980 --> 3:22:16.380]  go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[3:22:16.380 --> 3:22:22.220]  me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying,
[3:22:22.220 --> 3:22:29.100]  as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be
[3:22:29.100 --> 3:22:35.660]  afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake,
[3:22:35.660 --> 3:22:41.420]  and then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. That's
[3:22:41.420 --> 3:22:45.900]  right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country,
[3:22:45.900 --> 3:22:50.460]  no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[3:22:51.740 --> 3:22:55.100]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there,
[3:22:56.220 --> 3:23:00.860]  about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist, that if the public's so dumb down
[3:23:00.860 --> 3:23:04.060]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them,
[3:23:04.060 --> 3:23:09.420]  that we're sterilizing them, then they deserve to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the
[3:23:09.420 --> 3:23:14.460]  globalist. They play God, and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to
[3:23:14.460 --> 3:23:19.820]  us. And I've told you that the globalists who tried to hire me, they tried to get me to join them,
[3:23:19.820 --> 3:23:25.100]  but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection to God,
[3:23:25.740 --> 3:23:30.300]  and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy. But I'll tell you, at a
[3:23:30.300 --> 3:23:35.740]  selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of
[3:23:35.740 --> 3:23:39.740]  it, or believing you're getting power along with it. Whether you're just a steelworker,
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:45.900]  or a schoolteacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other people
[3:23:45.900 --> 3:23:50.620]  like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[3:23:50.620 --> 3:24:20.380]  That's a fact. I'm going to come back after this next video and talk about the cricket star who
[3:24:20.380 --> 3:24:25.900]  has been cancelled his entire career in jeopardy for tweets that he literally posted when he was
[3:24:25.900 --> 3:24:33.260]  18 years old, tweets that I've seen that were basically edgy lads banter, and he called himself
[3:24:33.260 --> 3:24:38.540]  the n-word when he was 18 on Twitter. God forbid this guy needs to be ruined for the rest of his
[3:24:38.540 --> 3:24:44.220]  life. And then it gets worse. I'm going to explain how it gets worse after that. We've also got big
[3:24:44.220 --> 3:24:52.140]  news on Black Lives Matter and the latest statue decolonization issue out of the United Kingdom.
[3:24:52.140 --> 3:24:58.140]  But first, the vaccine is being used as a tool of segregation in yet another way,
[3:24:58.140 --> 3:25:03.580]  as it relates to dating apps. And as I point out in this video, I think people who use these
[3:25:03.580 --> 3:25:09.740]  kind of dating apps, Tinder and Bumble Prime amongst them, are worrying about the wrong
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:15.740]  infection. This is dating apps allow users to reject the unvaccinated. Let's roll it. Here it is.
[3:25:17.580 --> 3:25:23.260]  Okay, have made it easier for users to reject people who haven't taken the COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:25:23.260 --> 3:25:27.020]  Some of Britain's leading dating apps are encouraging their users to display a badge
[3:25:27.020 --> 3:25:31.260]  on their profile to show they've been vaccinated against COVID, and a new partnership with the
[3:25:31.260 --> 3:25:35.980]  government aimed at boosting vaccine uptake. Badgers will enable users to quickly reject
[3:25:35.980 --> 3:25:40.460]  those who, whether out of medical necessity or personal choice, have not been vaccinated.
[3:25:40.460 --> 3:25:44.060]  Some platforms have also developed a new feature allowing users to display their
[3:25:44.060 --> 3:25:49.020]  preferences regarding social distancing and mask wearing when meeting in person,
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:54.220]  and they say romance is dead. Imagine what a joyous experience that would be. Going on a date
[3:25:54.220 --> 3:25:59.580]  with someone who refuses to remove their mask while insisting you stay at least two meters away from
[3:25:59.580 --> 3:26:04.220]  them, even though you've both had the vaccine. Bumble, the popular women first dating app,
[3:26:04.220 --> 3:26:09.180]  will enable people in the UK to add a vaccinated badge to their profiles. For those who apply the
[3:26:09.180 --> 3:26:13.420]  badge, Bumble will offer complimentary credits for premium features such as spotlights and super
[3:26:13.420 --> 3:26:17.500]  swipes. People on Bumble will also be able to share COVID preferences, letting them easily
[3:26:17.500 --> 3:26:21.660]  communicate how they are comfortable dating outdoors or indoors, how they feel about crowded
[3:26:21.660 --> 3:26:26.780]  spaces, and their expectations about masks and social distancing. Sounds like a whale of a time.
[3:26:26.780 --> 3:26:31.500]  May I suggest that if you're even using the soul-destroying relationship-ruining,
[3:26:31.500 --> 3:26:36.540]  hypergamy-inducing apps, not only are you an idiot, but I think you're worrying about the
[3:26:36.540 --> 3:26:42.460]  wrong virus. The most googled sex question in 2020 was what are the symptoms of chlamydia?
[3:26:42.460 --> 3:26:47.740]  Lovely. Google queries for STD testing near me nearly quadrupled between April 2020 and the
[3:26:47.740 --> 3:26:51.660]  end of the year. Sexually transmitted diseases hit a record high for the sixth straight year,
[3:26:51.660 --> 3:26:59.100]  with CDC researchers finding a 30% increase in STDs from 2015 to 2019. According to the latest
[3:26:59.100 --> 3:27:04.140]  data, 2.5 million Americans had either chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis infections in 2019,
[3:27:04.140 --> 3:27:11.980]  with chlamydia cases rising 61% and gonorrhea cases spiking 42% among young people aged 15-24.
[3:27:11.980 --> 3:27:16.940]  Compare this to 20 years ago, when according to researcher Paul Romaguerra, gonorrhea rates in
[3:27:16.940 --> 3:27:23.500]  the US were at historic lows, syphilis was close to elimination, and advances in chlamydia diagnostics
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:28.060]  made it easier to detect infections. Sexually transmitted diseases are also on the rise in
[3:27:28.060 --> 3:27:34.460]  the UK. And don't forget, sexual promiscuity literally increases the risk of getting cancer
[3:27:34.460 --> 3:27:39.980]  by as much as 91%. Anglia Ruskin University scientists found that many cancers such as
[3:27:39.980 --> 3:27:44.780]  cervical, prostate, and oral are linked to sexually transmitted infections. Experts found
[3:27:44.780 --> 3:27:51.180]  older women who had 10 or more lifetime lovers were 91% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer.
[3:27:51.180 --> 3:27:56.860]  So ironically, if you are dating someone you met on Tinder or Bumble, wearing a mask and staying
[3:27:56.860 --> 3:28:02.460]  as far away from them as possible might actually be a good idea. But not because of corona,
[3:28:02.460 --> 3:28:07.180]  because of the possibility that they've contracted several viruses from the dozens of people who
[3:28:07.180 --> 3:28:30.540]  they've had meaningless degrading casual sex with.
[3:28:30.540 --> 3:28:45.340]  So I mentioned how it got worse. This followed the international suspension of cricketer England
[3:28:45.340 --> 3:28:52.300]  cricketer Ollie Robinson for tweets he posted when he was 18. And I've seen the tweets and it's
[3:28:52.300 --> 3:28:59.980]  basically lads banter offensive edgy humor talking about women in a way that's a little bit misogynistic
[3:28:59.980 --> 3:29:09.020]  when you're 18, God forbid. In 2012, these tweets were posted nine years ago, nine years ago, and
[3:29:09.020 --> 3:29:15.260]  this guy's been strung up by his own criticizing authorities by the very board, the very officials
[3:29:15.260 --> 3:29:21.420]  that are supposed to represent and protect him for tweets he made when he was 18. He got an
[3:29:21.420 --> 3:29:26.540]  international suspension. His career is probably finished, probably ruined. He's been pulled out
[3:29:26.540 --> 3:29:34.620]  of the upcoming test matches. But it gets worse. Another cricketer could be about to face cancellation
[3:29:34.620 --> 3:29:42.380]  because of tweets he made when he was literally a child. Wisden.com, whoever the hell that is,
[3:29:42.380 --> 3:29:49.340]  some offense archaeology website, chose to obscure the identity of the player gracious of them.
[3:29:49.340 --> 3:29:56.060]  It was 15 at the time of the tweet. But did include details of the post, including you're
[3:29:56.060 --> 3:30:04.460]  going out with an Asian and three hashtags, Asian through and through, helio, and some C word
[3:30:04.460 --> 3:30:10.300]  that I don't even know because they asterisked it out. So he said a rude word and he's told
[3:30:10.300 --> 3:30:17.180]  someone you're going out with an Asian, when he was a 15 year old child. Oh my God, crucify him.
[3:30:17.180 --> 3:30:25.100]  So this is obviously a prominent player. They're obviously considering exposing him for his previous
[3:30:25.100 --> 3:30:30.220]  thought crimes when he was a child. But not only these offense archaeologists are considering
[3:30:30.220 --> 3:30:36.460]  exposing him, the ECB cricketing authorities are considering exposing him because they're so
[3:30:36.460 --> 3:30:45.260]  pathetic and cowed by this fringe extremist set. This woke witch hunt mob that his own
[3:30:45.260 --> 3:30:50.220]  cricketing board that's supposed to represent him is considering exposing tweets he made,
[3:30:50.220 --> 3:30:57.660]  which weren't even rude. I mean, you look at what people were tweeting in 2012. It's absolutely
[3:30:57.660 --> 3:31:02.380]  incredible. All those Hollywood producers and directors, by the way, who were literally tweeting
[3:31:02.380 --> 3:31:07.500]  about how much they loved children, like they really loved children, James Gunn and all those
[3:31:07.500 --> 3:31:13.260]  perverts. Oh, that doesn't matter. This guy told someone it's someone was going out with an Asian
[3:31:13.260 --> 3:31:19.660]  and he faces complete career ruination and cancellation. Absolutely incredible.
[3:31:21.100 --> 3:31:27.100]  What's more incredible is they're comparing it to the ISIS bride. They're literally saying, oh,
[3:31:27.100 --> 3:31:33.420]  Brits won't forgive Shamima Begum. So why should we forgive this 15 year old, whoever he is,
[3:31:33.420 --> 3:31:37.580]  and Ollie Robinson, the England cricketer? Yeah, little bit of a difference there.
[3:31:37.580 --> 3:31:43.980]  Shamima Begum literally fled to Syria to join an international terrorist group, ISIS. She literally
[3:31:43.980 --> 3:31:49.260]  pointed automatic weapons at women in Syria because they were wearing brightly colored shoes.
[3:31:50.700 --> 3:31:55.900]  And then we had this headline, ISIS bride left this one back in UK stitched explosives into
[3:31:55.900 --> 3:32:04.380]  suicide vests. She literally stitched bombs into suicide vests for ISIS terrorists to ensure that
[3:32:04.380 --> 3:32:12.060]  they exploded when taken off. The left is comparing that behavior to some 18 year old kid who called
[3:32:12.060 --> 3:32:19.820]  himself the n-word on Twitter in 2012. Yeah, totally the same, isn't it? Absolutely incredible.
[3:32:21.180 --> 3:32:26.220]  Absolutely incredible. And now they found another one who was even younger, 15 years old,
[3:32:26.860 --> 3:32:31.900]  who didn't even tweet anything that was that rude or offensive. No, forget about it. No,
[3:32:31.900 --> 3:32:38.940]  no doubt is why different standard, of course. But then he was defended by Oliver Dowden,
[3:32:38.940 --> 3:32:44.140]  who is the cultural secretary here in the United Kingdom, headliner of reclaim the net,
[3:32:44.140 --> 3:32:49.340]  ironic architect of UK online censorship bill condemns cancellation of cricket star for offensive
[3:32:49.340 --> 3:32:56.060]  tweets. This is Ollie Robinson, again, the cricketer, but the culture secretary is Oliver Dowden.
[3:32:56.060 --> 3:33:01.980]  Even after Robinson apologized for the tweets, he was still being condemned. But UK culture
[3:33:01.980 --> 3:33:07.580]  secretary Oliver Dowden responded by speaking out against the ECB's harsh punishment and tweeting,
[3:33:07.580 --> 3:33:11.100]  Ollie Robinson's tweets were offensive and wrong. They're also a decade old and written
[3:33:11.100 --> 3:33:16.220]  by a teenager. Teenager is now a man as rightly apologized, the ECB has gone over the top.
[3:33:16.940 --> 3:33:22.700]  Turns out, though, that this same individual in the government who is defending the cricketer
[3:33:22.700 --> 3:33:28.620]  is behind the online safety bill, which will block social media websites in the UK or force
[3:33:28.620 --> 3:33:34.620]  them to pay hefty fines if they fail to remove legal but harmful content, which basically means
[3:33:34.620 --> 3:33:41.180]  anything that offends anyone. So massive hypocrisy there, massive hypocrisy on comparing a cricketer
[3:33:41.180 --> 3:33:48.380]  who said a rude word in 2012 to a literal ISIS jihadist wannabe in Shemima Begum. We'll be
[3:33:48.380 --> 3:33:53.500]  right back. Don't go away. We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava
[3:33:53.500 --> 3:34:00.380]  root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[3:34:00.380 --> 3:34:05.100]  in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific
[3:34:05.100 --> 3:34:11.340]  Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:17.500]  as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator
[3:34:17.500 --> 3:34:22.540]  of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred
[3:34:22.540 --> 3:34:28.060]  ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its
[3:34:28.060 --> 3:34:34.540]  serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava

[3:35:51.500 --> 3:35:55.340]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just
[3:35:55.340 --> 3:36:01.500]  out and about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them?
[3:36:02.460 --> 3:36:06.380]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts. It's the history of
[3:36:06.380 --> 3:36:11.100]  contaminative vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe,
[3:36:11.100 --> 3:36:15.900]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines,
[3:36:15.900 --> 3:36:21.500]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites,
[3:36:21.500 --> 3:36:26.940]  Native Americans. The list goes on and on, but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress
[3:36:26.940 --> 3:36:35.580]  and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff,
[3:36:35.580 --> 3:36:39.660]  medical doctors, virologists, scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they get safe.
[3:36:39.660 --> 3:36:44.140]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in the private
[3:36:44.140 --> 3:36:47.100]  practices out there, somewhere numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking.
[3:36:47.100 --> 3:36:53.740]  That's very, very simple. There's your answer. It's not a secret why in leftist controlled cities
[3:36:53.740 --> 3:36:58.060]  all over the world, not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tents, cities as
[3:36:58.060 --> 3:37:03.340]  homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists admit
[3:37:03.340 --> 3:37:09.500]  under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[3:37:09.500 --> 3:37:12.620]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think
[3:37:12.620 --> 3:37:17.180]  of a civilization that gets better. They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively
[3:37:17.180 --> 3:37:23.260]  worse. The globalists fly around in private jets. They have huge private mistakes. They are separate
[3:37:23.260 --> 3:37:27.980]  from us. Their children go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want us to lock down,
[3:37:27.980 --> 3:37:34.300]  telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human
[3:37:34.300 --> 3:37:39.340]  infrastructure. The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been to control robot autonomous
[3:37:39.340 --> 3:37:44.700]  cars and trucks. This is all their admitted plan. The public's finally listening because the plan
[3:37:44.700 --> 3:37:49.340]  is no longer in beta. It's gone operational. It's a post-human future. You better find out about it
[3:37:49.340 --> 3:38:17.900]  right now. So these international cricketers have been engaged in this performative virtue
[3:38:17.900 --> 3:38:24.060]  signaling over the past, I guess, few months now at least, where it's a take a knee style show of
[3:38:24.060 --> 3:38:30.460]  solidarity to speak out against discrimination in the world of cricket. The only guy I see being
[3:38:30.460 --> 3:38:37.820]  discriminated against is Ollie Robinson for tweets he made 9 years ago when he was 18 years old.
[3:38:37.820 --> 3:38:42.780]  That's the only discrimination I see. The England cricket team is literally like half Muslim at this
[3:38:42.780 --> 3:38:48.140]  point. There's no racial discrimination. Everybody gets equal opportunity yet when
[3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:54.540]  offense archaeologists woke extremist mobs find his tweets from 9 years ago, he gets
[3:38:54.540 --> 3:39:00.460]  discriminated against. Now they've uncovered some from a guy when he was 15 and he's going to face
[3:39:00.460 --> 3:39:07.500]  the same punishment by the looks of it again to satiate this extremist woke mob. We have a similar
[3:39:07.500 --> 3:39:12.700]  situation in the United Kingdom with the upcoming Euro 2020 football championships
[3:39:12.700 --> 3:39:19.100]  where the England team is still a year later over a year later after the death of George Floyd
[3:39:19.740 --> 3:39:26.460]  taking a knee despite the fact that the fans are exercising their free speech in booing some of the
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:32.780]  fans at least booing the England players taking a knee. We've got this clip here from Nigel Farage.
[3:39:32.780 --> 3:39:37.180]  I'm going to come back and talk about it afterwards because this tournament is going to go on for
[3:39:37.180 --> 3:39:42.220]  the next three, four weeks. England if they get through the group stage they could play three, four,
[3:39:42.220 --> 3:39:47.020]  five, six games in this tournament. They're going to be booed by some sections of the fans at every
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:51.980]  single turn. The idiotic manager Gareth Southgate has come out and said they're still going to
[3:39:51.980 --> 3:39:56.940]  continue doing it despite the fact that as everybody with an ounce of common sense knows
[3:39:56.940 --> 3:40:04.380]  it's an explicitly political statement that endorsers supports Black Lives Matter specifically
[3:40:04.380 --> 3:40:09.980]  yet they're still claiming it's just some vague equality performative thing. It isn't. We all
[3:40:09.980 --> 3:40:15.100]  know what it means. Is Nigel Farage talking about that? We'll come back and talk about the latest
[3:40:15.100 --> 3:40:21.020]  on this after Farage. Here it is. Well a great summer of sport coming up which is wonderful after
[3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:28.860]  lockdown. All sorts going on. The Derby, the Open Golf, Wimbledon and of course Euro 2021
[3:40:28.860 --> 3:40:34.300]  which will excite tens of millions of people in this country as it always does. But I have a fear
[3:40:34.300 --> 3:40:39.500]  that Gareth Southgate the England football manager is putting himself out of touch with his own fans
[3:40:39.500 --> 3:40:45.260]  and with the country. Now look we know he's got a lot of Black players in his team. We also know
[3:40:45.260 --> 3:40:51.260]  that footballers receive a huge amount of abuse for whatever reason and I've no doubt that some of
[3:40:51.260 --> 3:40:57.420]  it is racial and unpleasant and the players absolutely hate it. But what Southgate has done
[3:40:57.420 --> 3:41:03.180]  is fallen into the trap of saying he's keener for the England players to take the knee than ever.
[3:41:03.180 --> 3:41:09.100]  We are collectively really disappointed that it happened. We are totally united on it. We're totally
[3:41:10.700 --> 3:41:17.820]  committed to supporting each other. We feel that more than ever determined to take the knee
[3:41:17.820 --> 3:41:23.900]  through this tournament. We accept that there might be an adverse reaction and we're just going to
[3:41:23.900 --> 3:41:29.500]  ignore that and move forward. Now in the last two games including tonight against Romania,
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:41.420]  as they take the knee before the game the fans are booing. Is that because they're insulting
[3:41:41.420 --> 3:41:46.380]  the Black members of the team? No, not a bit of it. It's because the great British public have
[3:41:46.380 --> 3:41:51.900]  sussed it. They've woken up to the fact that taking the knee to the Black Lives Matter organisation
[3:41:51.900 --> 3:42:00.460]  isn't about equality of opportunity, isn't about racial justice. It's about a Marxist organisation
[3:42:00.460 --> 3:42:06.060]  that wants to defund the police force, that wants to bring down Western capitalism, bring down our
[3:42:06.060 --> 3:42:13.500]  whole way of life and replace it with a new communist order. Over 100 years ago in Russia
[3:42:13.500 --> 3:42:20.220]  class division was used as a means of fermenting the 1917 revolution and bringing about the
[3:42:20.220 --> 3:42:24.460]  wonderful new communist state that finished up of course being one of the most monstrous
[3:42:24.460 --> 3:42:30.860]  the world has ever seen. Now they're using race as a means not to bring people together
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:35.660]  but actually to divide people and the soccer fans have woken up to this and they're booing
[3:42:35.660 --> 3:42:41.180]  loudly and they will go on booing loudly all summer. Go Southgate and some of the England
[3:42:41.180 --> 3:42:46.780]  team just don't seem to understand what's really going on here. Now in a way why should they?
[3:42:46.780 --> 3:42:51.340]  They're not political figures, they're not public affairs commentators, you know they are professional
[3:42:51.340 --> 3:42:57.500]  footballers and a very very good and professional manager but the moral of the story is very very
[3:42:57.500 --> 3:43:04.940]  simple. All sporting teams, all sporting events should stay completely out of politics, not get
[3:43:04.940 --> 3:43:11.500]  engaged with any political gestures of any kind whatsoever, no good can come of it and I fear
[3:43:11.500 --> 3:43:17.100]  we're headed for a summer where England football fans and their own team are going to find themselves
[3:43:17.100 --> 3:43:23.020]  in opposition to each other. It makes no sense and I would urge Gareth Southgate please just
[3:43:23.020 --> 3:43:29.580]  read the website of Black Lives Matter just understand what it's all about and commit yourself
[3:43:29.580 --> 3:43:35.180]  to getting on with producing a great football team and not getting involved in politics at all.
[3:43:35.180 --> 3:43:42.060]  Please Gareth do it otherwise we're in for a really really horrible divisive few weeks.
[3:43:43.340 --> 3:43:47.900]  So there you have it England fans should continue to boo players taking the knee because it is
[3:43:47.900 --> 3:43:54.380]  explicitly political cricket fans should continue to boo or at least start to boo this show of
[3:43:54.380 --> 3:43:59.820]  solidarity which again is basically the same thing. What it actually means is empowering it
[3:43:59.820 --> 3:44:05.740]  and satiating this extremist woke mob to cancel people for literal teenage tweets while on the
[3:44:05.740 --> 3:44:10.540]  other hand they say we should all apologize and accept back into the country Shemima Begum
[3:44:10.540 --> 3:44:17.180]  someone who literally joined ISIS and sold explosives into suicide vests. Yeah we should
[3:44:17.180 --> 3:44:23.100]  accept her back we should forgive her for her behavior oh but this 15 year old with his edgy
[3:44:23.100 --> 3:44:29.820]  tweets I mean my god he said you went out with an asian how dare he that's totally comparable
[3:44:29.820 --> 3:44:35.660]  what right no it isn't not on any same level whatsoever so continue to boo taking the knee.
[3:44:36.300 --> 3:44:41.260]  Headline of RT X Man United Captain Ferdinand Black Lives Matter kneeling is nothing to do
[3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:47.740]  with politics there's no valid reason for booze no they only literally desecrate war memorials
[3:44:47.740 --> 3:44:52.060]  and statues they only literally on their own website called for the destruction of the nuclear
[3:44:52.060 --> 3:44:58.300]  family the end of capitalism their founder Patrice Callors the woman who just got caught
[3:44:58.300 --> 3:45:03.740]  spending millions of dollars on luxury properties in mainly white areas literally says that her
[3:45:03.740 --> 3:45:10.060]  inspiration her guru her guru for founding Black Lives Matter was a Marxist terrorist a convicted
[3:45:10.060 --> 3:45:17.980]  cop killer who is a fugitive now in Cuba but it's not political at all yeah okay meanwhile
[3:45:17.980 --> 3:45:25.420]  friends of BLM activists shot in the head by four black gang members refused to talk to police
[3:45:25.420 --> 3:45:30.300]  to help find killers critics have slammed the friends of Black Lives Matter activists Sasha
[3:45:30.300 --> 3:45:34.300]  Johnson it was shot in the head by a gang of four black men after they appeared to care little
[3:45:34.300 --> 3:45:40.220]  about her life by refusing to talk to police to help convict the killers don't really care about
[3:45:40.220 --> 3:45:45.740]  her black life by the sounds of it do they Johnson was left in critical condition after
[3:45:45.740 --> 3:45:50.060]  being shot during a late night party in south London last month it appears as though she was
[3:45:50.060 --> 3:45:56.860]  caught in the middle of a gunfight between rival gangs and they literally said in the hours in the
[3:45:56.860 --> 3:46:02.540]  first two days after this was reported that she was targeted that she was shot in the head because
[3:46:02.540 --> 3:46:08.380]  she was a Black Lives Matter activist literal Labour MPs tweeting this with no information
[3:46:08.380 --> 3:46:14.220]  whatsoever the next day it comes out it's a gang hit she wasn't even the target of it she was caught
[3:46:14.220 --> 3:46:19.900]  in the crossfire but it was a gang of four black men attacking another gang in south London
[3:46:20.780 --> 3:46:26.460]  one of them has been charged the other three have been freed on bail so the police need to
[3:46:26.460 --> 3:46:32.860]  collect more evidence to convict these other murderers but the black friends of Sasha Johnson who
[3:46:32.860 --> 3:46:40.060]  were at this party last month don't want to talk to the police they don't seem to care about Black
[3:46:40.060 --> 3:46:45.980]  Lives anymore or more specifically they don't seem to care about Black Lives when they're taken
[3:46:45.980 --> 3:46:53.100]  by other black people only white people only white cops I had a friend send me a message on
[3:46:53.100 --> 3:46:59.980]  WhatsApp about two hours ago he lives in Crouch and London which is a big lefty area but it's also
[3:46:59.980 --> 3:47:06.300]  very you know well-to-do gentrified middle class and he said there's lips at someone's literally
[3:47:06.300 --> 3:47:11.340]  being shot in the head right outside my house he sent me a bunch of photographs this wasn't even
[3:47:11.340 --> 3:47:16.300]  reported in the media at the time I don't know if it is even now and again the victim was Black
[3:47:16.300 --> 3:47:21.260]  the perpetrators are Black is Black Lives Matter UK going to come out with a statement on that
[3:47:21.260 --> 3:47:27.500]  did they come out with a statement decrying the four black gang members that shot Sasha Johnson
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:33.660]  no they said absolutely nothing as they do every single time because they only care about Black
[3:47:33.660 --> 3:47:39.420]  Lives when they're taken by white people which is kind of rare given that 90% of black people are
[3:47:39.420 --> 3:47:46.300]  killed by other black people meanwhile Hartlepool's monkey statue to be given an explanatory sign to
[3:47:46.300 --> 3:47:52.060]  avoid offending visitors council leaders in Hartlepool have decided that a plaque must be placed on
[3:47:52.060 --> 3:47:57.820]  its famous monkey statue this is an actual news story by the way not the Babylon Bee to explain
[3:47:57.820 --> 3:48:01.740]  its origins in case people are offended by it following the Black Lives Matter protests and
[3:48:01.740 --> 3:48:08.140]  scrutiny over statues who are they pandering to who would be offended by a statue of a monkey which
