[00:40.280 --> 00:45.240]  studio coming up in the last hour in the second hour we're going to go to an interview with
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.000]  Syrian girl who's going to talk about ISIS the airstrikes questioning are they actually having
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.160]  an effect on killing ISIS members it appears that the opposite is the case ISIS is advancing
[00:57.160 --> 01:03.080]  we're also going to talk about Gamergate which is this basically huge open conspiracy within
[01:03.080 --> 01:09.760]  the video games industry where social engineers and feminists have infiltrated video game making
[01:09.760 --> 01:15.720]  companies and the video game media to implant messages of social engineering it's kind of a
[01:15.720 --> 01:20.160]  topic that's bubbled under the surface a little bit over the past month but we're going to get
[01:20.160 --> 01:25.760]  into it with Syrian girl we've also got a tribute to Stan Monteith coming up at the bottom of the
[01:25.760 --> 01:31.200]  hour so be sure to stay tuned for that the latest news surrounding Ebola of course the
[01:31.200 --> 01:37.760]  CDC's response goes from concerning to dam right alarming we've got a top story on info wars dot
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.160]  com right now Ebola patients family under armed quarantine this just came out around about 30
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.160]  minutes ago at the Associated Press originally basically the family of the Ebola patient in
[01:49.160 --> 01:55.160]  Dallas tried to escape the apartment in which they're being quarantined obviously because of
[01:55.160 --> 02:00.440]  their exposure potential exposure to the Ebola virus so we've got that story up on info wars
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.120]  dot com coming up now after the break we're going to play this clip from Anderson Cooper and this
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.280]  is just again astounding he interviews the partner of the Ebola victim who's still obviously hold
[02:12.280 --> 02:18.080]  up there in the apartment in Dallas and she basically tells him the CDC gave them no advice no
[02:18.080 --> 02:26.040]  information whatsoever on how to deal with the vomit diarrhea sweat stained Ebola bedsheets of
[02:26.040 --> 02:31.880]  this Ebola victim who had been staying in that apartment of course for days after he had contracted
[02:31.880 --> 02:38.560]  the virus so we've got that clip coming up again absolute incompetence on behalf of the CDC it
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.920]  goes from bad to worse there's there's a CNN story frustrated woman quarantined with sheets
[02:42.920 --> 02:49.160]  towels soiled by Ebola patient we've got that clip coming up after the break from CNN you've
[02:49.160 --> 02:56.520]  got to see this also out of Breitbart today co-workers of US Ebola patient he knew he was
[02:56.520 --> 03:02.080]  death he knew he had Ebola he was desperate to survive now a couple of days ago I made the
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.760]  comment that this guy could have been an Ebola tourist he could have been coming to the US
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.680]  specifically to get treatment in the knowledge that he wouldn't get such treatment in Africa of
[03:11.680 --> 03:17.840]  course where they're completely overwhelmed with the spread of Ebola well over 3000 people dead
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.920]  now as a result of this outbreak the hospitals cannot take any more patients we've seen videos
[03:22.920 --> 03:28.760]  of people dying on the street so now the boss of this Ebola victim who came into Dallas is
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.400]  based basically saying quote if he were in Liberia he was going to surely die saying he was glad
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.360]  that Duncan was in a country with adequate medical resources so he's basically making the point that
[03:39.360 --> 03:46.600]  in a quote desperate attempt to survive the Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan came into Dallas
[03:46.600 --> 03:53.800]  deliberately to get treatment that he knew he wouldn't get back in Liberia also shocking story
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.560]  that I put out last night shock image shows unprotected workers cleaning up Ebola vomit in
[03:59.560 --> 04:08.320]  Dallas now this is a shot an image out of a HD chopper a crew from WFAA and this shows the
[04:08.320 --> 04:14.360]  workers cleaning up the sidewalk outside the apartment where the Ebola victim stayed where
[04:14.360 --> 04:20.320]  he vomited on the sidewalk now it's not clear whether they're actually cleaning up the Ebola vomit
[04:20.320 --> 04:26.040]  but they're in the area they're cleaning the sidewalk where this patient stumbled and fell
[04:26.040 --> 04:31.880]  before he got into the ambulance and was taken to the Texas Presbyterian Hospital so obviously no
[04:31.880 --> 04:38.200]  protection whatsoever and we're going to delve more into that more into CDC incompetence with this
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.800]  Ebola situation after the break the news is all circulating around this apartment where the family
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.400]  members are currently quarantine Syrian girl coming up second hour David Knight third hour we've

[08:16.240 --> 08:17.640]  radio network
[08:31.640 --> 08:37.400]  the fact live on the Friday edition of the Alex Jones show big story just posted up on the
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.360]  south-west hand side of the drudge report patient with Ebola-like symptoms being treated at Howard
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.760]  University Hospital in DC so again of course yesterday and the day before we had potential
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.240]  cases in Hawaii and Utah they turned out to be negative but now they're saying patient with
[08:52.240 --> 08:58.280]  Ebola-like symptoms is being treated at Howard University Hospital in DC a hospital spokesperson
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.720]  confirmed late Friday morning the patient had traveled to Nigeria recently that person has
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.360]  been admitted to the hospital in stable condition and is being isolated and tested the medical team
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.680]  is working with the CDC to determine whether the patient has Ebola so another potential case
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.360]  there we've seen others turn out to be negative hopefully that's the case again but we've also
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.600]  received reports calls to other shows and I saw this story out a couple of days ago again
[09:26.600 --> 09:32.840]  unconfirmed but the people in Dallas are receiving phone calls from health authorities whether that
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.640]  be the CDC or emergency managers who were living in the immediate area surrounding the apartment
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.960]  where the Ebola victim lived and they're being told to either stay indoors or are being given
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.440]  advice on how to spot potential symptoms of Ebola and how to protect themselves so again
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.440]  that's unconfirmed but later we'll take calls hopefully people from Dallas can call in and
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.680]  tell us if they've had any information on that if they've received any such calls I know a
[09:58.680 --> 10:05.720]  couple of days ago there were reports of robo calls coming in from the CDC to residents in Dallas
[10:05.720 --> 10:13.040]  warning them about precautions to take regarding Ebola so we'll continue to track that now this
[10:13.040 --> 10:18.920]  apartment which the news seems to be centering centering around today where the Ebola victim
[10:18.920 --> 10:24.040]  stayed right before he was taken to hospital after obviously having been sent back home from
[10:24.040 --> 10:30.800]  hospital two days prior having been given antibiotics article up on info wars dot com
[10:30.800 --> 10:36.640]  right now from mackayle failen here sheriff's officers fearful after being ordered into quarantine
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.440]  Ebola apartment five employees with the Dallas County Sheriff's Department entered the quarantine
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.760]  department of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan Wednesday night after being ordered to bring
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.760]  his four family members a court order barring them from leaving their home the five who were
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.320]  ordered to enter the residence by Sheriff Lupe Valdes were joined by a doctor and the head of
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.160]  the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department the incident was learned after
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.480]  the sheriff's deputies noticed the squad cars used by the five being taken out of service
[11:04.480 --> 11:11.080]  unexpectedly the following morning and we can get into this further actually in a in a separate
[11:11.080 --> 11:17.840]  article here's the quote actually this is from Sheriff's Association President Christopher
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.960]  Dyer who said the sheriff's members were uneasy at best having been told to enter this potentially
[11:23.960 --> 11:30.120]  Ebola infected apartment my concern is for the deputies in their family said Dyer and I want
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.800]  to see Dallas County do everything that they can to alleviate their concerns my anger is really
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.600]  with the feds Dyer said let's move that family let's move everybody out of that building I don't
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.960]  care if it's overkill let's do overkill I don't think sending a few deputies in there is the
[11:44.960 --> 11:53.000]  right course of action and if you look at this tweet from Scott Gordon out of NBC five here four
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.560]  sheriff's deputies health director doctor went into a bowl of victims apartment without protection
[11:58.560 --> 12:05.400]  last night sheriff's association says then I actually have an image here on the desk of three
[12:05.400 --> 12:13.680]  individuals waiting to enter the potentially Ebola infected apartment obviously wearing no
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.800]  protection whatsoever it's not clear whether these are involved with the law enforcement
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.840]  authorities that entered that apartment but again it shows you the complete lack of protection
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.240]  that's being taken given the knowledge that this Ebola sufferer was in that apartment for a matter
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.960]  of days we're going to go to this Anderson Cooper clip now which is an interview with the partner of
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.560]  the Ebola victim just listen to what the CDC told her or what they didn't tell her about how to
[12:43.560 --> 12:50.360]  deal with the bedsheets with the towels that this Ebola victim had used before he was taken to
[12:50.360 --> 12:56.760]  hospital let's go to the clip so that was the first time they mentioned to you Ebola when you
[12:56.760 --> 13:07.480]  heard that what did you think when you were caring for him did you get in contact with any fluids
[13:07.480 --> 13:23.280]  that I know of did the CDC recommend that you clean your apartment the mattresses on my bed and
[13:23.280 --> 13:44.080]  so the sheets that Thomas used and the towels that he used what have you done with those
[13:44.080 --> 13:56.200]  we are in the plastic bag in your apartment so you put you took them off the bed you and put
[13:56.200 --> 14:10.560]  them into a plastic bag so the sheets that he used that he slept on that's still on the bed
[14:10.560 --> 14:32.080]  how are you coping with this depending on God to save your life so you feel like people are not
[14:32.080 --> 14:36.160]  informed about how you actually get Ebola you actually have to come in contact with the body
[14:36.160 --> 14:47.520]  fluids of somebody who is not only infected but actually sick with Ebola right and so we and at
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.080]  this point even if you had Ebola you're not showing any signs so you would not be able to
[14:52.080 --> 15:03.680]  infect anybody else and and you want to get that message across okay that was Anderson
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.760]  Cooper last night interviewing the partner of the Ebola victim who stayed there in the Dallas
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.400]  apartment she's calling for them to leave her kids alone actually it appears this morning tried
[15:12.400 --> 15:18.720]  to escape from the apartment and now they're under armed guard but of course the key thing to come
[15:18.720 --> 15:24.920]  out of that clip was the CDC basically gave them no advice whatsoever on how to deal with these
[15:24.920 --> 15:34.000]  diarrhea sweat potentially blood vomit stained Ebola bedsheets as well as the towels that were
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.360]  being used by this Ebola victim and the days before he was taken to hospital and then letting
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.520]  people into this apartment with no protection whatsoever if you go back to the document cam
[15:44.520 --> 15:51.440]  this is an image and it was in a daily mail article of individuals being let into this
[15:51.440 --> 15:58.840]  apartment obviously not even wearing face masks never mind any kind of bio suits which is interesting
[15:58.840 --> 16:04.560]  because as we'll get on to shortly the hazmat teams which cleaned the apartment last night and
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.680]  there are conflicting reports on this CNN reported this morning that they hadn't actually cleaned
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.400]  the apartment yet but bright bar is citing another source which says that the hazmat teams
[16:13.400 --> 16:19.800]  went in there last night to clean the apartment they were wearing full bio suits and yet here's
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.080]  the image of them being let into the apartment other individuals there's the article out of
[16:24.080 --> 16:30.200]  bright bar you scroll down it says that they're wearing full bio suits the quote is all employees
[16:30.200 --> 16:37.160]  entering the apartment unit will be fully dressed in bio suits and then you switch back to the
[16:37.160 --> 16:43.040]  article last night which is up on info wars dot com this is the cleaning crew that arrived at the
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.560]  Dallas apartment yesterday I believe to clean the sidewalk where the Ebola victim had spilled
[16:49.560 --> 16:54.640]  out of his apartment before getting into the ambulance to go to the Dallas hospital and I
[16:54.640 --> 17:01.160]  witnessed told NBC News that the Ebola victim had vomited on the sidewalk and yet there are these
[17:01.160 --> 17:09.600]  two guys wearing not even face masks pressure washing the Ebola sick from the sidewalk with
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.920]  no protective suits whatsoever and obviously potentially putting at risk the other people
[17:14.920 --> 17:20.440]  who live around that apartment in that apartment block absolutely amazing we've also got a story
[17:20.440 --> 17:27.880]  here again out of info wars dot com by Steve Watson Dallas paramedics slams health officials was
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.160]  not informed of Ebola diagnosis drove contaminated ambulance for two days so this is one of the
[17:34.160 --> 17:39.440]  individuals who picked up the Ebola victim in the ambulance which is again was used for a
[17:39.440 --> 17:44.880]  period of two days afterwards he's saying reports of officials tracking those potentially
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.920]  contaminated are quote bull crap paramedics who attended to the Ebola diagnosed patient in
[17:50.920 --> 17:57.680]  Dallas were not contacted by hospital officials local or state health officials or the CDC to
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.360]  inform them that they were driving around in an ambulance that could be contaminated with the
[18:02.360 --> 18:09.400]  infectious virus and again we have the quotes here none of them have been contacted none of the
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.960]  paramedics that were on that shift and went in the ambulance were contacted I've been off three
[18:14.960 --> 18:22.600]  days now no one contacted me and I was in and drove the ambulance after it was infected this was
[18:22.600 --> 18:27.000]  one of the guys who actually drove the ambulance this is definitely a concern and exposed workers
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.120]  have not been contacted or tested I had to call into control in Dallas at 8 p.m. and complain to
[18:34.120 --> 18:40.560]  get evaluated three days after the fact I had to demand exposure testing and they are reporting
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.800]  following up with all the people in the ambulance bull crap they haven't even followed up with
[18:44.800 --> 18:52.240]  10 firefighters that were on duty Sunday so what on earth is the CDC doing they're not even
[18:52.240 --> 18:57.760]  informing the people within the Ebola infected apartment on how to take proper precautions
[18:57.760 --> 19:03.640]  to clean it it took them days to send out cleaners to clean the surrounding area of the
[19:03.640 --> 19:08.480]  apartment they were wearing no protection whatsoever finally according to some reports the
[19:08.480 --> 19:14.560]  hazmat teams went in there last night but again they're letting people into this apartment block
[19:14.560 --> 19:21.200]  with no protection whatsoever and now it appears that this Ebola victim deliberately traveled
[19:21.200 --> 19:27.160]  to the United States in order to get treatment now you see the article out of WFAA with the
[19:27.160 --> 19:34.640]  sheriff's complaining they entered the quarantined apartment by order now they're on leave they're
[19:34.640 --> 19:42.160]  complaining basically that they were put in harm's way with no protection whatsoever amazing
[19:42.160 --> 19:48.960]  incompetence on behalf of the CDC we'll cover it more after the break we've got Syrian girl
[19:48.960 --> 19:53.560]  coming up in the second hour to talk about ISIS gonna talk about the jobs figures as well
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.560]  but they're not telling you about that this is the Alex Jones show live will be right back

[24:29.120 --> 24:35.400]  who sadly passed away a few days ago so we've got that coming up currently focusing on the
[24:35.400 --> 24:40.320]  latest Ebola news we've got this story again out of info wars dot com Texas health officials
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.760]  have yet to clean Ebola patients home despite protocol now this was yesterday afternoon
[24:45.760 --> 24:52.000]  so we called the CDC yesterday afternoon and said why hasn't the potentially Ebola infected
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.240]  department been cleaned the CDC told us an official told us that it should have absolutely
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.360]  have been cleaned and yet according to reports on CNN this morning it still hasn't been cleaned
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.240]  Breitbart is saying that hazmat teams cleaned it last night so that still remains up in
[25:10.240 --> 25:17.120]  the air they see the article out of info wars dot com and yet the CDC in all its wisdom
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.360]  is not blocking flights they refuse to block any flights coming in from West Africa the
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.960]  screening measures in the airport so you see CDC argues against shutting down air travel
[25:27.960 --> 25:35.160]  from Africa to stop Ebola they've refused to take that direct action the screening measures
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.520]  in the airports are completely useless basically as an article out today which argues that Ebola
[25:41.520 --> 25:47.920]  sufferers who take ibuprofen could fool these temperature detectors there in the airports
[25:47.920 --> 25:52.880]  so I mean they've not only dropped the ball they've put a lot of people at risk and the
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.400]  question is who's going to be fired people within the CDC need to be fired for this this
[25:58.400 --> 26:04.880]  guy was allowed to walk around for days afterwards the response from the CDC has been alarming
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.720]  absolutely alarming you would think they would take all measures to get this under control
[26:09.720 --> 26:15.400]  yet you know they send two guys with with caps we're not even face mask to pressure wash
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.760]  Ebola vomit off the pavement outside of the apartment they're letting sheriff's deputies
[26:20.760 --> 26:26.720]  into the apartment obviously against their will to take a court order to hand a court
[26:26.720 --> 26:30.440]  order to the family the family are now trying to escape the apartment they've got them under
[26:30.440 --> 26:35.920]  armed guard and we don't even know if it's been cleaned or not if it's been sanitized
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.600]  as you know whether the surrounding area has been sanitized absolute incompetence on every
[26:41.600 --> 26:47.200]  single level and somebody needs to be fired here we see out of Breitbart hazmat team arrives
[26:47.200 --> 26:55.320]  to decontaminate Dallas Ebola apartment now unlike the the vomit cleaning crew yesterday
[26:55.320 --> 27:02.240]  who pressure washed the sidewalk with no protection whatsoever this article says all employees
[27:02.240 --> 27:08.040]  entering the apartment will be fully dressed in bio suits so why wasn't that same advice
[27:08.040 --> 27:14.520]  given to the sheriff's deputies who were forced to enter the Ebola apartment yesterday why
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.080]  wasn't it given to the original cleaning crews that cleaned up the sidewalk they see sheriff's
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.840]  officers fearful after being ordered into quarantine Ebola apartment they've now been
[27:23.840 --> 27:31.280]  placed on leave this is not just a failure to communicate this is completely ridiculous
[27:31.280 --> 27:34.720]  and people's jobs need to be put on the line for the time I mean look at that ridiculous
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.600]  image that came out of WFA yesterday we have this out of the London independent treating
[27:40.600 --> 27:46.720]  it somewhat more seriously Ebola virus pandemic should be treated the same way as threat posed
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.400]  by nuclear weapons security officials say is that the independent the Ebola virus spreading
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.200]  exponentially across Africa and killing thousands of people will get worse the government has
[27:58.200 --> 28:03.240]  admitted a mid-calls for the full involvement of the international military to contain the
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.880]  disease the statement from European leadership network signed by five former UK defence secretary
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.240]  stated that Ebola was clearly outstripping the ability of health care systems and workers
[28:14.240 --> 28:20.520]  to respond so they're calling for an international military response to the crisis and yet the
[28:20.520 --> 28:27.440]  CDC is letting two guys with a pressure washer handle the Ebola vomit on the sidewalk it's
[28:27.440 --> 28:33.960]  completely ridiculous we have this article posted up on prisonplanet.com today there
[28:33.960 --> 28:40.280]  are only 19 level four bio containment beds in the whole of the United States and four
[28:40.280 --> 28:47.000]  in the UK the UK is well set for an Ebola outbreak we have two yes that's right two
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.280]  isolation units and one is getting redeveloped so if Ebola hits the UK they have one isolation
[28:54.280 --> 29:03.280]  unit that could properly contain one Ebola patient the United States has 19 level four
[29:03.280 --> 29:12.640]  bio containment beds for 317 million people so Lizzie Bennett of the underground medic
[29:12.640 --> 29:17.280]  comments I think we just found out why the government are underplaying the situation they simply
[29:17.280 --> 29:24.640]  do not have the facilities to cope with even a small outbreak so it seems that the preparations
[29:24.640 --> 29:29.720]  in the UK and the United States are just as bad as the situation in Africa where they're
[29:29.720 --> 29:33.520]  completely overwhelmed it's it really seems like we're not prepared for this and it's
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.280]  becoming very alarming the incompetent response from the CDC we'll be back after the break

[35:56.480 --> 36:00.760]  what's happening in iraq and what's happening here and about the big picture but i talked
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.480]  to him before the break i said people care about you and we need to talk about it and
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.760]  discuss it so doctor stan montice thank you so much for coming on whether it's my friend
[36:09.760 --> 36:15.520]  and we just are really thankful for all you've done how many years have you been fighting
[36:15.520 --> 36:23.520]  the new world order i know it's over 40 isn't it started 1962 so it's been 52 years 52 okay
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.560]  i was going off an old bio so 52 tell folks a little bit about yourself because and then
[36:28.560 --> 36:32.720]  tell folks about what you're going through right now well basically uh that's the number
[36:32.720 --> 36:38.040]  tired or three thirds and i do five hours to talk radio five days a week and what a
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.320]  privilege it is to get the information out now as far as my illness is concerned i have
[36:42.320 --> 36:50.640]  a t-cell lymphoma which of course i had no idea until suddenly the lymph nodes came
[36:50.640 --> 36:59.120]  up all over but fortunately uh why we have here in tata crews some excellent conventional
[36:59.120 --> 37:05.440]  doctors tied in the Stanford and they started me on chemotherapy and all the lymph nodes
[37:05.440 --> 37:12.280]  are gone now i also certainly am taking the finest alternative medicine and we have several
[37:12.280 --> 37:17.160]  friends i've known for many years one of them dr buzzer playlock i think he's the finest
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.560]  alternative medical specialist in the country and he's outlined a program for me of alternative
[37:22.560 --> 37:28.600]  treatment and i'm i'm i'm god is the optimistic about it what's going to happen all we can
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.360]  do is wait and see and pray it's really in god's hands but we do cover the prayers of
[37:33.360 --> 37:39.560]  your listeners alex and hope that people if god wants me here for another three or four
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.920]  or five years why there will be here i really sort of want to see what's happening because
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.920]  we are entering a a very very difficult time and i'm really very very concerned about what's
[37:50.920 --> 37:55.720]  going on over there in the middle east and let me just comment on that basically what
[37:55.720 --> 38:02.680]  you are seeing in the middle east today i'll with this the war in iraq i is exactly what
[38:02.680 --> 38:09.400]  we saw during the second world war i don't want to be what am i talking about well basically
[38:09.400 --> 38:15.320]  well we are funding the shia mausoleum in iraq we are funding the sunni mausoleum in iraq
[38:15.320 --> 38:22.080]  we're funding both sides and it really doesn't make sense that you understand world war two
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.920]  and this is one of my recent studies and the most frightening thing is the realization
[38:27.920 --> 38:34.160]  that we funded the nazis all during world war two just like anthony sutton the congressional
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.240]  hearings confirm what mccarty has said the soviets were funded all along by the robber
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.480]  barons even during the vietnam war that's all declassified now our own government put
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.400]  mausoleum in to kill 80 plus million of his own people it's the globalist above the nations
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.000]  playing them off against each other absolutely we funded both sides during the vietnam war
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.960]  but for more than that we funded the nazis during the second world war and basically
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.920]  the information is there other books have been written by responsible people after they
[39:06.920 --> 39:12.640]  thought about this and at the time it just didn't make any sense but now there's a fellow
[39:12.640 --> 39:19.400]  named john law this is what the book called america's nazi secrets and john has had a
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.360]  security clearance three levels above top secret that's right he's at the highest levels
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.640]  of the justice department and in national security with the fbi we've had him on the
[39:29.640 --> 39:35.520]  show and he's confirmed that it wasn't just a rat line that the nazis were fully in a
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.720]  double deal with the west well you know about the McCormick-dickstein committee they tried
[39:39.720 --> 39:45.200]  to overthrow the u.s. in the mid-30s but smithley butler blew the whistle on them we almost
[39:45.200 --> 39:52.560]  went under not even a nazi regime but under you a eugenics regime funded by the globalist
[39:52.560 --> 39:57.000]  but then the globalist double crossed the nazis themselves that's why hitler was on
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.560]  the cover of time magazine twice as man of the year as a great guy well you know most
[40:02.560 --> 40:09.360]  one of the most incredible stories is of the escape of a dog something else i would say
[40:09.360 --> 40:15.920]  that there's no one person that follows in america who believe that a dog that there didn't
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.240]  die in the bumper there in berlin i mean we've been told that for years and yet of course
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.520]  i've actually talked to at least three men who've been to south america who talked to
[40:26.520 --> 40:34.040]  the people who took care of a dog hitler till he died it went up and now in 1965 a dog hitler
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.920]  was allowed to escape to south america he had even lived there comfortably you know for
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.440]  a number of years for almost 20 years after the war ended and the fact that they've been
[40:44.440 --> 40:49.840]  able to conceal that information from the american people is simply a reflection of the degree
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.040]  of control that exists over almost every means of dissemination of information in the united
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.720]  states except for alternative media which is what you do so well i mean this is the
[41:01.720 --> 41:08.040]  most amazing story we have actually several books written by people who have looked into
[41:08.040 --> 41:13.080]  this and what has written i'm sure you know dr. Jerome christy and he's certainly a very
[41:13.080 --> 41:18.000]  reliable harvard train a person who writes for war on that daily and he's written a book
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.160]  on if there's escape there's another one called the gray wolf another one called written
[41:23.160 --> 41:29.560]  by a fellow named shark who writes the shark hunters and basically aid office or escape
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.560]  now if that is true that it means that almost everything we have been told by the media
[41:34.560 --> 41:40.800]  through the years is a lie and as you and i both know it is a lie and if until we get
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.120]  the american people to understand we're going to lie to and we are being lied to nothing's
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.800]  going to change but if we're going to turn this thing around we're going to have to
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.040]  get people informed and then they're going to have to get involved and one of the biggest
[41:54.040 --> 42:01.160]  problems is alex is that the average individual well he may vote or he may not vote and he's
[42:01.160 --> 42:07.800]  going to tell other people but people have to start getting involved in the local political
[42:07.800 --> 42:11.800]  system in their communities we're going to have to take america back from the bottom
[42:11.800 --> 42:17.400]  up because there's control from the top down and basically the other side's working every
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.880]  day our people don't even want to spend one night a week involved i mean i would say
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.960]  that every one of your listeners you've got to get started today putting it at least
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.640]  one day a week in the political process locally supporting the local politicians who are honest
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.000]  get rid of the local politicians who are bad contribute your money help get the information
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.320]  out start talking to people and get them involved in the political process and simply change
[42:45.320 --> 42:51.400]  our entire local structure we need to change our voices supervisors i said he counsels
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.360]  our school boards and we need to start taking america back and if we don't do it we're going
[42:56.360 --> 43:01.240]  to lose my default and well undoubtedly there wasn't for you and so many others that came
[43:01.240 --> 43:05.080]  before you in the last 52 years that you've been fighting they would have already gotten
[43:05.080 --> 43:11.160]  their program through but in their globalist own words they admit they're trying to create
[43:11.160 --> 43:16.880]  an artificial synthetic reality for us right encapsulated where everything's basically
[43:16.880 --> 43:25.360]  like time square with their disinformation overthrowing reality so they can sell us on
[43:25.360 --> 43:31.680]  all the unnatural things they want to do they want to play god and when you find out that
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.080]  all the major things we've been told are a lie and you look at how anti human the controllers
[43:38.080 --> 43:44.960]  are you come to realization that they are a cultist and i know in your book bestseller
[43:44.960 --> 43:49.680]  brotherhood of darkness that world net daily and others help put out that that you break
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.960]  this down all these different cults all these different groups skull and bones the illuminati
[43:54.960 --> 44:01.360]  you name it they're all really satellites of the same fellow traveler system doctor can
[44:01.360 --> 44:05.440]  you speak to the brotherhood of darkness and what their goal is well basically you know
[44:05.440 --> 44:10.040]  how do you make any sense out of what's going on people will always tell you the enemy communism
[44:10.040 --> 44:17.440]  and no we find out how many of the deception of the enemy's fascism and the Nazis or and
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.800]  basically this is all a lie and how do you understand what's going on how do you understand
[44:22.800 --> 44:29.120]  the theories of war we had the first world war the second world war and the coming third
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.000]  world war well you could only understand this when you understand that there is another
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.080]  force there the people on the right think that the left control of me what's going on
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.280]  the people on the left think that the people on the right control it and they're both wrong
[44:45.280 --> 44:50.400]  there is this other group and i call them the brotherhood of darkness but they are made
[44:50.400 --> 44:56.960]  up basically of people of great wealth who are deeply involved in the occult and they
[44:56.960 --> 45:04.240]  actually rely on supernatural occurrences they actually have supernatural power these
[45:04.240 --> 45:11.320]  people have wealth beyond comprehension for the average individual what is so difficult
[45:11.320 --> 45:18.040]  for most people to believe is that there really is a supernatural component to life i mean
[45:18.040 --> 45:24.560]  how we live we were born and just because of life we die how about if there is certainly
[45:24.560 --> 45:31.160]  much more to life than simply that there really is a god there really are supernatural forces
[45:31.160 --> 45:36.880]  and what do you have a personal relationship with our lord or you'll see him interfering
[45:36.880 --> 45:44.040]  and put the interjecting in him into your life almost on a daily basis it's almost impossible
[45:44.040 --> 45:50.640]  to believe but i i'm sure that you and other people who are christian achieve that influence
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.680]  of god now i've experienced so much providence and then i feel ashamed that i'm that i'm given
[45:56.680 --> 46:00.920]  this many chances and that's much providence i mean is that what it feels like for you
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.200]  to say amen to that but god is guiding us and there's a small number of us who are out
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.760]  there in the front lines of this battle being protected and and getting the word out and
[46:10.760 --> 46:16.920]  what i'm just hoping and praying that more and more people will turn to god and get involved
[46:16.920 --> 46:22.360]  in this we're not going to be able to defeat all these wicked people on our own only god
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.560]  help we can we're involved in spiritual battles is being taught on a political ideological
[46:28.560 --> 46:34.760]  and cultural battlefield but it is really a spiritual battle and we need god help and
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.960]  god will help us if we ask for it but unfortunately america as the nation has rejected god we
[46:40.960 --> 46:46.240]  are opposed to christian nation and i really fear that god is going to bring his judgment
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.200]  on this nation i think that's the biggest thing that we have to look forward to now
[46:51.200 --> 46:56.520]  in fact there's one one thing that thomas jefferson said i will never forget it god
[46:56.520 --> 47:01.160]  who gave his life gave his liberty but can the liberty of a nation be secure when the
[47:01.160 --> 47:07.560]  conviction has been forgotten that liberty is the gift of god i tremble for my country
[47:07.560 --> 47:14.640]  when i reflect that god is just and his justice will not be forever i can see that the hammer
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.880]  is dropping i mean hey do you concur with that do you feel it in your spirit and where
[47:18.880 --> 47:23.040]  do you see everything going i think that we are in real trouble i think america has turned
[47:23.040 --> 47:28.560]  against god and i believe god is going to bring his judgment unless as i mentioned earlier
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.760]  we have a massive revival i don't see it coming but my job third job the small group of people
[47:35.760 --> 47:42.840]  that alternative radio are having an impact i will tell you the other side it is worried
[47:42.840 --> 47:47.720]  i thought i saw this uh notation the other day there was some sort of article in one
[47:47.720 --> 47:53.720]  of the magazines criticizing these crazy people because of conspiracy but it says is there
[47:53.720 --> 48:00.680]  almost 23 percent of the population really believes there is a conspiracy well i i think
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.800]  that's pretty good and i think we're making progress alex all we could do is keep pushing
[48:05.800 --> 48:12.280]  but also pointing this is not simply an ideological battle it's a spiritual battle and try to
[48:12.280 --> 48:18.640]  get people to begin looking to our lord for salvation and basically for strength because
[48:18.640 --> 48:23.120]  that's where strength is going to come from and if we're going to turn this thing around
[48:23.120 --> 48:30.120]  it's going to be with god help not simply on our own efforts i'm showing images of
[48:30.120 --> 48:36.440]  the al-qaeda troops that have taken over the isis forces and they are just showing the
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.680]  mass graves the mass executions there's even gruesome video of it i don't know if we're
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.800]  gonna show that but i mean this is just wholesale evil every christian they find is killed every
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.840]  policeman they find is killed this is who our government put in and is now funding with
[48:51.840 --> 48:57.200]  destruction of the very same moderates that we're putting compared to these people this
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.640]  is unspeakable evil that's being committed right now and it just shows uh the plan they
[49:02.640 --> 49:07.520]  have for us here as well they're funding both sides that's what most people must understand
[49:07.520 --> 49:12.760]  we're funding the shias we're funding the sunis and we should pull out of there completely
[49:12.760 --> 49:19.320]  and we should demand immediately in fact i said to me yesterday for the first time actually
[49:19.320 --> 49:25.200]  contact my congressman and both my senators and said pull out pull out immediately and
[49:25.200 --> 49:34.840]  i would suggest that we ask your listeners to send an email immediately to their congressman
[49:34.840 --> 49:42.320]  and both senators saying pull out if there was enough of the support across america we
[49:42.320 --> 49:47.600]  could bring pressure on obama and he would begin to back out sure sure here's my issue
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.040]  and i'll have you back up soon and talk about it i was against going there both times because
[49:52.040 --> 49:58.440]  it was a setup right and i know you were as well the problem is saudi arabia and nato
[49:58.440 --> 50:05.960]  are behind this isis takeover you've got highways for 20 miles full of the al-qaeda forces they
[50:05.960 --> 50:10.920]  could highway of death and destroy them but obama acts like he's just fumbling around
[50:10.920 --> 50:16.120]  doing nothing don't we have a responsibility if we toppled the government to not let al-qaeda
[50:16.120 --> 50:22.200]  take over i think that we this is a civil war just pull everything out get out of there
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.720]  completely and let them solve it on it there's got to be a there's got to be a bloodbath no
[50:27.720 --> 50:33.560]  matter what happened about we should not be back there no i agree with you that but that
[50:33.560 --> 50:38.120]  was you know back in 1990 don't let them you know do this or let them have a civil war
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.560]  now what i'm saying is the globalist are the ones this is the same al-qaeda group they
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.920]  had attacking syria now they've gone into iraq i understand monty for all praying for

[54:28.640 --> 54:34.280]  but just before the break you heard his interview from back in June with Dr. Stan Monteith who
[54:34.280 --> 54:39.640]  of course sadly passed away just a few days ago now we're actually giving out the address
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.800]  to Stan's wife of course you know he was a complete icon of the Liberty movement going
[54:44.800 --> 54:51.200]  back decades and decades and people can write their support to Mrs. Monteith the address
[54:51.200 --> 55:01.800]  is radio Liberty PO box nine six nine soquel California nine fifty seven B so you can write
[55:01.800 --> 55:09.520]  your support seven what was that sorry seven three so that's radio Liberty PO box nine
[55:09.520 --> 55:18.080]  six nine soquel California nine fifty seven three that's nine fifty seven three write
[55:18.080 --> 55:23.240]  your support for Mrs. Monteith and of course all our thoughts and prayers go out to his
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.280]  family now just touching again on Ebola briefly before the break Drudge has his top story
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.200]  patient being tested for Ebola DC's Howard University Hospital we've got another case
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.280]  in DC and again you know I was called a conspiracy theorist for weeks and months we were all
[55:39.280 --> 55:44.760]  called that we were all labeled that demonized just for questioning whether this would be
[55:44.760 --> 55:50.600]  a genuine threat for questioning whether the CDC was prepared to handle it and whereas
[55:50.600 --> 55:56.360]  you know Alex will rant and rave expressing his anger at the CDC at the feds for their
[55:56.360 --> 56:01.520]  failure to deal with this my approach is a bit more measured but still I'm absolutely
[56:01.520 --> 56:09.240]  flabbergasted at this response this completely botched response bringing shame upon the country
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.160]  because they're not responding much better than the African authorities who are obviously
[56:14.160 --> 56:19.300]  overwhelmed by this they don't have the adequate medical provisions to deal with it and yet
[56:19.300 --> 56:25.000]  America apparently is not doing much better because of the CDC's complete incompetence
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.320]  at not handling this case letting people into the Ebola infected apartment letting cleaning
[56:30.320 --> 56:37.080]  crews clean up the Ebola sick with no protection whatsoever and a failure to communicate between
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.440]  the hospital which supposedly allowed this Ebola victim to wander around Dallas for four
[56:41.440 --> 56:48.240]  days potentially infecting hundreds of other people and yet they refuse they refuse to
[56:48.240 --> 56:53.200]  block the flights directly into Washington dollars and now we've got a potential Ebola
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.760]  victim in Washington unconfirmed but if this starts to spread I mean people are going to
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.040]  have to be fired that's the only solution and we're going to have to have a complete
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.400]  reevaluation of how we handle this because the bio-containment facilities for a start
[57:08.400 --> 57:12.360]  if we get many more of these patients just aren't in existence to deal with this as
[57:12.360 --> 57:16.720]  you saw out of the article we covered earlier underground medic there are only 19 level
[57:16.720 --> 57:23.000]  four bio-containment beds in the whole of the United States to deal with a population
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.720]  of 317 million so they were caught with their pants down but they've made the situation
[57:29.720 --> 57:34.840]  even worse in the interim by failing to take the proper precautions this apartment wasn't
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.920]  even cleaned until last night the people who went in there to clean it were wearing full
[57:39.920 --> 57:46.360]  bio hazmat suits that protection wasn't offered to the sheriff's deputies who also entered
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.720]  the apartment last night who are now complaining about the fact they've been placed on leave

[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.320]  edition just got word that the new info wars magazine is back in stock here it is on the
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:48.280]  desk isis equals al qaeda is the subject of this month's issue also got some ebola articles
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.240]  in the issue so be sure to get your hands on the latest copy of info wars magazine
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:01.240]  now available economic news of course we had the jobs numbers come out today 5.9% unemployment
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:08.360]  rate vehemently celebrated by the mainstream media as a sign of the ongoing quote economic
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:14.120]  recovery what they won't tell you is the fact as documented in the zero hedge article labor
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:23.680]  participation rate drops to 36 year low record 92.6 million americans not in labor force and
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:29.280]  again this read this unemployment rate doesn't include the people who've stopped looking
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.640]  for work it's a completely bogus statistic while by now according to zero hedge everyone
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.000]  should know the answer for those curious why the u.s. unemployment rate just slid once more
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.240]  to a meager 5.9% the slut the lowest print since the summer of 2008 the answer is the
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.680]  same one we have shown every month since 2010 the collapse in the labor force participation
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:58.280]  rate which in september slid from an already three decade low 62.8% to 62.7% the lowest
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.800]  in over 36 years what's more disturbing is that people not in the labor force rose to
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:14.240]  a new record high increasing by 315,000 to 92.6 million so they added 232,000 jobs yet
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:22.320]  315,000 americans dropped out of the labor force and they're celebrating this as some
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.480]  great benchmark of the economic recovery of course we know that the real economic figures
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:34.080]  show that the economy is stagnating and declining in fact I wrote an article a few days ago
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:42.200]  from foreign affairs where the cdc where the cfr sorry did a series of articles concerned
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:48.000]  about the populist revolt now sweeping europe and america of course we had the big anti
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.440]  eu backlash back in may with ukip and denmark the true fin party several others rejecting
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.960]  the brussels power structure we've also had the tea party merge over the past few years
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:06.600]  and in that article the cfr expressed their amazement at the fact that this popular uprising
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.120]  was still going they see america indicate the sources of political dysfunction what's
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:17.360]  key about this is that they said this populist liberty uprising both in the united states
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:24.400]  and europe which was threatening the two party monopoly monopolies in both those continents
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:30.720]  needs to be quote co-opted those were the exact words they use co-opted so again they're
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.560]  going to try and infiltrate these movements get their own people to represent these movements
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:44.480]  and then sell everybody down the river now in the article in the cfr article that i cited
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.960]  one of the key aspects that they drew attention to which is causing this populist uprising
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:57.400]  is the fact that medium household household income has declined since 1989 so in the past
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.800]  what twenty five thirty years has been absolutely zero real economic recovery and people are
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.920]  struggling under the same conditions they were back in 1989 nothing has improved they
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.760]  see the article article establishment desperate to co-opt populist uprising to neutralize
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.720]  what they call the american distemper and that distemper is arising out of the fact
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:27.360]  that these living standards continue to stagnate and decline as evidenced again by this article
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.680]  the wage less recovery average hourly earnings suffer first monthly decline since july two
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.680]  thousand thirteen so wages are on the decline large numbers of people dropping out of the
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.600]  labor force and yet the mainstream media and the government are celebrating the economic
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.840]  numbers like it's some great recovery the real figures suggest otherwise we'll be back

[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:36.560]  jones show on sunday for the sunday show we're now going to be joined by syrian girl syrian
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.760]  activist and blogger who of course needs no introduction she's been on the show many
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:48.640]  times syrian girl welcome to the alex jones show thank you for having me paul now let's
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.200]  talk about isis first because of course we have these airstrikes launched in iraq what
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.800]  was it a couple of months ago now they expanded them into syria back a couple of weeks ago
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.720]  no real news though on what kind of effect they're having there was one marine who died
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.520]  you went missing i believe it was yesterday but in terms of isis we've not really heard
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.800]  anything about whether or not these airstrikes are actually pushing them back allowing whoever
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:21.560]  rebels the us wants to support this week to take back the territory supposedly vacated
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.840]  in the aftermath of those airstrikes so tell us exactly the situation if these airstrikes
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:34.720]  are actually having an impact on these isis militants i think it's clear if you watch
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:41.240]  the news the isis is still advancing they've been advancing on cobain which is in the north
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:47.240]  of syria the northeast of syria it's a Kurdish town and if anyone's been observing the news
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:53.240]  it's they've almost taken the town now and they've absolutely taken an area called ayin
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.640]  l'arab and also they've been advancing in iraq and they've been getting closer and closer
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.520]  to Baghdad so as many people predicted these airstrikes really do nothing but create more
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.400]  recruits for isis because once the airstrikes began there was talk that the actual recruitment
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:16.240]  for isis doubled with more and more of these youths being convinced that after all we are
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:22.480]  fighting the u.s. the u.s. isn't backing isis you know that's that's caused more recruits
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.680]  so the only way to really fight these groups is to stop the source and to cut the umbilical
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:36.840]  cord of their supporters which are again you know turkey and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:44.640]  Qatar now there was a report six thousand new isis members just days after these airstrikes
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.080]  in syria have been lodged and it's a point that i've been i've made many times before
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:55.480]  you flood the region with weapons you bomb the region you only create more radicalization
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.920]  all the university studies show that bombing the region flooding it with weapons only causes
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:07.560]  more terrorism and yet the united states continues to do so um are they really creating the terrorists
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:14.360]  they need to justify further military occupation and expansion in the middle east well you
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.560]  have to judge people by what they do not what they say and in spite of all the rhetoric
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.320]  of fighting terrorism what they've done for the last 10 years in fact or more is to create
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.600]  these terrorist groups and to keep them growing i mean it was clear that the training and the
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:37.240]  weapons they gave to the fsa went into the hands of isis eventually when the fsa or they
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.680]  call them moderate rebels defected to isis and took all the weapons and training that
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:50.040]  the u.s. provided with them it's a clear double standard and we predicted in fact on my channel
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:56.480]  i said that these strikes are only going to gain isis more recruits and that is exactly
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.840]  what happened and of course you know the syrian air force was already air striking the areas
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.200]  in rakka where isis were so more airstrikes isn't actually going to do anything what needs
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:15.920]  to stop is allowing these groups across the border um and turkey a NATO member a us ally
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.480]  has so far not done so in fact there's plenty of videos and footage online of um isis merchandise
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:30.280]  being sold in istanbul turkey and isis members actually being um given medical aid by turkey
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:37.120]  so um i don't think that this would occur without the us is okay because turkey is after
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:44.960]  all a NATO member um and it's subject to uh some sort of influence by the us as well um
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.640]  also we should talk about the other group not just isis but jeba to nusra as well exactly
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.080]  there's a financial times article syria islamis seek troops with isis after being targeted
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:02.640]  by us and this is jeba el nusra who of course many of this so-called moderate fsa groups
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:10.320]  pledged allegiance to as far back as 2012 i believe and jeba el nusra is of course radical
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:16.000]  extremist jihadist group that's committed atrocities almost on a par with isis they're
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.360]  now embroiled in bed with the fsa tell us about jeba el nusra and how they relate to
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:28.280]  the isis militant group well you know absolutely they're they're just as barbaric if not more
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:34.040]  so and um they are on par with isis they were around before isis and they are very similar
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.840]  to the other insurgent groups in syria that are extremist and sectarian and um if you
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:47.960]  recall there was a split between al-qaeda um and isis and that also coincided between
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:54.520]  a split between jeba el nusra and isis as well and now that um the us is bombing both
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.480]  isis and jeba el nusra at the same time instead of splitting them up they've actually unified
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:08.040]  them into one big group and not only them in fact um the um it's called the hazam movement
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:15.160]  which is the moderate rebel group that the us is actually has provided arms to and training
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:22.360]  the only group that has it has provided arms to you know on paper not with the back doors
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.600]  in as a middleman um but this group that started as the moderate group actually condemned the
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:34.760]  strikes against jeba el nusra um because they have said in the past they've told the independent
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.320]  that jeba el nusra is their ally in the war against the syrian government and asad and um
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.600]  they basically have no problem with jeba el nusra it's not their problem it's the us's problem
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.560]  and they're not going to fight it so the idea that these moderate rebels are against al-qaeda
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:15:01.160]  or fighting al-qaeda is uh has now been exposed as complete um lies basically now i believe it was
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:07.080]  two days ago or three days ago there was a huge bombing in hams in a you know quote government
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:13.720]  controlled area of a school which killed 41 school children there you see the aljazeera
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:20.040]  headline children killed in hams double blast killed 45 people people including 41 children
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.560]  this basically got no mainstream coverage whatsoever it was in aljazeera imagine if a
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:31.480]  school was bombed in america and 41 kids died i mean that no attention whatsoever on this
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.960]  and why well because it's it's being carried out by the very same rebels that are in bed with the
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.360]  fsa which you're about to receive a huge new cache of weapons courtesy of the obama administration
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:51.720]  so tell us about this school bombing that just occurred well you know it's uh very easy for the
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:57.160]  media who does do reported to try to blame it on isis but actually isis doesn't have much of a
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:04.600]  presence in the hams region in the um southwest of syria they do have a presence but it's very
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:12.360]  minimal and what happened was hams was touted as the heart of the revolution only about a year ago
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:21.160]  so until it was actually um taken back by the government forces in the military so um the syrian
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:29.400]  troops secured these areas and now the only way that these extremist militias can uh extract
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:36.520]  basically vengeance upon those residents of hams that are now living their daily lives is to have
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:43.000]  these suicide bombings and it wouldn't be the first time that area has been under uh car bombs like
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.360]  twice or three times in the past and the fact that bbc and uh you know i've i've looked up the
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.920]  coverage of the story and it's very minimal um they start trying to ignore it because they don't want
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:01.320]  to point out the atrocities of the rebels that the they have been supporting for the last three years
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:11.560]  and calling um democratic uh you know freedom fighters and um in this attack against the school
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:19.000]  was a deliberate attack there was no military targets anywhere around the proximity of the
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.440]  region there were not any um soldiers or anything like that um and the bombs went off just as the
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.480]  kids were coming out of the school and there's video footage of it online and it's quite horrific
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:35.880]  i would warn anyone that would um search for it but um it's interesting also that some of these
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.840]  human rights groups and NGOs also didn't have much of coverage of it and in fact the syrian
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:48.920]  electronic army um had to hack into the twitter and the page of unicef just to get them to cover the
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.960]  hams car bombing and as soon as they got their accounts back of course they deleted any evidence
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:01.720]  of the um car bombing of the school so did anyone actually claim responsibility for the bombing um
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:10.200]  as far as i know not yet no but it's quite a cowardly attack um and it's i think it's it's clearly um
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.240]  to revenge against these people are going back to live in homes they want to make sure that um they
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:24.280]  don't live peacefully or perhaps even to try to kick them out of homes and to restart things there
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.280]  because homes is a very important city um it's had it all roads lead to homes and into lebanon
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.320]  so this is what one of the reasons why it became the heart of the revolution because it's a very
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:42.280]  strategic city and there was this new group that suddenly emerged out of nowhere corazon a couple
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.840]  of weeks ago which the obama administration claimed it had bombed tell us about corazon is that a
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:54.360]  real group or is it just a an offshoot of jaba al-nosra? corazon is basically just jabet al-nosra
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:59.800]  and i don't know why they've decided to give them a new name i suspect it's because um they don't
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.160]  want to make it clear that they're targeting jabet al-nosra because it would uh anger all of the
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:12.280]  moderate rebels that they're supporting in syria and anger all of the um people in syria who support
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.520]  the the surgency and the revolution who also happen to support jabet al-nosra and you can see
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:25.640]  that again you know even the group um um that the us has said that these are the moderates and these
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:33.000]  other people were giving weapons to um said that you know we condemn the strikes against jabet al-nosra
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.920]  because if they don't do so then the you know they're going to lose a lot of supporters and
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:42.200]  they can't basically can't survive without jabet al-nosra many times that western media has admitted
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:48.840]  that jabet al-nosra and isis are basically the main groups fighting in syria and yet um they're
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.480]  still trying to undermine the syrian government's okay we'll be back after the break calls for syrian

[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.120]  the hazmat teams that are there to clean up the ebola infected apartment of ebola victim uh
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:39.960]  torah's duncan who of course came into dallas a few days ago have finally arrived three days
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.720]  after the fact after he was announced to be the first ebola victim in the united states so it took
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:53.320]  the cdc at least three days to dispatch a proper hazmat team to clean up that apartment again
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:59.960]  underlining the alarming incompetence of the federal government in dealing with this ebola
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.240]  outbreak uh me me allah ham sirian girl i know you've been tracking ebola you made a video about
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:14.600]  that recently uh give us your take on the ebola outbreak well you know i've actually been looking
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:20.520]  into ebola because it's a very interesting virus for many years now and i remember just learning
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:27.000]  about how um it's you know it's it's one of the deadliest viruses known to man it has a 90
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.160]  kill rate especially the zaire strain which is apparently the strain we're um facing right now
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:40.920]  and um interestingly there was no ebola before the 1970s and the first case of ebola was actually
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:48.920]  not in africa well an ebola-like virus um the relative of it being marbug the first case of marbug
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:56.680]  which was related to ebola was actually in germany and only after that were the first case the second
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:04.040]  cases that came out in africa so the orange origins of ebola are actually not known about
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:12.200]  and this uh outbreak seems to be different to any other outbreak in the past because in the past
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:21.720]  ebola has killed so quickly um and so uh so with such a high rate that it hasn't been able to spread
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.480]  but in this case it seems to be spreading out of control and nobody knows why this uh outbreak
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:33.720]  occurred and why it seems to be different from all the rest so do you think there may be a possibility
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:40.280]  that it's gone airborne at least to a limited extent as many of the other experts are now saying
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:46.920]  including the um u n ebola chief yesterday said that it could mutate and go airborne that that was
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:55.080]  the main threat now well i've um read that once viruses enter enough hosts that they could mutate
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:01.560]  and go airborne um the thing is ebola just as it is now is classified as a category a biological
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:09.160]  weapon and it's um you know it's they've had actually teams in Sierra Leone uh and in other
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.640]  regions of Africa actually researching ebola um for its use as a biological weapon the US military
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:21.800]  has had scientists researching about it there and that's all you know open knowledge so um
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:29.240]  i'm not i don't know any information about uh what is actually the cause of ebola but these
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:36.040]  points are interesting to note um because of course you know in this kind of uh world that
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.320]  we're living in on the verge of world war three and with the superpowers all trying to outdo each
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:48.440]  other researching to biological weapons is the sort of in the next step besides nuclear weapons um
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:57.240]  and you know it's it's it's interesting if ebola does go airborne though that uh it would be
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:03.560]  really disastrous but i do know that sometimes when viruses mutate into um something airborne
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.440]  they actually may or may not make them less deadly so we'll see how that goes it may have
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:14.680]  already gone airborne but usually you can actually tell by the shape of the virus whether or not it
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:20.120]  is air it's capable of being airborne certainly it seems to be very contagious and maybe it's spread
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:29.080]  by even small particles of the virus of the the saliva in air could potentially spread the virus
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:33.560]  as well and what do you think about the health authorities in the united states you know they
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.680]  let this guy walk around for two days actually four days he went back to the hospital two days
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:45.080]  later they let him walk around for the best part of a week infected with ebola the response since
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.520]  has been nothing more than pathetic they've um the apartment there they've sent in people with
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:56.200]  unprotected gear to literally hose down the ebola sick off the sidewalk they've let sheriff's
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.320]  deputies into the apartment with no protection whatsoever what do you think about the federal
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.360]  government response and what it says about how prepared the united states is for an ebola outbreak
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:13.720]  i think it's really shocking the fact that the man went to hospital and told them that he's just
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:20.040]  come back from um africa in one of the infected countries i'm not sure if it was liberia or
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:27.000]  syralion but um i believe it was probably liberia but they just gave him antibiotics and sent him
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:35.240]  home i mean that's quite shocking and uh you know the response is uh maybe being tested as well
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:40.760]  through this outbreak and it's clearly not um coming up standard okay we'll be back after the

[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:27.240]  we're back live friday edition of the alex jones show talking to syrian girl otherwise known as
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:37.000]  mimi aleham your calls coming shortly huffington post global warming created isis yes that was an
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:44.680]  actual article in the huffington post you see there was a drought in syria from 2006 to 2010
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:50.280]  and they claim that happened because of climate change even though droughts worldwide over the
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:57.160]  last 30 years are down they blamed this drought for being responsible for the rise of jihadists
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:04.760]  in syria and isis even though isis was not even formed in syria of course it was formed in iraq so
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:13.320]  these are climate change alarmists are now actually blaming global warming for the rise of jihadists
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:20.200]  in syria mimi aleham of course nothing to do with the fact that the us armed the jihadists in the
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:27.080]  first place that they trained isis members in jordan saudi arabia qatar turkey bank rolled them to
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.920]  the hill it can all be explained by global warming what do you think of that well even the drought
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:40.520]  itself wasn't caused by global warming it was caused by the turkish president damning the river
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:46.680]  that runs into syria in order to destabilize the syrian government and he's on record for saying
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.360]  telling the previous president hafez al-assad not this current one that you know your people can
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:58.920]  drink sand and that is the reason for the drought in syria it wasn't global warming in the first
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:07.000]  place the the turkish government did this purposely to get people to get the syrian economy weakened
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.400]  and to get people angry and it continues to be turkish policy and the u.s government policy that
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.000]  leads to these jihadist groups and has led to groups like isis and you know interestingly the
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.960]  turkish government now are talking about having invasion plans into syria using isis as an excuse
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  and saving the Kurds as an excuse because of the problems now happening on the turkish border
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:38.360]  200 000 Kurds have crossed into turkey now syrian Kurds crossing into turkey and of course
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:47.560]  turkey actually doesn't like having Kurds coming into turkey because they see Kurds as a potential
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:53.960]  threat and separatists and as a result you know that is probably one of the reasons they are
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:01.800]  worrying about what's happening in syria right now and they are in fact the turkish war leaks
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:08.440]  in six months ago revealed where Erdogan's ministers were talking about war plans in syria
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.880]  that they were going to use isis as a false flag operation on a turkish tomb and to try to get
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.160]  some excuse to go into syria and that's all on youtube you can have a look at it and as a result
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:29.720]  Erdogan actually shut youtube down that day just to prevent his people from listening to it just
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.600]  before the election okay we're going to get back into isis soon with the callers but we're running
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.800]  low on time now so let's get into gamergate this is an amazing topic that's kind of slipped under
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:47.160]  the radar radar over the past month or so it began in august and this is an attempt by individuals
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:54.040]  to hijack the video game industry to implant social engineering and basically brainwashing
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:37:03.160]  messages explain how that emerged well actually gamergate is a very very interesting and promising
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:09.240]  um sort of twitter phenomenon that's going on right now it's a hashtag on twitter of gamers
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:16.520]  who have actually been able to expose collusion between the media um and a think tank called
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:27.320]  digra which is supported by darpa the um military and government ministry um so this uh darpa is
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:33.720]  providing money to this think tank called digra that's specializing uh in sort of injecting
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:41.000]  social engineering into video games and they're trying to sort of say uh apply their sort of
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.480]  um multiple genders as we saw in facebook and uh they call them social justice warriors you know
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:54.120]  sort of a fake pseudo feminism taking up the the cause of racism feminism and all of those things
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:02.520]  um not in real support of equality but to try to pit races and genders against each other
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:08.360]  and what's happened is that these gamers um have rejected these people and have been sort of
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:15.080]  starting to link connection make connections between uh the video game journalism these think
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.600]  tanks and certain video game developers that are making creating games specifically to social
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:26.840]  engineer people one of those is her name is um i forget her first name but her last name is quinn
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.640]  zoe quinn yeah zoe quinn exactly um and she's uh she they sort of expose her connections and after
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:41.320]  that all across all the game journalists uh they wrote down the same story gamers are dead
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.240]  the game development industry should ignore their market and start producing games that are
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:53.960]  politically correct and no longer consider what the gamers themselves want but sort of what the um
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.040]  think tanks and the academics and the social engineers want them to produce and all the
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:06.520]  journalists seem to be concluded on that and what's going on now is uh these gamers um are
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:13.640]  have a mission now um to expose these think tanks and these connections with what they themselves
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:23.080]  what even the the ceo of um a big game industry called electronic arts called in his memo the
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.880]  establishment elite the establishment elite have injected themselves into movies film television
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:37.560]  into social media to try to uh socially engineer society and it seems that they haven't completely
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.600]  controlled the game industry they have to some degree in the military aspect of it but not in
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.760]  the social aspect of it and that's what they're trying to do right now and that's all about
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.520]  shifting the propaganda over from news to entertainment because they know a lot of young
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.880]  people are turned off by the news so now they're shifting it as you said into video games movies
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:02.200]  television shows and this is red flag bombshell proof of a deliberate attempt to undermine and
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:08.360]  hijack the video games industry to implant that politically correct social engineering it's a story
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.760]  we're going to be covering more in the future but now we're going to go to calls for syrian girl
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:19.240]  we got habu in wisconsin go ahead habu you're on the air thank you very much for the opportunity
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.760]  and i always learned something uh listening to syrian girl so you're very uh enlightening to the
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.360]  to the people here um you know let me just have a comment and i'll be very quick and then i'll
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:37.400]  ask you a question i do believe the u.s has an obligation to put armed forces on the ground
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:44.680]  coordinated with the syrian forces and the iraqi forces to drive out these or to corner
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:52.040]  these people in my estimation with the superior american air power this should be a pretty straightforward
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:57.720]  thing and in under six months this would be done um so my my question to syrian girl uh
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:03.560]  there's just two quick questions one do you think president Assad is really setting himself up for
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:12.520]  regime change as this um bombing uh just morphs and kind of encroaches upon his power uh centers
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:19.720]  meaning the air and the second thing is i think that the present iraqi constitution should be
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:27.240]  torn up and written in news so that it it embraces all different types of people in iraqi society
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.120]  which it doesn't do now so thank you very much for the courtesy and keep on uh enlightening the
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:39.880]  world syrian girl thank you so much for your kind words um i you know in principle the idea of the
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:47.080]  u.s and syria coordinating coordinating against these uh extremist groups like isis you know that
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:52.680]  might be a good idea but in fact i think that u.s troops on the ground anywhere in the middle east
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:42:00.200]  it's just going to exacerbate matters um u.s troops on the ground would only uh embolden these
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:06.200]  groups into fighting and gaining more recruits and believing that their cause is the right cause
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.520]  and i think that uh with everything that the u.s has has been doing in the region especially since
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.880]  they've been supporting uh these islamist groups um that are extreme in libya as well as syria
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:26.120]  you know there's this they really don't have any agenda to actually fight isis isis is basically
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.040]  the monster they created in order to have an excuse some kind of excuse to intervene i think that
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:37.800]  you know the the syrian people we don't want um any foreigners on the ground we don't need any help
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.960]  all we need is for the people who are supporting these groups and who are arming the insurgents
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.440]  to stop undermining the state to stop undermining the military and then we'll can take care of it
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:54.040]  ourselves we can clear things up in a few months and our our military is more than capable of doing
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.480]  that they just have to stop the money flow and that that would be all um but i do think that
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.520]  the u.s strikes on syria right now just as i said it's not so much about fighting isis
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.520]  as we've seen isis is still gaining ground they're still gaining recruits even more so now
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:15.320]  so it's not really about fighting isis i think it does still have a lot to do with regime change
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.040]  and finally about the iraqi constitution you know the iraqi constitution was written
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.920]  during the u.s occupation of iraq and um i know that uh james steel and robert ford had an agenda to
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.760]  uh create a civil war in iraq to put sunnis and shiites against each other and to eventually
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:39.880]  vulcanize the country and they wrote up the the um the constitution themselves and the major like
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:46.120]  the only part of the iraqi society voted for it just with devices to begin with and i you know i
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:50.840]  totally agree with you on the iraqi constitution on that point slam in canada you're on the eye
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:58.760]  with syrian girl go ahead slim hi syrian girl uh first of all i'd love about it and uh uh
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:06.360]  oh you're welcome uh my question is regarding isis um a while back i used to be a gamer myself
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.880]  it's funny you guys mentioned that uh the gaming industry i used to play this game called uh
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:20.360]  uh call of duty and the there used to be this you can make creative plans and the strongest and
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:26.760]  most vast clan in that game when i played it a few years ago was isis i don't know if that's a
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:33.640]  coincidence or what's going on but with respect to them being like just basically a cult they are
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.400]  basically just a death cult to me that's what i my opinion of them and the fact that they have the
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.920]  name the islamic state is just you know slapped in the face for everybody as far as i'm concerned
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:51.720]  what's what do you guys think about that got your comments syrian girl i think it's uh basically the
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.760]  worst kind of face you could give to islam and maybe that's part of the agenda you know we're
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:03.720]  talking about a clash of civilizations and these kind of groups they didn't exist before um this is
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.440]  a recent phenomena and most of the people they're killing are actually muslims so it's funny that
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.880]  they should call themselves the islamic state it's probably very interesting that the biggest clan
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:19.240]  in call of duty was isis i was wondering if it stood for anything that would be interesting to know
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.840]  if it was an acronym for anything derek in wyoming you're on the air with syrian girl go ahead derek
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.520]  thank you paul thank you syrian girl i i just want to tell him for us i appreciate all you're
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.480]  doing and i believe we can wake people up in our areas on vaccines and everything else i've done
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.560]  so with common core and visited our local county nurse on vaccines they're looking at it i think
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.680]  we got to get off our couches and syrian girl thank you so much and it seems to me that she
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.240]  should be on every network talking about this but they just have propaganda so i want to ask you
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:46:01.080]  syrian girl why do you think that israel is not being targeted by i that's a very very good question
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:07.000]  why indeed is israel not being targeted by isis i think that none of these groups seem to be
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:13.640]  really targeting israel and in fact israel is helping jabhat al nusra on the syrian golden
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:19.400]  heights borders and it's this this is a fact that they're giving them medical aid um treating their
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:28.760]  wounds giving them a buffer zone and shooting down a syrian airplane jet or um helicopter
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.960]  that is chasing jabhat al nusra the al qaeda group down so israel is sort of acting as the air
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:41.880]  defenses of al qaeda and it's very interesting why these groups who are supposed to be so you
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.000]  know anti any other religion wouldn't attack israel and i think that maybe it has something to do
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.760]  with the people who control isis leading them and directing them to attack you know syria instead of
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.520]  israel so sangering texas you're on the air with syrian girl your question go ahead
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:12.360]  do we have sangering texas uh frank in carolina go ahead uh yes you can hear me yeah you're on
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:21.160]  the air go ahead frank okay um yeah uh dr watson with respect to uh your your coverage of the
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:27.320]  the abola thing uh you know i think i sometimes think we give uh this you know agencies like
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:33.800]  the cdc way too much credit for incompetence and whatnot i mean the way i look at it i'm not even
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:40.360]  following that closely but if they wanted to create some type of a crisis uh they couldn't do a better
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:47.160]  job as far as setting all the chess pieces into place and that's my take on it and i know a lot
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:53.320]  of other people would agree with that and syrian girl uh i had a question for you would you say
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:58.840]  based on your research and all the goings on in the middle east and with isis uh that this is
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:05.800]  primarily probably being engineered and managed by uh the nazis or perhaps their descendants
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:15.560]  um i don't have any details about that but i do believe that you know you can kill a man
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:24.040]  but you can't kill an idea so maybe you know in some degree there's a connection between um you
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:30.200]  know the the fascism of old or the groups that the basically the establishment elite who created
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:36.600]  these ideologies whether they be nazism or marxism or you know any anything that was useful at the
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.800]  time whether they be good ideologies or bad ideologies um i don't really um i wouldn't say
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:50.120]  you know nazis are behind these things but certainly there's been a rise of um neo nazism in
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:56.760]  ukraine that that's as far as i can really comment on that bruce in michigan wants to talk about
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:02.760]  iran you're on the air with syrian girl go ahead bruce well okay thank you um you know uh uh there
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:10.040]  are more christians in lebanon and syria than anywhere else in the middle east and no one uh
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:17.800]  televivriad paris london or washington would replace mr asad with would be better for the
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:26.360]  christians than mr asad i i just read some articles by a basem maru out of lebanon and of

[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:29.000]  at cob county jail being tested for a bowler of course early we had potential cases in dc and
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.840]  toronto thankfully most of these cases normally turned out to be negative but an inmate at the
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:40.200]  cob county jail is reportedly being tested for a bowler will keep track of that also the cleanup
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.800]  crew that has mat crew en route to that apartment the potentially a bowler infected apartment in
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:52.200]  dalis have been delayed once again because they haven't got a permit so the incompetence of the
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:58.360]  cdc continues to know no bounds we thought that that cleanup crew had actually been in place last
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:04.120]  night turns out that they haven't even got the permit to conduct the cleanup of the abola
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:10.760]  apartment going back to syrian girl now this is a sensitive subject but she was targeted
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:18.680]  by a huge defamation campaign recently and then a separate incident where somebody actually
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:25.000]  called her university and basically made some astounding claims i'll let syrian girl explain
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:32.360]  it syrian girl go ahead well actually um because there's a lawsuit going on and i can't actually
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:38.840]  comment very much on the case on the advice of my lawyer i can't specifically mention what the
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:44.600]  defamation was about but i can say that it was quite um horrendous and especially in the case
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:50.360]  where the man contacted my university um i'm just to get it clear i mean you were involved in a
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:55.720]  in a kind of a propaganda offensive against him because you did some research which kind of disproved
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:02.040]  what he was saying he was coming down on the side of a sad uh regarding the the the sad's opponents
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.480]  of course regarding the chemical weapons attack so you did some research which proved him wrong
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:14.120]  he got a big chip on his shoulder resentful and he actually called your university and basically
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:20.440]  implied that you might be a terrorist is that the case well again i can't comment on specifically
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.960]  what he said but um you know anyone who's been following the case might already know uh that
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:32.920]  i would been work i was working with professor ted postal of mit just to give him a bit of a chemistry
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:40.120]  help because he was looking into the claims by two individuals which i'm not sure if i'm allowed
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:47.240]  to name myself on the show now i think we'll avoid the names okay um that made these outrageous
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:54.040]  claims to the mainstream media that a specific chemical called hexamine was smoking gun evidence
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:57:02.200]  that the syrian government used the sarin on the mascus and that this hexamine itself is the fact
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:08.040]  that it was in the soil samples is just proof enough the problem with that is that um hexamine
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:13.160]  is a chemical that's found in many explosives and that would make sense why it would be in the soil
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:18.600]  samples furthermore the man who's making these claims is not a chemist he has no background in
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:23.880]  chemistry but the mainstream media because he's saying something that supports their line
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:32.600]  has started him as an expert and uh when i helped uh professor ted postal of mit look into his claims
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.920]  i was basically um and and chose to prove the fact that he has no idea what he's talking about
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:44.120]  he has no knowledge in chemistry and has nothing to support his claims um once once he found out
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:50.840]  about my involvement that's when he decided to attack me directly and attack my career amazing
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:56.200]  30 seconds left tell people how they can support you and about your youtube twitter account well
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:01.160]  if you'd like to support my defamation lawsuit against him and the other people so that i could
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:06.040]  show them that they cannot do this to to anyone and get away with it no matter how weak they are

[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:40.680]  girls who wanted to make a couple of other points here in the first five-minute segment
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:46.120]  of the third hour we were talking about her being targeted basically for defamation we can't go into
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:52.360]  too many details for legal reasons but because of her research in disproving the notion that the
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:58.680]  2013 chemical weapons attack in guta was the work of the asad government she was viciously
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:04.440]  targeted syrian girl you wanted to make another point on that subject um in fact thank you so much
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:09.800]  i'm sorry for stealing your airways in fact i wasn't going to um make it about me or the
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.440]  defamation suit i would thank anyone who would help me support because i would love to continue to
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:21.080]  fight and to continue to um you know bring my point of view across so anyone any kind of support
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:27.480]  would be a great help but i did want to just come back on just to mention the fact that um just to
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:34.440]  answer the the caller uh earlier you know the narratives can change very quickly and it's
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:40.280]  interesting that last year the media u.s. media was talking about um you know the syrian people
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.640]  that saw poor civilians that are being killed by airstrikes and starvation and you know the
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:51.560]  airstrikes against Shabbat al-Nusra actually killed tens of civilians including children the
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:57.720]  u.s. airstrikes did and they also hit a grain silo and killed farmers in raka when they were
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:03.880]  airstriking isis and destroyed you know the food supply to raka so it's it's very funny that these
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:10.360]  narratives can change and now um even uh obama is meeting with the christian communities in syria
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:16.040]  to try to pretend that he's on their side when in fact he's been trying to basically um eliminate
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:22.120]  any trace of them in the middle east um in syria iraq and and probably lebanon soon enough also
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:28.120]  so so thank you so much i'm sorry to take up your airwaves again like one one more question isis
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:33.560]  what's the ultimate agenda is it about the partition of syria yes i think it's to do with
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:38.920]  partition of syria and of iraq um and i just want to say it's not good for the american people
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:43.640]  it's not good for the syrian people either we don't want to see any troops on the ground losing
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.120]  their heads we don't want to see any planes shot down by americans either i think the best
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:53.640]  situation here is to just live peacefully amongst each other and yes isis is definitely there to
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.080]  try to take over land they're not even syrian they're coming in from europe and from all over the
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:04.200]  world from australia and from the u.s to kill syrians and to live on their land and to make syria
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:10.040]  as if it was their own country and part of that is to divide syria into three pieces um the kurdish
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:19.160]  north the a isis middle and a the coast just cleaved off for the for the minorities and of course
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.760]  this isis propaganda offensive which has been embraced and vehemently launched by the mainstream
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:30.440]  media itself is founded mainly in recent weeks on these beheading videos which have raised
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:36.520]  suspicions for me what's your take on those um the beheading videos of journalists well it's
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:42.280]  interesting that uh you know the family members and the family spokesman of these journalists
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.960]  said that the moderate rebels that obama is supporting actually sold these men to isis
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:54.040]  and it just sort of interesting to me that the beheading videos came just in time um when the
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:04:01.880]  syrian air defenses in the northeast of the country collapsed to isis so just when the uh u.s
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:07.480]  government needed a uh the to convince the american people that they needed to go into syria
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:13.320]  these videotapes of these journalists being the head came out and then of course the basically
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:21.080]  the other point is that the u.s uh government needed the syrian air defenses in that region
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:28.840]  to fall to isis before they attacked um because as the pentagon has continuously said they find
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:34.600]  that the syrian air defenses are a risk and that's the only reason why um demcy said that we can't
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.400]  airstrike syria we can only have kinetic strikes which means launching missiles from boats at the
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:45.480]  country okay we'll leave it for there syrian girl thanks for joining us we'll be back after the break

[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:26.840]  we're back live on the alex jones show friday edition david night in studio and we're gonna
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:31.960]  switch back into some Ebola news before taking your calls at one eight hundred two five nine
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:38.200]  ninety two thirty one early we had the clip from anderson cooper where he was talking to the partner
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:44.360]  of the Ebola victim there in dallas she basically said she got no advice whatsoever from the cdc on
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:50.920]  how to clean the apartment um that the the Ebola stained uh bedsheets and the towels that this
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:56.360]  victim had been using was still there in the apartment again no proper advice on disposal
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:02.520]  now we have the hazmat teams being delayed because of a failure to obtain a permit we've got judge
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:08.920]  clay jenkins responding to this apartment this potentially Ebola infected apartment who acknowledged
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:14.840]  quote some hygiene issues in the department in the apartment so that's how he that's how concerned
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.040]  he is and david as he said just in the break the cdc seems to be the least concerned out of all
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:24.680]  these different authorities about this Ebola outbreak absolutely paul you've got these
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:29.000]  conflicts between different jurisdictions one of the things that the reporting in cnn is that
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.600]  uh we heard that there was a delay in the cleanup because a permit issue stopped it well the issue
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.200]  is that the texas highway association and department transportation others do not allow
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:45.880]  these kinds of hazardous materials to just be transported on the highway but of course the
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:52.120]  cdc says that's not any problem just go ahead and do it new york times reports that part of this delay
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.920]  was that officials had not had found it very difficult to find a contractor who was willing to
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.840]  go to the apartment and clean it up to remove the bedding and clothes uh which they say was
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.440]  bagged in plastic they found somebody they're called the cleaning guys i don't know if they
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:12.920]  feel the confidence maybe it's the two guys who were hosing down the vomit off the pavement earlier
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:19.720]  yeah it's it's uh this is serious stuff i mean it is so incredibly stupid and incompetent
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:24.360]  that it is funny it's kind of graveyard humor isn't it to see those guys out there and the
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.520]  pictures that you see from the helicopter they're out there like you pointed out earlier just in a
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:34.040]  t-shirt hosing it down and there's somebody walking by i mean that's actually spreading it around
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:39.560]  that's not cleaning it up no precautions for no concern for the workers who are going in there
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.840]  and cleaning this up no concern for the police officers it was the guy who was president of the
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:50.120]  dallas police officers union who had the concern for his officers there was still a a cavalier
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.560]  attitude from the health department from the cdc they are the ones who don't really seem to get
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:02.600]  it they don't really seem to care if it is overkill let's do that before we do have a lethal pandemic
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:08.200]  going out into the community seems like that'll be exercising care over the top because they don't
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:13.000]  know how to contain this obviously it's not contained in africa and there's a lot of questions
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.680]  that that you raised yesterday you pointed out people raising uh as to how it's transmitted
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:22.520]  we've had reports coming out of canada where they believe that it is very easily transmitted by
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:27.960]  aerosols and of course that's not technically airborne but essentially the same thing i mean
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.680]  it's uh they're they're arguing over semantics so there needs to be more care because they haven't
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:38.120]  been able to confine this they're doubling the number of cases uh that they reported at the cdc
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:43.560]  every uh a couple of weeks still in Liberia and they're projecting that it's going to be
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:46.920]  anywhere from a half million to one and a half million people by january just in those two
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.880]  countries that are hardest hit and here we have the tweet again which i showed earlier from scott
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:57.960]  gordon mbc five here on the document cam four sheriff's deputies health director doctor went
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:04.200]  into a ball of victims apartment without protection last night sheriff's association says and here you
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:10.280]  can see one of the images from right outside the apartment you see three completely unprotected
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:16.440]  individuals being allowed into the apartment of course we had the the shock image shows unprotected
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:24.600]  workers cleaning up ebola vomit in Dallas there on the document cam this was shot by w f a a and
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:29.400]  these guys were hired to hose down the pavement immediately outside the apartment where the
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:35.720]  ebola victim was kept before he was taken to hospital i went amazing amazing i mean i i when i
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.880]  first saw this i thought that's that's got to be some kind of hoax some kind of unrelated picture
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:46.280]  but we digged into it and it's w f a a tv it's confirmed it's amazing to see that and then i was
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:51.640]  aghast at the time stamp on that that was yesterday at about one o'clock in the afternoon i mean the
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:56.680]  press conference that was a couple of days after they had learned that this guy had ebola
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:00.760]  that occurred on wednesday and of course at that time we were told by government officials like
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:05.240]  rick perry and cdc officials that they were the most professional in the world we had the best
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:10.360]  medical system they were very well acquainted with how to contain this they were doing everything
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:14.920]  that needed to be done at that point everybody was saying but wait a minute you sent the guy home
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:19.000]  with essentially an aspirin the first time he showed up at the hospital even though it came out
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:25.080]  that he was from liberia they clearly weren't looking for that information he mentioned it
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:29.640]  as he was being checked in he said i don't have a social security number because i'm not from
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:34.760]  america i'm from liberia but it appears that the health care workers not just the people who are
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:39.880]  checking him in and doing the the uh processing of payment looks like the health care workers were
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:44.840]  not screening for that that's why that information wasn't passed along but now it is far worse than
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:49.480]  that if you stop and think about how long it has been just today they're getting there to
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:55.640]  clean the apartment they just cleaned the sidewalk yesterday you had the ambulance worker who said
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.920]  that they didn't notify the fire department for days after everything happened they took 48 hours
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.960]  to quarantine the ambulance when you look at how much stuff was done it wasn't just sending the guy
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:12.040]  home to percolate for a couple more days before he got much worse and brought to the hospital again
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:18.200]  i mean we're seeing an avalanche of information about how they've dropped the ball here uh over
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.920]  the last three or four days and here's the article that david just mentioned the dallas
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:28.680]  paramedic slams health officials was not informed of the bola diagnosis drove contaminated ambulance
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.160]  for two days he says the reports of officials tracking those potentially contaminated are
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:41.320]  quote full crap those are his words and this is the quote three days after the fact i had to demand
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.440]  exposure testing and they are reporting following up with all the people in the ambulance question
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.840]  mark bull crap they haven't even followed up with the 10 firefighters that were on duty
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:56.840]  sunday so david i mean this guy is outraged and he ought to be outraged he's been exposed to a
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.560]  disease that kills 70 percent of the people in a horrific way his family has been exposed now
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:06.600]  indirectly because there's also a possibility that they could travel to them this is something
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:10.840]  people need to get angry about they need to demand that these people are going to do something we've
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:16.200]  seen them just pull back and allow undocumented democrats to come in over the borders not do
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.880]  anything about any of this pretend that they've got the border seal pretend that they've got
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:28.280]  everything under control with the cdc they clearly are just trying to preserve their careers these
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:33.640]  are people who like obama have never ever done anything in their life other than run for political
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:38.680]  office or get a political position and so they're these people at the top are trying to
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:45.160]  to swage everybody's concerns about this while they do absolutely nothing it's the people who
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:50.200]  are not even involved with the cdc they're doing things people need to be aware of what the dangers
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.080]  are for themselves individually your government as usual is not going to be there to protect you
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:00.440]  you need to take your own precautions but now before it affects somebody in your family now is
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.640]  a time for people to get angry and to contact these people and demand that they do something
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:11.320]  they're asleep at the wheel i mean how long before we start to call for the head of the cdc
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:15.640]  to be fired over this i mean heads need to roll surely that would be the very least and of course
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:23.640]  there was the article from uh on info wars dot com earlier today about how obama back in 2010
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:30.920]  quietly rolled back precautions that would be in place for just this type of thing at the time
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:38.120]  they were worried about bird flu and of course we had 21 million people killed in 19 die in 1918
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:44.440]  far more than died in world war one because of flu and that was transmitted because of people
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:50.280]  returning home from areas where there was a war and and so it's that kind of travel today we have
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:56.760]  a very dynamic world where people are traveling across the globe in very short periods of time
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:02.680]  i mean back in 1918 if you had a nebola situation like this many people on board a ship would have
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:07.480]  already been showing symptoms before they got to the united states probably but today they can do it
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:12.920]  in just a few hours and so that's something that is of great concern so they had regulations in
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:17.960]  place that would require the airlines to keep additional records so that they could go back
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:24.840]  and do contract tracing in case something showed up that was pushed back by the airline industries
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:29.240]  the american civil liberties union was concerned that there were going to be records kept of people
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.680]  that was before we learned about ed snowden that was before we learned that they're keeping records
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:37.640]  on everything of course the only thing that they really are not going to start is stop keeping records
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:43.000]  on is anything related to political power they want to know everything about who is a threat to
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.320]  them politically but they don't want to know anything about something that would protect the
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:53.400]  american people and going back to the airliners um obviously the cdc has come out repeatedly said
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:59.000]  they're not going to call to block any airlines as far as i understand it david the direct flights
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.880]  from west africa do they go into washington dullers well it's not clear i mean there's a lot of
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:08.840]  different airlines that will go uh usually there are intermediate stops usually there's at least
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:15.400]  two to three stops uh when you're looking at traveling from uh liberia to dallas for example
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.720]  if you're going to an east coast uh the city you might get there in just one hop i don't know that
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:26.200]  there's any direct flights going from east coast cities to uh western africa i'm not sure but the
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:32.120]  issue is is that the airlines know when you get on a plane they know what your itinerary is there
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:37.240]  but there's other methods that they could do uh if they were to keep track of people's um if they
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:42.200]  were just to hold the records of people that had traveled on track on planes then if something
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:47.000]  were to happen like this they could backtrack it and look at uh contact information which would
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.760]  be something that would actually benefit the people who had been on the plane it would be
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.880]  something that in in retrospect would be helpful to them uh as you mentioned when you traveled
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.360]  and there was a concern about flu they came on to the plane where you were a passenger
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:05.480]  uh where was that china or i mean in china yeah they came on to the plane in hazmat suits and
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.080]  checked people for a temperature and that sort of thing so there's certain things that they
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:13.720]  could do nothing is a hundred percent certain but there's things that they could do to minimize
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:17.480]  the risk and that's the point you're never going to have anything that you do that's going to be
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:22.520]  a hundred percent effective but you can do your best to try to minimize the risk they're not even
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:28.920]  concerned about that breaking news as well out of uh politico bobby jindal louisiana governor
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.960]  ban travel from ebola nations he's calling on the obama administration to impose a travel ban

[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:23.480]  it's the friday edition of the alex joneshow with me your host pal joseph oatson
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:29.200]  Join by David Knight in studio. We're just gonna get back into the latest Ebola news David
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:30.680]  We had this
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.680]  Revocation of this 2010 CDC
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.820]  Measure which kind of would have protected to some extent
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.700]  America against potential Ebola victims coming in from outside the country tells about that
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:48.640]  Yeah, this is the original article back in 2010 from USA Today says Obama administration scraps quarantine
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:56.120]  Regulations and they start out by saying that the Obama administration quietly scrapped plans to enact sweeping new federal quarantine regulations
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.520]  These are regulations that they proposed back in 2005
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.520]  It would have given the federal government additional powers to detain sick airline passengers
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:09.520]  And it would have required that airlines report passengers that are sick to the CDC and
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:16.200]  Require that they collect and maintain contact information for flyers if they later need it to be traced now
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:20.920]  This is removed under the pretense that well, we don't want to violate anybody's privacy look
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:27.280]  They're looking at everybody's records when you buy your plane tickets. They're completely investigating your background
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:31.920]  They're keeping that information and of course we subsequently learned after 2010
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:33.920]  We had been telling people this for quite some time
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:38.200]  But now there's no question about it that our government is spying on every detail of our life
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:39.960]  This isn't a privacy issue
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:44.640]  This is something that could actually help the people who were flying on the plane with someone who is sick
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.200]  But of course that was scrapped four years ago
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:51.720]  And now we see that that's exactly the type of thing that needs to be done
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:57.760]  But of course the federal officials are not interested in that rather they're taking a very cavalier attitude about that
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:02.240]  There's some breaking news about what's going on in the schools there in Dallas. I saw this one
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.560]  This is an article. I think it's up on a drudge from the telegraph in the UK
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:09.520]  And they were talking about missteps that had happened
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:15.240]  Over just the last few days already with this Ebola patient in Dallas
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:22.160]  And one of the things that they said was that five children who went to four local schools in the area that had direct contact with him
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:26.880]  Were only pulled out of school on Wednesday on Wednesday on the 30th now
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:33.200]  You know, he went back in anywhere from two to three days before that they knew that he had Ebola and
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.520]  This is about the time that they're doing the press conference talking about how
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:40.080]  A professional everything has been yet for two days
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.840]  They allow these kids to continue to go to school there in Dallas and they point out that one of the schools is
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.080]  Only a few hundred yards from the apartment where he lived and they were just out there blowing
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:57.880]  You know just cleaning yesterday the sidewalk there where he had been sick and throwing up and just you know spring that around with a pressure washer
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.280]  You know, I mean it's just amazing to see what they're doing and what they're not doing
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:13.120]  And as David mentioned that this is a tweet from WFAA and that was again the same news organization that provided us with a picture of the
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:21.480]  The pressure washer cleaners hosing down the Ebola seat wearing no protective gear whatsoever a tweet out of reporter Sebastian Robertson
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.120]  Breaking Dallas company to install five remote temperature
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.160]  monitors to five schools with potential Ebola exposure
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:38.000]  So David we know that this Ebola victim had contact with numerous children. There was concern about that several days ago
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:45.320]  What does it tell us now that these five schools are installing remote temperature monitors in the Dallas area?
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:48.920]  Well, it has been a day late and dollar short from the very beginning hasn't it?
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:55.080]  I mean, they're not getting up to speed nearly quickly enough. They're not being precautious enough
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:00.560]  They're coming into this with an attitude that everything is under control. We're professionals. We know everything
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:07.640]  They're trying to protect their jobs. These bureaucrats need to understand that if this pandemic gets out of hand
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:13.680]  They're going to die along with the rest of us. They're not going to have their pass into the underground bunker with Obama
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:19.600]  I think Chris Matthews kind of realized that the other day when he said wait a minute Obama promised this wasn't gonna happen
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:27.480]  And that was just a couple of weeks ago when he was at the CDC. It's a very unusual step for a president to go to the CDC in the first place
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:28.960]  but
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:37.480]  You know, this is the sort of thing that they need to take precautions on they were talking about what happened in the kind of an hour-by-hour
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:45.520]  Breakdown of what happened. This is a Washington Post story where they interviewed one of the people that's in his family
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.520]  and she was talking about how
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.920]  She's actually the daughter of the person that he was living with and she said that she went down to Walmart
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:58.840]  Bought him a blanket brought it back and she said she knew because her family and friends are from Liberia
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:02.280]  She knew how it started that it starts with and this is very important
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:06.080]  Listen this it starts with muscle pain and we read eyes as well as fever
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.720]  So when she saw all three of these things present
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:15.280]  She pretty much knew that he had Ebola and then and she was the one who contacted the ambulance again
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:20.120]  He didn't want to go because they had just sent him away essentially with some antibiotics and the Lord's take a couple
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.680]  Aspirin's and you know call us in the morning that type of thing
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:28.200]  But she was the one who contacted the crews and her children were some of the children that came in direct contact with him
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:35.360]  We're gonna cover this and more after the break we're gonna dip into some geopolitical news as well as the UN's latest
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:41.000]  Ascent to control the internet gonna go to your calls 1-800-259-92 31

[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:55.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:06.640]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:14.240]  But it's not just the air outside. That's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:19.360]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:26.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.920]  Conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.080]  They're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics. It was clear to me
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:39.960]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:45.800]  But that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA

[02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:18.040]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans

[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:07.680]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:14.960]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?

[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:42.160]  Evil minds that plot destruction
[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:46.160]  We're back on the Alex Jones show live David Knight in studio
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:50.160]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson Alex will be back on Sunday
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:52.160]  We've got breaking news up on inforwars.com
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:58.160]  Report Liberians flood airport attempting to flee Ebola struck country
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:00.160]  This is an article by Kit Daniels
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:05.160]  Liberians are apparently flooding Robert's international airport in Harbell, Liberia
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:11.160]  In an attempt to flee the Ebola struck country raising fears that more people infected with Ebola will fly into America
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:19.160]  Elsewhere in this article they talk about the visas being processed for Nigerians also going through the roof skyrocketing
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:26.160]  So it appears that this trend of Ebola tourism which we talked about earlier could indeed be coming to the fore
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:31.160]  And you know if these Africans realize that they can get treatment in America
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:36.160]  Whereas in comparison in places like Liberia people are literally dying on the streets
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.160]  They're stumbling to get into hospitals which are completely overwhelmed
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:44.160]  And it is an incentive to try and get to America to get proper medical treatment
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:52.160]  Of course earlier we covered the story out of Breitbart where the co-worker of the Ebola victim said that he admitted
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:57.160]  He had basically flew to America as part of a desperate attempt to survive
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:04.160]  There you see the headline so this individual went to America by looks of it deliberately according to his comments
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.160]  To get treatment as David Knight an Ebola tourist
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:16.160]  You know Paul the part of what the media is selling in terms of telling people that we have some cure here called ZMAP
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:19.160]  That's part of the fallacy that's going to be driving this
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:25.160]  If by some chance he recovers that's going to add even more impetus to it
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:31.160]  And it was just yesterday that we had that doctor put on a full biohazard suit and go through the airport with written on it
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:36.160]  The CDC is lying and one of the things he said is as this builds in these countries
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:40.160]  There's going to be a lot of pressure for those people to leave those countries en masse
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.160]  And go somewhere else where they believe that they will get better quality care
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:52.160]  They're projecting again a half a million to one and a half million people the CDC is projecting in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:57.160]  Will have Ebola that's about five to fifteen percent of the population in those two countries
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:04.160]  Once it gets to that point they're already to the point where the government has essentially broken down in most areas there
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:09.160]  At least in Liberia so these people are desperate to get out of there
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:12.160]  They're being granted visas with no conditions
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.160]  We can't have any quarantine conditions put on there
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  They're just allowing these people to come
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:21.160]  This is political correctness to the most absurd extreme
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:29.160]  When we see the director of the CDC saying that the right of return is more important than preventing the disease from spreading
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:32.160]  I mean what in the world is he talking about with this new right?
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:38.160]  This right of return says when has the American government ever been concerned about our rights when we're traveling
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:41.160]  I mean whether you're traveling by plane or by car or even crossing a border
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:45.160]  They've maintained for the longest period of time that you essentially have no rights
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:52.160]  That they're going to do anything that they wish to you and yet we've got something called a right of return that trumps everything
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:55.160]  What is this guy talking about? Do you have any idea? I don't have any idea
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:04.160]  It just doesn't seem credible does it that the feds are suddenly really careful and caring about our rights in the face of this potential Ebola outbreak
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:08.160]  Whether they're trying to dampen down the hysteria by not blocking the flights remains to be seen
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:13.160]  But their very incompetence and inaction has only created more hysteria
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:16.160]  We're going to go to some of your calls now on the subject of Ebola
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.160]  Mike in Maryland, you're on the air, go ahead Mike
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:27.160]  Hey, thanks for taking my call and that Syrian lady, she's one courageous person here
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:31.160]  I wanted to bring, it's an honor to talk to you about the way
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:35.160]  I want to bring something to your attention, this is from the Federick News Post
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:40.160]  dated October 1st, Federick is the home of Fort Detrick, Maryland
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:43.160]  I might remind the listeners here
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:49.160]  The title of the article from the local paper is Federal Decision to Bring Ebola Patient to Airport
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:58.160]  And the article goes on to say that the decision to fly an American physician into Federick out of the heart of the Ebola outbreak
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:01.160]  was made with little input from local officials
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:07.160]  The State Department decided Sunday to fly the physician from Sierra Leone
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:12.160]  versus the guy from Dallas that came from Liberia
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.160]  So he's from Sierra Leone to Federick Municipal Airport
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:24.160]  The doctor's identity is not known, but the person was exposed to the Ebola virus while volunteering for an aid organization
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:32.160]  The National Institutes of Health has not yet confirmed or denied if the physician has contracted the deadly disease
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.160]  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:38.160]  The virus has taken more than 3,000 lives in West Africa
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:42.160]  The city has been working on a memorandum of understanding with NIH
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:48.160]  and Fort Detrick regarding procedures when the city airport is used to transport patients
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:52.160]  Frederick, Amir, Mandy, McClellan
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  So that can go on if you like
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:56.160]  No, we've got the article up
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:59.160]  I've got local officials have one-day notice before doctor exposure
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:01.160]  Ebola flown to Federick
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:03.160]  So again, David, you know
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:08.160]  It's interesting that they'd fly him into that location where Fort Detrick is
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:10.160]  because that's where they work on bio weapons
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.160]  And there's been a lot of talk about the involvement of the U.S. military
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:18.160]  Of course, the U.S. military is deeply involved with this ZMAP vaccine
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:22.160]  which apparently doesn't look to be necessarily effective
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.160]  It was given along with blood transfusions
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:28.160]  and it's not clear that the two people who recovered
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.160]  recovered from the blood transfusion or did they recover from the ZMAP vaccine?
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:35.160]  They were given both of those things on the same day
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:37.160]  And so it's not clear
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.160]  In both of those cases, both the ZMAP vaccine comes with antibodies
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:46.160]  In other words, it's not giving you a version of the virus that your body then reacts to
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:47.160]  and creates antibodies
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.160]  No, they're injecting you with what they call plant bodies
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.160]  because these are genetically modified organisms, antibodies
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:59.160]  supposedly of Ebola that were grown in plants
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:02.160]  But when he got the blood transfusion of an Ebola survivor
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:05.160]  he was also getting antibodies from that guy's blood
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:07.160]  So in both cases he was getting antibodies
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:11.160]  There were subsequently other people that were given ZMAP who then died
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:15.160]  So it's not clear that that is a cure
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:18.160]  But just talking about all this fear mongering that's going on
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.160]  Everybody's saying there's fear mongering, there's panic about this
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:26.160]  Look at the fear mongering that goes on just a couple of weeks ago
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:28.160]  about global warming
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:33.160]  People were marching by the thousands in streets of various countries
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:37.160]  and protesting saying something needs to be done about global warming
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.160]  Look, nobody has died from global warming
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.160]  It's not something that can even be measured according to most scientists
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.160]  It looks like that's a trend that they're now saying it's a pause in global warming
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:50.160]  Well, it didn't happen
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:55.160]  They measured an increase in CO2 but their models that predicted a subsequent increase with temperature
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:57.160]  that hasn't happened either
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:40:59.160]  And yet we have a real hockey stick here
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:02.160]  You know, Al Gore is pushing the hockey stick that Michael Mann created
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.160]  saying this is the end of the world
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:08.160]  We do have a hockey stick going on with this pandemic in these countries
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.160]  and people don't understand what to be afraid about and what not to be afraid about
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:16.160]  They don't understand how to assess the risks
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.160]  And that's what's really concerning me is trying to get this information out
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:23.160]  where people need to be concerned about what the real threats are here
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.160]  Sanger in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:28.160]  Hi gentlemen, thank you for having me
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:32.160]  Just touching on the subject of Ebola and what Alex has been talking about lately
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:34.160]  about internet censorship
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.160]  Right now on Instagram, if you try and type in
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:42.160]  a natural feed is called Garcinia Cola
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.160]  If you try and type it in on Instagram, they won't allow you to actually post it
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.160]  And certain friends of mine have actually had themselves logged out of their account
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.160]  and their password changed and it happened to me as well
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:57.160]  And so I just wanted to inform you and the listeners as well
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:00.160]  that there is censorship right now of our internet
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.160]  and there is something that can stop the spread of Ebola
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:06.160]  that they're not letting us be aware of
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:11.160]  So you're saying that Instagram is censoring images related to Ebola or information?
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:14.160]  Yes, if you try and post a comment
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:18.160]  and I just tried to tag Barack Obama's official Instagram on it and send it to him
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:21.160]  and Instagram will have a notification that comes up
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:24.160]  and it says that it goes against their policy
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:26.160]  and for the protection of users
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:31.160]  and if you have a problem you can either try and contact them or just dismiss it
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.160]  Okay, that's interesting
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:37.160]  Do you think they ever censored a picture of a lonely polar bear sitting on an ice cream?
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.160]  Do you think they ever censored it?
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:40.160]  I would think that would be okay
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:43.160]  George in California, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.160]  George, go ahead, you're on the air
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:49.160]  George is not there
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.160]  Bob in Rhode Island, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.160]  Do we have Bob?
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:00.160]  Dr. Gill on the line
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:01.160]  Do we have Dr. Gill?
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:02.160]  Yes, Dr. Gill
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.160]  Is this the doctor that was in Atlanta protesting the CDC's line?
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:08.160]  That is correct
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:10.160]  Oh, thank you for calling in
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:11.160]  Thank you
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:12.160]  What questions about you have?
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.160]  Thank you for giving me this opportunity to get the word out
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:19.160]  that Ebola is coming to the America and the CDC has been sugarcoating it
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:22.160]  or they're terribly derelict in duty and not predicting it
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:26.160]  So Dr. Gill, obviously you hit the headlines yesterday
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:31.160]  We have an article, Dr. Protest CDC by showing up at Atlanta Airport in Hazmat Gear
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:33.160]  CDC is lying
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:38.160]  What was the first example of CDC incompetence in the aftermath of this Ebola outbreak
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:43.160]  that really raised your suspicions to the fact that they might be being dishonest about this situation?
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:45.160]  It's happened the last few months
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:47.160]  Any practitioner can connect the dots
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:50.160]  There are a million people on the continent of Africa that are quarantined
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:53.160]  10,000 people leave West Africa a day
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.160]  It's a matter of time before every third world country is seated with this terribly deadly disease
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.160]  They also share infrastructure of health, medicine, shambles
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:05.160]  Poor sanitation and distrust of the government
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:07.160]  Every country to the south of us
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:13.160]  And once it becomes endemic in third world countries as it will in Africa
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.160]  We will be importing these cases on an hourly basis
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:19.160]  Sure, we can tamp down this
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:22.160]  We can stop this Ebola out down
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:25.160]  I have no question at all this cluster we're going to take care of
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:26.160]  But what happened?
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:31.160]  It's already outstretched the ability of the Texas Health Department to respond
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:33.160]  There's blind people from the CDC
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:35.160]  But what happens when a dozen of these should pop up?
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.160]  The CDC still doesn't have it
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:39.160]  They say if another one shows up
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:42.160]  It's when another shows up
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:45.160]  So let's play the video if we have it
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.160]  The doctor at the airport yesterday
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:51.160]  You showed up with obviously the hazmat suit on CDC is lying
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.160]  What was the reaction you received from the TSA officials
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:59.160]  The other airport officials there at the airport in Atlanta yesterday?
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:01.160]  TSA was most cordial
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:03.160]  I had met with them the day before
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:08.160]  I had flown from Guatemala through international concourse and customs integration
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.160]  Mind you, no thermal scanning is going on despite what the CDC told USA today yesterday
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:17.160]  But the reaction from Delta, I also warned Delta day before
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:19.160]  But it didn't make it up the chain of command
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:21.160]  I was able to get all the way to the gate
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:27.160]  I did take off the garb for the security of course
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:30.160]  But I did make it all the way to the gate and took off everything
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.160]  I put it in a satchel, carried it onto the plane
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.160]  I was ready to go, they were ready to close the door
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:39.160]  The Delta officials stormed the plane, jerked me off
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:41.160]  Took my bags and said, we want the gear
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:43.160]  We need to confiscate the gear, you're not flying
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:45.160]  It was a little bump in the road at the end
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:47.160]  But by the time I sat down that plane before that
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:49.160]  I just breathed a great sigh of relief
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:51.160]  Thank God we got the message started
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:53.160]  The American Constitutional Journal
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:55.160]  They were out there just filming everything
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:56.160]  And photographing everything
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:58.160]  Because I want to make sure I wasn't going to have a
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:00.160]  Don't taze me bro moment
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:02.160]  Thank God for that, we started this going viral
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:04.160]  And the conversation has begun
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:06.160]  Well that's very important, thank you for doing that
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.160]  And it's that type of event that gets people's attention
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:13.160]  So it really was necessary for you to do it
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:16.160]  In that manner, I think, to get people to listen
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:19.160]  I've been trying to figure out for months
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:21.160]  How to get the public's attention
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:23.160]  We've known these clusters were coming
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:26.160]  We had meetings months ago in the Green County Medical Society
[02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:28.160]  Yet Obama came out two weeks ago
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:31.160]  The very same week it was misdiagnosed in Dallas
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.160]  Because our alert was down because Obama
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:36.160]  And freedom from the CDC says a very, very small chance
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.160]  We knew that is either a lie or they're incompetent
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:42.160]  Yes, yes, what would you like to see happen?
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:45.160]  What would you suggest that the CDC do?
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:47.160]  I wish we could close the borders
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:49.160]  But we've been dragging our feet to the south
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:51.160]  I wish we could close the borders
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:53.160]  Make every person coming in the United States
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:56.160]  Have a three week isolation period
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:58.160]  You know, we're not going to stop this
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:00.160]  Until we catch every single case
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.160]  Maybe this means thermal scanning everywhere
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:05.160]  I don't know, but I'll tell you what we do need to do
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:08.160]  We need to get people with fevers out of the hospital now
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:11.160]  Because it's showing up, it's going person to person
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:13.160]  In the United States and the flu season is coming
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:15.160]  And we're not going to be able to tell the difference
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:17.160]  The flu, by the way, gets your flu shot
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.160]  Because you don't want to wind up in quarantine
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.160]  Because you have a fever, gets your flu shot
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:25.160]  We don't want to have people showing up to the ERs
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:27.160]  And coming in contact with the staff
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:29.160]  And then all of a sudden we lose that shift
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:31.160]  And if somebody else shows up, we lose that shift
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:33.160]  The PRN workers get scared and they quit
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:35.160]  Next thing we know, we're without healthcare workers
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:38.160]  We must remove Ebola from the hospitals
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.160]  The hospitals are saying they're prepared
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.160]  I would ask every listener to call their hospital
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:44.160]  Call their director of nursing
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.160]  Ask how many, spare, negative pressure rooms you have
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:52.160]  Negative pressure removes the aerosolized hemorrhagic vomit
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.160]  Coughing from the atmosphere filters it
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:57.160]  Puts it outside the hospital by circulating it
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:47:58.160]  To the patient next door
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:00.160]  Ask them how many spare negative pressure rooms they have
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:02.160]  Which is absolutely essential
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:03.160]  And they'll probably say zero
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:05.160]  We have to work every time we get up
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:07.160]  Level four isolation or something like that
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.160]  Yeah, I would disagree with you about the flu shot
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.160]  We've seen a lot of people who come down with a flu
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:14.160]  After getting the flu and there's other issues
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:15.160]  Involved with that as well
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:17.160]  But could you address for a moment
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.160]  What you think about the way this was handled
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:23.160]  In terms of the cleanup of the sidewalk
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:25.160]  The way they sent guys out there without any protective clothing
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:29.160]  Pressure washing that days after they knew about this
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:32.160]  And then, actually it was yesterday they did that
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:34.160]  And then today they're just now getting around
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:36.160]  To cleaning the apartment
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.160]  Could you address that?
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:40.160]  We flew this doctor from West Africa a month ago
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:43.160]  At 55 gallons sat outside Emory University Hospital
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.160]  For over a week with the medical waste
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:47.160]  Wonder what we're going to do with it
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:49.160]  You know, they need to be proactive
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:52.160]  Not crossing this bridge after the fact
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.160]  Same thing with this family in Dallas
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:56.160]  They sat for three days in an apartment
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.160]  With blood, urine, feces, soap, mattresses, and carpet
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:03.160]  While the CDC goes, what are we going to do about this now?
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:05.160]  They should have been proactive
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:07.160]  Institute of Policy Procedures
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.160]  And implemented them months ago
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:12.160]  They've been derelict in their duty
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:15.160]  And I point my finger squarely at Frieden and say
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:17.160]  That you use their derelict in their duty
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:19.160]  Get the ball rolling
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.160]  Well, there's still a conflict in terms of transporting this
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:25.160]  The CDC is saying that it's okay to what was holding up
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:28.160]  They say the cleanup of this apartment was number one
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:30.160]  Finding a contractor who wanted to do the job
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:34.160]  And every municipality should work on that contractor right now
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:36.160]  Our municipality should be calling the trash
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:38.160]  In Springfield, Missouri right now
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:40.160]  Should be calling the trash companies to say
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:42.160]  Who's going to remove our infectious waste?
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:44.160]  This stuff should have been done months ago
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:46.160]  Not after we need it
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:48.160]  And the transportation agencies are the ones
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:50.160]  Who are putting the blocks on
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:52.160]  Transporting this stuff on the highway
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:54.160]  Whereas the CDC says just go with it
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:56.160]  That's fine, we're not concerned about that
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:00.160]  Now, at Emory, they had some industrial autoclaves
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.160]  That they eventually brought on site
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:04.160]  To get rid of the medical waste, is that correct?
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:08.160]  I understand there were several days of intense negotiation
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:10.160]  With management companies that they worked out something
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:12.160]  I don't know the details
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:14.160]  Well, you're right, they need to be proactive on this
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:18.160]  But instead, what we've seen is them reacting several days
[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:20.160]  After these things occurred
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:22.160]  Letting children continue to go to school
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:24.160]  Allowing people to walk across the sidewalk
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:28.160]  Where this patient was violently vomiting days before
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.160]  They're actualizing the vomit with a power washer
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:34.160]  Oh my god!
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:38.160]  In the news, every day, not get any worse
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:40.160]  I understand there's a suspected Ebola patient
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:42.160]  At Washington DC right now
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:44.160]  We'll be back with more from Dr. Gil Mobley
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:46.160]  After the break, he was the doctor
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:48.160]  Who staged the anti-CDC protests
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:50.160]  At Atlanta Airport yesterday
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:52.160]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show live

[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:06.160]  No one has put together a formula
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:08.160]  That focuses directly on brain health
[02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:12.160]  Nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time

[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:36.160]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:37.160]  I had to try it for myself
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:38.160]  Talk about the effects
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:40.160]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:42.160]  I have drive to go to the gym
[02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:45.160]  I feel like I look better, I feel better, I feel sexier
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:46.160]  I love it
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:48.160]  Even if you don't believe in supplements

[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:17.040]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show on this Friday, edition live, again very important
[02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:24.600]  to keep a healthy immune system. Infowarslife.com has the new stock of SilverBullet, many of
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:29.320]  you have been waiting for this to come back in stock, concentrated to a powerful 30 parts

[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:46.400]  market that SilverBullet available exclusively at Infowarslife.com just back in stock. Now
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:52.760]  we're talking to Dr Gil Mobley who yesterday hit the headlines for his anti-CDC protest
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:59.160]  saying that the CDC is asleep at the wheel with this Ebola outbreak. Dr Mobley, now we're
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:03.000]  getting reports out of Liberia that people are flooding the airports there trying to
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.360]  get into the United States for treatment. We had comments from one of the co-workers
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:12.360]  of the Ebola victim in Dallas who said that he had entered America in a quote desperate
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:17.280]  attempt to survive. Do you think we're going to see a wave of Ebola tourism in light of
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:23.520]  this incident? Well, yes we will and I'll mind you and mention to you that I came through
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:29.160]  international customs returning from a medical mission trip in Guatemala just Wednesday evening
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.440]  night day before yesterday and despite what USA Today said on the front page yesterday
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:37.800]  that we're doing thermal screening at airports, we are not at Hartsfield International Airport,
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:42.520]  the busiest airport in the world. No one asked where I was, no one asked if I had been sick,
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:47.200]  no one asked if I had a fever and there was no thermal scanning. The CDC is asleep at
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:51.920]  the wheel and there have been derelictions of duty and I point my finger squarely at
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:58.440]  Dr Frieden and say derelictions of duty, sir, get the ball on rolling.
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:03.520]  It seems to be a pretty pervasive ignorance because this article that we have up on Infowarslife.com
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:09.000]  about Sheriff's Office, officers are fearful after being ordered into the apartment where
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.400]  this Ebola patient was staying in Dallas. The amazing thing to me is not only did they
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:19.200]  order these five deputies to go there but they were joined by a doctor and the head
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:23.640]  of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. I just don't understand, is it
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:30.160]  because the CDC is telling people not to worry about any of this?
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:34.720]  They need to do whatever they can to avoid panic. Panic will just, but not lie or sugar
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:41.320]  coat, but panic will cause irrational actions. We need to have frank, honest talk. Right
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:46.960]  now either they're just omitting it or they're just lying. The fact that these clusters are
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.480]  going to overwhelm our capacity to handle them.
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:56.960]  Yeah, but clearly there's the head of the Health and Human Services Department and
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.960]  a doctor who are accompanying these officers in the apartment that had not been cleaned.
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:08.800]  It had bedding, it had blankets that had been in direct contact with this patient who had
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:14.800]  been vomiting, had severe diarrhea, all these symptoms where he's losing bodily fluid. It's
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.840]  in the apartment, they haven't cleaned it and yet these people don't seem to be aware
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:21.960]  of the threat that that poses to them.
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:26.320]  And why is this? It's because the CDC has been asleep at the wheel. We should have had
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:33.280]  policies, procedures implemented long ago. This epidemic has been ravaging West Africa
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:34.800]  for a half a year.
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:38.880]  I'm just now scratching our heads. What do we do about the blood-soaked mattress? What
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:43.480]  do we do about the 55 gallon containers outside Emory? We're past due.
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:49.560]  Okay, that's going to wrap it up. For our guest, Dr. Gil Mobley, we'll continue to track
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:53.520]  your protest against the CDC. Thanks for joining us on the show today.
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:55.440]  Thanks for helping us get the word out, sir.
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:59.320]  Thank you. That's going to wrap it up for the show today. Alex Jones, of course, will
