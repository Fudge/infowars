[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:32.640]  welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Monday June 3rd 2013 this is Mike Adams the
[00:32.640 --> 00:38.120]  health ranger filling in for Alex today who is in the UK he has successfully
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.400]  arrived there they did not kick him out of the country at least I I haven't heard
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.960]  about it if they did and I'm sure we'd be the first to hear so he's there getting
[00:46.960 --> 00:50.720]  ready for the Bilderberg conference and he's going to be joining us in fact in
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.880]  the second hour today calling in also joined by David Ike in the second hour
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.120]  in fact today is a show that's just packed with great personalities we've
[01:00.120 --> 01:05.840]  got Gerald Salente hosting the third hour and I'm just here for the first hour
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.080]  to get things rolling so breaking news today on Drudge in fact Drudge is
[01:11.080 --> 01:15.680]  linking to this right now the US Supreme Court has ruled that police can take
[01:15.680 --> 01:21.920]  DNA swabs from arrestees just like taking your fingerprints they can now
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.360]  take your DNA we're going to talk about this during the first hour of the Alex
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.920]  Jones show here why this is such a big deal it means that the government can
[01:30.920 --> 01:36.840]  take your DNA essentially anytime they want and enter it into a database that
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.920]  will be used against you now every power that we give to the federal government
[01:41.920 --> 01:46.440]  turns out to be used against us in ways that never could have been imagined by
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.440]  our founding fathers so this is a very disturbing decision by the Supreme Court
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.200]  and it was a sharply divided court that made this decision there were four
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.280]  dissenting justices who said that the court was allowing police to have a
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.120]  significant change a significant expansion in police powers so we're
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.480]  going to talk about that but it turns out that your DNA this is the big story
[02:09.480 --> 02:15.360]  really your DNA is now claimed to be owned by the federal government and they
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.440]  can do anything they want with it in fact there have been cases that's still
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.520]  happening right now where medical science has ripped off the DNA of patients
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.320]  and used it to create cancer tumor cancer tumors that they use for
[02:29.320 --> 02:33.080]  experimental purposes to study anti-cancer drugs and they never pay that
[02:33.080 --> 02:37.600]  patient any kind of royalty and and they don't intend to so we've got that
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.520]  story coming up also the official Bilderberg attendee list has been
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.360]  released and this is posted right now on info wars dot com we've got the full
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.200]  list we're going to break down for you some of the big names who that are on
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.760]  that list because it is a big deal remember the Bilderberg conference is
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.680]  something that was called a conspiracy theory just a few years ago they said
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.440]  it doesn't exist even though it does just like the ammo purchases by DHS it
[03:05.440 --> 03:08.920]  doesn't exist it's a conspiracy theory that they're buying ammo but they are
[03:08.920 --> 03:12.880]  buying ammo but it's not for you it's not to be used against you that's that's
[03:12.880 --> 03:18.580]  the explain explanation now in addition to that story we've got this story the
[03:18.580 --> 03:25.360]  Al Gore backlash why environmentalists are celebrating rising CO2 levels and to
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.880]  explain that later today on the show I brought some science flashcards with me
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.160]  here right there to explain to you a little bit about the table of elements
[03:35.160 --> 03:41.880]  and why carbon dioxide is a nutrient not a pollutant why plants and forests and
[03:41.880 --> 03:46.160]  gardens need carbon dioxide that's our gun we're showing you right there let's
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.920]  find let's find something else oh hydrogen yeah and that wonderful we're
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.960]  gonna go through a little a little bit of a science lesson which I know you'll
[03:53.960 --> 03:57.800]  enjoy because it has pictures and flashcards just a little flashback to
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.960]  high school yeah your favorite time science class right anyway we're gonna
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.120]  explain all that right here on the Alex Jones show and in addition to that
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.480]  we're covering the other news that's breaking today we've got two-thirds of
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.020]  Americans don't know if they will insure under Obamacare because of course
[04:14.020 --> 04:18.640]  Obamacare which promised to make your health insurance more affordable is
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.560]  actually making it more expensive by far in fact Californians are expected to
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.760]  pay 146% more for their health insurance premiums under Obamacare and
[04:30.760 --> 04:38.080]  other states are paying or going to pay up to 400% more for health care health
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.160]  insurance under Obamacare gee it's called the affordable care act but no one
[04:44.160 --> 04:48.600]  can afford it all that and much more straight ahead as we continue here on
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.240]  the Alex Jones show stay with us

[08:29.200 --> 08:33.880]  is Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today Alex is in the UK
[08:33.880 --> 08:40.680]  getting ready to break down the Bilderberg conference and as a journalist
[08:40.680 --> 08:44.360]  a news reporter I don't mean break it down I don't mean like like bash the
[08:44.360 --> 08:49.080]  doors in no I mean he's there to cover it and by the way if you want to watch
[08:49.080 --> 08:54.760]  the live coverage here on info wars just go to info wars.com slash B as in
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.040]  Bilderberg got it info wars.com slash B is the website where all the live
[09:00.040 --> 09:04.920]  coverage is going to be happening and Alex Jones is there we've got other
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.720]  info wars reporters there Richard Reeves is on location right now of course Paul
[09:09.720 --> 09:15.960]  Joseph Watson who lives there is there we've also got I heard Luke Rudowski is
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.960]  there covering it from We Are Change and many other people so expect a lot of
[09:19.960 --> 09:24.920]  interesting reports to come out of the Bilderberg conference all this week and
[09:24.920 --> 09:28.480]  info wars.com is the headquarters where you're going to get the most information
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.720]  on that more than any other news source in the world and by the way we have the
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.360]  official Bilderberg attendee list and it includes this is this is breaking news
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.600]  this is the attendee list was just released it includes Jeff Bezos founder
[09:43.600 --> 09:49.860]  of amazon.com vice chairman of Goldman Sachs gee we didn't expect that one
[09:49.860 --> 09:55.400]  Michael Evans the former secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner gee there's
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.000]  another big unexpected name the general general of the US Army David Petraeus
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.200]  yeah I start to see a pattern here Eric Schmidt the chairman of Google there's
[10:08.200 --> 10:11.680]  another big name and a lot of other names but gee according to the mainstream
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.800]  media all these people are going to a meeting that doesn't exist gee do you
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.440]  think do you think Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt and General Petraeus would all
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.400]  go to a meeting that doesn't exist really no they're going to the Bilderberg
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.800]  meeting which does exist and it's not a conspiracy theory it is a meeting of
[10:32.800 --> 10:38.080]  some of the the most influential and powerful and maybe power hungry people
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.640]  around the world who are getting together to talk about how they're going to
[10:42.640 --> 10:46.000]  run the world how they're going to influence the world they're going to
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.400]  shape policy and control people and probably depopulate the planet has been
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.080]  one of the topics that's been talked about in the past but certainly they
[10:55.080 --> 10:59.240]  want to own the planet so probably the big topic this year this is just my
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.100]  personal conjecture on the topic is to figure out how can they crash the
[11:04.100 --> 11:07.400]  global debt markets in a way that transfers all the wealth from the hands
[11:07.400 --> 11:11.560]  of the working class into the hands of the ultra wealthy elite who are
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.680]  primarily the people at the meeting how can they how can they make that crash
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.400]  happen so that it just crashes in their direction that's probably the big topic
[11:20.400 --> 11:25.240]  but we'll see so watch info wars calm all week long and listen to the Alex
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.600]  Jones show for updates on that now big breaking news from the U.S. Supreme
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.280]  Court just breaking this morning in fact and this is the top headline on Drudge
[11:34.280 --> 11:40.880]  this morning Drudge says ruled take their DNA the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a
[11:40.880 --> 11:49.400]  ruling that allows police across the country to take your DNA when they arrest
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.920]  you to swab your DNA involuntarily on your part they just take it from you
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.000]  essentially by force in the same way that they take your fingerprints the
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  now going to take your DNA well why is this a big deal and why did four of the
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.880]  justices at the U.S. Supreme Court have dissenting opinions warning about the
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.960]  expansion of police powers this is a big deal because it essentially says that
[12:13.960 --> 12:19.840]  the U.S. government claims ownership over your DNA now here's why that really
[12:19.840 --> 12:25.000]  matters number one your DNA is unique and it's supposed to be yours supposed to
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.320]  be private it's part of your biology is part of your body it's an intimate part
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.640]  of your body why can the government just take that from you and if the
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.080]  government can take it from you what can they do with it now here's where it
[12:37.080 --> 12:44.240]  gets really scary you're probably aware of the the gene hypothesis of disease
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.120]  right you've heard of Angelina Jolie having a double mastectomy because she
[12:49.120 --> 12:55.080]  carried a gene mutation called the the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene BRCA1 and 2
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.280]  genes that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer this
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.560]  hypothesis is wrong your genes do not determine your health outcome they might
[13:06.560 --> 13:12.160]  have a 1% influence over your health 99% of your health is up to you it's based
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.840]  on what you eat it's based on avoiding GMOs and avoiding fluoride and avoiding
[13:15.840 --> 13:19.760]  toxic chemicals and avoiding smoking and fried foods and all those things that
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.320]  you know are bad for you most of your health outcome is up to you probably
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.160]  again 99% but the government has been saying that the genes determine your
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.480]  health outcome now here's the danger what happens when they take your DNA
[13:35.480 --> 13:39.040]  because you're arrested they put it in a government database which is of course
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.880]  what they do with everything the government loves to have databases on
[13:41.880 --> 13:48.000]  the people and then they analyze your DNA and they decide oh you have a gene
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.440]  for mental illness then they use that information to take away your second
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.880]  amendment rights that's right a knock on your door hey we're here to take your
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.760]  guns because when you were arrested last week we ran a DNA analysis over your
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.840]  genome sequence and we discovered that you had the gene for mental illness haha
[14:08.840 --> 14:12.520]  the jokes on you were taking your guns that's what the government is gonna do
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.120]  with this or even worse they're gonna say oh you want to sign up for Obamacare
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.760]  because you just you want to pay 100 to 200 even 400% more for your health
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.120]  insurance than you used to pay because Obamacare is raising the rates on
[14:27.120 --> 14:32.200]  everybody around the country well guess what you're disqualified because you have
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.520]  a gene for breast cancer or you have a gene for liver cancer or you have a gene
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.640]  for sickle cell anemia if you want to get down that road they can use this with
[14:42.640 --> 14:48.440]  a racial bias to take away your right to have basic healthcare basic human
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.880]  dignity in a medical system that essentially respects no human dignity by
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.200]  the way they can use your genes against you they can use them against you in a
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.280]  court of law they can say let's say they take your children because they don't
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.440]  like the fact that you're not vaccinating your children or you're
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.360]  homeschooling your children to give them a real education instead of the watered
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.640]  down government run public education system right so they take your children
[15:13.640 --> 15:19.960]  and then they they arrest you they get a gene swab a DNA swab they run that the
[15:19.960 --> 15:23.600]  genetic code from that and then they say well you have the gene of a bad
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.280]  parent so you can't have your kids back we're gonna take your kids because the
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.960]  state knows best we're gonna take your kids and say you have a bad parenting
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.240]  gene you see this is the mythology that's so dangerous they can say your
[15:37.240 --> 15:43.240]  genes are anything they want they can say you have a gene for being a rebel they
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.440]  can say you have a gene for being a patriot which they now call terrorism
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.720]  oh you have the gene for speaking out that's dangerous to the government
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.360]  Obama says you shouldn't listen to those voices maybe you should arrest those
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.800]  voices put them in jail because they've got the gene for speaking out so
[15:59.800 --> 16:05.280]  basically anybody who's got genetics that are part of humanity you know the
[16:05.280 --> 16:11.600]  the will to live the will to to exercise free speech the the liberty gene you
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.240]  might even say if there is such a thing they're gonna target that and target you
[16:16.240 --> 16:20.680]  because of your genetic code this is a very dangerous precedent and it will be
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.880]  abused mark my words here on this day on the Alex Jones show my prediction is
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.920]  that this will be abused in highly destructive ways against the American
[16:31.920 --> 16:38.320]  people so the Supreme Court has just sent us down a hellish path of abuse of
[16:38.320 --> 16:44.360]  police powers over our DNA now on the DNA topic and by the way bringing
[16:44.360 --> 16:50.520]  back up Angelina Jolie who continues to be in the media for her decision to have
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.040]  both of her breasts removed even though they were perfectly healthy breasts she
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.800]  did not have cancer she just had a gene that's supposed to be linked with cancer
[16:57.800 --> 17:03.080]  and I strongly criticize Angelina's decision I didn't criticize her as a
[17:03.080 --> 17:07.560]  person I I don't know her I can't really criticize her I'm criticizing her
[17:07.560 --> 17:12.640]  decision but the reason this is important is because right now today
[17:12.640 --> 17:18.080]  4,000 human genes are owned and patented by corporations and
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.920]  universities did you know that 4,000 of your genes now the human body has about
[17:23.920 --> 17:31.640]  20,000 genes 4,000 of those or roughly 20% are patented by someone else what
[17:31.640 --> 17:35.960]  does this mean it means you don't even own your own genetic code you follow me
[17:35.960 --> 17:41.200]  on this somebody else claims to own your code who gave them that claim over
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.640]  your human body who gave them that that right to claim they own it the US
[17:46.640 --> 17:52.200]  government the US patent and trademark office gave them that claim they
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.400]  handed out your genes to other corporations and universities and one
[17:56.400 --> 18:00.640]  of those corporations and universities doing with that monopoly that patent
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.760]  that they've been given by the US patent office they're using it to charge you
[18:04.760 --> 18:10.880]  monopoly prices on the testing of those genes that's right so all those women who
[18:10.880 --> 18:14.840]  are listening to Angelina Jolie and are saying well gee I should go get tested
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.600]  for the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene they're having to pay 3,000 to
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.560]  $4,000 out of pocket for a genetic test that should only cost 100 bucks the
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.800]  reason it costs 3,000 to $4,000 is because you have to pay these monopoly
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.600]  royalties to a company called myriad genetics out of Utah that owns the patent
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.160]  on those genes because the US patent office gave them that patent it's
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.880]  insane and it's going to be used against you it's going to be used against women
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.000]  especially against women who are all freaked out about whether they have this
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.040]  breast cancer gene it turns out 99% of them don't have it so you have to test
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.360]  100 women to find one who has it so you're going to spend $300,000 on this
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.360]  gene testing in order to find one woman who has one gene that only has about a
[19:03.360 --> 19:10.560]  1% influence over her cancer outcome that's insanity that's a medical insanity
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.040]  patent insanity intellectual property insanity and now the US government says
[19:15.040 --> 19:20.880]  we can take your genes anytime we want yeah we pull you over we can just swab
[19:20.880 --> 19:24.320]  your mouth and if you refuse guess what we're going to stick a gun in your face
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.160]  and make you do it or take it to jail and then make you do it there they could
[19:28.160 --> 19:33.200]  take your DNA they can assign ownership of your DNA to someone else as they've
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.080]  been doing and they can use that against you over and over and over again
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.720]  this decision by the US Supreme Court is a violation not just of human rights
[19:43.720 --> 19:49.360]  and civil rights it is a violation of universal law the violation of God's
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.400]  law if you want to say it that way it's a violation of basic human dignity and
[19:54.400 --> 20:00.000]  basic genetic privacy it is wrong and we'll be back stay with us
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.400]  oh we travel so much and having a fake TV well it gives added peace of mind
[20:05.400 --> 20:10.760]  burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool
[20:10.760 --> 20:14.600]  even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching
[20:14.600 --> 20:19.000]  television as a recent widow living alone it gives me a great peace of mind to
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.600]  set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motors and pedestrians will
[20:23.600 --> 20:28.360]  think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home fake TV

[24:08.160 --> 24:14.840]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[24:16.600 --> 24:21.800]  all right we're back welcome to the Alex Jones show we're continuing here by
[24:21.800 --> 24:27.040]  the way in the second hour we've got Alex joining us by phone from the UK where
[24:27.040 --> 24:32.240]  he's covering the Bilderberg conference and check out all the latest videos and
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.720]  I think you've even got real-time text messaging or at least articles at
[24:36.720 --> 24:42.040]  info wars.com slash B. B is in Bilderberg David Ike will be joining us in the
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.680]  second hour also with Alex Jones it's going to be a really fun and interesting
[24:46.680 --> 24:51.560]  conversation and then the third hour is going to be hosted by Gerald Salenti
[24:51.560 --> 24:57.480]  so Gerald happens to be my favorite guest here on the Alex Jones show so I'm
[24:57.480 --> 25:01.160]  super excited that he's going to be hosting the third hour and maybe I'll
[25:01.160 --> 25:04.680]  get to talk to him for a few minutes as we intro the third hour but then I'm
[25:04.680 --> 25:08.600]  out of here and I'm going to do some special reports for the nightly news on
[25:08.600 --> 25:15.080]  the CO2 hoax the carbon dioxide hoax which we'll get into here in the next
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.000]  segment but before we do that let's let's break down some of the other news
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.920]  that's happening mayhem in the city New York City 25 people were shot in the
[25:25.920 --> 25:32.440]  last 48 hours gosh that's almost one person every two hours that's quite a
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.040]  quite a lot of shooting for a city that says it's making you safe by taking away
[25:37.040 --> 25:44.000]  all your guns yet more proof that gun control doesn't work because of course
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.440]  only the criminals have the guns in New York City and Chicago and everywhere
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.440]  else that they try their their gun control agenda just flat out does not
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.280]  work period does not work you notice there's not a bunch of shootings like
[25:56.280 --> 26:02.800]  that in I don't know central Texas that's cuz cuz everybody's armed including
[26:02.800 --> 26:07.120]  myself right now at this very minute is sitting here in the studio carrying a
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.720]  Glock as I always do everybody's armed around here there's not a there's not
[26:10.720 --> 26:15.200]  crazy shootings people are actually pretty darn polite to each other when
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.840]  everybody knows their their carrying so in other news info wars reporters
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.040]  confront Bilderberg security Paul Joseph Watson and Richard Reeves were
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.720]  confronting the hotel that cancelled their reservations apparently in
[26:30.720 --> 26:36.720]  violation of the 2010 Equality Act in the UK which says that people cannot be
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.880]  denied they cannot be discriminated against for their political beliefs but
[26:41.880 --> 26:47.200]  the hotel appears to be discriminating against the Alex Jones crew precisely
[26:47.200 --> 26:51.080]  because of their political beliefs this story is posted right now on info wars
[26:51.080 --> 26:57.480]  calm it's by Paul Joseph Watson what is that video it's a video of them at the
[26:57.480 --> 27:03.160]  hotel confronting the reception personnel there and asking why their
[27:03.160 --> 27:07.520]  rooms were canceled well gee we know why they're canceled because you're with
[27:07.520 --> 27:14.280]  Alex Jones and we can't allow Alex Jones to exercise free speech in the United
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.840]  Kingdom that would be a terrible terrible thing so the oppression has
[27:18.840 --> 27:22.280]  already begun at the Bilderberg conference and you can expect there
[27:22.280 --> 27:27.240]  would be more interesting stories all week long now two-thirds of Americans
[27:27.240 --> 27:29.680]  don't know if they will ensure under Obamacare I mentioned this in the last
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.520]  segment but I have a few other comments here Obamacare has been described as a
[27:34.520 --> 27:39.560]  train wreck it's already derailed it's running off the tracks it's just a matter
[27:39.560 --> 27:45.400]  of time before the cars start stacking up and whatever explosives were being
[27:45.400 --> 27:50.840]  carried by the train start leaking out and catching on fire this is a disaster
[27:50.840 --> 27:56.080]  the state exchanges that are supposed to be running Obamacare can't even get
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.200]  their IT departments to work correctly most of the states that claim they're
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.920]  going to have this by January 1 of 2014 are not going to be able to do it there
[28:06.920 --> 28:11.280]  are going to be computer problems galore if you think the DMV is a nightmare
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.680]  wait until you try to sign up for the Obamacare exchanges in your state that
[28:16.680 --> 28:23.520]  is going to be an IT nightmare I mean just imagine just the mess of all these
[28:23.520 --> 28:29.040]  overpaid government employees trying to figure out highly complex relational
[28:29.040 --> 28:33.680]  databases they're probably going to try to run the whole system on an Excel
[28:33.680 --> 28:38.280]  spreadsheet because they don't even know how to use databases so it's going to be
[28:38.280 --> 28:44.160]  a massive nightmare and the whole thing my prediction is it's all going to fall
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.000]  flat on its face and Obamacare is eventually going to be pulled it's
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.960]  going to be redacted it's going to be rejected after the 2014 elections and
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.280]  it certainly by the 2016 presidential election things are going to be so
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.000]  different by then hopefully we will have Obama impeached by that time we'll
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.400]  have Obamacare pulled out of the US law we'll have some liberty back in place
[29:08.400 --> 29:13.440]  we'll have Rand Paul successfully championing the the legalization of
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.720]  industrial hemp farming in America something that he's just come out for
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.040]  so that our farmers can get back to business making money again planting a
[29:21.040 --> 29:25.720]  crop that has a multitude of uses it's not about marijuana this is industrial
[29:25.720 --> 29:29.680]  hemp okay you can't smoke it but you can turn it into clothes and textiles and
[29:29.680 --> 29:34.160]  car parts and even seeds and oils and nutritional products it's the crop for
[29:34.160 --> 29:39.000]  America that's what we need right now go Rand Paul get it legalized okay thank
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.280]  you thank you for standing up for liberty we love you keep it up stay tuned
[29:43.280 --> 29:46.960]  this is the Alice Jones show we'll be right back
[29:46.960 --> 29:58.360]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.440 --> 30:05.200]  there's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.760]  for all of us Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important
[30:09.760 --> 30:14.680]  supply you can for your liberty freedom and security and that's food we thought
[30:14.680 --> 30:19.720]  the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.200]  that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it or our food being sold to
[30:24.200 --> 30:27.880]  other countries but here's the most effective way you lose your liberty
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.400]  and security without a fight government regulation the do-it-yourself public
[30:32.400 --> 30:37.320]  services of many LDS Mormon food storage canaries can no longer be provided

[33:59.040 --> 34:03.280]  carbon dioxide and here in the studio I brought some flashcards obviously you
[34:03.280 --> 34:06.680]  can't see them on the radio but if you're tuned in on prisonplanet.tv you
[34:06.680 --> 34:10.720]  can see the flashcards now we've got elements here on the flashcards carbon
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.960]  oxygen nitrogen hydrogen and argon all with their atomic weights with pictures
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.760]  cool pictures isn't that awesome now here's the myth here's the delusion
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.040]  being pushed by Al Gore he says that carbon dioxide which is a combination of
[34:25.040 --> 34:35.400]  one carbon and two oxygen atoms carbon dioxide he says is a pollutant CO2 is a
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.080]  pollutant he says and it's so deadly and so dangerous it's going to destroy
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.720]  human civilization unless you pay him and his buddies some carbon taxes so
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.960]  you got to pay him money and then you'll be okay but let's talk about carbon
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.760]  dioxide and what's really in the atmosphere it turns out that carbon
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.000]  dioxide has just surpassed a level of 400 parts per million in the in Earth's
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.760]  atmosphere 400 parts per million what does that mean really is it high is it
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.720]  low because Al Gore wants you to think it's alarmingly high it's terrible it's
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.440]  it's atrocious it's going to kill us well 400 parts per million is 400 out of
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.000]  a million so 400 parts per million is less than one half of one one thousandth
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.480]  of the air 400 parts per million is so small it's so minuscule it is a trace
[35:26.480 --> 35:33.080]  gas in the air it almost doesn't exist at all and the levels in the past in
[35:33.080 --> 35:37.320]  Earth's history have been as high as 7,000 parts per million so 400 is very
[35:37.320 --> 35:42.000]  very small in fact right now in this office is probably 2,000 parts per
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.960]  million in many offices or work environments it can go up to 3,000
[35:45.960 --> 35:50.880]  or 4,000 parts per million so 400 parts per million in the atmosphere is
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.920]  ridiculously small at the same time when you exhale your exhale in carbon
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.640]  dioxide your breath can exhale as much as 40,000 parts per million carbon
[36:01.640 --> 36:06.080]  dioxide which adds to the atmosphere but you're not a polluter just for
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.280]  breathing are you that's what Al Gore wants you to think and a lot of people
[36:10.280 --> 36:14.160]  are confused about this a lot of people have been brainwashed and I gotta admit
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.600]  I was one of them yeah five years ago I was writing about global warming and CO2
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.800]  I had fallen for the Al Gore argument well I tell you what I educated myself
[36:24.800 --> 36:30.640]  since then and I can admit today that I was wrong about that and that the CO2
[36:30.640 --> 36:38.040]  myth is a complete hoax it turns out that oxygen by itself is at a level in
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.560]  the atmosphere of 210,000 parts per million you got that so CO2 is only
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.800]  400 parts per million oxygen is at 210,000 parts per million and over here
[36:49.800 --> 36:57.400]  nitrogen you see this nitrogen is at 780,000 parts per million of the
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.240]  atmosphere and then there's a little bit of argon in the atmosphere and I
[37:01.240 --> 37:07.400]  include hydrogen in here because H2O hydrogen and oxygen creates well
[37:07.400 --> 37:10.360]  water vapor and there's a little bit of that in the atmosphere as well so what
[37:10.360 --> 37:13.560]  you're looking at here on these flashcards is most of what's in the
[37:13.560 --> 37:19.320]  atmosphere not everything but most of it by far the majority so we're supposed
[37:19.320 --> 37:23.640]  to be concerned about the CO2 being at 400 parts per million wait a minute some
[37:23.640 --> 37:28.200]  new science has just come out that says that as CO2 levels are rising it's
[37:28.200 --> 37:34.840]  causing more plants to regrow and regreen desert type of areas arid areas
[37:34.840 --> 37:41.400]  all across the planet they're regreening because of rising levels of CO2 here it
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.640]  is in science news there's been a new study that was just published it looked
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.400]  at CO2 concentrations and as they're rising which they are I'm not saying
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.920]  they aren't going up slowly they're rising thank God because they've been so
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.560]  desperately low for so long that the plants are starving for CO2 okay so
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.560]  they're finally going up a little bit and it's helping the forest and it's
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.680]  helping the trees I got to tell you if you're an environmentalist and I am I
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.360]  am a legitimate true libertarian environmentalist I love the environment
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.040]  I love plants I love aquaponics I love growing food from seeds I love forest I
[38:19.040 --> 38:25.800]  love CO2 because CO2 helps all of those things CO2 makes forests grow back
[38:25.800 --> 38:32.480]  faster it is the ultimate reforestation nutrient it is a fertilizer okay CO2 is
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.200]  fertilizer from the air that helps deserts and arid areas and forest
[38:37.200 --> 38:42.600]  regrow forests and regreen it's the ultimate nutrient that environmentalists
[38:42.600 --> 38:47.360]  should be supporting but Al Gore's got these people all twisted up to where
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.280]  they're thinking that CO2 is a poison and that if you're an environmentalist
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.160]  you have to be against CO2 it's ridiculous now by the way just to
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.840]  clarify just to clarify because I know where people leap on this issue I am
[38:59.840 --> 39:07.600]  not pro oil and pro gas and pro coal okay I'm not pro fossil fuels and no the
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.880]  coal industry didn't pay me to say any of this in fact coal is very dirty at
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.760]  burning fossil fuels is dirty all right now coal can be made cleaner than it
[39:16.760 --> 39:20.160]  used to be it's a lot cleaner here in the US than it is in China for sure but
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.160]  it's still it puts sulfur into the air it puts mercury into the air fossil
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.480]  fuels you know oil BP spills it into the Gulf of Mexico crimes against nature
[39:28.480 --> 39:33.520]  Exxon crimes against nature these companies I do not support them all
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.600]  right just to be clear just to be on the record I don't support the fossil fuel
[39:37.600 --> 39:44.000]  energy industry that's not my thing but I do support rising CO2 levels as a way
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.680]  to regreen the planet and this is where we've got to get our heads on straight
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.880]  CO2 is such a powerful nutrient for growing plants that greenhouse owners
[39:53.880 --> 39:59.680]  actually pump CO2 into the greenhouses to boost production of the food plants
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.680]  there did you hear me on that they pump CO2 into the greenhouses to boost
[40:04.680 --> 40:11.000]  productivity if you want to grow more food on the planet you need more CO2 if
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.360]  you want to reforest the areas where forests have been lost you need more
[40:15.360 --> 40:21.200]  CO2 I'm not saying burn oil and put CO2 into the atmosphere it turns out that
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.560]  ocean life produces most of the CO2 anyway and that's enough the ocean is
[40:26.560 --> 40:32.280]  is exchanging CO2 with the atmosphere constantly and just like we exhale CO2
[40:32.280 --> 40:38.840]  ocean creatures are exhaling CO2 as part of their respiration so CO2 levels
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.680]  the higher they go the greener our planet gets which is why CO2 is the
[40:43.680 --> 40:49.320]  ultimate nutrient for environmental support of plants and trees and food and
[40:49.320 --> 40:54.640]  gardens all right so get it through your heads folks I know a lot of people I
[40:54.640 --> 40:59.960]  mean I did an article on this on natural news yesterday and some people were
[40:59.960 --> 41:03.640]  still screaming at me and they were like one of the comments this is the dumbest
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.640]  comment ever from a Facebook troll was in my article when I said let's celebrate
[41:08.640 --> 41:11.800]  rising CO2 levels because it's good for plants it's good for food it's good for
[41:11.800 --> 41:18.720]  trees the dumbest comment ever was stop being so negative yeah can you believe
[41:18.720 --> 41:22.720]  that stop being negative what do you mean I was being positive I was celebrating
[41:22.720 --> 41:26.400]  CO2 levels they're going up it's good for nature it's good for plants it's good
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.960]  for food production it's good for trees you know and it doesn't hurt us we can
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.680]  actually you can your breath has 40,000 parts per million CO2 if you can save
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.320]  another person's life by breathing that into them through mouth-to-mouth
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.040]  resuscitation they will come back to life you breathing oxygen and carbon
[41:44.040 --> 41:49.600]  dioxide into them from you carbon dioxide doesn't hurt them even at that
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.560]  high level for that short a period of time in fact OSHA has set up a limit in
[41:54.560 --> 42:00.000]  a workplace of 5,000 parts per million more than 10 times the current level of
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.680]  CO2 that's in the atmosphere you can work in an office environment you can
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.520]  breathe just fine at 2,000 3,000 4,000 even 5,000 parts per million not a big
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.840]  deal not a big deal so I just couldn't believe that comment he stopped being
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.120]  negative you know that actually it's Al Gore is being negative Al Gore is the
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.840]  doom and gloomer he's the one that's saying we're all gonna be destroyed human
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.880]  civilization is gonna end if the CO2 level goes up and a greenhouse gases and
[42:25.880 --> 42:30.320]  the planet's gonna fry and you have to pay him money to solve the problem that's
[42:30.320 --> 42:35.200]  doomsday talk okay that's doom and gloom right there from Al Gore I'm being
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.760]  the optimist we are the optimist we're saying CO2 levels going up that's great
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.520]  that's great for the plants it's great for the trees it's great for food
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.640]  production we can produce more food feed more people we can turn deserts into
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.040]  forest we can turn arid areas into forest we can regreen the planet thanks to
[42:52.040 --> 43:00.160]  CO2 so that's the wrap-up of that little science lesson I hope this gets posted on
[43:00.160 --> 43:06.320]  YouTube I want to see the comments on there to see it really sets apart people
[43:06.320 --> 43:11.200]  who are intelligent rational thinkers versus those who are just delusional
[43:11.200 --> 43:17.160]  cultists who believe in the Al Gore cult of CO2 being evil all right it's it's
[43:17.160 --> 43:22.800]  it's a very clear the litmus tests for your IQ basically and like I said I
[43:22.800 --> 43:26.520]  admit I failed that test many years ago and I was suckered into the the whole
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.080]  global warming thing and I you know it takes it takes a lot to admit you were
[43:31.080 --> 43:35.040]  wrong and change your opinion but I think that is a sign of someone who
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.560]  actually thinks about what they're saying sometimes we change our minds I
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.120]  changed my mind about Adam Kokesh by the way you know at first I was like his
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.800]  march on Washington which has now been sort of expanded into 50 states I was
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.640]  like that's the worst thing ever I think it's a terrible idea then I rethought
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.200]  you know I rethought the thing I said you know Adam Kokesh he's got a point
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.480]  he's got a point the most dangerous thing is sitting at home doing nothing
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.600]  you know so I support I support activism I I don't necessarily support the
[44:02.600 --> 44:05.840]  speech you know saying it's gonna be an armed overthrow or anything like that I
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.240]  don't think we need to go there I agree with Alex on that point let's fight the
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.880]  info war first let's not whip out the rifles and start you know flying lead
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.840]  downrange to make our point let's let's use words instead let's because we're
[44:18.840 --> 44:23.160]  winning on the words all right we're winning on the mathematics we just talked
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.480]  about mathematics in the atmospheric gases and science we're winning on the
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.560]  mathematics of economics Austrian economics is winning okay we're winning
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.880]  on so many fronts that we should just keep the info we're going but if we are
[44:36.880 --> 44:40.600]  ever wrong if we come to the conclusion that maybe there's new information that
[44:40.600 --> 44:44.520]  comes in that that contradicts our previous opinion then we got to be man
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.680]  enough to change our opinion and admit yeah we learned something new we're
[44:49.680 --> 44:54.120]  changing our our stance on something we got to be man enough to admit that and
[44:54.120 --> 44:57.760]  then move forward from that point forward and I'm not saying I'm a hundred
[44:57.760 --> 45:00.960]  percent correct on everything right now there might be things that I changed a
[45:00.960 --> 45:04.960]  few years down the road but I do know you know these are elements from the
[45:04.960 --> 45:10.480]  table of elements carbon dioxide is not a pollutant I know that I mean unless
[45:10.480 --> 45:13.520]  you're on a space station or something and then if you're on a space station
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.480]  then yeah CO2 is a pollutant because it's gonna build up in the air you got to
[45:18.480 --> 45:21.800]  have scrubbers to you know remove it from the air CO2 scrubbers why they have
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.200]  them on spaceships but on on earth we got enough plants to balance that out so
[45:27.200 --> 45:32.000]  it's not a pollutant it is a nutrient that's the point of all this all right
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.880]  so enough said on that point let's go to the next big news item got to get this
[45:37.880 --> 45:41.280]  in before we go to David Ike and Alex Jones in the next hour check this out
[45:41.280 --> 45:48.160]  South Korea joins the Japanese ban on US imports or imports of US wheat after
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.280]  the shocking GMO contamination announcement by the USDA gonna cover
[45:52.280 --> 45:58.240]  this very quickly here's the deal the USDA tested crop commercial crop fields
[45:58.240 --> 46:03.720]  wheat fields in Oregon and it found that they were contaminated with Monsanto's
[46:03.720 --> 46:08.080]  genetically engineered wheat which was only used experimentally planted across
[46:08.080 --> 46:14.760]  16 states in the United States from 1998 to 2005 this genetically engineered
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.600]  wheat has never been approved by the government for commercial use and it
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.000]  has never been intentionally grown in any commercial farm what this means is
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.240]  that the genetically engineered wheat escaped it escaped the experiment it
[46:29.240 --> 46:33.520]  got loose all right and it spread to other farms and other fields and it's
[46:33.520 --> 46:38.160]  now being found in wheat where it's not supposed to be found now Japan got
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.240]  worded this has said hey we're canceling our contracts but we're not gonna buy
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.640]  that wheat from the United States because it's contaminated with GMOs and we
[46:46.640 --> 46:51.680]  here in Japan we don't want to eat GMOs well South Korea just joined in on
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.520]  Friday said the same thing we don't want to eat GMOs either we don't want that
[46:55.520 --> 46:59.960]  Monsanto contaminated wheat we're not buying wheat from the United States why
[46:59.960 --> 47:04.080]  is this a big deal think about it if you're a US wheat farmer you just got
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.880]  screwed by Monsanto big time because now the wheat prices are gonna collapse in
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.720]  the United States through no fault of your own only through the fault of
[47:13.720 --> 47:19.640]  Monsanto whose GMOs are contaminating wheat crops causing prices to go down
[47:19.640 --> 47:23.760]  because it's being rejected by other countries all around the world most of
[47:23.760 --> 47:28.600]  the world doesn't want to eat GMO most of the people don't want to eat GMO but
[47:28.600 --> 47:33.840]  GMOs are rejected by everyone except Monsanto and a few members of Congress
[47:33.840 --> 47:39.240]  who are in Monsanto's pocket and in the corrupt USDA and that's it
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.640]  everybody else rejects it so if you're a farmer and you're growing wheat now
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.720]  you're gonna suffer an economic loss because of Monsanto's experiments gone
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.040]  awry because of that experimental crop grown in the open air with no
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.440]  protections that didn't even grow it in a greenhouse this open field let's see
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.840]  what happens let's play genetic roulette to quote Jeffrey Smith's book with the
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.000]  entire agricultural system so now we've got check this out thanks to the USDA
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.040]  conspiring with Monsanto to legalize these open field experiments we've now
[48:14.040 --> 48:19.240]  got a situation where we have genetic pollution polluting the fields of
[48:19.240 --> 48:24.920]  America's bread basket now we've got wheat and we've got corn and we've got
[48:24.920 --> 48:30.960]  alfalfa and probably other crops that are contaminated with GMOs and you can
[48:30.960 --> 48:36.600]  never put that back in the box you can never take that back so is our wheat
[48:36.600 --> 48:42.040]  crop now ruined permanently where other countries aren't gonna import US wheat
[48:42.040 --> 48:48.400]  ever hopefully not hopefully hopefully they'll find a way to still buy US wheat
[48:48.400 --> 48:55.360]  but it could be that bad it could be that bad and this is why it's important
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.640]  for all of us to recognize that Monsanto is hurting farmers Monsanto is
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.600]  destroying the integrity of the United States agricultural system it is
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.680]  destroying the economic productivity Monsanto is hurting US exports Monsanto
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.240]  is hurting the GDP of the United States of America it's time all of you out
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.400]  there woke up and smelled the coffee on this issue and realized that Monsanto is
[49:23.400 --> 49:28.520]  bad for America it's bad for farmers it's bad for your food it's all around
[49:28.520 --> 49:36.000]  all around bad news and now the proof is in the exports Japan says no South

[54:20.120 --> 54:25.240]  Alex is in the UK he successfully arrived there to cover the Bilderberg
[54:25.240 --> 54:28.280]  conference that's going to be happening all week with Paul Joseph Watson and
[54:28.280 --> 54:33.480]  others he joins us by phone now to give us the report of his travels and his
[54:33.480 --> 54:39.400]  arrival hey Alex you're on thank you so much thank you so much for sitting in
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.160]  and doing a great job on the broadcast for natural news and for info wars
[54:44.160 --> 54:49.880]  obviously Bilderberg does a kickoff till Thursday but the things that are
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.840]  happening here politically their agenda just being released today the list of
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.680]  attendees just six seven years ago they didn't do that and even then they would
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.040]  just send to one big newspaper of a big stink got made the list of government
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.680]  officials that were there from around the world now they put out the whole list
[55:09.680 --> 55:15.240]  and the agenda three days before it officially starts we had that first
[55:15.240 --> 55:19.640]  today because Charlie Skelton of the Guardian alerted us even before the
[55:19.640 --> 55:25.960]  Guardian posted it that it is up on the official Bilderberg meetings site we now
[55:25.960 --> 55:31.400]  have the agenda and a breakdown of that as well as the full list up on info
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.360]  wars.com and again for new listeners listing on AM and FM stations you may
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.440]  be saying why cover some group of politicians royalty elite well now
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.560]  it's about 150 members there's a lot of them that aren't on the list every year
[55:46.560 --> 55:51.840]  we're here to identify them that's always the key people and we have moles a
[55:51.840 --> 55:55.840]  very close to Bilderberg and we're able to learn the agenda for the year coming
[55:55.840 --> 56:01.880]  up these people brag and release the BBC about four years ago the fact that they
[56:01.880 --> 56:06.680]  helped found what became the EU these are the people setting up the new world
[56:06.680 --> 56:11.080]  order these are the people behind the carbon taxes it's in 21 last year when
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.960]  I was in Chantilly Virginia at Bilderberg a gentleman showed up with the
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.680]  National Archives I'll just leave it at that and he said this isn't classified
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.160]  but he said if you've got the WAVOS you can post it is restricted and it was
[56:25.160 --> 56:29.840]  marked on each one restricted National Archives of a US senator's papers and
[56:29.840 --> 56:34.360]  some other internal Bilderberg documents so it was his papers from
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.160]  meetings there in the 50s and 60s and everything they talked about they then
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.480]  got done within a decade and so it's royalty it's all of them getting
[56:43.480 --> 56:50.400]  together with energy ministers and others with the heads of the big power
[56:50.400 --> 56:53.760]  companies to then decide who's gonna be able to operate who's gonna be shut
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.440]  down it's it's the ultimate backroom deals and it is a giant victory that
[56:59.440 --> 57:03.600]  people now know that Bilderberg even exists I mean just four years ago as
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.120]  I've talked a lot about the New York Times did a film review on the film New
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.240]  World Order and basically said that I was insane and Bilderberg didn't exist and
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.520]  I was in Virginia again five years ago when they had the event but this was in
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.240]  their newspaper four years ago and that film came out imagining it so it's a big
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.280]  defeat to them first they said it doesn't exist and you're all cooks there's
[57:24.280 --> 57:27.480]  nobody above presidents and prime ministers the buck stops there there's
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.280]  no secret of special interest blah blah blah because Bilderberg members have been
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.440]  indicted and gotten in trouble before like Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands
[57:35.440 --> 57:41.080]  in Lockheed Martin's taxpayer scams you know buying jets for more money than
[57:41.080 --> 57:44.720]  they were worth as getting kickbacks you know let's say a jets worth two million
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.200]  well he'd buy them for five million a piece and get a million bucks out of the
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.000]  three million extra that's the type of stuff that they do on a small fry scale
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.240]  it's much much bigger so that's why this is so huge that's why this is so
[57:58.240 --> 58:00.840]  important and think about the victory we've had folks all of us should be
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.120]  savoring this to realize we can't have victory these are just humans just like
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.280]  us they're not God they're not invincible that they wanted to deny this
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.920]  existed for decades and now they're forced to admit it they go okay but so
[58:12.920 --> 58:17.160]  what it's no big deal is that why over two million pounds or close to four
[58:17.160 --> 58:20.640]  million dollars is being spent to erect a giant steel fence we're going to
[58:20.640 --> 58:27.000]  videotape tonight we got a we got to go to break here Alex great okay so we're

[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.000]  third hour Geld Salenti is hosting again my my favorite guest here on the show
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.680]  and Alex as I turn it over to you I know your focus is Bilderberg but I I'm
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.640]  just wondering if you would comment on the big drudge linked story today the
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.280]  US Supreme Court saying that the police can take your DNA anytime they want it's
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.960]  it's horrible news it's the way the whole world's going because the
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.520]  establishment wants authoritarianism the the people running things have
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.960]  openly said Bilderberg has said the trilateral Commission has said the
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.560]  Rand Corporation has stated that we should talk about that more after the
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.880]  break and get David Ike's take on that they just want to set the precedent to
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.440]  do whatever they want whenever they want and shut down the free press because
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:30.480]  the system is becoming so inequitable so fraudulent you've got big fat special
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.840]  interests that are able to shut down their competition able to transfer most
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.800]  the wealth of themselves their government corporate welfare and bailouts
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.120]  and then you've got a giant dumbed-down mass of people that eat GMO and watch TV
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.800]  all day who will go along with it but then you've got maybe 30% of us
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.480]  conservatively worldwide or more that actually you're starting to wake up to
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.920]  what's happening and aren't going along so it's it's when the unstoppable force
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.520]  meets the immovable object it's going to be a nuclear explosion or an atomic
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.200]  reaction politically historically for every action there's an equal and
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.720]  opposite reaction so as evil rises good rises and this is the process I really
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.280]  had an epiphany last night flying in on that 10-hour flight from Dallas Texas
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.320]  into London I've got to say I'd I'd never seen the PBS special by Stephen
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.480]  Hawking on the nature of reality and you know do we have free will or not and
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.600]  of course they ended up at the show saying we obviously do have free will but
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.960]  expanding on that it is our job to be tested that's what this plan it's all
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.400]  about in the middle of space I mean there's no doubt every culture has known
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:47.200]  this at their core and it is our job to decide whether we support negative
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.640]  energy destructive energy parasitic energy or but I'm trying to be new age
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.440]  here I'm just saying or whether but just boiling it down to its most simple
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.480]  physics or whether we support things that are of a higher order things that
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.600]  build things that construct are we based on fraud or are we based on lies and so
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.000]  there is tyranny galloping forward worldwide because of all the cosmologies
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.040]  out there and there's different forces in this world different forces of good
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.880]  different forces of evil different passive forces I hate to get
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.240]  philosophical here but the main driving evil force is technocratic it is
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.640]  scientific and it believes in survival the fittest and it believes that
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.240]  dumbing us down and then killing us is an act of righteous dominance but in the
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.400]  process the globalists are destroying the planet and themselves and it's really
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.000]  twisted I mean really they're just a bunch of bullies who enjoy hurting us
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.360]  and people but when we come back briefly as we go to David I I will tell you my
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.280]  experience getting into the country because they interrogated me for 15
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.680]  hours in Canada so they weren't gonna let me in until a bunch of press showed
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.320]  up thanks to Jim Tucker calling the CBC and others and local newspapers then
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  they got scared and released me I believe they weren't gonna let me into
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.800]  England who's blocked Michael Savage and many others except for the fact that I
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.680]  made the point this will just be bigger news if you don't let me in we got into
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.560]  the cube and well I'll tell the story when we come back it it's just that they
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.640]  definitely had extra people up there with us and they were making a decision
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.360]  on whether or not we were gonna be led into the country because everybody else
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.960]  was just flying right through and some things happen there so I'll finish up
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.400]  with that but this is a big deal that we can be here that we can cover this and
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:34.920]  that now Bilderberg is admitted in all over German British Dutch newspapers
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.400]  some US newspapers but now they've got to make jokes about it I think oh it's
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.320]  just a bunch of elitist meeting in secret what's the big deal well we're
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.960]  here to expose what they're doing the men in the smoking room and again Mike
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.400]  Adams I want to thank you for a co-hosting and being traffic cop today
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.080]  David Ike is coming up with Mike Adams Alex Jones and more I'm coming to you
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.520]  live from Bilderberg 2013
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.480]  there's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.040]  for all of us Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.960]  supply you can for your liberty freedom and security and that's food we thought
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.320]  the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so

[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.800]  know who's a prepper is running a chest rig like this or some kind of body armor
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.080]  like this the thing is you can run it as a chest rig without the plate and just
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.320]  to carry things I mean even even as a farmer or a gardener you can carry
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.120]  because it's got all the Mali attachments and it's got the ATACs pattern
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.240]  of camo and then you can put the chest plate in if you need to if there's
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.960]  riots or gangs looting or whatever so it's it's dual purpose I've got stuff
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:37.080]  just like that and I know you're one hell of a farmer and a prepper man I mean
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.040]  you're out there doing it with your your cows and your goats and everything else
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.640]  doing a great job again Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is riding shotgun Gerald
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:50.760]  Salente is going to be giving you a trends in the news update for about 50
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:56.040]  minutes in the third hour I want to go to David Ike of davidike.com I want to
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.280]  thank everybody that's made exposing Bilderberg possible David Ike has
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.920]  exposed it for 20 years with people saying it didn't exist Jim Tucker that
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:10.000]  died about a month ago he exposed it for about 35 years the real trailblazer I've
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.360]  been exposing it for 18 years sites like davidike.com naturalnews.com
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.120]  infowars.com and the biggest in the last six years drudgereport.com
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.280]  drudge was the only big outlet the US other than info wars that would put it
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.000]  on his site when we covered it and far and press like the Guardian covered it
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.680]  forcing the Washington Post after 50-plus years of attendance the Graham
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.000]  family would admit it exists so that's the big issue they don't want you to
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.560]  know there's something above presidents and prime ministers and Bilderberg is
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.240]  right up there at the top of the pyramid and now it's merging with Google and the
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.800]  technocracy that David Ike has talked so much about and so I want to do a
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.520]  couple things here I want to get David's take on a how they're acting like we the
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.520]  media and the demonstrators that are coming like we're dirty and we're bad
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:04.280]  and then GS you know security coming out and G4S security coming out this big
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.720]  globalist outfit and saying oh the only place you're allowed to have press in
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.400]  Watford in fact they're saying on the city sidewalks and the and and this
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.520]  rural countryside areas that the hotel's at that that no one's allowed to walk on
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.880]  the sidewalk or on the grass and that citizens have to show their ID this is
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:29.240]  in the newspaper the police chief you'll have and the the county sheriff as well
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.120]  they'd like to show your ID to walk down the street or drive a car they've got
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:39.480]  checkpoints set up this is martial law and I've talked to the head cop liaison
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.520]  and he says you know he's a listener and does particularly like what's going on
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.760]  but I'm not gonna say much more I don't even trouble I don't think he's playing
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.800]  good cop bad cop he gets that he's compartmentalized as David Ike has said
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.160]  here are the people protecting this and and and oppressing the people while they
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.320]  themselves are being oppressed and destroyed so I want to get his take on
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.560]  that that made him so angry in a letter that we published on info wars.com
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.320]  last week or earlier no yes it was last week I'm a bit jet lag folks sorry
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.200]  haven't had any sleep and then I want him to get into why they're merging with
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.720]  Google because we have inside moles that was a big story we broke two weeks ago
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.360]  that's why they don't want us in the hotel days ahead and threw us out because
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.400]  because Google is meeting there now and for a week after and it's almost a
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.240]  permanent command base turns out they hatched a bunch of World War two OSS
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.360]  stuff there turns out they hatched the Arab Spring there this Wadford compound
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.440]  is key and has a transhumanist skeleton merging with a machine climbing out of
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.120]  a reflecting pool in the back so without further ado I want to thank David Ike for
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.600]  being such a big part of this he can bring out six seven thousand people
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.800]  easily and and so if that many show up they're gonna make it hard folks but
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:56.400]  you got to do it this could bring down Bilderberg politically by forcing it
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.560]  out into the media if they miscalculate if the police abuse anybody or if the
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.800]  security people do that will backfire I believe we have these guys by the short
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:11.840]  hairs David Ike again former head of the Green Party champion goalie BBC sports
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.800]  reporter and of course best-selling author and say which one about David
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.560]  Ike he gets people thinking David Ike what do you make of how historic this
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.640]  year is and do you disagree with me that that that this is a key time and a key
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.960]  opportunity here outside of London
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:36.760]  I think it is I think we are looking at an historic moment and in terms of the
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:44.120]  history of exposure and you know Alex coming from England and knowing the
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:54.460]  geography and the location and all that stuff is meeting in that hotel in
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.000]  Watford I mean they must have a very good reason for it because from a
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.120]  protest point of view there's 30 minutes by train from central London a short
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.960]  journey in a car really from the second biggest city in England Birmingham these
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.560]  Midlands cities which are just up the motorway
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:28.120]  at a place where so many people in the middle of a vast vast population area
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:37.000]  and so either they miscalculated they hope they'll cause trouble and do a
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.120]  problem reaction solution or there's another reason why it has to be that
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.720]  hotel because what they've done is create a situation in which the people
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.200]  instead of having to go to them they've all almost come to us you know in 1995
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:17:01.800]  Alex I am the great great Jim Tucker did a round robin email saying that the
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.160]  Bilderberg meeting was a place called Bergen Stock in Switzerland and as
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.920]  coincidence would have it I was staying with some friends about two hours away
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.040]  at the same time though I didn't know that when I agreed to go so on the day
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:22.480]  before I went across there down the two hours down the motorway freeway and I
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.240]  went up to three enormously flashed hotels at the park the palace and the
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:32.560]  grand at the top of this mountain it was basically in the middle of nowhere and
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:38.200]  there was just like not much more than a village down the bottom of the mountain
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.720]  I saw them putting up the the temporary fences I saw the people walking around
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:51.560]  with it with their you know name tags on and there was no one around protesting
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:56.480]  I mean Jim Jim was there somewhere but I didn't need him and then I went back on
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:03.160]  the last day of it of the Bilderberg meeting that year 1995 and
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.480]  honestly if I could get closer when it was going on I couldn't even get on the
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.640]  mountain right down in the entrance onto the mountain road from the village
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.480]  there was the Swiss police guys had I remember them big orange illuminous
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.640]  jackets on and I said to them you know I just want to go up to the hotel I said
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.160]  oh no no you can't this there's something going on and I asked the guy you
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.520]  know so what is it made playing the playing the idiot wait why can't I go
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.360]  on what's going on and he just said to me I don't know but it's top secret top
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:40.120]  secret he said you know I sat there and I thought that's compartmentalization for
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:45.800]  you a guy that the people at the top of that mountain are conspiring to manipulate
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.720]  you're there you're like your children's like your grandchildren's life and you
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.320]  are protecting them when you don't even know they're there and the agenda that
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.360]  that's happening by the way David we're gonna skip this we're gonna skip this
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.880]  network break because I got to you a little bit late we're gonna skip this
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.080]  break this is the perfect example of everything you're talking about please
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:14.280]  continue and so it's gonna be quite emotional I think very likely when I
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.520]  come up there because having stood at the bottom of that mountain and saw just
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:25.080]  nothing in front of me and it couldn't even see the hotels are so far away here
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:32.800]  we are now looking in their face and I do urge as many people as possible to
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.440]  come along in total peace and I'm sure that's what the vast majority's intent
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:48.800]  will be let's make a massive statement by numbers that we are not having this
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:56.160]  anymore and that we are starting to figure out what's going on and in you
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:03.000]  know this is such a wonderful opportunity for massive exposure you've
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.360]  got the media now you know I do have to laugh you know you've got the mainstream
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:14.840]  media we're now covering it and often making fun of the alternative media
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.240]  the media overwhelmingly when you fact if you go back to 1995 and when Jim
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:27.000]  Tuckett was the trailblazer the media entirely that will be there covering this
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.560]  event would not be there this weekend if it wasn't for the alternative media it
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.880]  wasn't for the Jim Tucker's trailblazer when no one else wanted to know and the
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:45.160]  media was just laughing and ignoring it and David David isn't this and Jim trailblazed
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.640]  it and the mainstream media have had to follow us and they better get used to it
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.000]  because it's only just started no no I totally agree and that's where I was
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.640]  going in my gut in my intellect in my spirit at every level this is a
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.280]  microcosm of the entire world the entire universe of what's happening and I
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.200]  want you to elaborate on that and Mike Adams who's riding shotgun to pop in
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:14.240]  with any of his views on this because here is Westbrook Pegler covering this
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:20.640]  60 years ago not even knowing its name Tucker picks it up 36 years ago and it
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.480]  wasn't until a decade ago that really even foreign press would cover it and
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:30.160]  now it's a I talk to people on the airplane they know what it is even if
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.640]  they don't know who David Ike is or Alex Jones so again this shows our power the
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.400]  people's power that that they've gone from from a stone wall doesn't exist
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.480]  there aren't two billion bullets there aren't armored vehicles there aren't
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.960]  NSA check you know spying on you there isn't a new world order we're not
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.080]  putting cancer viruses in the vaccines we're not giving you GMO to kill you to
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:55.080]  where we were all on the airplane flying here last night and I was talking to
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.160]  people they're going Henry Kissinger wants a new world order and he's scum
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.720]  and GMOs designed to sterilize us with chemicals in it and I'm going do you know
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:06.800]  who I am no who are you and and it was I'm telling you David people are either
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.320]  getting more zombie or they're getting more awake and I think it's coming to
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.840]  Rikashindo and as you just said they're arrogance by the way I read this two
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:20.440]  weeks ago and then looked it up and it's true this is on some weird ritual site
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.320]  that had a stone circle at it before they built this palace that royalty would
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.760]  have parties at and then they brag on the side of the thing that people have been
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.720]  coming here to party and mate for 6,000 years so it is some type of weird power
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.040]  site for him but but but just interjecting I totally agree this is
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.960]  historical this is the Bilderberg meeting to be two folks this is this is
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.720]  it this is where we force the global shadow government out in the open David
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:50.400]  I well you know what I was saying earlier Alex about you know why have they held it
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.240]  here in that great you know population area I kept saying or some other reason
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.880]  well that's what I was talking about when I said that you know the Bilderberg
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:10.080]  group is very very significant but it is a strand in a in a gigantic web and you
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:15.120]  go much deeper in the rabbit hole than the Bilderberg group to find the source
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:23.040]  and from that comes a deep knowledge of the nature of reality the nature of the
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.800]  energy field the fact that the everything is conscious and if you can do
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.040]  things to the earth energy field you can affect the collective consciousness of
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.480]  of everyone because at the energetic electromagnetic level we are interacting
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.720]  with the planet we're interacting with all energetic fields and this is why
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:51.280]  they're constantly doing their rituals and they do select Bilderberg meetings
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.840]  based on this and this is a classic example so in many ways when you look
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.920]  at it from that point of view there was only one place that we're going to come
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.440]  which is which is there for energetic reasons this is what you find and
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.560]  understand when you go deeper in the rabbit hole when you get down there you
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.600]  also realize that there is a reason or an explanation for the apparent blatant
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:20.760]  contradiction between a network of families and and secret societies who
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:27.120]  are systematically dismantling the planet and the fact that they have to live
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.280]  here I mean we this is not the time to go into it but they want to change the
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.080]  planet into a different state that suits something and that's what's so crazy is
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.680]  that they tell us all day we want to kill the earth and then they say they're
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.440]  the saviors well they're the ones on every front GMO chemicals you name it
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.720]  actively trying to not even play a good God but to play a destructive ugly
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.240]  God and David expanding on that even if other people don't believe in the
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.040]  occult and things I stuck into Bohemian Grove I have you know covered
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.480]  skull and bones you said that Savelle was you know running kids to the royal
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.640]  family 15 years ago you know now it's come out the guy was you know this this
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.720]  this total Satanist and and and for those of us that that aren't like these
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:16.280]  people were blind to it because we can't see into that dark spectrum that they
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.600]  inhabit that they operate in and expanding on that that's that's why
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.360]  they've been so scared of exposure because as you said Bilderberg was just
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:31.160]  one uncovered part of say a temple out in the Sahara Desert one little piece
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.040]  sticking up and they said oh that's not part of a temple don't go dig over there
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.760]  and we started digging like archaeologists and are now digging in
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.840]  finding this this giant submerged structure is that a good analogy
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:50.440]  yeah it's this week a few things together here first of all understanding
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.520]  that these people at the Bilderberg group I'm looking through the list in front
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.200]  of me that is said to becoming this year they look rich and powerful people and
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.360]  on one level they're rich and powerful people but in the greater scheme of the
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:10.680]  global network they are gophers and they are terrified on one side of those much
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.920]  deeper in the rabbit hole because this is a whole edifice of fear that they're
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.080]  caught in and on the other side there's still massive compartmentalization and
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.760]  a lot of the people there will know some of the picture but they won't know all
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:30.640]  of it and these people who are really in the know they worship these these gods
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.200]  they've been talked about in in every culture for eons on the different
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.600]  different names and they interact with these gods and these what I mean talking
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.880]  about the gods I'm talking about non-human entities and they are seeking to
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:51.720]  change the planet to suit them this is why they are using GMO and goodness knows
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.760]  how many other methods to change human DNA which is why they're doing that the
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.200]  genetic modification of animals of plants and all the rest of it they are
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.120]  seeking to take turn this planet into something that is right for them and
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.000]  it's been an ongoing thing for centuries well let me say this I mean that
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.160]  they are publicly as you know in all their publications saying they're a
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.040]  different species than us we're animals they're God and that they're going to
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.480]  transcend and merge with machines and so again just from a news perspective
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.760]  whether it's true or not when I was at Bohemian Grove they were worshiping they
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.320]  are a cultist they believe this is real and I want you to come back and get into
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.560]  whatever you want with Mike Adams because I'm gonna leave you David so that
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.560]  you can have some time here gonna be in studio with us sometime on Friday during
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.840]  the show Friday evening British time I I think we were talking during the break
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.200]  you're good for that correct yeah I see you Friday all right fantastic but but
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.520]  let me ask you this question as as we get ready to go to break you've got a
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.600]  few minutes here specifically though calling out the trips because you know
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.600]  you're you're huge all over the world I have a big audience here in the UK as
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.320]  well but you're you're really probably biggest here in the UK you know where you
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.240]  can get seven eight thousand people out at an event what do you think people
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.240]  should do what are points you think that they should be making I mean we don't
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.200]  really talk about talking points but what do you think the most important
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:22.800]  message is to get out here well I think the biggest message is numbers if we
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:29.000]  get a very large number of people turning up at this event I mean you know
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.400]  what we've just discussed Alex this is what we're looking at here is absolutely
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:41.600]  unprecedented the the way that it's set up and we could actually get in to the
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.040]  to the grounds and stuff like that yes the security will be ludicrous and you
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.760]  know just over the top but I mean the people that run the world are insane I
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.720]  mean it you know you but you that's the penny that needs to drop before you
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:29:00.040]  start understanding the world we live in the mad but if we calmly and peacefully
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:06.360]  assemble in large large large numbers I mean even focus it on the Saturday when
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.560]  when when people are you know not working and let's make a statement in
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:17.160]  numbers that I agree including the mainstream just numbers just numbers
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.240]  ignore you see this is the thing you see in what you're talking about on the train
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:33.040]  let's come back let's come back and talk about that with David Ike of David Ike

[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.360]  research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.840]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.760]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.040]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.720]  happening that I don't feel like I am properly imparting to people how big
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.960]  this is the awakening that's going on and and one of two things happened I
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:27.720]  got in to UK border to customs and the EU citizens you know that's the bricks
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.800]  under the EU they all went right through but myself and hundreds of others
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.640]  went and got in line for about an hour and everybody was just going
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.920]  instantly through nobody was getting stopped people were just straight through
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.920]  they let you get a ticket here then you're usually let right in but when we
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:47.800]  got up there three extra women came over men lined up behind the counter myself
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.920]  and Leanne Macadoo this didn't happen when Richard flew in the day before
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.040]  Richard Reeves and they all lined up and and we're looking at us and we're
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.440]  making a decision and then she interrogated us probably four or five
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.560]  times longer than they did other people and they were looking for some
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:08.640]  technicality like like Canada did one time saying who's paying you to be here
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.720]  and I said I told you I'm a media person and they all knew who I was that was
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.800]  clear as hell people lined up waiting for something and then they said okay and
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.520]  she reluctantly stamped it and I got in in the past Jim Tucker's been blocked out
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.720]  of countries and then he's got to go to another country in Europe to get back in
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.800]  in the past Daniel Estlund's been blocked in the past I've been blocked and
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.440]  so the fact that they didn't block me show that they do not want a lot of press
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.160]  attention which is exactly what they're getting we're seeing no exaggeration
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.400]  three or four times the coverage we saw last year last year was three or four
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.280]  times the coverage we saw the year before that it is exponential so I
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.560]  wanted to ask David Ike in closing them a throw the interview over to Mike Adams
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:36:01.920]  and David again just how historical this is what he thinks Bilderberg is
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.760]  thinking and what he thinks the establishment is going to do to strike
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.800]  back because humanity is waking up and then I'll be back tomorrow live
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.800]  hosting probably an hour and a half or so with David Knight we're gonna have a
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:22.320]  live video feeds live audio feeds text you know chat all of it as stuff
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:27.320]  breaks will have live feeds that then get archived at info wars.com forward
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.400]  slash Bilderberg and I want to ask listeners and viewers even if you can't
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.480]  come to this event in England because I understand it's a great expense believe
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.120]  me it's hard for us to come and bring this crew in it is so important that you
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.360]  spread the word about the demonstrations and about the press and that you write
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:51.200]  articles yourself or blurbs or you do YouTube videos about what's happening so
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.880]  so David that's my final question for you and I'm gonna turn the show of the
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.920]  rest of the hour over to you and Mike Adams David Ike how important is it for
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.680]  people around the world to talk about this on the internet and to watch our
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.760]  video streams listen to our audio streams and and and give this attention
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:18.360]  and focus on the resistance. Well it's a simple situation really that which
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.880]  wishes to be secret that which works in the shadows that which wishes to keep
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.560]  what it's doing secret from the public then the antidote for that is the
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.280]  opposite it's making what they're doing as public as possible and we've reached
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:40.400]  the point we have reached this this this critical point where people in enough
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.720]  numbers are starting to see it that the difference is starting to cause a shift
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:49.200]  because it you know once you have a certain number of people that knows
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.880]  something then that number of people tell another number of people then you
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.320]  now you've got a bigger number of people and they tell people from from their
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.720]  level of awareness much greater numbers and the exponential curve starts to
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:09.000]  turn towards the sky and this is where we are now we're at this point where they
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.520]  can't keep it secret anymore and you know the experience you say you've
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.880]  just described at the airport I've had that in different airports around the
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.040]  world I've had it in Australia where they they try to think of a way in exactly the
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:27.840]  same way how could we do think of a credible way of not letting this guy in
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:35.600]  but then they will hold on a second if we do stop the fella it's gonna cause more
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:42.680]  publicity for what they're doing then if we just let him in and so if you it's
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.600]  like I said on my website you know when they when they decided that they they
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:52.000]  were gonna let have an area for people at this Builderburg event you know look
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.400]  what happens when you won't take no from the system this is what we must
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.600]  understand David you gotta tell them what you did you gotta tell them what
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.280]  you did though number you look at the number of people who almost certainly
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:10.920]  gonna turn up this this weekend and you look at the number of people in the
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:17.120]  hotel at the Builderburg event there will be far more turning up to to make
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.400]  their feelings known than people in that hotel now think that the people in that
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.760]  hotel tiny number are making decisions and manipulating and coordinating
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:37.640]  events so they're gonna play out as changing policy this is not the tail
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.720]  wagging the dog it's not the tail wagging the elephant it's the tail wagging
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.560]  the planet that we're looking at we have to realize that when we start to
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:53.280]  understand the power we have in numbers the power we have when we say no we're
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.040]  not having it then then the house of cards will come down because that's what
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:03.480]  it is the house of cards which we are holding together by our ignorance and
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:10.080]  now by our acquiescence absolutely the ignorance in large numbers of people are
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.160]  starting to see it now we have to remove the acquiescence and show ourselves in
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:20.680]  numbers that the game is up this is that this may not be this may not be the end
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.520]  it's nothing like the end but as Churchill once said it may perhaps be the
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.280]  end of the beginning and I think it is it's the end of this stage where we've
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.760]  been building up to this point where there's enough awareness now gathering
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.560]  all the time that we can go on the net and to the next stage and that is
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.080]  dismantling this bloody nonsense and bringing an end to it because these
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.880]  people these people these these these these powerful people on this list in
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:51.160]  front of me the little boys in short trousers that's what they are but that's
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.440]  a good little people playing little games with the lives of the population of the
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:01.680]  world and we say enough it's over and we can make a mighty statement this weekend
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:07.360]  that enough is the point we've reached all right Mike Adams you take it over I
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.560]  want to thank all of you I want to thank the crew because I'm punching out now
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.160]  and I want to thank all of you the listeners our affiliates everybody I
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.440]  just have a real feeling of thankfulness to everybody that loves liberty that
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.240]  we've gotten to this point and we're not hyping this folks this is a big deal
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.520]  Mike Adams you take over till five after with David Ike then Gerald Salentes
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.080]  coming up and again ladies and gentlemen all the news at info wars.com
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.600]  forward slash Bilderberg David Ike.com and of course natural news.com but again
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.880]  just amazing I'm gonna turn it over Mike you bring up some wildcard questions
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.560]  here for David Ike and I'll see everybody back tomorrow on the show Alex
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.120]  Jones signing off for now back to David Ike you bet thank you Alex for that live
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  report and David yeah it's it's an honor to be able to speak with you you
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:42:06.840]  probably know I'm a big fan of you and your work but yeah absolutely and you
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.360]  know I've read all your books and I've watched your presentations and in the
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:14.320]  context of Bilderberg here's here's my opening question for you on this you
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.160]  know you you talk about the nature of reality you talk about the interaction
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:23.320]  between consciousness and reality when we look at Bilderbergers they are in
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:29.080]  essence engineers of illusion they're trying to fabricate a reality that the
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.240]  people then must exist in like in the matrix so I'd like you to speak to that
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.720]  role of the Bilderberg members of being sort of engineers of illusion and how
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:48.720]  we can see through that illusion and awaken to reality
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.320]  an area that you know I think everyone in the the area of alternative media and
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  people looking for answers to what's going on in the world we really do need
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:04.040]  to get this deep and deeper to understand the true nature of what is going on
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:10.120]  because if we stay only in the realm of the five senses then we're staying on
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.320]  the movie screen we're not actually exploring where the movie's coming from
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:21.880]  and if you go deep deep in the rabbit hole you're looking at entities I'll
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:26.320]  call it a force which is talked about using different names all over the
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:35.720]  world in all the ancient cultures and they manipulated human genetics in
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.080]  total and specifically manipulated human genetics to create particular hybrid
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:45.800]  bloodlines which are representing this force in our reality we call these
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.920]  bloodlines the Illuminati families they're the ones that sit on top the
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.240]  the banking system the the government's the the corporations and all the rest of
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:04.120]  it so what you're looking at is these rich and powerful people so-called they
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:09.560]  are representing this hidden force in their rituals they are interacting with
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:17.040]  this force this is what Satanism is and so they understand that what we are
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:23.440]  living in is not a physical reality that's the illusion it is a holographic
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:30.040]  reality illusory reality and if you look at how holograms you know simple
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.800]  holograms you buy in the shops are made the basic information that creates the
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.440]  hologram is not what you see as a apparently three-dimensional image
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:45.560]  it's actually information on a waveform print and then you fire a laser at the
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.640]  waveform print which looks just like a fingerprint really when you see them in
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:55.480]  close-up and suddenly that laser activates information that gives the illusion
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:01.880]  of a three-dimensional figure or image whatever the holographic film is has
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.160]  been taken off and the best of them can look as solid as you and me now but you
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:15.000]  see the hologram only exists because of the information on the print and the
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.120]  nature of what the hologram is whether it's a person or a box or a ball or
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:28.440]  whatever is dictated by the information on the waveform print so they know
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:34.000]  because this is how our reality works that what we think of as the physical
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.840]  world is just a holographic projection from information fields waveform
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:46.080]  information fields beyond the frequency range of human sight but we can feel it
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.880]  we feel this energy all the time all got good vibes all got bad vibes so there's
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:55.760]  a bit and so it's at that level Mike that they're manipulating our reality they
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:59.240]  know that what's the point in manipulating the hologram the hologram is just a
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:01.840]  projection of something else it's there's something else they want to
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:08.440]  manipulate and therefore they do these endless rituals and a lot of them
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:15.160]  absolutely in public sight like the pomp and ceremony of the royalty in Britain
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.560]  you know all the marching soldiers and then royal rituals and all this stuff
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.640]  these are all manipulating energy and when you get deeper into it you realize
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.840]  that they've created basically a constant ritual that we call human life
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:42.040]  in which if they can manipulate us for instance to feel fear to feel anxiety to
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:50.400]  feel stress anger and frustration then that generates an energy because
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:57.320]  everything's energy and you are pouring that energy into the energy field
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:05.000]  magnetic field and that is affecting the field in its in its entirety you know
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:14.680]  you've only got to see what they found when you had the 9-11 attacks yeah they
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.280]  were feeding off all that fear that are picking up changes in the energy field
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.680]  as magnetic field despite the time of the attacks when the public became
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.000]  globally aware of it was absolutely fantastic and that was caused by the
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.400]  human collective emotional reaction to those attacks now this is what they're
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.360]  manipulating and this is why they are to say they'll do they'll do their ritual
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:48.680]  which is what this Bilderberg thing is all about so what the long-term story of
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:55.800]  this is is that over a vast amount of what we call time these entities hidden
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:02.640]  from human side outside of the human visual range through their network of
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:10.000]  hybrid families in this reality have been changing our planet changing the
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.880]  reality changing the atmosphere changing it genetically in the ways I was just
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:23.120]  talking about the GMO is what it's all about remember it's not just GMO of
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:30.400]  human beings and GMO food it's genetic modification of the entire natural
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.680]  world they're having genetically modified grass and lawns now they're
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:40.520]  bringing it everything they want to genetically modify everything because the
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.440]  atmosphere and the planet that these entities can stand and therefore can
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.960]  can interact with as they can't now is very different to the one we that is
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.600]  good for humans and that's what we're seeing and this is why there is no
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.840]  when you understand this this is why there is no contradiction between these
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.640]  people who are manipulating events in the world to destroy it from a human point
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.120]  of view well at the same time they appear to be living in it well why would
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.760]  they destroy their own world well they're not like us that's the point and the key
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.520]  that really connects Bilderberg here and Google is transhumanism which is not
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:29.240]  transhumanism at all it's dehumanism it's dehumanization the more that you
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:39.840]  can turn someone from a consciousness into a machine which is like a computer it
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:45.080]  can have the power of thought the power of decision-making but it's not
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.360]  actually conscious in the greater human sense the more you can turn them into
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.400]  machines and fuse them with the machines the more power you have over them and
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.320]  the less power they have because their energetic power their power of
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.560]  consciousness is constantly being eroded by the the the machines the the
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:08.480]  technology that are being fused with so you look at Google and Google is
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:16.760]  absolutely there and has been from the start to lead this fusing of technology
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:22.440]  with humans you you know I have this thing I call the totalitarian Tito
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.040]  where you know you start at A and you know you're going to the Z and you go
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.920]  in steps because you don't want to go too big or people might say what's going
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.800]  on and you look at what Google are doing this thing Google Glass you know the you
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.840]  know the computer and on the wearable computer stuff like that all this stuff

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:48.800]  it it's all connected to fusing and David we're going to break start to

[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.160]  Adams filling in for Alex who is in the UK at the Bilderberg conference which
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.480]  begins later this week now in the last segment David gave us a bewildering
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.960]  tour of a lot of fascinating concepts including the actual terraforming of the
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.840]  planet and some unseen forces that are at work and continuing continuing with
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.040]  that day but I wanted to ask you you know people are fed up with their food
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.400]  being genetically engineered but they don't yet realize how their reality is
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.400]  being engineered how their fears are being engineered I mean so much of what
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.480]  we get from the government and these people at the Bilderberg conference is
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:56.320]  what I would call fear engineering you spoke to that a little bit in the last
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:01.000]  segment can you give us a little more explanation of why fear is such a crucial
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.800]  element to their global domination plan
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.920]  well yeah I was just saying Mike about the the Google agenda with the the
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:14.040]  transhumanism and and what have you and I just want to throw in one more quick
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:20.240]  thing just to connect to all this with with Bilderberg Bilderberg its job is to
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:28.280]  basically sell and bring into public policy this deep this way yes dehumanization
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:35.320]  agenda so in the Bilderberg meetings the interface with the Google event that's
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.240]  been going on and of course Eric Schmidt the Google chairman will executive
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:43.280]  chairman will be at the Bilderberg meeting according to the list that's
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.400]  come out their job is to then to push that through the politicians there and
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.400]  the administrators and what have you in to public policy and it's interesting
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:02.440]  that the head of DARPA this sinister deeply deeply sinister technological
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:09.520]  development arm of the Pentagon that's really on a military level running
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.640]  this whole transhumanist agenda and developing the technology to push it on
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:20.400]  was Regina Duggan Regina Duggan left DARPA and became a executive of Google
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:30.200]  and this very week Mike she was also she is an executive of Motorola she was
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:38.040]  astounding the benefits of replacing passwords with a electronic tattoo which
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:42.880]  is one step only from an under the skin microchip so this is how all these
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:52.760]  things are running through and what they use as you point out is fear has many
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:58.560]  many levels and connotations for this whole story but one of them is when
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.160]  you get people in fear they will look outside of themselves for someone or
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:08.200]  something to protect them from what they've been manipulated to fear this is
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.920]  why all the way through history these bloodlines have used the bogeyman the
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:18.280]  big bad monsters come in and all the rest of it to frighten people into
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:26.000]  giving their power away and we must stop being frightened of all the fake bogeys
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.480]  and threats that they are throwing at us and we can only really do that again
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:37.120]  when we start to understand the nature of our own reality you know while we we
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.400]  look in the mirror and we think of ourselves as Charlie Smith or Ethel
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:47.160]  Jones little me then of course you're gonna look for all these powerful people
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:52.680]  to save us good all that rest of it when you realize that Ethel Jones and
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:57.400]  Charlie Smith is just an experience just the name for an experience what we are
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:04.000]  is not our body or a name it is that consciousness the infinite that we all
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.640]  are always have been and always will be about 30 seconds that body that's the
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:17.440]  true self and if you look at it Mike society has been set up to get people to
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.960]  have that point of attention the point at which they observe everything to the
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.080]  five senses to the body level of reality even if they can do that and cut us off
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:34.000]  from consciousness and then control the information thank you David we gotta go
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.120]  to break I'm sorry to interrupt you but thank you fascinating information David

[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:35.440]  of reality and how reality is manipulated by global controllers to put you
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.680]  into a state of constant fear so that you need to beg for authority to tell
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:43.480]  you what to do at least that's that's part of how it works and it reminds me
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.440]  david this is our last segment with you and then gerald salente takes over
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:51.760]  after this segment but it reminds me there was a story that was just posted
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:57.120]  this one's by anthony gucciardi the la pd was caught in an intense armed
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.840]  standoff with the call of duty video game statue at the headquarters of the
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:07.200]  company that makes the call of duty video games they had a statue of a guy
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:16.000]  with with a rifle and the police the la pd thought that that statue was a threat
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.680]  to them now isn't that a great metaphor for what they have the people doing
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:28.200]  well what they've done Mike is you will know that in america this happening
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:34.600]  everywhere is that they have spent decades systematically changing the
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:40.880]  personality of the police force and law enforcement the the the old genuine
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.840]  copper the old genuine police officer who used a bit of common sense and thought
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.040]  he was there to serve the people or she was there to serve the people they've
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:53.600]  been sifted out and sifted out and sifted out some of them still exist they
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.800]  must be a nightmare to work in the system as it is now but most of them have
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.920]  been sifted out and so many of these narcissistic psychopaths have come in
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:11.160]  and this is why the YouTube is full of these unbelievable violent scenes of
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:19.400]  police upon innocent people but they've also used the training that this is
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.160]  course it happens in the military all the time to literally program the minds
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:30.880]  of law enforcement people who will allow their minds to to fall for it and and
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:39.040]  what they've turned out are people who have no no sense of looking at a
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:46.880]  situation and making a judgment on the circumstances they every time I see them
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.720]  symbolically I see a big slot in their head and a rulebook pushed in or a
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:03:01.560]  micro chip pushed in and it's basically they find it impossible to make a
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:06.520]  decision by their own initiative it's like they're robots that's what they've
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  been turned into and then you see you get these ridiculous stories I know I've
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.960]  seen someone your side from time to time you find them all over the place these
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.640]  incredible stories where you know people what was this one the other that has
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:25.920]  been running the last few days a young kid at school makes a as an experiment he
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:31.000]  goes off with a bit of a bang and they arrest her for a destructive weapon I
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:38.840]  mean only the mindless and the brain dead could possibly react to pop-tarts
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:45.360]  like guns bubble guns by doing so right yeah yeah you name it it's it's it's
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:48.680]  they've bought into the illusion at such a deep level that they can't see
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:53.240]  reality now and and we put them in charge of you know policing our society
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:04:00.680]  it's quite frightening yeah and you know if you look at society and it's always
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.480]  been like this but that never more than now in terms of those that run it it's
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.560]  completely inverted you take anything that you know society sees as normal or
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:16.000]  you know to be desired or to be admired and you've got to turn it absolutely on
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.960]  its head to see the real truth and I said this before if you're born into a
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:28.120]  madhouse and basically the manipulation of the human conception and the fact that
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.200]  absolute clinical insane insane people have been running that the world for
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:41.360]  so long they have created a madhouse David we're going to a break David I

[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.440]  there's not a lot of natural news out there so it's really refreshing to see
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:24.680]  what you guys do I appreciate it very much and thank you Alex Jones for having
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:30.240]  me as a host on the Alex Jones show today it's an honor and a privilege and
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.760]  what I'm going to do today Mike and everyone is what we do every day for
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.760]  subscribers to the Trends Journal and that is from Monday to Friday we do
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.600]  Trends in the News so we're going to start off with today's Trends in the News
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:50.760]  talking about gold because you know gold is gold and it's been around for
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:56.080]  civilizations and it still makes a big difference of what's going on and gold
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:03.880]  prices today have bounced up as I speak about 24-25 dollars this is a very
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.960]  important mark by the way is a trend forecaster it's very important that gold
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:15.880]  stays above the $1400 mark as it is right now so it really determines where
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:22.640]  gold is going to go over the short period and long term if gold stays above
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:30.640]  this crucial point now why is gold going up today well the news is that
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:38.440]  manufacturing numbers fall unexpectedly drop according to Bloomberg most US
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:44.560]  stocks fell leaving the Standard and Poor's 500 index at its lowest in nearly
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:51.480]  three weeks after manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May indicating
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:57.200]  industry will provide scant support for the economy so what's the other side of
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:08.280]  that more cues QE1 QE2 QE3 QE2 infinity so that's what we're seeing that's
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.520]  why gold is going up because there is no recovery it's an artificial recovery
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:20.880]  it's an interest rate recovery as I call it look in the old days when I was a
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:27.120]  kid people used to put money in the bank and they used to retire on the interest
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.600]  that they got from it that's right that's ancient history in slave landia the
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:37.920]  new name for America the merger of state and corporate powers and now it's the
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:43.680]  USA China that's what's really going on over here so going back to interest
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:49.200]  rates there aren't any you put your money in the bank the banks does make the
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:55.960]  dough and you get nothing for return so what does that mean you're forced to
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.440]  speculate in the equity markets that's one of the other reasons the equity
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:07.240]  markets are going up people have no place to put their money so it's an
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.800]  interest rate recovery because interest rates are at historic lows we're
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:20.680]  celebrating the one hundredth year of the Federal Reserve taken over the
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:26.640]  country that's right the Federal Reserve Act and was it 1913 hundred years
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:34.040]  ago gave them the power to regulate and control the supply of money now they've
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:39.280]  regulated to the point where they just keep pumping the money in stimulus of
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:44.120]  course is white shoe boy language for printing cheap money and the other thing
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:50.600]  is low interest rates so gold is going up because manufacturing is going down
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:57.960]  there is no recovery it's only temporary in interest rate recovery and what's
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:05.520]  boosting it is home sales and the construction industry on one end began
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:13.400]  only temporary construction spending level edges higher in April now remember
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:19.640]  it's only edging higher in April after record low interest rates total
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.800]  construction spending registered a small gain in April surging home and
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:31.600]  apartment construction volatile private non-residential activity and shrinking
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:38.920]  public investment brings the whole report around new apartment and home
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:47.160]  construction with the standouts okay here's the deal new apartment
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:55.120]  construction that's because people can't afford to buy a home yeah that's right
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:01.800]  because young people back in the old days when they got out of college they
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:10.480]  didn't have 30 40 50 60 70 thousand 100 thousand dollars in debt yeah they could
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:18.040]  buy homes but now of course all the jobs that are coming out stink here's a story
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:29.080]  from the exchange the real reason Millennials don't buy cars and homes
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:35.280]  well the percentage of 16 to 24 year olds with drivers licenses dropped
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  sharply since 1997 and is now below 70% for the first time since 1963 you know
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.200]  why they can't buy cars and they're not buying them they got no dough the job
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:57.840]  stink here look at the numbers here I'm not making this up wealth from
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:05.520]  economic recovery has gone to the richest Americans top 1% got 93% of
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:13.280]  income growth as rich poor gap widened oh this story came out on Saturday when
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:19.200]  no one was paying attention Saturday is the least followed Newsday of the week
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:27.840]  and this isn't from a communist paper it's from Bloomberg yeah since it goes
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:33.880]  on the numbers are right here the 1.2 million households whose income put
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:42.480]  them at the top 1% of the US saw their earnings increase 5.5 percent last year
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:48.400]  according to the US Census Bureau so this isn't like you know a lefty
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:56.800]  organization making these numbers up well earnings fell 1.7% for the 96
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:10.400]  million households in the bottom 80% those that made less than 101,583
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:19.800]  dollars in 2010 the top 1% of families captured as much as 93% of the
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:26.000]  nation's income the earnings gap between rich and poor Americans was the
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:33.200]  widest in more than four decades in 2011 now check this out you don't like
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:37.000]  when you're walking down the street you're going to some of these supermarkets
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.800]  and man my own it really looks bad out there when you look at some of the
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:47.040]  people your eyes are telling the truth yeah now remember this is from the
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:53.000]  Census Bureau census data shows surpassing income equality
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:59.440]  previously reported in you the United States is surpassing income
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:10.000]  inequality previously reported in Uganda and Kazakhstan all right I mean I
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.680]  never been to Uganda Kazakhstan but I know you know they're not at the top of
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:25.200]  the pyramid when it comes to quality in life and either is the United States even
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:31.680]  in me the meandering economy generated 4.6 million private sector jobs since
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:40.920]  February 2010 almost 40% of them were in the fields of hospitality don't you
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:46.960]  love the word hospitality that means making somebody's bed in a hotel it
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:55.040]  means room service it means waiting on tables it means jobs that pay crap while
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:02.480]  the fat cats keep getting fatter and everybody else keeps getting poorer
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:12.600]  temporary staffing with the average wages below $15 an hour about 11.7% of
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:22.520]  middle-income families own stock in 2010 down from 14% in 2007 so when they're
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:29.640]  talking about a rising stock market the money's only going to the top although
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:34.000]  US consumers spending climbed to its highest level in four years in August
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.240]  according to the Gallup survey it still lags 2008 levels by more than 20%
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:48.320]  and what are people buying hey have a lovely time at family dollar because
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:58.240]  that's all you have to spend it just keeps getting worse from 1979 to 2007
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:06.800]  about $1.1 trillion in annual income shifted to the top 1% of Americans so
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:12.440]  there you got it those are the numbers the numbers don't lie but the people
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:19.920]  that are saying that there's a recovery they're lying as a matter of fact making
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:27.560]  fun of the gold news is none other than Norio Rabini you they call dr. Doom he
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:33.720]  says that gold prices really don't make a difference because after all gold is
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:39.920]  in a medium of exchange now you could store it but it's really not a unit of
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:44.440]  wealth that you can exchange for product and services he says you can't buy
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:50.560]  groceries with it tell that to the Iranians and tell it to the Chinese
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:20:00.200]  because you know why they're exchanging oil for gold
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:04.640]  have you ever consumed protein powder supplements I have and all of them don't

[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:47.040]  gold is not a means of payment you cannot pay for your groceries with it nor is
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:59.200]  it a unit to account you can't buy prices of goods and services are not
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:05.640]  denominated in gold terms again tell that to the Iranians and the Chinese I
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.760]  think the Persians in the Chinese by the way I've been around a lot longer than

[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.800]  bloodshed as toll of civilians and security personnel cross 1,000 hey
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:54.240]  remember all of those people that said hey Iraq is a better place without Saddam
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:26:00.000]  Hussein and it was worth the war you know the trillion dollars spent in the
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.680]  million people killed plus our soldiers that have lost their lives limbs in their
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:11.880]  minds here check out this video look what these psychopaths said I think the
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:16.640]  removal of Saddam Hussein was the right decision we are safer more secure that
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:20.960]  Iraq is better but our own security is better with Saddam and his two sons out
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.680]  of power and out of office than in office I believe indeed that we are but
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:30.120]  Saddam Hussein was a unique threat and the world is better off without him in
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:34.040]  power what we did in Iraq was the right thing to do it was hard to do it took a
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:44.920]  long time there were significant cost involved yes or no yes absolutely can
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.640]  you imagine what the world would be like with Saddam Hussein in control of the
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:56.080]  third largest oil reserves in the world in the heart of the Middle East these
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:01.760]  guys are psychopaths look at them did you get that the porky pig apologics over
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:07.640]  there Karl Rove with his last statement what was I Saddam Hussein in charge of
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:14.000]  you know the third largest oil reserves in the Middle East it's none of our
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.680]  business you don't attack foreign countries because you want their goods
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:26.440]  and services or maybe imperialists doing immoral people like you porky pig this
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:31.520]  is disgusting you want to know how America could come back people asked me
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:38.920]  all the time it's very simple do what the founding fathers suggested stay out of
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:43.680]  foreign entanglements no Iraq is not better off without Saddam Hussein and
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:50.040]  neither is the rest of the world because from Iraq also came al-Qaeda more of
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:55.360]  al-Qaeda and where is al-Qaeda now oh they're over there in Libya you remember
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:02.160]  Libya that was the place that chicken or Cameron Sarkozy and Obama were going to

[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:24.640]  that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it or our food being sold to
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:28.440]  other countries but here's the most effective way you lose your liberty and

[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:14.640]  heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show hey this is
[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:19.840]  Gerald Salenty I'm back and I'm happy to be a host on the Alex Jones show as
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:27.520]  he's over there exposing the Bilderberg bullies who are taking control of the
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:35.520]  entire globe it's a takeover the multi-nationals are in control and now
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:40.960]  it's coming back right here to the United States even the Chinese are grabbing a
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:46.640]  piece of the action as I mentioned they're buying Smithfield up one of those
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:51.600]  big pork producers and a lot of labels out there that you're all familiar with
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:59.000]  here's a story in today's New York Times the self-proclaimed paper of record
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:05.480]  which I like to call the Turley paper of record Chinese bid for US pork had
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:12.920]  links to Wall Street you see what I mean that is a BS line how nice they say it
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:19.480]  how about a criminal operation where the Mafia is all working together to pull
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:26.760]  off another big deal that's gonna screw the people short-term long-term that
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:32.560]  would have been more appropriate but I digress let me move on when a Chinese
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:41.680]  company bid 4.7 billion last week to take over Smithfields America's biggest
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:48.680]  pork producer the deal was announced by the company's Chinese executives but
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:54.400]  behind the bid was a group of savvy investors savvy investors you know what
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:01.480]  that means savvy investors is a BS line for the guys in that are doing the deal
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:06.040]  in a rigged game that know how it's gonna fall out and put all their bets
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:11.640]  down as the suckers stand around the table thinking they're gonna win the
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:17.720]  game it's an inside deal but we'll call them savvy investors because that's nice
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:27.640]  and proper and global deal makers again a BS word who hold the substantial
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:33.440]  stake in the Chinese company oh when you know who those global deal makers are
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:46.840]  and savvy investors Goldman Sachs the Goldman Sachs game yeah CDH investments
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:53.520]  Singapore's sovereign wealth fund and New Horizon capital a private private
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:36:00.800]  equity firm founded by the son of the former Chinese Prime Minister Wenzhou
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:07.360]  bow you get it the group controls nearly half the shares of Shungai
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:13.080]  International much of which was acquired about seven years ago by helping
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:20.640]  privatize the company that had been run by a state-owned meat processor it's all
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:26.760]  inside deals privatization by the way that too is white shoe boy language for
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:35.440]  selling expensive public assets to your buddies on inside deals for pennies on
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:44.160]  the dollar so here you got it the Chinese buy-in Smithfield this company by
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:51.840]  the way is a huge pork producer now check this out these are the Chinese rat
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:57.800]  meat and Chinese food safety this was only May 12th it is an ancient history
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:04.360]  the latest food scandal in China which has seen rat meat passed off his lamb has
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:11.480]  raised more questions about food safety in the country okay and then there's that
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:22.040]  bird flu thing going on and now people also forgot this is from March 20th the
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:30.680]  number of dead pigs pulled out of the Hangpu River in Shanghai crossed 10,000
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:38.840]  since the city government started fishing out the pig caucuses about two
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:45.880]  weeks ago now let me get this straight they got pigs floating down the Hangpu
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:53.080]  and now they're taking over the biggest pig producer in the United States what
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:38:01.800]  are we gonna have now pigs floating down the Potomac I mean that's all it is
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:11.600]  pigs to pigs I think they should change you know the symbols of the Democratic
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:18.240]  and Republican parties the elephants are the pigs and the Democrats are the rats
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:25.920]  that's right the Democrats are the rats that began to sell America out full time
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:33.840]  with Bill Clinton's NAFTA and of course the elephant pigs they started you know
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:40.000]  paving the deal with Nixon playing ping-pong over there in China to get the
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:47.960]  deals rolling so now you could see what's happening as I said as the United
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:59.280]  States wages war China wages business and now they're taking over America
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:06.480]  there's another side to the Chinese pig story and those glottons that sold out
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:12.680]  Smithfield you see the Chinese food I love it by the way you go into a health
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:17.920]  food store this is one of my favorite you know I don't eat corporate food and I'm
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:21.880]  Italian I like to cook and I have a wonderful recipe that I make with
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:30.320]  broccoli and pinnoli nuts and olives orc yeti like a nice fine olive oil and
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:36.120]  another couple of other ingredients like capers so I like pinnoli that's I go
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:42.240]  into the into the health food store the pinnoli nuts come from China oh yeah
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:47.800]  guaranteed to be organic and I got a bridge for you to buy over there in
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:54.120]  Brooklyn and I'll give it to you at a good price the Chinese once they have
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:00.560]  established their companies in the United States now could be bringing in
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:07.720]  more of their crappy products and sell it to us and pass it off whatever they
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:18.160]  want oh and by the way only about 2% or less of imported product is looked at
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:25.000]  and tested by the FDA and the agricultural department so virtually
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.080]  nothing is being looked at and by the way as a trend forecast what you look at
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:37.560]  when you look at this trend is to see what the opportunities in food natural
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:44.360]  as in natural news natural food natural healing that is the future
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:51.960]  entrepreneurs understanding that not everybody watches the Kardashians not

[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:12.360]  and health is going to continue to be one of the biggest motivators for profit
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:19.600]  opportunities among those who look for whole health healing as myself to be the
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:25.280]  major trend the major trend as we continue to move into the 21st century
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:34.840]  and continue to see a population that's aging and a very sizable segment of it
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:41.320]  looking to age healthy because in the words of Mr. Boogie you got a boogie

[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:04.760]  the Renaissance is in food break the change you hear me say it all the time
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:10.880]  now check it out use your head if the Chinese are going to be taking over the
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:17.040]  nation's largest pork producer and they're being taken over by a company
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:22.440]  that is already one of the largest pork producers in the world guess what you're
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:30.320]  gonna get at those chain food places and all that fast food crap they eat you're
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:39.120]  going to get Chinese pork it's already disgusting food the way agribusiness has
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:43.520]  destroyed it and what they've done to these poor animals is in your main
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:51.320]  conditions now you can guarantee it's even gonna get worse so remember the
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:43:02.200]  future is in food you know talking about China by the way little note that
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.760]  comes out kind of things you look at the trend as a trend forecaster and this
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:11.120]  again this is over the weekend the news doesn't come out very big buried in the
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:18.000]  second section of the Financial Times way down on the bottom iron ore route
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  amid mounting concern over China demand iron ore prices suffered their sharpest
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.360]  fall in more than a year this week as steel traders and mills rushed to dump
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:36.520]  their stocks amid fears over the outlook for China demand so things are
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:41.280]  slowing down globally again the only way they're going to pump the markets up
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:47.920]  is by pumping money into them and the more money they pump in the higher gold
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:55.600]  prices should go and again we're not only looking at problems in the United
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:01.400]  States hey over the weekend you know as they were talking about stupid crap on
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:10.200]  CNN and continue to do so or an MSNBC you know mindless news for nobody and and
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:19.680]  CBS and ABC etc little story came out anti-austerity protests held across
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:28.640]  Europe she I wonder why demonstrations take place in Greece Spain Portugal and
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:36.840]  Germany as anger against continent-wide austerity pressures grows these are not
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:43.880]  austerity pressures these are robbing the people to give the money to the
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:48.600]  people that have all the money already that's what austerity measures are what
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:55.320]  austerity measures means raising taxes cutting services killing your pensions
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:01.120]  and benefits and increasing the age of retirement until after you die and I'm
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:08.200]  sick of hearing that term entitlements social security is not an entitlement
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:14.120]  medical benefits are not an entitlement just to get this straight for anybody
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:21.840]  that's too stupid to read or too deaf to hear we put tons of our money that they
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:30.200]  steal from us from every damn paycheck in social security in federal taxes
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:38.240]  and then when it's time for us to get it back they say screw you their
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:44.320]  entitlements and we'll give them back to you if we feel like it but meanwhile
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:51.200]  we're gonna give you less back than we promised and you know why because the
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  pigs and the rats are in control the Democrats and the Republicans I'm a
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:02.320]  political atheist as you know I don't believe in any of these religious
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:06.960]  political parties political political politics has become a religion and I

[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:05.680]  there in Turkey yeah you know that place that wanted to get into the European
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:11.080]  Union all the time but they never let them but always when they need soldiers

[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:43.040]  Turkey's protest reignite yep this series of television
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.720]  appearances following the occupation of Taksim Square
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:56.400]  Rees up a dog in that's the Prime Minister dismissed protesters across the
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:05.400]  country's biggest cities as looters he's a striped Twitter as a curse and branded
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:11.640]  anyone who drank alcohol and alcoholic yeah you look at this photo of these
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:20.120]  protesters they certainly don't look like looters alcoholics who have been

[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:32.280]  life but to make this point Erdogan says many protesters say that his
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:39.720]  authoritarian tendencies on the part of his regime are the root cause of the
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:45.240]  scale of discontent citing measures such as a new law to restrict the
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:51.360]  consumption of alcohol quote I do these things because I love all my citizens I
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:59.200]  want them to get rid of their bad habits I know you get it I do these

[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:42.880]  and as I was saying as he went into break imagine six trillion dollars spent
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:49.840]  in the Afghan and Iraq wars for nothing to only destroy two countries and destroy
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:55.640]  the lives of millions of people including our troops who have lost their
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:01.560]  lives their limbs many of their minds committing suicide and getting very

[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:27.480]  Chuck Hagel is over there pushing for pivot Asia Singapore US Defense

[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:46.700]  like like Patriot missiles you know I love that one too the first of a new
[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:52.520]  class of literal warships recently deployed to Asia to partner with allies
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.480]  in the region oh yeah allies like Japan you remember them yeah

[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:18.800]  and viability of the roughly thirty four billion dollar program and the Pentagon
[02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:25.240]  buying 42 pieces of this crap you know how much junk that they keep making and
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:32.080]  throwing away when I wrote trend tracking back in 1988 the government had
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:39.760]  already spent 13 trillion dollars on the Cold War general the white the eyes and
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:43.240]  how I warned us that the military industrial complex is robbing us of
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.520]  the genius of our scientists the sweat of our labors and the future of our
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:53.600]  children it's right here in black and white it's being robbed and what they're
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:59.880]  also talking about UK to ship arms if Syria talks fail this is from the
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.320]  Financial Times Britain and France this week forced through an amendment to a
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.760]  UN arms embargo that opened the door for supply of weapons to the opposition
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:17.360]  forces in recent weeks the US has secretly undertaking significant lobbying
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:25.120]  of you EU member states in order to get the EU arms embargo amended the
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:32.080]  officials said hey you know where this comes from no no not the world's socialist
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:38.920]  newspaper not the progressive not counterpunch the Financial Times it's as
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:47.600]  obvious as that the US is setting us up for a new war in Syria and now they're
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:53.160]  talking about a no-fly zone yeah you know what that is you remember that one
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:59.280]  in Libya and no no-fly zone means they bomb the hell out of the government
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:05.440]  that's in control and you listen to what every one of the prostitutes repeat
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:12.040]  from the government officials Assad has to go I say if they want him to go any
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:15.120]  of those officials that want him to go go take him out and leave a saddiest
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:21.640]  psycho trip we're all lead a deathmatch Obama wants Assad out let's put him in
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:25.840]  the arena and let him fight it out and keep us out of it like the real warriors
