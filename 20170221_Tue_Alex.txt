[00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:04.996]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:09.982]  But the truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:13.067]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.024]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.267]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.549]  We have to be good.
[00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:27.410]  We have to be pure.
[00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.591]  We have to be strong.
[00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.392]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:32.894]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:40.691]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:48.792]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:55.314]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:18.993]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:20.194]  Move, bitch!
[00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:23.057]  Get out the way!
[00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:26.300]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag
[00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:35.435]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.956]  I will not let you down.
[00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:41.759]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.280]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.401]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:51.145]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:53.727]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:54.748]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:03.630]  You know, I knew what the New York Times was doing when they wanted to do this profile piece on Infowars.
[00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.894]  They'd attacked me probably, I don't know, five, six times in big articles just in the last two weeks.
[00:02:10.894 --> 00:02:17.918]  But I talked to Roger Stone and he said that he'd gotten some halfway fair reporting out of this Jim Rutenberg show.
[00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:18.559]  I did the interview.
[00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:26.457]  And I read some of the other articles he'd written calling for shutting down fake news, by any means necessary.
[00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:33.581]  And I realized that he was basically writing a blueprint for how the system could come after us.
[00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:37.223]  How they were asking how we make our money, how we fund ourselves, things like that.
[00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:46.047]  But still, I knew it would be in the paper physical edition of the New York Times, and so it could reach some people that aren't normally on the internet who could actually be woken up.
[00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:46.788]  And so I did the interview.
[00:02:48.092 --> 00:03:09.749]  We got contacted this morning by our big third-party advertising group that brings in a large portion of our funding, selling our products, and they said, you are fake news, you are political, they said that's banned, and you are kicked off of our system for good.
[00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:19.065]  Now that's like Nazi Germany telling the Jews, you gotta go to your ghetto, you can't have businesses anymore anywhere in these areas of the city.
[00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.306]  Matt Drudge came here a year and a half ago.
[00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:23.707]  Only interview he's done in like four years.
[00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:29.490]  And I think it's time for one again and he said, I was told by Supreme Court Justice, they're coming after free speech.
[00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.113]  They're coming after it in 2016, towards the end of the year.
[00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:39.415]  We're in 2017 and I have congressmen on television
[00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:51.264]  Saying that Trump should have his free speech banned and that they want a law passed to ban Trump's speech.
[00:03:51.264 --> 00:04:04.548]  You also hear them saying ban him off Twitter and now they don't let positive comments get up in his Twitter feed so he can't read those and interact with the public because he interacts with the public just like he'll sit there and answer the switchboard at night randomly and talk to the public.
[00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:05.568]  He loves it.
[00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:07.009]  So did his dad and he always did.
[00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.109]  And the rest of his family.
[00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:16.896]  So Jerry Nadler's gone on CNN and said it's time to ban Donald Trump from being able to quote criticize the media.
[00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:19.178]  Whoa!
[00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:25.243]  Look, they're the fake news, they're the collapsing news, their revenue, their viewers, they know it.
[00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:36.132]  And so their answer is get a bunch of foreign Mexican kingpin money to come in and you know run the New York Times and if that doesn't do it just shut down Infowars, shut down Donald Trump.
[00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:36.853]  This is a big deal.
[00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:40.406]  Reddit is banning sharing Donald Trump information.
[00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:45.570]  This is a war they're heating up against us, and there's ways to stop them.
[00:04:45.570 --> 00:05:00.362]  There's ways to defeat them, but we have to codify it, we have to document it, we have to expose it, we have to sue people, we have to get really aggressive, and you, the viewers, have to understand it's a total war, and spread the links and the articles even more, and buy the products directly from us.
[00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:09.760]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:18.343]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:23.184]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:40.795]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia, and the deep states declared war on President Trump, condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet, reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity, one has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:53.103]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities, and even shoot downs of Russian jets, if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:58.309]  Uh, there are other options, uh, that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:01.332]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:03.174]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:09.581]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:12.924]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:22.714]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:23.555]  Caveman.
[00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:28.640]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.742]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:34.183]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:39.324]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:47.405]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:55.407]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:55.407 --> 00:06:58.928]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself.
[00:06:58.928 --> 00:07:00.048]  InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:11.542]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:17.467]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.488]  Iodine is key.
[00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:24.670]  Paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:33.614]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:34.274]  On top of that,
[00:07:34.414 --> 00:07:37.537]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:40.359]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:53.289]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[00:07:53.289 --> 00:08:00.215]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:24.993]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:24.993 --> 00:08:26.635]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:29.799]  Tuesday, February 21st, 2017 is a very important date.
[00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:47.852]  Facebook, Google, Twitter, and hundreds of other major corporate platforms like Amazon are openly getting money from the CIA, the NSA, you name it, to spy on their customers.
[00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:52.695]  The Washington Post is openly run by criminal elements of the CIA.
[00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:58.419]  There is a civil war going on politically inside this country.
[00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:01.221]  Hillary and her cohorts tried to steal the election.
[00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:03.022]  The landslide was so big they failed.
[00:09:04.597 --> 00:09:12.439]  Now they are openly in newspapers and publications everywhere calling for the overthrow of Trump, including his murder.
[00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:29.885]  So does that surprise us, ladies and gentlemen, that just the last few days, Reddit, Twitter, you name it, have all been announcing that they're not going to let political news and information be shared if it's conservative, or if it's libertarian, or if it is nationalistic.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.980]  And it's all being done in concert.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.241]  It's one thing if Reddit or Twitter or Facebook comes in and censors you.
[00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:40.702]  It's their platform.
[00:09:40.702 --> 00:09:41.942]  They can discriminate, I guess.
[00:09:41.942 --> 00:09:56.745]  But when they meet with other consortiums, when they get directed, as the WikiLeaks shows, by the Democratic Party and different foundations, then they're engaged in organized racketeering to suppress free speech.
[00:09:58.402 --> 00:09:59.563]  And that's what's going on.
[00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:04.207]  So I have many fights here, obviously, but we have to defend free speech.
[00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:09.652]  In fact, months ago, I had the crew create the Coalition to Defend Free Speech.
[00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:13.676]  And we can actually give you that URL and put that up on screen.
[00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:17.159]  I will get that URL for you next.
[00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.480]  Call Anthony in, please.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.182]  Need a data sheet on that and give people all that information.
[00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:21.483]  Thank you.
[00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:26.608]  But I obviously didn't have a lot of time to get prepared for the broadcast today.
[00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:31.531]  It's CoalitionToDefendFreeSpeech.com.
[00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:37.316]  And we, again, launched this the last few months, sent 100,000 signatures to President-elect Trump.
[00:10:37.316 --> 00:10:40.858]  And we're going to send the signatures back again this week to the White House.
[00:10:40.858 --> 00:10:46.883]  Just to point out that Obama signed a law saying they're going to start restricting free speech.
[00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:49.444]  And they've announced all these attacks on free speech.
[00:10:50.558 --> 00:11:03.671]  And we need to admit this is happening and understand how serious it is and understand that Trump has to openly repeal the law that Obama passed or sign executive orders basically blocking it.
[00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:09.866]  Because Trump is the greatest victim of the censorship, our president.
[00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:11.766]  They're openly saying, take away his Twitter.
[00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:14.347]  They're only letting you see negative comments in the Twitter.
[00:11:14.347 --> 00:11:17.648]  They are, you know, kicking his daughter's clothing line out of stores.
[00:11:17.648 --> 00:11:24.771]  And the point is, you can do this here or there, but you can't have a organized, solid wall of this.
[00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:31.093]  This is organized, and they've called for it in the news, and this is a program
[00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:35.634]  An operation that they are running against everyone.
[00:11:35.634 --> 00:11:40.496]  Now, they're desperate because Trump's trying to turn the economy back on.
[00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:42.257]  He's trying to cut taxes for poor people.
[00:11:42.257 --> 00:11:44.338]  He's got regulations getting cut for small businesses.
[00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:48.841]  He's ordering the Federal Reserve to have small business loans to local businesses.
[00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:53.503]  That's why small businesses are exploding right now for the first time since 1984.
[00:11:53.503 --> 00:11:55.464]  I covered that news just yesterday.
[00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.026]  Really good numbers coming in for the little guy.
[00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.453]  For the first time since the Reagan recovery of 1984.
[00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:05.755]  That didn't get going until 82, 83.
[00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:15.561]  And so they're trying to block this, and the Federal Reserve's trying to block it, so he's trying to change who's in the Federal Reserve, and they are trying to throw him out right now, because he's doing that now.
[00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:18.303]  Enter what just happened to InfoWars.
[00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:27.188]  And this, this, this, this, this giant spectrum of censorship that is taking place.
[00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:53.464]  You see third-party targeted advertising online, where if you visited InfoWars, then, or if you visit InfoWarsStore.com, when you then go to other sites, if they're part of the ad network, you will then see those ads posted and projected again, whether it's water filtration systems or non-GMO heirloom seeds or supplements.
[00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:57.266]  One of the biggest groups out there is AdRoll, and it works closely with Google.
[00:12:59.349 --> 00:13:08.716]  Now, they've openly said, kick Breitbart off its apps that they paid for, that were accepted years ago by Apple, iTunes.
[00:13:08.716 --> 00:13:10.697]  They won't even accept one of ours, basically.
[00:13:10.697 --> 00:13:24.528]  Now, then meanwhile, you've got these third-party advertising platforms, and you heard about Breitbart getting Kellogg's and other third-party groups that advertise through the networks dumping them.
[00:13:24.528 --> 00:13:27.490]  That was to get the ad-sharing network they were on to dump them.
[00:13:29.045 --> 00:13:30.686]  So this is economic warfare.
[00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:33.588]  This isn't saying we're going to protest one sponsor until they drop.
[00:13:33.588 --> 00:13:34.489]  That's free speech.
[00:13:34.489 --> 00:13:39.353]  This is we're not going to let you have access to the markets.
[00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:43.876]  Like not letting black people rent a house or buy a house or letting black people vote.
[00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:53.663]  This is classical discrimination and they tell you and they're always updating their giant contract where you basically waive your rights.
[00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:58.067]  They tell you, document cam shot please, in the ad roll contract
[00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:02.440]  How they can ban you.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:13.405]  And they go on to say that you are political and we won't allow any advertising on our platforms that are political.
[00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:20.449]  Now see, they can say that in their terms of service, but not if they take liberal or globalist sponsors, which we've gone and looked.
[00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.869]  They do.
[00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:21.990]  So it's discriminatory.
[00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:26.813]  It is a civil rights violation.
[00:14:26.813 --> 00:14:29.394]  It is an attempt to bankrupt us.
[00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:33.076]  It is an attempt to put us into an electronic and then physical ghetto.
[00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:39.458]  Because first, before you're physically silenced, you are financially and culturally silenced, and your speech is silenced.
[00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:42.079]  So, we have very tame advertising.
[00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.340]  Everybody knows that.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.721]  Go to InfoWars.com, see the same ads we serve out to everybody else.
[00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:54.143]  An image of a canister of bone broth concentrate that says good for your body.
[00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.584]  Or non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:14:56.584 --> 00:15:01.886]  Those are the ads that we serve out on their networks, and what do they say?
[00:15:01.886 --> 00:15:02.766]  Special interest.
[00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:10.569]  To protect the privacy of users, audiences cannot be targeted based on implied or explicit knowledge of a user's personal circumstances.
[00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:11.529]  What on earth does that mean?
[00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:16.061]  Do not target based on or imply potentially sensitive.
[00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:20.547]  This is like in schools, in the admission forms, they say don't say you're a mother or father.
[00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:25.215]  Someone else might not have one, so you can't have a mother or father.
[00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:25.836]  This is what they're saying.
[00:15:25.836 --> 00:15:27.017]  This is their new system of law.
[00:15:27.984 --> 00:15:30.666]  Physical or mental, medical or health information.
[00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:31.846]  What does that even mean?
[00:15:31.846 --> 00:15:33.407]  Criminal proceedings or allegations.
[00:15:33.407 --> 00:15:34.048]  None of that.
[00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:34.948]  Financial problems.
[00:15:34.948 --> 00:15:37.950]  So we can't talk about things in the world or the economy.
[00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:38.831]  But everybody else can.
[00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:39.951]  This is all sexually enforced.
[00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:41.012]  Political opinions.
[00:15:41.012 --> 00:15:42.753]  You can't have any of those.
[00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:44.654]  Racial or ethnic information.
[00:15:44.654 --> 00:15:45.855]  Religious or similar beliefs.
[00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:48.376]  Let's go to InfoWars.com.
[00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:50.718]  Let's show you the ads.
[00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:51.438]  Rainforest.
[00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:52.419]  Powerful nootropic.
[00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:55.930]  For mental performance.
[00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.071]  Powerful new InfoWars live formula.
[00:15:58.071 --> 00:15:59.531]  33% off retail.
[00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:00.472]  Caveman.
[00:16:00.472 --> 00:16:02.512]  Wow, that is so evil.
[00:16:02.512 --> 00:16:03.913]  Here, let's scroll down some more.
[00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:05.754]  Let's see the evil ads.
[00:16:05.754 --> 00:16:06.414]  Keep scrolling down.
[00:16:06.414 --> 00:16:07.354]  There aren't many ads, are there?
[00:16:07.354 --> 00:16:08.075]  Keep scrolling down.
[00:16:08.075 --> 00:16:08.895]  Oh, there's another one.
[00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:10.736]  Survival Shield X2 Nasal Ionine.
[00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:15.058]  Leading the way into the next generation of supplements.
[00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.658]  Oh my gosh, this is so horrible.
[00:16:16.658 --> 00:16:17.999]  Those are the ads we serve out.
[00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:20.726]  Now let's look at what they say.
[00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:24.791]  All content on your website should be relevant, accurate, informative and up to date.
[00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:26.413]  This is what they sent us in an email.
[00:16:26.413 --> 00:16:28.596]  Any claims should be easily verifiable.
[00:16:28.596 --> 00:16:36.486]  We are not able to promote websites that intentionally misrepresent their businesses or use any tactic to falsely enhance reputation or misrepresent actual offerings.
[00:16:36.826 --> 00:16:45.649]  Furthermore, all political content should focus on the merits of the candidate or political message and should not be special interest or groups or imply affiliations.
[00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:51.631]  So they're saying our website cannot have any political views unless they certify and say it's okay.
[00:16:51.631 --> 00:17:02.615]  But Facebook and Google and the Huffington Post and everybody else, there's no problem with this group and Salon that promotes pedophilia.
[00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:04.836]  So what you see is an attempt to purge
[00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:09.681]  Conservative, and libertarian, and Americana, and pro.
[00:17:11.278 --> 00:17:14.799]  Sovereignty organizations off the web and cut off their funding.
[00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:21.440]  And if you look at the amount of money we made with this last year with advertising, it's about the extra money we have this year to expand.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.741]  Now here's the thing.
[00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:24.221]  I've cut a lot of commercials.
[00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:25.661]  I could do a lot more plugging.
[00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:30.443]  We've always done that saying, if we ever get in a jam, we have ways to raise money.
[00:17:30.443 --> 00:17:34.984]  And so because of this, I'm not going to hire 20 more people this year.
[00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:37.664]  I'm hiring 100.
[00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:40.165]  And I am going to triple revenue.
[00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:40.325]  So.
[00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:43.564]  Because we know more attacks are coming.
[00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:47.906]  We have to get big like a fortress and strong to stand against this.
[00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:50.467]  I just want to focus on the news and not trying to raise funds.
[00:17:50.467 --> 00:17:53.668]  But the two go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:17:53.668 --> 00:18:01.071]  So you hear all over the web that Breitbart's having its advertising pulled or not letting them promote on networks to make money for their systems.
[00:18:02.287 --> 00:18:04.428]  We have innovated ways to fund ourselves.
[00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:08.189]  You hear about Breitbart not having as much money and needing to lay people off.
[00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:11.170]  You hear about other platforms not doing as well.
[00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:18.031]  All of them aren't doing as well because they're being censored and they're being blocked and they're being controlled.
[00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:20.792]  Breitbart then tries to sell t-shirts just like we do.
[00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:22.633]  You either support InfoWars
[00:18:23.653 --> 00:18:33.023]  Or we contract in the face of the globalists and then they win and then they can censor your kid's speech at school or your speech at church or work.
[00:18:33.023 --> 00:18:34.224]  This is bullying?
[00:18:34.224 --> 00:18:34.905]  I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:44.211]  This is absolutely an attempt, in my view, in my opinion, in my research, at a giant program of racketeering.
[00:18:44.211 --> 00:18:49.532]  And it's in the WikiLeaks, how they wanted to shut down the alt-right, how they want to shut down the independent media.
[00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:53.293]  I have Hillary, as a presidential candidate, saying, I'm evil.
[00:18:53.293 --> 00:18:58.595]  I have the New York Times and others, look at this, media's next challenge, overcoming the threat of fake news.
[00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:06.732]  In Trump's volleys, echoes of Alex Jones conspiracy theories, the message that wasn't, and a turning point for fake news.
[00:19:06.732 --> 00:19:09.098]  This is all the New York Times, coming out.
[00:19:10.069 --> 00:19:13.752]  In the article saying it's time to restrict fake news.
[00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:22.099]  And a day after the New York Times comes out and says that, Alex Jones has 3.3 million dollars of funding.
[00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:25.181]  That's what happened last year with Enroll.
[00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:30.706]  Projected into next year, more than that, pulled, so we can't start a Washington Bureau.
[00:19:30.706 --> 00:19:32.267]  So that we can't hire more crew.
[00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:35.269]  So that we can't fight harder and expose these liars.
[00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:38.532]  When Nancy Pelosi gets up and says George W. Bush is still the president,
[00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:46.473]  And the same press conference Maxine Waters is so out of her mind she thinks Russia attacked Korea.
[00:19:46.473 --> 00:19:48.714]  And they're up there saying we're going to shut Trump down.
[00:19:48.714 --> 00:19:49.935]  Let me play for you.
[00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:51.275]  Because here's the deal.
[00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:52.276]  If they get away with this...
[00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:59.152]  And they can start restricting, and they can try to shut down Drudge, and they can try to shut down Infowars through all this.
[00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:02.194]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:20:02.194 --> 00:20:04.495]  This is bigger than your Second Amendment.
[00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:16.822]  This is your First Amendment, and if you don't use it, and exercise it, and support it, and if you don't support our platforms, I want everyone to go to InfowarsStore.com today, and I
[00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:40.372]  Want you to buy the incredible Nutraceuticals, the Super Mel Vitality, the Bone Broth Caveman, the incredible Nanotech Body Armor, the non-GMO heirloom open pollinated seeds, the shortwave radios, the high-quality water... I love how the left always makes jokes that we sell high-quality water filters when the water supply is so poison, because they love us just sitting there drinking their poison.
[00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:46.619]  It's all there, the storable foods, all the high quality products, the hunting supplies.
[00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:54.323]  It's all the optics, the lowers for M4s with the limited edition Donald Trump.
[00:20:54.323 --> 00:20:57.665]  And if you'll just stop shopping at the big globalist box stores.
[00:20:58.723 --> 00:21:04.586]  And if you'll just start supporting us a little more, believe me, $3 million sounds like a lot, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:09.189]  You couldn't run a small-town newspaper on that a year.
[00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:13.592]  We have that amount of bandwidth cost every six months, okay?
[00:21:13.592 --> 00:21:15.293]  I mean, people want us to fight.
[00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:16.273]  You want somebody to stand up.
[00:21:16.273 --> 00:21:17.794]  You want somebody to take action.
[00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:20.416]  I'm in every newspaper in the country saying, shut me up.
[00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.984]  They're saying shut down your president.
[00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:25.265]  They're saying ban him off TV.
[00:21:25.265 --> 00:21:28.807]  Pass a law that the president doesn't have free speech.
[00:21:28.807 --> 00:21:32.730]  Our elected representative at the highest level, our commander-in-chief.
[00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.912]  And they're openly saying all this because they plan on doing it.
[00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.253]  I told you this was all coming.
[00:21:39.827 --> 00:21:56.900]  So, we have products everybody needs, but it's a 360, because you get products you need, you get products that are game-changing, you get products that are super high quality at a very competitive price, and you fund an operation totally committed that is fearlessly taking on the new world order.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:06.668]  But please, put it in your calendar, your digital calendar, put it on your physical calendar to every month support InfoWars, to get a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt, to get a Bill Clinton rape shirt,
[00:22:08.268 --> 00:22:18.835]  You know, they're saying, oh, we're mean, so we're not allowed to advertise our shopping cart with Make America Free Again hats and Made in America apparel, like come and take it.
[00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:25.860]  They're the ones on every major platform saying kill the president, have civil war, beating people up that go to demonstrations to support the president.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.681]  I want to say something about Milo.
[00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:28.142]  I'm going to get into this later.
[00:22:28.142 --> 00:22:34.026]  Milo made his comments about being sexually abused when he was, quote, a boy or a teenager, and
[00:22:35.686 --> 00:22:53.490]  CPAC invited him knowing that so they could disinvite him and have a big stunt to begin all of these amazing attempted takedowns of civilization and society.
[00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.211]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:56.031]  They're trying to set the precedent with bullying.
[00:22:57.591 --> 00:23:02.572]  to take down all the different groups and organizations that are actually defending our Republic.
[00:23:02.572 --> 00:23:06.613]  They're popping in my ear telling me Dr. Corsi just Skyped in and he's sitting with Kurt Weldon.
[00:23:06.613 --> 00:23:12.655]  Yeah, I talked to the Congressman and him earlier, former Congressman, former head of the, Vice Head of the Homeland Security Committee.
[00:23:12.655 --> 00:23:13.535]  I talked to him earlier.
[00:23:13.535 --> 00:23:15.395]  I thought we were going to talk about this.
[00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.416]  I'm happy to have him on.
[00:23:16.416 --> 00:23:23.877]  I just, people just know all the stuff I did, you know.
[00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:24.778]  Yeah, let's play that, Drudge.
[00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:25.298]  Let's play this.
[00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:26.138]  Here's Drudge warning people.
[00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:26.338]  Here it is.
[00:23:27.008 --> 00:23:37.395]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:39.656]  In a big way.
[00:23:39.656 --> 00:23:41.377]  If your calling is media, fine.
[00:23:41.377 --> 00:23:43.779]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:45.340]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.820]  Now.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:57.925]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[00:23:57.925 --> 00:23:59.526]  This is ghetto.
[00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:00.326]  This is ghetto.
[00:24:00.326 --> 00:24:01.226]  This is corporate.
[00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:04.267]  They're taking your energy.
[00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:06.968]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return.
[00:24:06.968 --> 00:24:07.349]  Nothing.
[00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:08.809]  They're dumbing the language down.
[00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:10.750]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.791]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:16.973]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[00:24:16.973 --> 00:24:18.694]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[00:24:18.694 --> 00:24:21.176]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[00:24:21.176 --> 00:24:21.956]  You're out of there.
[00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:24.598]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[00:24:24.598 --> 00:24:31.782]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[00:24:31.782 --> 00:24:33.423]  Time is not forever.
[00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:36.525]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[00:24:37.345 --> 00:24:38.566]  Uh, rise and fall.
[00:24:38.566 --> 00:24:39.667]  There's not that many.
[00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:41.669]  It's a small amount.
[00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:47.793]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:47.993]  No.
[00:24:47.993 --> 00:24:48.734]  No, you can't.
[00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:50.816]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:56.020]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.362]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[00:24:58.362 --> 00:25:01.084]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:01.944]  This is insane.
[00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:05.127]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[00:25:05.487 --> 00:25:07.969]  Now, remember just recently, people lined up with it.
[00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:10.451]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:12.473]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:14.335]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[00:25:14.335 --> 00:25:25.064]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:31.346]  Now that was a year and a half ago, Matt Drudge said you cannot have a news site with news headlines or you will be shut down.
[00:25:31.346 --> 00:25:39.769]  And they told us, AdRoll that works with Google, one of the biggest companies out there, that we were very successful with promoting our products that helped fund our operation and our free speech.
[00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:45.011]  They said you're banned for being a news site and we basically say you're fake news.
[00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:48.232]  And it's being done across the board to silence the American people.
[00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:53.214]  Now, Congressman Nadler went on MSNBC and said they're introducing legislation
[00:25:54.598 --> 00:26:00.240]  to basically ban the free speech, and that was also on Fox.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.941]  They want to ban the free speech of the President.
[00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:03.602]  You cannot make this up.
[00:26:03.602 --> 00:26:16.367]  Now, Kurt Weldon is joining us, former Congressman, former Vice-Head of Homeland Security and the Armed Services Committee, an expert on Russian infiltration with the Clintons and technology transfers.
[00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:19.348]  Now, there's a big article on InfoWars.com that just broke.
[00:26:19.348 --> 00:26:20.729]  Dr. Jerome Corsi's with him right now.
[00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:24.531]  The congressman has to go in a minute to go to a U.N.
[00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:27.532]  meeting, I was told, but I'm glad we're doing this today now.
[00:26:27.532 --> 00:26:31.774]  Russian bank docs show how Putin laundered money to Hillary in Podesta.
[00:26:31.774 --> 00:26:32.995]  Now we know why Clinton and co.
[00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:35.816]  were so desperate to frame Trump with ties to Putin.
[00:26:35.816 --> 00:26:38.758]  So it's good to have the former congressman on with us.
[00:26:38.758 --> 00:26:43.640]  I know he's going to be the source of some articles in the next few days concurring with this and the background.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.762]  So thank you, Dr. Corsi, and former congressman, thank you.
[00:26:47.896 --> 00:27:07.761]  We're delighted to be with you, and I think it's really important to know that Congressman Weldon did a lot of the groundbreaking research in the 90s, showing the technology transfer, the payments that the Clintons got for transferring technology to China.
[00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:15.883]  And he is very familiar with the subject of this article, Becklessburg, and how the Russians operate, and here's Congressman Weldon to talk about it.
[00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:20.264]  Well, thank you, and it's an honor to be with you and be on your show.
[00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:20.984]  Thank you.
[00:27:20.984 --> 00:27:25.786]  Just to give you a few moments of history that I'm sure you're aware of.
[00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:30.207]  It's amazing that we talk about Russian influence in the presidential election.
[00:27:30.207 --> 00:27:35.449]  It was Bill Clinton's advisors who were sent to Moscow in 95 and 96.
[00:27:35.449 --> 00:27:38.530]  They actually stayed in the presidential hotel in Moscow.
[00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.491]  And they ran Yeltsin's re-election campaign.
[00:27:42.491 --> 00:27:45.093]  So the Russians were aware that U.S.
[00:27:45.093 --> 00:27:54.697]  strategic advisors were actually running the presidential campaign of a president whose popularity had fallen down to 10% and had a known drinking problem.
[00:27:55.157 --> 00:28:00.383]  So they knew that we basically reelected the guy that we wanted to be the president in the form of Clinton.
[00:28:00.383 --> 00:28:01.464]  That was Yeltsin.
[00:28:01.464 --> 00:28:07.931]  Second, I was on the Cox Commission that investigated the theft of our technology by China.
[00:28:07.931 --> 00:28:10.834]  And I also documented and have the charts to back it up.
[00:28:11.414 --> 00:28:18.524]  The People's Liberation Army funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the Clinton-Gore campaign.
[00:28:18.524 --> 00:28:28.176]  You remember the famous time when Al Gore was at a Buddhist temple and there was a fundraiser and he claimed he was in the bathroom when they were collecting money for the Clinton-Gore campaign?
[00:28:28.797 --> 00:28:29.057]  Yes.
[00:28:29.057 --> 00:28:34.981]  And I would remind people that it was two of the largest fundraising operatives in the U.S.
[00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:42.927]  at that time, Riady and Wong, got access to the Clinton White House 49 and 17 times in one year.
[00:28:42.927 --> 00:28:43.788]  Neither was a U.S.
[00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:49.272]  citizen and they were the prime fundraisers for the Clinton, Gore, and Democratic campaign committees.
[00:28:49.992 --> 00:28:56.116]  And finally, I would add that one needs to look at the CEO of LaRouche Corporation, Bernie Schwartz.
[00:28:56.116 --> 00:29:12.245]  When LaRouche Corporation was caught transferring very sensitive technology to China, and Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, arranged and got Bill Clinton to sign a retroactive presidential waiver, which means the technology had already been transferred.
[00:29:12.245 --> 00:29:16.488]  Technology that our commission voted 9-0 caused serious harm to us.
[00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:30.276]  Bernie Swartz was the beneficiary of that retroactive presidential waiver, so he couldn't be indicted, and that was the same year he became one of the largest... Former Congressman Weldon, former heads of these committees, they've got to go in about 6-7 minutes, we're going to break shortly.
[00:29:30.276 --> 00:29:37.621]  I'm going to come right back so we can finish up and talk about how this fits in today with the new information that the Clintons have been on the Russian and Chinese payroll.
[00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:39.362]  I mean, I was on there, then I remember it was all the news.
[00:29:39.662 --> 00:29:40.502]  Your committee covered it.
[00:29:40.502 --> 00:29:41.563]  It was documented.
[00:29:41.563 --> 00:29:44.323]  So it's just crazy these so-called ties to Trump.
[00:29:44.323 --> 00:29:47.704]  So I'd like to get your take on that and have you back up for a full 30 minutes soon.
[00:29:47.704 --> 00:29:48.505]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.505 --> 00:29:50.305]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:51.705]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:54.226]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:56.907]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:09.848]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[00:30:09.848 --> 00:30:18.431]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:23.272]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:40.901]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia and the deep states declared war on President Trump, condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity, one has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:53.188]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities and even shoot downs of Russian jets if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[00:30:53.628 --> 00:30:58.595]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:01.118]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:01.118 --> 00:31:03.021]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:05.024]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:05.024 --> 00:31:06.425]  It's the air we're breathing.
[00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:07.827]  Especially for our children.
[00:31:07.827 --> 00:31:09.810]  The artificial particulates.
[00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.511]  The chemicals.
[00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:13.973]  This is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:23.179]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:23.179 --> 00:31:30.705]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:38.750]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.691]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:44.838]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.838 --> 00:31:48.419]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:55.121]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:59.222]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.581]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:09.464]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:32:09.464 --> 00:32:12.025]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:17.828]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:32:17.828 --> 00:32:23.531]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:26.935]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:26.935 --> 00:32:32.501]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:39.529]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:44.095]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:47.639]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:32:47.639 --> 00:32:49.742]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:49.742 --> 00:32:55.469]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:32:55.469 --> 00:32:57.892]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:57.892 --> 00:32:59.575]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:33:06.343 --> 00:33:15.989]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:33:15.989 --> 00:33:23.174]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.408 --> 00:33:26.769]  All right, I've been on air 21 years.
[00:33:26.769 --> 00:33:28.050]  We've only got a few minutes left with him.
[00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.471]  I want to get him back in the near future.
[00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:34.133]  Former Congressman Kurt Weldon, who was the vice head of the Homeland Security Committee and Armed Services Committee.
[00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:38.396]  I remember the hearings when they just exposed the Communist Chinese, the Russians.
[00:33:38.396 --> 00:33:41.518]  The Clintons all got waivers, though, from themselves to do it.
[00:33:41.518 --> 00:33:48.142]  But then after they're at the State Department continuing, and even the New York Times admits $30-something million for all this uranium concessions.
[00:33:48.142 --> 00:33:51.984]  Now we've got new documents about money going to Podesta and Hillary for more.
[00:33:52.324 --> 00:34:01.953]  Technology transfers under Obama, and then they've got the nerve to point the finger and say the former National Security Advisor talked to the Russians about sanctions?
[00:34:01.953 --> 00:34:02.694]  Okay.
[00:34:02.694 --> 00:34:03.855]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:34:03.855 --> 00:34:08.199]  So, as an expert on this, former Congressman Weldon, just in three or four minutes, I know you got to go.
[00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.940]  Your crew's trying to drag you out.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.921]  What's the nutshell?
[00:34:10.921 --> 00:34:12.222]  What's the takeaway from this?
[00:34:12.222 --> 00:34:13.944]  And where is all this going?
[00:34:15.168 --> 00:34:24.694]  Well, Dr. Corsi has shown me some documents here that are startling, involving what look to be illegal payments to the Clintons.
[00:34:24.694 --> 00:34:30.977]  I'm going to talk to my associates in Russia, who work with Russia, and see what else I can find out.
[00:34:30.977 --> 00:34:39.102]  I can tell you this hatchet job is taking place against General Flynn, who's an outstanding American, and our President is wrong.
[00:34:39.722 --> 00:34:42.145]  I've remained silent for 10 years.
[00:34:42.145 --> 00:34:51.794]  I have 480 cases of files, I've done 100 hours of an oral history, and I'm going to start to come out now with irrefutable facts about what I saw occur.
[00:34:51.794 --> 00:35:00.061]  What I saw with the Clintons, in lining the pockets of themselves and their friends, while they left our foreign policy basically hanging in the air.
[00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:01.423]  When they went and murdered Qaddafi,
[00:35:01.863 --> 00:35:05.166]  Causing much of the problem we have with immigrants around the world.
[00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:08.448]  When we played games in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:35:08.448 --> 00:35:19.276]  The true story of the 9-11, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am dedicated to the true story that protected and unfortunately lost 343 firefighters in New York.
[00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:19.797]  Sure, the 28 pages.
[00:35:22.959 --> 00:35:28.061]  All of which you're talking about and all of which needs to be brought forth to the American people.
[00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:39.084]  If the Clintons are going to try to misinform and malign the integrity of our new president and people like you trying to get out the truth, then it's time for America to step up to the plate.
[00:35:39.084 --> 00:35:40.245]  I've never met Donald Trump.
[00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:44.746]  I voted for him, and I wrote op-eds for him in the primary and the general.
[00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:47.327]  But I'm not going to sit back any longer.
[00:35:47.327 --> 00:35:50.068]  Members of Congress know the facts that I have.
[00:35:50.068 --> 00:35:57.930]  They know that I've been trying to restart a trilateral dialogue with the Duma and the Federation Council, the Rada in Ukraine, and the U.S.
[00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:58.610]  Congress.
[00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:04.672]  But I'm not going to sit back and let these morons try to rewrite history when I saw what happened.
[00:36:04.672 --> 00:36:08.753]  I was on the Cox Commission when we voted 9-0 that our security was harmed.
[00:36:09.053 --> 00:36:16.896]  I have the charts that I'll make available to your show to show the PLA money going to front companies that benefited the Clinton-Gore campaign.
[00:36:16.896 --> 00:36:29.401]  I'll show you the charts with the Chinese nationals who were admitted to the White House 17 and 49 times in the same election year that Clinton was running for re-election while they're raising money for the Clinton-Gore campaign.
[00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:36.184]  You can check online and find the retroactive waiver that was given to Bernie Schwartz, the CEO of LaRouche Corporation.
[00:36:36.184 --> 00:36:45.608]  Sure, what you're saying is, bottom line, you were heading up these committees, you saw it all, you know it really happened, and then they're claiming everything that they've done, Trump's done, so you're going to break your silence.
[00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:55.772]  Obviously, you've had high level, the highest level security clearances to know all this, and now you're saying you and others, not to put words in your mouth, are getting ready, if they want to play games, to bring the truth out.
[00:36:56.479 --> 00:36:58.220]  We're not going to play games.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.721]  I've been sitting back for 10 years, and the Clintons know this.
[00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:04.122]  I was his number one target in 2006.
[00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:07.623]  I've got 480 cases of files.
[00:37:07.623 --> 00:37:10.164]  I've got 100 hours of world history.
[00:37:10.164 --> 00:37:16.826]  I've got 40 hours of other tapes done by former officials, former agency people, former DOD people.
[00:37:16.826 --> 00:37:20.248]  And if they want to play hardball, then it's time to play hardball.
[00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:22.609]  They screwed with my family 10 years ago.
[00:37:24.089 --> 00:37:27.911]  Unlike anything that Hillary Clinton experienced, my family experienced.
[00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:30.893]  It's time now that I'm going to say, it's over.
[00:37:30.893 --> 00:37:32.634]  Clintons, it's time you move on.
[00:37:32.634 --> 00:37:36.216]  And if you don't want to do it voluntarily, then I'm going to be your worst nightmare.
[00:37:37.438 --> 00:37:51.864]  And the key here, Alex, is I think we've got the connections between what was going on in the 90s with the Clintons and the documents we're getting today, these Russian bank documents, which are fully validated in the Russian newspapers and also in U.S.
[00:37:51.864 --> 00:37:52.924]  news reports.
[00:37:52.924 --> 00:37:55.005]  Well, I understand, Dr. Corzi.
[00:37:55.005 --> 00:38:00.007]  Are you going with the former vice chair, or are you going to stay and talk more?
[00:38:00.007 --> 00:38:00.707]  Because I know he's got to go.
[00:38:01.383 --> 00:38:02.364]  I'll stay and talk more.
[00:38:02.364 --> 00:38:02.724]  I'm here.
[00:38:02.724 --> 00:38:04.345]  Okay, well take a minute to say bye.
[00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:06.966]  Sir, Congressman, I know you went through a lot.
[00:38:06.966 --> 00:38:08.007]  Thank you for everything.
[00:38:08.007 --> 00:38:09.228]  Just 60 seconds, final comment.
[00:38:10.011 --> 00:38:10.451]  Thank you.
[00:38:10.451 --> 00:38:11.292]  You've got to find the comment.
[00:38:11.292 --> 00:38:12.192]  Okay, I appreciate it.
[00:38:12.192 --> 00:38:16.915]  Let me say, Alex, during my 20 years in Congress, everything I did was bipartisan.
[00:38:16.915 --> 00:38:20.017]  Some of my best friends in Congress were, and still are, Democrats.
[00:38:20.017 --> 00:38:21.098]  So you're known for that?
[00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:22.379]  Trips overseas.
[00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:25.181]  This is not about Republican versus Democrat.
[00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:34.427]  This is about America being taken back from the thieves who became wealthy on the backs of the taxpayers of this country and on the backs of innocent people around the world.
[00:38:34.427 --> 00:38:35.868]  That's the story that's got to be told.
[00:38:36.488 --> 00:38:36.828]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:36.828 --> 00:38:38.249]  Well, please, let's get you on it.
[00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.890]  I'll send a crew up there with the press conference.
[00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.953]  I know this is big to have you, one of the former heads of these committees, with this information.
[00:38:43.953 --> 00:38:45.094]  This is very important.
[00:38:45.094 --> 00:38:45.434]  Thank you, sir.
[00:38:47.202 --> 00:38:50.043]  Dr. Corsi, I'm going to come back to you here in just one moment.
[00:38:50.043 --> 00:38:53.764]  So I'll give you a second to say bye to the Congressman.
[00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:57.305]  These are the type of conversations I'm having off air, okay?
[00:38:57.305 --> 00:39:01.386]  And then they were going to come on the next few days, but I guess they decided to do it today, so they just called in.
[00:39:01.386 --> 00:39:04.567]  Obviously a lot more.
[00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:08.108]  The country is in desperate crisis, okay?
[00:39:08.108 --> 00:39:09.648]  And they're really threatening a lot of people.
[00:39:09.648 --> 00:39:11.229]  You heard the Congressman, former Congressman.
[00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:11.977]  But
[00:39:31.308 --> 00:39:33.429]  Thousands of conservative leaders was the admitted plan.
[00:39:33.429 --> 00:39:37.491]  You see them in the news saying, arrest us and kill us, and ban the president talking about the media.
[00:39:37.491 --> 00:39:41.734]  I mean, that's on CNN and Fox News, for heaven's sakes, with straight faces.
[00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:43.735]  They were already planning a total takeover.
[00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:50.218]  You heard Drudge, who met with the Supreme Court Justice a year and a half ago, telling you, word for word, they're not going to let you have a news site.
[00:39:50.218 --> 00:39:51.499]  They're going to ban it.
[00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:52.479]  And that just happened to us.
[00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:53.480]  We just lost $3.3 million today.
[00:39:56.172 --> 00:39:58.414]  That's what we made last year on AdRoll.
[00:39:58.414 --> 00:39:59.175]  Profit.
[00:39:59.175 --> 00:40:00.656]  To help fund this operation.
[00:40:00.656 --> 00:40:01.897]  Profit from that program.
[00:40:01.897 --> 00:40:04.620]  Not profit here.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:10.065]  I told Dr. Corsi months ago, our budget is about three to four million dollars to expand and fight.
[00:40:10.065 --> 00:40:11.186]  He knows the internal baseball.
[00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:11.647]  They knew that.
[00:40:11.647 --> 00:40:14.329]  They just blew away our extra money for 2017.
[00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:15.470]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.111]  We'll get it.
[00:40:16.111 --> 00:40:16.972]  The listeners understand.
[00:40:16.972 --> 00:40:19.854]  But listen to me.
[00:40:19.854 --> 00:40:21.136]  Everybody that serves this system
[00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:26.176]  You're starting a real civil war with patriots who will never back down.
[00:40:26.176 --> 00:40:27.957]  I will never back down.
[00:40:27.957 --> 00:40:29.299]  You think I care?
[00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:31.161]  You just blew away three million dollars?
[00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:32.202]  That's just fuel.
[00:40:32.202 --> 00:40:33.844]  I'm gonna get that fuel one way or another.
[00:40:35.323 --> 00:40:52.262]  And it's the fact that you've pushed so hard is the reason people like Kurt Weldon, who knows all the secrets, folks, highest level, you know, head of the committee, vice chair of Homeland Security, vice chair of Armed Services Committee, that he knows everything!
[00:40:55.023 --> 00:40:56.804]  About the Clintons and the Chinese.
[00:40:56.804 --> 00:40:57.464]  That's the big one.
[00:40:57.464 --> 00:41:04.766]  The Russians are, and it's not anti-Russian to expose this, but if they want to sit there, of course Russia infiltrated our government because we had traitors in it.
[00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:09.027]  That's, Russia did its job!
[00:41:09.027 --> 00:41:12.948]  The point is they respect Trump because they know the globalists can't bind.
[00:41:12.948 --> 00:41:15.009]  You know by, they're attacking his family.
[00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:19.050]  He is the most beautifully pig-headed person I've ever seen.
[00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.070]  And so here's the bottom line.
[00:41:21.715 --> 00:41:23.256]  Dr. Corsi's on fire.
[00:41:23.256 --> 00:41:25.516]  He's had three number one New York Times best-selling lists.
[00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:29.038]  He worked at the highest levels with the State Department and the banking and worked with Trump.
[00:41:29.038 --> 00:41:32.559]  Why is he, at his age, fighting so hard seven days a week?
[00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:43.223]  I get text messages from him at midnight because he realizes, folks, we're in crisis and we're starting to get a little bit of the initiative back, but we're still not winning.
[00:41:43.223 --> 00:41:49.025]  And listen, spread the articles, spread the videos, spread the links, spread them like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:41:50.834 --> 00:41:56.459]  Buy our products directly from m4warstore.com because that's all the money.
[00:41:56.459 --> 00:42:00.823]  If you look, basically, because I have a bunch of different things that help bring in money.
[00:42:00.823 --> 00:42:04.006]  And that is right at the money.
[00:42:04.006 --> 00:42:06.369]  We have a little bit more that was in our budget for this year.
[00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:08.070]  That was the money.
[00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.812]  I told you I'm not going to even take a profit this year because my children's future is everything.
[00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:13.714]  It's not that money's bad.
[00:42:13.714 --> 00:42:16.135]  The point is, is that all I want is to win.
[00:42:16.135 --> 00:42:23.941]  And so, I started expanding our operation ten years ago when they tried to infiltrate us and shut us down when I had like seven or eight employees.
[00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.462]  And I said, how dare you try to shut me down.
[00:42:25.462 --> 00:42:26.803]  I'm going to go to the next level.
[00:42:26.803 --> 00:42:27.684]  We did it.
[00:42:27.684 --> 00:42:29.145]  And now I pledge before God
[00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:49.855]  And his son, Christ, my Lord and Savior, that I am going to turn every bit of my will completely over to this, and I pray for God's discernment and to lead God and direct me, and I'm going to ask the listeners to pray with us and to flood us with capital so I'm not penny-pinching with Dr. Corsi hours the last week on how to get a little office in D.C.
[00:42:49.855 --> 00:42:51.317]  and worrying about the bills.
[00:42:51.317 --> 00:42:52.978]  We shouldn't be worrying about the bills.
[00:42:52.978 --> 00:42:55.240]  There should be just tsunamis of money coming in here.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.121]  And quite frankly, for media, it is tsunamis.
[00:42:57.782 --> 00:43:00.748]  But for what we need to do, it's not enough, okay?
[00:43:00.748 --> 00:43:02.752]  I need money to go after these people.
[00:43:03.973 --> 00:43:07.714]  And they are, people ask, the New York Times is like, we want your affiliate list.
[00:43:07.714 --> 00:43:09.314]  We notice there's stations you don't list.
[00:43:09.314 --> 00:43:14.156]  And I go, yeah, because I tell the network, don't list our affiliates, because all sorts of stuff goes on.
[00:43:14.156 --> 00:43:14.756]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:43:14.756 --> 00:43:16.456]  Not just boycotting, okay?
[00:43:16.456 --> 00:43:18.517]  I mean, straight up mafia racketeering crap.
[00:43:18.517 --> 00:43:19.577]  And our stations know it.
[00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:21.517]  A lot of our stations have us on a little bit and get threatened.
[00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:23.718]  They go, especially in the South, they go, go to hell.
[00:43:23.718 --> 00:43:25.238]  He's on primetime now.
[00:43:25.238 --> 00:43:28.659]  So it backfires a lot too, when you threaten station owners' families.
[00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:31.120]  I mean, let's just get it out in the open, what we're dealing with here.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.062]  And I'll tell all the bullies and all the mafia scum this.
[00:43:34.062 --> 00:43:35.022]  You want to fight?
[00:43:35.022 --> 00:43:37.324]  You better believe you got one, okay?
[00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:39.005]  So AdRoll blocks us off.
[00:43:39.005 --> 00:43:40.686]  We've got other systems as well.
[00:43:40.686 --> 00:43:42.748]  And they say, you are fake news.
[00:43:42.748 --> 00:43:45.089]  You are not allowed to have free speech.
[00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:45.830]  It says right here.
[00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:53.293]  In the email this morning, we were projected to be over 5 million this year with this program, 3.3 last year after expenses.
[00:43:53.293 --> 00:43:58.696]  All content on your website should be relevant, they decide, accurate, informative, and up-to-date.
[00:43:58.696 --> 00:44:00.717]  Any claims should be easily verifiable.
[00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:04.359]  We are not able to promote websites that intentionally misrepresent.
[00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:08.161]  No judge, no jury, they just claim and just say, I'm worthless, I'm bad.
[00:44:08.161 --> 00:44:13.404]  Their businesses are using any tactic to falsely enhance reputation or misrepresent actual offerings.
[00:44:13.404 --> 00:44:13.584]  Really.
[00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:18.487]  I mean, we have on third-party sites 4.9 reviews, tens of thousands of them.
[00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:20.849]  I mean, we're just loved everywhere the president calls me.
[00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:21.830]  I talk to the president.
[00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.451]  I got an award-winning journalist on.
[00:44:23.451 --> 00:44:26.914]  I just had a former head of the Homeland Security Committee on.
[00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:28.455]  What the hell are you talking about?
[00:44:28.455 --> 00:44:29.916]  We're changing the world.
[00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:31.537]  We just put the president in.
[00:44:31.537 --> 00:44:34.319]  You, the listeners and viewers, did.
[00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:39.743]  And I know for a fact the other big news sites aren't contracting in viewership and readership.
[00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:40.724]  I'm not going to say their names.
[00:44:40.724 --> 00:44:41.745]  I love them.
[00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.586]  They're all in trouble.
[00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:44.977]  Except for us and one other.
[00:44:44.977 --> 00:44:47.640]  And I'm in talks with them to basically merge.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.643]  Because we've gotta get big or be destroyed here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:54.405]  And they are cutting the money out.
[00:44:54.405 --> 00:44:58.069]  And they won't even let Breitbart have an app, folks, after they paid for it years later.
[00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:59.970]  The same stuff's happening to us.
[00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.352]  So, we just basically, imagine we're a ship.
[00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:06.796]  We just got hit by, you know, a huge 50mm shell, okay?
[00:45:06.796 --> 00:45:08.998]  So just understand, it's a big fire on the deck.
[00:45:08.998 --> 00:45:10.539]  We're gonna make it through this and get stronger.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.223]  But I don't want to spend all my time crawling around just trying to raise capital.
[00:45:15.223 --> 00:45:17.124]  We need everybody to get products they need.
[00:45:17.124 --> 00:45:19.926]  There's thousands of great items at infowarestore.com.
[00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:20.947]  Go there.
[00:45:20.947 --> 00:45:21.948]  Sign up for vitamins.
[00:45:21.948 --> 00:45:22.788]  Sign up for minerals.
[00:45:22.788 --> 00:45:23.749]  Sign up for supplements.
[00:45:23.749 --> 00:45:25.851]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:27.872]  And there may come a time when they shut all that down.
[00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:29.954]  I'm going to be up here every day saying, you want to hear this show?
[00:45:29.954 --> 00:45:30.834]  Send me a donation.
[00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:33.536]  Because that's what this comes down to.
[00:45:33.536 --> 00:45:35.077]  That's where this country is.
[00:45:35.077 --> 00:45:35.978]  And that's where this world is.
[00:45:35.978 --> 00:45:37.419]  I'm going back to Dr. Corsi here in a minute.
[00:45:37.419 --> 00:45:38.300]  But I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:45:39.707 --> 00:45:47.172]  Help defend InfoWars and get our Silver Bullet colloidal silver that now just came back in stock after three months of being sold out.
[00:45:47.172 --> 00:45:49.554]  We're going to offer it 33% off on top of it.
[00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:50.775]  Topical, internal.
[00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:51.675]  Check with your physician.
[00:45:51.675 --> 00:45:52.316]  It's amazing.
[00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:55.838]  Me personally, I've had infections I couldn't get rid of that this did.
[00:45:55.838 --> 00:45:59.361]  We're going to wait until tomorrow to launch the Silver Bullet back in stock.
[00:45:59.361 --> 00:46:00.682]  Special InfoWars.com.
[00:46:00.682 --> 00:46:01.783]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:01.783 --> 00:46:04.444]  But right now we need as much support as possible.
[00:46:04.444 --> 00:46:08.928]  InfoWars has been banned from major advertising platform for helping Donald J. Trump get elected.
[00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:12.609]  Cutting off one of our primary means of funding the operation.
[00:46:12.609 --> 00:46:19.832]  Right now, InfoWarsLive.com helps support InfoWars and gets Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver 33% off stock price for a very limited time.
[00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:31.016]  Our proprietary Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver formula is super concentrated into three times the dose of many colloidal silver products and comes from the highest quality certified labs.
[00:46:31.874 --> 00:46:37.939]  Whether it's economic meltdown or any other collapse, colloidal silver is something I have on hand for myself and my family.
[00:46:37.939 --> 00:46:40.821]  Get colloidal silver at 33% off Silver Bullet.
[00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:46.745]  Off the stock price at Infowarslife.com today and help defend Infowars from corporate tyranny.
[00:46:46.745 --> 00:46:47.846]  One more and censorship.
[00:46:47.846 --> 00:46:49.367]  One more thing I want to tell you about.
[00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:53.551]  The famous artist, who I should probably have on as a guest sometime.
[00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:55.332]  We need to pull this up.
[00:47:00.669 --> 00:47:06.176]  He put out only 2,000 of these and they sold out so quick, I said, can we just put out one more edition?
[00:47:06.176 --> 00:47:11.603]  And he said, well, you know, we really can't because that was that one design lithograph.
[00:47:11.603 --> 00:47:14.586]  And I said, well, what about a different print color, a different, you know, packaging?
[00:47:15.598 --> 00:47:18.400]  And then he said, okay, but that's it.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:28.748]  2,000 of the chocolate sepia-colored dark ink, or 2,500 of those, and then 700 of the famous, iconic Ronald Reagan.
[00:47:28.748 --> 00:47:29.508]  And then that's it.
[00:47:29.508 --> 00:47:32.250]  We will never again sell any variant.
[00:47:33.411 --> 00:47:33.751]  Of these.
[00:47:33.751 --> 00:47:35.792]  I had no idea how popular these would be.
[00:47:35.792 --> 00:47:40.813]  Now that's the old white paper print that's excellent as well that I have hanging in the hallway here of Trump and Reagan.
[00:47:40.813 --> 00:47:42.013]  We weren't selling the Reagan one.
[00:47:42.013 --> 00:47:44.654]  So that's that original, the Reagan on the classic.
[00:47:44.654 --> 00:47:48.314]  This is the chocolate dark ink for the Trump.
[00:47:48.314 --> 00:47:50.175]  And when it's gone, it's gone.
[00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:55.396]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com
[00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:09.453]  Gary Gervais, I hope I pronounced his name right, I've met him, he's the famous artist that does stuff officially for the Republican Party.
[00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:25.137]  Now again, I'm a little bit, not hysterical today, we've known all this is coming, they're all announcing censorship, they're all announcing control, but just to even have the next year budgeted, and to know the money we made from this past year is our extra profit or budget for the next year to expand in the face of the globalists.
[00:48:25.137 --> 00:48:26.237]  I'm going to Dr. Corsi right now.
[00:48:27.402 --> 00:48:29.123]  So this is an incredible time.
[00:48:29.123 --> 00:48:33.544]  Everybody should buy Roger Stone's book, The Making of the President 2016, that we sell.
[00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:34.584]  We need your support.
[00:48:34.584 --> 00:48:36.625]  We're not going to be here if it isn't for you.
[00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:37.545]  Yeah, Trump's in.
[00:48:37.545 --> 00:48:38.665]  He's surrounded.
[00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:49.188]  We're beginning to have some big effects, but they're trying to say he's basically a Russian agent and is an evil person and needs to be removed, needs to be overthrown, needs to have his speech taken.
[00:48:49.188 --> 00:48:53.449]  So we have to get even more aggressive in the face of this censorship.
[00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:54.810]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:48:55.814 --> 00:49:00.879]  You want to call and ask about any of our specials, any of our products, you want to order over the phone, that's welcome as well.
[00:49:00.879 --> 00:49:01.139]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:01.139 --> 00:49:06.323]  You get 10% off when you sign up for auto ship on things.
[00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:08.265]  Free shipping on orders, $50 or more.
[00:49:08.265 --> 00:49:11.628]  I don't normally sit here and belabor funding us, but boom!
[00:49:11.628 --> 00:49:13.089]  I advertise the limited amount.
[00:49:13.089 --> 00:49:14.591]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:16.673]  I advertise the limited amount I need to.
[00:49:17.642 --> 00:49:19.964]  To be able to fund their operation and go into the future.
[00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:36.798]  We're good to go.
[00:49:53.447 --> 00:49:53.687]  I don't
[00:50:13.238 --> 00:50:15.379]  It wasn't on screen, but he was pissed, like, bowed up.
[00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.839]  He was ready for war.
[00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:21.481]  I love seeing that type of body language now by these patriots that have held their tongue.
[00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:24.281]  If I was Hillary Clinton, the globalist, I'd be crapping my pants right now.
[00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:25.242]  But what do you make of that?
[00:50:25.242 --> 00:50:33.704]  And then the massive, unprecedented ad roll tied to Google, banning us having ads on the Internet of just, you know, milquetoast stuff.
[00:50:33.704 --> 00:50:35.225]  Water filters, you name it.
[00:50:35.225 --> 00:50:36.665]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:50:36.665 --> 00:50:37.625]  Oh, including the book.
[00:50:37.625 --> 00:50:38.866]  We were advertising Roger's book.
[00:50:38.866 --> 00:50:40.306]  That might have been why we were banned.
[00:50:40.306 --> 00:50:41.247]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:42.467]  Banned from the Internet.
[00:50:42.967 --> 00:50:47.711]  Over these platforms from advertising, exactly what the New York Times and others are calling for.
[00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.773]  If that's not racketeering, I don't know what is.
[00:50:49.773 --> 00:50:50.254]  Dr. Corsi.
[00:50:51.018 --> 00:50:55.839]  Well, I mean, first of all, you know, we've been writing about Google going to do this, and now they're doing it.
[00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:58.460]  You wrote about it two weeks ago.
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.480]  I wrote about it two weeks ago.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.581]  I was predicting this was going to happen.
[00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:04.182]  Tony Lyons, Kurt Weldon left here.
[00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:12.424]  When he saw the article today and saw the link with the Russians now funding Hillary and Podesta, he's ready to connect that.
[00:51:12.964 --> 00:51:21.528]  To what he learned in the 90s of the Clintons getting money from China and also funding, selling U.S.
[00:51:21.528 --> 00:51:23.189]  technology.
[00:51:23.189 --> 00:51:25.870]  And Kurt Weldon will go to his contacts in Russia.
[00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:27.431]  This story is going to deepen.
[00:51:27.431 --> 00:51:30.292]  He was leaving here calling for an FBI investigation.
[00:51:30.292 --> 00:51:31.052]  Well, you heard him.
[00:51:31.052 --> 00:51:34.814]  He talks to the highest levels of the Russian Federation and to the Duma.
[00:51:34.814 --> 00:51:36.635]  And he said, that's it, I'm going public.
[00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:39.036]  Because absolutely, the answer for Russia
[00:51:39.876 --> 00:51:44.099]  To not be shut up and have a war with the globalists is to go ahead and release the info on Hillary.
[00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:45.620]  Well, I've worked with Tony Lyons.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.021]  Well, Tony, say hello here.
[00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:47.821]  He's a warrior.
[00:51:47.821 --> 00:51:49.162]  He's published two of my books.
[00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:54.725]  He's now done Roger Stone's book, Making of the President, and you're selling this book.
[00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:55.386]  It's critical.
[00:51:55.386 --> 00:52:04.171]  It is the story of why Donald Trump won, and it exposes Hillary and the lies and the fact that this fake news is what the Democrats are doing.
[00:52:04.171 --> 00:52:04.932]  Tony, you want to say hello?
[00:52:05.782 --> 00:52:11.323]  Yes, this is Tony Lyons from Skyhorse Publishing and this is Roger Stone's new book.
[00:52:11.323 --> 00:52:15.744]  It's an incredible true story of how Trump actually got to be president.
[00:52:15.744 --> 00:52:18.325]  Not the story that the mainstream media wants you to read.
[00:52:18.325 --> 00:52:21.545]  Absolutely, and our audience is totally familiar that he's been banned all over TV.
[00:52:21.545 --> 00:52:25.486]  They've been trying to block the book from the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:52:25.486 --> 00:52:32.888]  What do you make of the fact that they just banned InfoWars from basically third-party advertising on the internet and said, because you're fake?
[00:52:34.815 --> 00:52:42.058]  I think that the American public needs to hear all kinds of different stories, all kinds of different points of view.
[00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:54.224]  And what's really scary, what really makes you think of 1984 is when alternative views get stifled, so that there's only one message, one message that millions and millions of people need to hear.
[00:52:54.224 --> 00:52:54.884]  I want to say this.
[00:52:54.884 --> 00:52:55.665]  Look, look, look.
[00:52:55.665 --> 00:53:03.831]  When Roger got censored, when they've done stuff to Drudge, when Breitbart's been censored, when they all get censored, I come out and say it's wrong.
[00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:04.932]  We run the stories.
[00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:06.273]  We call for support.
[00:53:06.273 --> 00:53:11.136]  So when they were trying to kick Limbaugh off the air six years ago, I went and advertised on a show.
[00:53:11.136 --> 00:53:13.978]  I need, and I need Paul Watson to get on the phone.
[00:53:13.978 --> 00:53:14.999]  I've been trying to get a hold of him for hours.
[00:53:14.999 --> 00:53:17.761]  I love Paul, but sometimes he's away from the phone.
[00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:23.686]  We need a big article on this as this breaks, because this is the beginning of the electronic ghettos that Drudge warned about.
[00:53:24.491 --> 00:53:31.514]  And it's super dangerous, and it's happening, and if we don't make a big deal about it, they'll just set the precedent, because the massive censorship is now rolling out.
[00:53:31.514 --> 00:53:33.255]  Go ahead.
[00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:33.635]  I agree 100%.
[00:53:33.635 --> 00:53:38.377]  I mean, I think that censorship is the worst possible result here.
[00:53:38.377 --> 00:53:42.199]  That everybody needs to hear different sides of the story.
[00:53:42.199 --> 00:53:44.020]  You guys are playing a great role.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:51.403]  You're telling stories that aren't covered in other places, and it's an earth-shattering problem that needs to be resolved.
[00:53:52.284 --> 00:53:53.205]  And we've got publishers.
[00:53:53.205 --> 00:54:00.110]  I mean, I want to say for Tony Lyons and publishing Roger's book, this is a story the mainstream media does not want.
[00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.751]  He had to stick his neck out.
[00:54:01.751 --> 00:54:02.792]  I mean, that's the point.
[00:54:02.792 --> 00:54:04.413]  These people are bullies.
[00:54:04.413 --> 00:54:10.117]  And no matter whether you're conservative or liberal or whatever, I know Skyhorse publishes a lot of liberal stuff, but great work.
[00:54:10.117 --> 00:54:12.739]  The point is, it's about free speech, not about tyranny.
[00:54:12.739 --> 00:54:13.400]  And I really think
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.662]  They've jumped the shark.
[00:54:15.662 --> 00:54:19.649]  I think there's going to be massive backfires and blowback from this Dr. Corsi.
[00:54:19.649 --> 00:54:24.016]  I want you to specifically talk about your employer, you're the head of the Washington Bureau.
[00:54:24.016 --> 00:54:26.340]  How much money did I tell you we had to work with this year coming up?
[00:54:26.954 --> 00:54:33.216]  I mean, you know, you were projecting that we had millions to work with, but now it's down to, you know, who knows what we're going to have to work with.
[00:54:33.216 --> 00:54:34.897]  We're going to make it happen.
[00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:38.538]  The point is, our audience is going to support us because they're right here with us on this mission.
[00:54:38.538 --> 00:54:40.999]  But I mean, I'm telling you, they are coming after everybody.
[00:54:40.999 --> 00:54:47.641]  And folks, if you think you're safe under this, they want to get rid of populist free speech venues that are defending you getting your taxes cut.
[00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:52.129]  That are defending you and your family, having regulations cut, because Trump is in your corner.
[00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:53.731]  Look at all the small business numbers.
[00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:55.935]  The best since the Reagan recovery in 1984, Dr. Corsi.
[00:54:57.981 --> 00:54:59.542]  Well, I'm 100% committed to this.
[00:54:59.542 --> 00:55:01.123]  We're going to make it work.
[00:55:01.123 --> 00:55:03.505]  And we're not going to be blocked.
[00:55:03.505 --> 00:55:07.047]  I'm here with Tony Lyons because he has the courage to publish this book.
[00:55:07.047 --> 00:55:08.869]  It is a great story.
[00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:11.390]  Roger, I think, has really told the inside.
[00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.252]  And this should be the mainstream.
[00:55:14.252 --> 00:55:16.014]  Donald Trump won.
[00:55:16.014 --> 00:55:18.976]  You've got the left fighting a losing battle.
[00:55:18.976 --> 00:55:19.916]  That's the problem.
[00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.337]  And they're getting desperate.
[00:55:21.337 --> 00:55:24.099]  They're trying to take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:25.260]  They're showing themselves.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.141]  They're showing themselves.
[00:55:26.854 --> 00:55:29.175]  They're scared and they're cornered.
[00:55:29.175 --> 00:55:31.275]  And now, you know, we had Kurt Weldon here.
[00:55:31.275 --> 00:55:34.596]  We're talking about publishing what Kurt Weldon's got as information.
[00:55:34.596 --> 00:55:36.256]  They're going to be all over.
[00:55:36.256 --> 00:55:37.557]  I'm going to work with Kurt.
[00:55:37.557 --> 00:55:45.799]  We're going to get out the ties between the Russians right now paying Hillary through this money laundering connection, paying Podesta.
[00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:53.443]  And going back to the 90s when the Clintons were taking money from the Chinese selling technology.
[00:55:53.443 --> 00:55:53.863]  U.S.
[00:55:53.863 --> 00:55:55.864]  technology to the Chinese.
[00:55:55.864 --> 00:56:00.107]  This is a story that needs to be told and nothing's going to stop us, Alex.
[00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:02.288]  We're going to create the Washington Bureau.
[00:56:02.288 --> 00:56:03.269]  It's going to be functioning.
[00:56:03.269 --> 00:56:05.990]  It's going to be a major news entity.
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.591]  It's going to function for a long time.
[00:56:07.671 --> 00:56:10.612]  Well, I'll tell you, I love the way you get, you know, Kurt Weldon and all these other great folks.
[00:56:10.612 --> 00:56:12.073]  You are a one-man wrecking machine.
[00:56:12.073 --> 00:56:16.034]  And I can't wait to get you a camera crew and folks up there at the Bureau as well.
[00:56:16.034 --> 00:56:19.055]  So I got to get that lease signed today.
[00:56:19.055 --> 00:56:23.437]  And again, Tony Lyons and all of you, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:56:23.437 --> 00:56:25.498]  In fact, let's get you on, Mr. Lyons, in the near future.
[00:56:25.498 --> 00:56:25.758]  Thank you.
[00:56:26.294 --> 00:56:27.716]  Can I just say one last thing?
[00:56:27.716 --> 00:56:38.492]  You know, one of the other kinds of stories that I've seen you guys run was, you know, Bobby Kennedy from the left talking about vaccine safety in his book, Thymerosol, that we published.
[00:56:38.492 --> 00:56:39.854]  And that's the same kind of thing.
[00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:40.796]  That's what we do!
[00:56:40.796 --> 00:56:42.058]  I mean, I have all these authors on.
[00:56:42.438 --> 00:56:42.838]  Great, thanks a lot.
[00:57:05.492 --> 00:57:31.103]  That Kurt Weldon was powerful stuff and see I was having to talk to him this morning and then sit on all this when the former vice chair of the Homeland Security Committee and the head of Homeland Security when he was in there for you know a decade is telling you they're Russian and Chinese agents I'm sick of it I'm going public well come on today well I can't do it today I'll come on tomorrow and then they just end up they call up they're on and then you know it's just so real I mean
[00:57:32.165 --> 00:57:34.846]  You can't get more direct than what you just heard.
[00:57:34.846 --> 00:57:41.288]  In fact, you know, this news story about these documents and, you know, money flowing out of the Russians to Podesta and the rest of it.
[00:57:41.288 --> 00:57:42.188]  Okay, that's important.
[00:57:42.188 --> 00:57:54.953]  But what's really big here is that Congressman Weldon is ready to go public and said, I've been quiet for 10 years after my family got threatened.
[00:57:56.817 --> 00:57:58.698]  But now I'm going public, I don't care.
[00:57:58.698 --> 00:58:00.379]  I mean, that's legendary.
[00:58:00.379 --> 00:58:01.680]  That's the opposite of fake news.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:10.866]  That's Pulitzer Prize winning, when the head of the former head of the committee, you know, vice head of the committee, he's like, I'm going public, I'm not going to shut up anymore.
[00:58:10.866 --> 00:58:11.887]  They're agents.
[00:58:11.887 --> 00:58:15.269]  They're Chinese and Russian agents.
[00:58:15.269 --> 00:58:17.310]  And again, that doesn't mean war with Russia.
[00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:19.151]  It means they're the ones that got infiltrated.
[00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:20.472]  That's what governments do.
[00:58:20.472 --> 00:58:21.673]  They were the ones wide open.
[00:58:21.673 --> 00:58:24.555]  Globalism is infiltration of your country by everybody.
[00:58:25.495 --> 00:58:30.200]  It's like hanging your ass out the window like you're a whorehouse in one and everybody just lines up.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.801]  That's what it is.
[00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:33.022]  Support us.
[00:58:33.022 --> 00:58:38.608]  I want to have a big number tomorrow to show on air in the face of AdRoll and Google and just say, take that!

[00:58:46.936 --> 00:58:48.878]  I need the energy to crush the enemy!
[00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:51.661]  Not a group.
[00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.102]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:53.102 --> 00:58:54.422]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:54.422 --> 00:58:55.622]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:55.622 --> 00:59:00.924]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:59:00.924 --> 00:59:14.447]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:14.447 --> 00:59:15.808]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:16.588 --> 00:59:18.248]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:18.248 --> 00:59:20.809]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:22.109]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:23.229]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:24.570]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:29.070]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.211]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:35.412]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:35.412 --> 00:59:36.452]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:36.452 --> 00:59:38.372]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:38.372 --> 00:59:39.392]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:39.392 --> 00:59:42.113]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:42.113 --> 00:59:42.313]  And, uh,
[00:59:42.973 --> 00:59:44.014]  You support the broadcast.
[00:59:44.014 --> 00:59:45.355]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:59:45.355 --> 00:59:47.617]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:53.662]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:59:53.662 --> 00:59:56.284]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:17.343]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:17.343 --> 01:00:22.545]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:25.406]  What country is Mount Rushmore located in?
[01:00:25.406 --> 01:00:25.866]  I don't know.
[01:00:25.866 --> 01:00:27.407]  Are you an American?
[01:00:27.407 --> 01:00:28.927]  Yeah.
[01:00:28.927 --> 01:00:31.248]  Okay, I'm gonna have to revoke your citizenship.
[01:00:31.248 --> 01:00:32.689]  Okay.
[01:00:32.689 --> 01:00:34.309]  Where is Trump Tower located?
[01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:36.130]  I don't know.
[01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:36.810]  You don't know?
[01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.331]  I don't know.
[01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:39.491]  Where's Donald Trump from?
[01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:41.292]  Where does he live?
[01:00:42.162 --> 01:00:43.704]  I don't know where he lives.
[01:00:43.704 --> 01:00:45.786]  Just generally, where does he live?
[01:00:45.786 --> 01:00:46.467]  I have no idea.
[01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:51.532]  If you could tell Donald Trump something about your tampons, what would you say to him?
[01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.838]  They're definitely a necessity.
[01:00:54.838 --> 01:00:58.081]  They're not something that needs to be banned at all.
[01:00:58.081 --> 01:01:07.950]  I don't know for sure, but I don't think he would use an executive order to ban tampons, because one, that just sounds preposterous to me, because they're kind of a necessity.
[01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:10.432]  They're not a luxury at all.
[01:01:10.432 --> 01:01:17.979]  And I can tell you that from many, many years of experience, that there's nothing luxurious about having your period and needing to use a tampon.
[01:01:18.639 --> 01:01:21.622]  You might have seen the Donald Trump kids are big hunters.
[01:01:21.622 --> 01:01:25.845]  They go on these hunting trips just for fun and kill all these poor animals.
[01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:35.073]  So now, just getting people's reactions to Donald Trump's kids now killing the triceratops in Africa on a hunting expedition.
[01:01:36.254 --> 01:01:46.640]  Okay, so honestly my opinion is I think they're just getting away with a lot for the simple fact that they're Donald Trump's children.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:55.965]  Would an ordinary person be able to get away with killing a triceratops or is the Donald Trump's kids just being able to get away with that because they're Donald Trump's kids?
[01:01:56.525 --> 01:02:04.471]  I think they're getting away with it, because they're Donald Trump's kids, and I think anybody else would just get in trouble, and they're honestly, just, I don't know.
[01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.132]  Jail time?
[01:02:05.132 --> 01:02:06.873]  With animal rights activists?
[01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:12.838]  Yeah, they'll pay a fine for it, and they'll serve their time in jail, and... For killing the Triceratops.
[01:02:12.838 --> 01:02:18.462]  I think it's an endangered species in some countries, so it makes it even worse.
[01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:19.223]  Yeah, but I agree.
[01:02:19.223 --> 01:02:20.804]  Alright, thank you very much.
[01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:22.925]  We want to know how many stars are on this flag.
[01:02:22.925 --> 01:02:23.046]  51.
[01:02:23.046 --> 01:02:23.246]  Alright.
[01:02:27.389 --> 01:02:28.909]  What do the stars represent?
[01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:35.451]  They represent... Let's see, is it the... You can't, don't physically count, it's like a quiz.
[01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:38.151]  It's something about the states, right?
[01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:38.611]  Alright.
[01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:39.832]  Something about the states.
[01:02:39.832 --> 01:02:40.732]  Each state?
[01:02:40.732 --> 01:02:41.472]  But there's not 51 of them.
[01:02:41.472 --> 01:02:44.092]  Alright, you guys are gonna make me look stupid.
[01:02:44.092 --> 01:02:45.753]  How many states are there?
[01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:47.333]  What's the last book you read?
[01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:54.435]  Um... Hmm... I don't read books, man.
[01:02:54.435 --> 01:02:55.835]  I'm pretty, I'm pretty stupid.
[01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.792]  Well, thanks for demonstrating that.
[01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:01.153]  It's all over social media.
[01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:12.520]  You probably saw Princess Diana passed away this morning over in London, and we're just getting people's comments on the loss that they're facing.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.500]  Died of a heart attack.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.462]  Wow, that's gnarly.
[01:03:15.462 --> 01:03:19.764]  Princess Diana, gone at the age of 35.
[01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:22.306]  Death is pressing now.
[01:03:22.306 --> 01:03:24.528]  I keep her in my prayers.
[01:03:24.528 --> 01:03:26.589]  What's your favorite memory of Princess Diana?
[01:03:28.068 --> 01:03:33.532]  Um... It was gnarly that she was a princess.
[01:03:33.532 --> 01:03:34.012]  And that's cool.
[01:03:36.578 --> 01:03:45.422]  You probably saw on the news that this morning the hunters did capture what they have called the Loch Ness Monster, Nessie.
[01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:45.762]  Really?
[01:03:45.762 --> 01:03:51.244]  And we're just asking people if they think Nessie should be set free.
[01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:55.126]  Is that really fair to keep her in captivity like this?
[01:03:55.126 --> 01:03:57.187]  No, I think they should just let Nessie free.
[01:03:57.187 --> 01:04:01.028]  I mean, well, supposedly if they find her, that's messed up to keep an animal captured.
[01:04:01.028 --> 01:04:02.669]  You probably didn't check the news.
[01:04:02.669 --> 01:04:03.670]  No, yeah, no.
[01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:11.494]  Occasionally, the marine biologists will find these old animals that have thought to have been extinct.
[01:04:11.494 --> 01:04:17.738]  They did capture the Loch Ness Monster, a 17-foot-long platysaurus.
[01:04:17.738 --> 01:04:22.761]  A lot of people are saying that it's really unfair to keep Nessie in captivity.
[01:04:22.761 --> 01:04:24.802]  Do you think we should let her back into the wild?
[01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.577]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:26.577 --> 01:04:31.280]  I think because it's like, you know, animal rights, like it's the same thing as humans, like let them be free, you know?
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:41.104]  It's like not right, as I said, that to keep, you know, a special being, like a special animal, like keep and like show them off to people.
[01:04:41.104 --> 01:04:48.347]  It's like, no, let the animal be free and let, you know, other people enjoy the view and let, you know, let them be in nature, basically.
[01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:51.529]  So what's your reaction to the discovery and the capture?
[01:04:51.769 --> 01:05:00.994]  I'm actually surprised, because I didn't even know, because I'm not from here, so I never really watch the news, and I'm just surprised that they found Lockheed's monster.
[01:05:00.994 --> 01:05:09.559]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[01:05:09.559 --> 01:05:12.361]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case.
[01:05:12.561 --> 01:05:18.165]  In an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:23.609]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[01:05:23.609 --> 01:05:31.395]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia and the deep states declared war on President Trump.
[01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:37.079]  Condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity.
[01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:40.141]  One has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:53.367]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities and even shoot-downs of Russian jets if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:58.269]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:00.250]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com
[01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:05.153]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:06:05.153 --> 01:06:07.956]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:09.417]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:13.680]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.483]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[01:06:17.483 --> 01:06:19.165]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:06:19.165 --> 01:06:20.746]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[01:06:20.746 --> 01:06:21.146]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:21.146 --> 01:06:23.268]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:06:23.268 --> 01:06:23.908]  At all.
[01:06:23.908 --> 01:06:24.949]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:06:24.949 --> 01:06:27.351]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:28.052]  They lost.
[01:06:28.592 --> 01:06:29.372]  We won.
[01:06:29.372 --> 01:06:31.493]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:06:31.493 --> 01:06:32.834]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:34.535]  We need a thousand Paula beers.
[01:06:34.535 --> 01:06:40.818]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:06:40.818 --> 01:06:43.179]  And beef was for supper.
[01:06:43.179 --> 01:06:43.959]  Revelation.
[01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:45.760]  Dawn of global government.

[01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:10.803]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[01:08:10.803 --> 01:08:14.808]  In a big way, if your calling is media, fine.
[01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:17.211]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[01:08:17.211 --> 01:08:18.773]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:20.233]  Now!
[01:08:20.233 --> 01:08:31.355]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[01:08:31.355 --> 01:08:32.936]  This is ghetto!
[01:08:32.936 --> 01:08:34.656]  This is ghetto, this is corporate.
[01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:37.216]  They're taking your energy.
[01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:40.377]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return.
[01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:40.757]  Nothing!
[01:08:40.757 --> 01:08:42.217]  They're dumbing the language down.
[01:08:42.217 --> 01:08:44.358]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:46.218]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[01:08:46.898 --> 01:08:50.401]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[01:08:50.401 --> 01:08:52.122]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[01:08:52.122 --> 01:08:54.604]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[01:08:54.604 --> 01:08:55.364]  You're out of there.
[01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:58.026]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[01:08:58.026 --> 01:09:05.191]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[01:09:05.191 --> 01:09:06.832]  Time is not forever.
[01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:09.955]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[01:09:10.775 --> 01:09:11.996]  Uh, rise and fall.
[01:09:11.996 --> 01:09:13.077]  There's not that many.
[01:09:13.077 --> 01:09:15.079]  It's a small amount.
[01:09:15.079 --> 01:09:20.763]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[01:09:20.763 --> 01:09:21.203]  No.
[01:09:21.203 --> 01:09:22.164]  No, you can't.
[01:09:22.164 --> 01:09:24.226]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:29.430]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.772]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:34.494]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[01:09:34.494 --> 01:09:35.354]  This is insane.
[01:09:35.354 --> 01:09:38.537]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[01:09:38.897 --> 01:09:41.379]  Now, remember just recently... Getting him lined up with it.
[01:09:41.379 --> 01:09:43.882]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[01:09:43.882 --> 01:09:45.904]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[01:09:45.904 --> 01:09:47.745]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[01:09:47.745 --> 01:09:58.495]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[01:10:01.215 --> 01:10:03.856]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:10:03.856 --> 01:10:10.798]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:10:10.798 --> 01:10:23.662]  It was October 6, 2015 that Matt Drudge, the king of news, came here in an unannounced visit.
[01:10:23.662 --> 01:10:24.762]  A surprise visit.
[01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:25.863]  I didn't know he was coming.
[01:10:25.863 --> 01:10:26.503]  Some of the crew did.
[01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:42.005]  To warn that he'd met with a Supreme Court Justice who said the whole plan is to cut off the advertising, to use copyright to say you can't even have links, to basically shut down everybody's free speech.
[01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:46.910]  And everything he said basically has unfolded except Trump got in and is trying to block it.
[01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:53.595]  But Obama, before he left, signed a bill to begin putting the CIA over media and to begin censorship.
[01:10:53.595 --> 01:10:54.416]  And it happened today.
[01:10:56.767 --> 01:11:16.004]  AdRoll that works with Google, that goes out and third-party places your ads on the internet, after working with them for years, and bring in 3.3 million in profit, and by profit I mean that was what we made in the program to fund our operation, and that was about the amount of money we had to expand this year.
[01:11:16.004 --> 01:11:19.266]  It's interesting.
[01:11:19.266 --> 01:11:22.069]  And they said that basically you cover WikiLeaks news,
[01:11:23.462 --> 01:11:24.522]  That's what this legalese means.
[01:11:24.522 --> 01:11:26.683]  We've already had some lawyers look at it.
[01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:34.626]  And so, remember when Cuomo on CNN said, only CNN or mainstream media can look at this?
[01:11:34.626 --> 01:11:37.007]  You can't read WikiLeaks or you can be arrested.
[01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:40.808]  Total made-up crap.
[01:11:40.808 --> 01:11:46.970]  And now they've come in with, again, Breitbart and taken their free apps that they paid four years ago that they put on the Apple Store.
[01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.911]  Just, they're gone.
[01:11:48.911 --> 01:11:50.892]  And Google said, you can't sell the Obama deception.
[01:11:50.892 --> 01:11:51.652]  It's racist.
[01:11:51.652 --> 01:11:52.092]  We're banned.
[01:11:54.073 --> 01:11:57.095]  And then Reddit says you can't promote Donald Trump stuff now.
[01:11:57.095 --> 01:12:00.317]  That was announced yesterday, DrudgeReport.com, link to that.
[01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.738]  I'm doing a Reddit Ask Me Anything tomorrow, 8 o'clock.
[01:12:02.738 --> 01:12:05.240]  Now it's going to be really special, dealing with the war on free speech.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:15.145]  So I'm going to be up here probably 3-4 hours tomorrow night doing a live Ask Me Anything, but it's dealing with free speech.
[01:12:15.145 --> 01:12:17.046]  This is from Carolyn French.
[01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:24.614]  At AdRoll.com, I apologize for the lack of communication here prior to pausing campaigns.
[01:12:24.614 --> 01:12:27.795]  InfoWars has been flagged by the AdRoll policy team.
[01:12:27.795 --> 01:12:29.316]  As a result, campaign suspended.
[01:12:29.316 --> 01:12:32.237]  In an effort to protect, blah blah blah, it goes on.
[01:12:32.237 --> 01:12:36.279]  All content on your website should be relevant, accurate, informative, and up-to-date.
[01:12:36.279 --> 01:12:38.440]  And Snopes decides.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.422]  When they're not hanging out with dominatrices or whatever.
[01:12:41.422 --> 01:12:44.163]  And the Clintons, they decide.
[01:12:44.163 --> 01:12:46.084]  Any claims should be easily verifiable.
[01:12:46.854 --> 01:12:51.218]  We are not able to promote such websites that are intentionally misrepresented.
[01:12:51.218 --> 01:12:52.039]  So it's Kafkaesque.
[01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:54.561]  They won't tell you what you've done.
[01:12:54.561 --> 01:12:55.782]  You're just banned.
[01:12:55.782 --> 01:13:01.768]  Intentionally misrepresent their businesses or use any tactic to falsely enhance reputation or misrepresent actual offerings.
[01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:06.868]  Like beer commercials where you pop a Budweiser and 20 hot blondes jump on you?
[01:13:06.868 --> 01:13:10.669]  Furthermore, all political content should focus on the merits of the candidate.
[01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:13.369]  Oh, they're gonna tell us what our political content should be!
[01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:14.790]  New definitions of free speech!
[01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.690]  Seems like a safe space, like a college!
[01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:22.391]  These people are all graduating from college, and they go to run these little ad boards, and they hear, fake news should be banned!
[01:13:22.391 --> 01:13:29.893]  Alex Jones is on every channel, from the CBC to CNN to ABC, NBC to the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, all saying, ban me this week!
[01:13:31.499 --> 01:13:35.903]  You would think, man, this guy must be cutting edge and saying something really powerful we should all look into.
[01:13:35.903 --> 01:13:42.249]  No, no, no, it's just, oh, sorry, you've been doing business with us for several years, was it two and a half years?
[01:13:42.249 --> 01:13:46.472]  First year a million something, next year two million, three plus million?
[01:13:46.472 --> 01:13:54.920]  Advertising our products, how we fund ourselves, we take that profit, then put it back into the operation, and you just say, sorry, we don't tell you why, just here's what it might be.
[01:13:57.776 --> 01:14:01.318]  We are not able to promote websites that intentionally misrepresent their businesses.
[01:14:01.318 --> 01:14:02.958]  They don't show you what you did, though.
[01:14:02.958 --> 01:14:06.080]  It's like being convicted of murder, but they don't tell you who you murdered or what you did.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.622]  Or use any tactic to falsely enhance reputation or misrepresent actual offerings.
[01:14:10.622 --> 01:14:20.486]  Furthermore, all potential content should focus on the merits of the candidates and political messages and should not target special interests or groups or imply affiliations.
[01:14:20.486 --> 01:14:21.367]  So you shouldn't target
[01:14:22.728 --> 01:14:23.428]  Anti-gunners.
[01:14:23.428 --> 01:14:26.250]  You shouldn't have any speech, but our ads weren't even that.
[01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.291]  They go on to say, well, it's your website.
[01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:32.613]  It's your website's the problem, and it's what your website carries.
[01:14:32.613 --> 01:14:38.616]  So you can't then buy advertising with us, and then have it placed on our ad network with people that put ads on their site.
[01:14:38.616 --> 01:14:44.699]  No wonder ad revenue's imploding on the web, because they're killing it on purpose.
[01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:48.161]  But selectively, they're going after Breitbart, WorldNetDaily, and everybody else.
[01:14:49.790 --> 01:15:07.766]  To protect the privacy of users, it goes on, do not target based on or imply potentially sensitive political opinions, trade union, religious, don't say you're Christian, interest or participation in activities, sexual behavior, status of a child under 13 years of age.
[01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:17.688]  You know, maybe they banned us because we talked about Milo and being sexually abused, and now they're using that as a way to try to censor everybody, while they cover up for the big pedophile networks.
[01:15:17.688 --> 01:15:19.309]  Listen, here's the deal.
[01:15:19.309 --> 01:15:28.577]  If you want to sue me for defamation, libel, or slander, and you can prove it in court of law, never happened, knock on wood, then that's your issue.
[01:15:28.577 --> 01:15:34.742]  But they've been trying to maneuver and set things up that they can censor us, and now this points a gun at everybody's head.
[01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:39.775]  And it fits into all the big announcements that came out last Friday.
[01:15:39.775 --> 01:15:49.021]  Zuckerberg leaks his plan to censor conservatives, that means anybody they disagree with, nationalists, and to quote, get your personal data.
[01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:51.123]  But it's not even on Facebook.
[01:15:51.123 --> 01:16:02.090]  So these are arrogant people that think you're like an animal, that doesn't understand the technocracy and the system they've built and that you'll just go into it like a mouse into a mousetrap.
[01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.731]  The truth is,
[01:16:04.175 --> 01:16:07.816]  People need to value independent media, even if they don't totally agree with it.
[01:16:07.816 --> 01:16:11.978]  They need to spread it and promote it and praise it.
[01:16:11.978 --> 01:16:14.099]  And vote with their dollars to support it.
[01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:16.700]  We're going to expand this year with the Washington Bureau and other projects.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.041]  We're going to hire more reporters.
[01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.841]  We're going to do it if it's God's will.
[01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:23.123]  And I'm going ahead with everything, even though they're trying to cripple us.
[01:16:23.123 --> 01:16:31.126]  And I'm going to ask you to just sign up for AutoShip, get 10% off, pick more items you want to buy, pick items you bought years ago you like, buy some more.
[01:16:31.126 --> 01:16:33.787]  Regardless, it's a donation supporting free speech.
[01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:37.095]  And the total tip of the spear.
[01:16:49.184 --> 01:17:03.728]  Saying they threatened my family 10 years ago and nothing was done and they're total criminals and they work for the communist Chinese and the Russians and I'm going to expose the Clintons and I'm going to bring it all out because they're lying about Trump and I have all the classified contacts.
[01:17:03.728 --> 01:17:07.849]  He's even currently still involved with the UN and the US and the Pentagon obviously.
[01:17:07.849 --> 01:17:09.210]  That's what he was at meetings today with.
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:13.773]  I mean, you know, Dr. Corsi is not just Dr. Corsi, obviously, as well.
[01:17:13.773 --> 01:17:15.995]  And it's all about to start coming out.
[01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:21.659]  So, and he said this in games, the gloves are off and he stomped out of the meeting.
[01:17:21.659 --> 01:17:25.563]  Because they recognize America was on its deathbed and Trump's a nationalist.
[01:17:25.563 --> 01:17:27.764]  He's far from perfect, but he wants prosperity.
[01:17:27.764 --> 01:17:28.585]  He's not out to get us.
[01:17:28.585 --> 01:17:29.426]  He's not a pedophile.
[01:17:30.157 --> 01:17:36.302]  And so, Kurt Weldon, you heard he was going to give us the data in the next 24 hours, 48 hours.
[01:17:36.302 --> 01:17:37.183]  I wish I had a bigger crew.
[01:17:37.183 --> 01:17:40.705]  I've got a crew, but the other crew was just covering Trump.
[01:17:40.705 --> 01:17:41.686]  We need a couple more crews.
[01:17:41.686 --> 01:17:42.887]  We've got to go interview Weldon right now.
[01:17:42.887 --> 01:17:45.149]  This is all super dangerous.
[01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:51.314]  Now, another individual covering super dangerous stuff is Robert David Steele, former Marine Corps, actually an operative.
[01:17:52.194 --> 01:18:00.786]  On the ground with the CIA, with HUMET running whole operations, an expert on hacking, and a former CIA case officer, RobertDavidSteele.com.
[01:18:00.786 --> 01:18:07.576]  He was talking about a whole other subject today, but clearly they're making their move trying to block the restoration of the Republic.
[01:18:08.537 --> 01:18:11.199]  They're taking the gloves off, openly saying censor.
[01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:12.981]  They just hit us really hard.
[01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:15.583]  Oh, I forgot!
[01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:22.088]  I went in last week and noticed three videos totaling more than 20 million views that were removed off our Facebook, deleted.
[01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:23.630]  And they didn't tell us why.
[01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:24.490]  Used to, they'd tell you.
[01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:25.871]  And it was rare.
[01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:26.671]  It's everywhere.
[01:18:26.671 --> 01:18:31.973]  They're hitting us with a stealth system to test us, to see what we do, and to see if we notice.
[01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.134]  Now, I don't... This all broke this morning.
[01:18:34.134 --> 01:18:36.795]  We don't even have articles out on this yet, okay?
[01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.015]  But Robert David Steele joins us.
[01:18:38.015 --> 01:18:41.536]  I want to get his take on where we are and what's currently happening.
[01:18:41.536 --> 01:18:48.458]  But people need to understand, this is the most serious censorship since the Civil War in this country.
[01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:49.758]  Robert David Steele, thank you for joining us.
[01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.079]  What do you make of all this?
[01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:54.058]  Well, Alex, A, you're my hero.
[01:18:54.058 --> 01:18:57.280]  I think you're one of the best of the alternative media sites.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.243]  And frankly, I wouldn't be popular anywhere if it hadn't been for you.
[01:19:01.243 --> 01:19:01.983]  So thank you.
[01:19:01.983 --> 01:19:03.204]  No, thank you.
[01:19:03.204 --> 01:19:05.165]  I'll give you two names.
[01:19:05.165 --> 01:19:08.067]  Brendan Sullivan and Daniel Sheehan.
[01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:23.263]  I think you should reach out to both of them because this is the single greatest threat to American democracy since Congress abdicated its constitutional role to control the power of the purse and war.
[01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:25.325]  This is without question
[01:19:26.025 --> 01:19:29.908]  An unconstitutional, illegal action.
[01:19:29.908 --> 01:19:38.175]  And Alex, I would be thrilled if you got Brendan Sullivan and Danny Sheehan on your side and led a full court trial.
[01:19:38.175 --> 01:19:39.156]  Sure, tell folks who those are.
[01:19:39.156 --> 01:19:41.858]  There's a lot of people that have been warning about all this and now it's happening.
[01:19:41.858 --> 01:19:48.424]  Well, Brendan Sullivan is the I'm-not-the-potted-plant guy who defended Oliver North.
[01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:53.067]  Brendan Sullivan is probably the single greatest lawyer still working in Washington, D.C.
[01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:57.109]  Daniel Sheehan is the Ellsberg lawyer.
[01:19:57.109 --> 01:19:59.570]  I reviewed his book, The People's Advocate.
[01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:03.891]  Daniel Sheehan is one of the greatest lawyers on the planet.
[01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:07.212]  And he is deeply committed to First Amendment rights.
[01:20:07.212 --> 01:20:18.835]  Absolutely, and they can argue we have terms of service, but they just can't take some fake list that The Washington Post admits is fake, and then apply it, and then ban me and say I'm not a human, and put me in some electronic ghetto.
[01:20:19.955 --> 01:20:22.238]  AdRoll is a failing company.
[01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:26.182]  They laid off 500 people in December.
[01:20:26.182 --> 01:20:28.764]  They're a crap company, okay?
[01:20:28.764 --> 01:20:31.287]  They do whatever Google tells them to do.
[01:20:31.287 --> 01:20:33.489]  And behind Google is Eric Schmidt.
[01:20:33.489 --> 01:20:39.235]  And behind Eric Schmidt is the Clinton Foundation and George Photos, and behind them are the Rothschilds.
[01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:42.299]  What is happening right now is that we need a new internet.
[01:20:42.859 --> 01:20:47.521]  We need to bury Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
[01:20:47.521 --> 01:20:50.622]  A Steemit is a good start.
[01:20:50.622 --> 01:20:57.785]  I personally have never taken ads on my website, in part because I rely on donations and I'm much smaller than you are, Alex.
[01:20:57.785 --> 01:20:59.186]  But I think this is war.
[01:21:00.166 --> 01:21:06.887]  And Trump, unfortunately, is having all of his people being stripped away from him, and he still doesn't get it.
[01:21:06.887 --> 01:21:10.468]  He needs an Electoral Reform Act, and he needs a Trump channel.
[01:21:10.468 --> 01:21:15.489]  And you and I have talked about the Trump channel, and you should certainly be a critical part of the Trump channel.
[01:21:15.489 --> 01:21:27.712]  But I want to bury Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube, and I want to do it in the next 90 days with a blockchain technology that Donald Trump could roll out with Brad Parscale overnight.
[01:21:28.815 --> 01:21:33.139]  I agree because they're not backing off and just letting us have our country back.
[01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:34.641]  They are declaring war.
[01:21:34.641 --> 01:21:36.463]  I think they've miscalculated.
[01:21:36.463 --> 01:21:37.544]  Yes, I do.
[01:21:37.544 --> 01:21:38.004]  I do.
[01:21:38.004 --> 01:21:41.848]  But I'll tell you, Alex, you can't win this one without Brendan Sullivan and Danny Sham.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.786]  Let's expand then on what do you think this signifies?
[01:21:48.786 --> 01:21:50.609]  It's not just us.
[01:21:50.609 --> 01:21:53.153]  They are again pulling all these other major sponsors.
[01:21:53.153 --> 01:21:54.114]  They're blocking people.
[01:21:54.114 --> 01:21:56.478]  They're blocking people's apps.
[01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.521]  I mean, they're just on a savage operation.
[01:21:59.508 --> 01:22:00.449]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:01.950]  I mean, this is a civil war.
[01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.131]  This is a civil war.
[01:22:04.131 --> 01:22:14.357]  And although Jeff Sessions is installed as the Attorney General, he has a Department of Justice that is slow rolling him.
[01:22:14.357 --> 01:22:18.319]  They are not going to do their job because they don't want to do their job.
[01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:21.681]  This is everybody against Donald Trump, except we the people.
[01:22:21.681 --> 01:22:23.683]  But Trump is also his own worst enemy.
[01:22:24.603 --> 01:22:30.712]  I have written a memorandum for the president that has been read by a million people in the last week and a half.
[01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:33.416]  Memo for Trump, with four being a number.
[01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.079]  Memo number for Trump.
[01:22:35.079 --> 01:22:37.202]  You can find it online very easily.
[01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.284]  You and I have talked about it.
[01:22:39.525 --> 01:22:44.870]  Rance Priebus, we call him Judas Priebus, is blocking Trump's mail.
[01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:49.275]  Priebus is also- We know from our reports he met with Twitter.
[01:22:49.275 --> 01:22:56.702]  He's the one that got them to block the people's comments going to the top because that freaks them out that Trump is obsessed with reading what the public has to say.
[01:22:56.702 --> 01:23:00.826]  Trump goes for hours and reads the actual mail.
[01:23:00.826 --> 01:23:01.307]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:02.280]  Twitter?
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.821]  No, Alex, you're brilliant.
[01:23:03.821 --> 01:23:07.083]  I mean, Twitter is a treasonous company right now.
[01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:15.907]  Google should be prosecuted for all of the undeclared campaign contributions worth tens of millions of dollars that they gave to Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:23.971]  The bottom line here is that Trump needs a Trump channel that bypasses not just the mainstream media, but the social media.
[01:23:23.971 --> 01:23:25.792]  And an Electoral Reform Act.
[01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:28.974]  Those two things together, combined with counterintelligence,
[01:23:29.534 --> 01:23:31.555]  We'll allow Trump to survive.
[01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:39.678]  The Republican and Democratic parties, the billionaires in New York, some of the energy guys in Texas, are all against Trump.
[01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:44.119]  Trump is right where John F. Kennedy was just before he got assassinated.
[01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:48.020]  And they're openly calling for his death in the news, and the Secret Service is doing nothing.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:57.964]  They're actually saying, let's organize, let's kill him, time to murder him, time to overthrow him, time for a coup, and nothing's being done because I guess Trump doesn't want to look weak or like an authoritarian.
[01:23:58.984 --> 01:23:59.885]  Let me play you this clip.
[01:23:59.885 --> 01:24:02.186]  We've got a clip here.
[01:24:02.186 --> 01:24:08.610]  Representative, we should pass a resolution condemning President Trump's attacks on the media and trying to basically restrict it.
[01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:11.491]  Here's Jerry Nadler.
[01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:18.836]  He, of course, I mean, as you know, he's been much more vocal in denouncing the media.
[01:24:18.836 --> 01:24:23.438]  He has been quite aggressive in his feelings about the media.
[01:24:23.438 --> 01:24:27.221]  He's called the press the enemy of the American people.
[01:24:28.381 --> 01:24:30.142]  Is Congress doing anything about this?
[01:24:30.142 --> 01:24:32.482]  I don't know what Congress can do about that.
[01:24:32.482 --> 01:24:33.283]  We should condemn it.
[01:24:33.283 --> 01:24:37.264]  We should maybe pass a resolution condemning the president for saying things like that.
[01:24:37.264 --> 01:24:39.285]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:24:39.285 --> 01:24:50.828]  The two institutions that we depend on to maintain a democratic form of government, to maintain protection against tyranny from the executive or anyone else, are the free press and the independent judiciary.
[01:24:50.828 --> 01:24:52.429]  And he's attacking both of them.
[01:24:52.429 --> 01:24:55.910]  And to say that you can't believe, to delegitimize the
[01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:56.290]  I don't think so.
[01:25:05.549 --> 01:25:06.970]  That has a history.
[01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:12.734]  The only people that I know of who've used that phrase, he's an enemy of the people, were Stalin.
[01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:20.219]  And the people who succeeded Stalin in the Soviet bloc, counter-revolutionaries, enemies of the people, were prosecuted as enemies of the people.
[01:25:20.219 --> 01:25:22.080]  The press is not an enemy of the people.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.903]  Nobody's an enemy of the people because they disagree with me or you about what we ought to be doing.
[01:25:26.903 --> 01:25:30.926]  We're all presumably working for the benefit of the people as we see it.
[01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:32.407]  We may be wrong.
[01:25:32.407 --> 01:25:33.307]  I may disagree with you.
[01:25:33.307 --> 01:25:34.348]  What's the benefit of the people?
[01:25:34.648 --> 01:25:36.049]  That's what democracy is.
[01:25:36.049 --> 01:25:47.978]  They call Trump the enemy and Hitler and say kill him all over the news and then he says the corporate media is working against tax cuts and regulations being cut on small businesses and getting the Federal Reserve to actually loan to small banks.
[01:25:47.978 --> 01:25:49.299]  Let me jump in here.
[01:25:49.299 --> 01:25:51.340]  I'm a son of New York.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.141]  Jerry Nadler is an idiot.
[01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:55.043]  He's also a Mossad agent.
[01:25:55.043 --> 01:25:59.106]  I'm quite sure someone has him on videotape doing evil things.
[01:25:59.106 --> 01:26:00.747]  That man is under control.
[01:26:02.242 --> 01:26:14.772]  I am the top intelligence professional for the 21st century, with eight books, two with forwards by senators, and I will tell you my independent evaluation of the media is a D-.
[01:26:14.772 --> 01:26:19.155]  Crap news network and the freaked out X-holes, as I call them.
[01:26:19.155 --> 01:26:21.857]  And there's no doubt the people that own the corporate media are the enemy.
[01:26:21.857 --> 01:26:22.478]  They're the globalists.
[01:26:23.018 --> 01:26:23.678]  Absolutely.
[01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:32.720]  Look, Donald Trump is absolutely right with his accusations and he is totally incompetent at doing something about it.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.780]  Trump has to do it.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:34.841]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[01:26:34.841 --> 01:26:38.481]  He's used to business where you just bring in the top people and move forward.
[01:26:38.481 --> 01:26:39.562]  He's just trying to cut taxes.
[01:26:39.562 --> 01:26:46.523]  He even says, what's wrong with me just cutting taxes and not shutting down our coal plants when we have clean burning coal?
[01:26:46.523 --> 01:26:47.624]  Why isn't everybody for this?
[01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:49.424]  He doesn't get how evil they are.
[01:26:50.305 --> 01:27:03.139]  Well, what really troubles me is that Congress, including John McCain, I mean, when somebody talks about a free press in the United States of America, they are either stupid or a criminal.
[01:27:03.139 --> 01:27:04.640]  McCain said that Trump is a dictator.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.241]  McCain is senile.
[01:27:12.415 --> 01:27:13.476]  Okay?
[01:27:13.476 --> 01:27:16.117]  McCain sang like a bird in prison camp.
[01:27:16.117 --> 01:27:17.418]  They called him Songbird.
[01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:19.959]  That was his nickname.
[01:27:19.959 --> 01:27:27.124]  Wayne Madsen has done an excellent piece on how John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who is a world-class gay, are owned.
[01:27:27.964 --> 01:27:28.645]  By the CIA.
[01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:47.749]  No, I get it.
[01:27:47.749 --> 01:27:55.055]  If he was to bring in bonafide, known liberals, real liberals that are trusted by real liberals, that would just shut down all the left-right garbage.
[01:27:55.055 --> 01:27:55.676]  Yes!
[01:27:55.676 --> 01:27:56.656]  Yes, Alex!
[01:27:56.656 --> 01:28:00.920]  I mean, this is like they say in New York, we gotta go to the mattresses here.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:07.525]  But the problem is, you are our natural leader, and I really respect everything you have done for all of us.
[01:28:08.246 --> 01:28:14.568]  But on this one, I think you really need to think very deeply about reaching out to Brendan Sullivan and Danny Sheehan.
[01:28:14.568 --> 01:28:19.110]  No, listen, I know that I need to sue some people now, because for everybody... No, you do need to sue them.
[01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.451]  And you need to get these two lawyers this week.
[01:28:23.618 --> 01:28:36.122]  I know, I'm not a litigious person, but when they just say, we say you're fake, and we've got a Washington Post list that they admit was a fake list, and so now you signed a contract, we worked with you for years, and now we're not going to work with you.
[01:28:36.122 --> 01:28:39.704]  If they just said we're not going to work with you, fine, but they said, no, you're fake, you're a fraud.
[01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:41.724]  So we're not going to work with you.
[01:28:41.724 --> 01:28:50.567]  When I just had the former vice head of the Homeland Security and Armed Services Committees on saying, they threatened my family 10 years ago and I didn't speak out.
[01:28:50.567 --> 01:28:55.309]  Well, I'm taking the gloves off now and exposing the Clintons as communist Chinese and Russian agents.
[01:28:55.309 --> 01:28:56.189]  That's not fake news.
[01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:58.190]  That's Pulitzer Prize level stuff.
[01:28:58.190 --> 01:28:59.590]  I mean, what do you make of that stuff?
[01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:04.672]  You're right where, you're right where WikiLeaks was when PayPal
[01:29:05.612 --> 01:29:09.515]  Cut them off without any legal due process whatsoever.
[01:29:09.515 --> 01:29:10.857]  Exactly.
[01:29:10.857 --> 01:29:12.998]  That's what's happening to you now.
[01:29:12.998 --> 01:29:16.742]  Now, there's a three part... And if I don't fight back, it's going to be everything next.
[01:29:16.742 --> 01:29:17.242]  Exactly.
[01:29:17.242 --> 01:29:19.744]  There's three ways you fight back.
[01:29:19.744 --> 01:29:25.008]  Way number one is you get Brendan Sullivan and Danny Sheehan and you create the legal dream team.
[01:29:25.008 --> 01:29:25.869]  You go O.J.
[01:29:25.869 --> 01:29:30.393]  Simpson on steroids and you make these people hurt.
[01:29:30.393 --> 01:29:33.816]  You get judgments against them in every state that cuts them off.
[01:29:33.936 --> 01:29:34.316]  No, I agree.
[01:29:34.316 --> 01:29:35.677]  It's a battle to expose fake news.
[01:29:35.677 --> 01:29:40.179]  Well, the Washington Post had to retract a few months ago their fake news list because a lawsuit was filed.
[01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:42.281]  And then they backed off.
[01:29:42.281 --> 01:29:45.602]  Alex, you have got to get me in front of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon.
[01:29:45.602 --> 01:29:47.704]  We have got to roll out the Trump Channel.
[01:29:47.704 --> 01:29:49.104]  I missed a call just yesterday.
[01:29:49.104 --> 01:29:50.705]  It's not like I talk to Trump all the time.
[01:29:50.705 --> 01:29:51.146]  We'll be back.
[01:29:51.146 --> 01:29:51.926]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:54.467]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.467 --> 01:29:57.129]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:09.730]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:18.314]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[01:30:18.314 --> 01:30:23.156]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[01:30:23.756 --> 01:30:40.763]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia, and the deep states declared war on President Trump, condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity, one has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[01:30:40.763 --> 01:30:53.068]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities, and even shoot downs of Russian jets, if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[01:30:53.528 --> 01:30:58.394]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[01:30:58.394 --> 01:31:01.057]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[01:31:01.057 --> 01:31:06.143]  Over the years there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:07.345]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:07.345 --> 01:32:10.568]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:16.152]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:16.152 --> 01:32:22.278]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:22.278 --> 01:32:25.561]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:25.561 --> 01:32:27.022]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:27.202 --> 01:32:31.503]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:31.503 --> 01:32:34.464]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:34.464 --> 01:32:36.125]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:36.125 --> 01:32:39.566]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:39.566 --> 01:32:42.166]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:42.166 --> 01:32:43.227]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:43.227 --> 01:32:45.927]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:46.808]  I take this.
[01:32:46.808 --> 01:32:48.628]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:48.628 --> 01:32:50.589]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.

[01:33:13.447 --> 01:33:30.340]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.421]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.512 --> 01:33:59.220]  Alright, so we've got some really corrupt out-of-control elites that have openly been announcing for years they want to start censoring the internet, censoring the alt-right, the alt-left, anything the big corporations don't agree with.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:09.046]  A lot of the big telecoms and big internet companies openly work with Communist China to help arrest Buddhists that are secretly practicing and have their organs sold.
[01:34:09.046 --> 01:34:16.832]  That's the huge out-of-control disconnect with Apple and its Foxconn labs it uses with the suicide nets and the forced drugging and forced abortion.
[01:34:18.061 --> 01:34:26.024]  Here we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution and some history of freedom, but the very bedrock of that is being debilitated.
[01:34:26.024 --> 01:34:36.787]  Now I want to cover a bunch of other news with our guest here in just a moment and tie this in to a whole bunch of other issues, but I'm not somebody that wanted the Iraq War.
[01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:41.169]  I'm not against Muslims in general, but why are the most radical Muslims being funded?
[01:34:41.169 --> 01:34:42.569]  Why are they being brought in?
[01:34:42.569 --> 01:34:43.890]  An article up on DrudgeReport.com
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.901]  Says Trump was right.
[01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:52.886]  Migrants riot, loot, fight with police and set fires on cars in Sweden, you name it.
[01:34:52.886 --> 01:34:55.448]  Same thing in France.
[01:34:55.448 --> 01:35:00.932]  So it's getting really bad while the media says and the Pope says, quote, there is no such thing as Islamic terror.
[01:35:01.857 --> 01:35:03.258]  Now look, I know there's false flags.
[01:35:03.258 --> 01:35:03.738]  I know all of this.
[01:35:03.738 --> 01:35:04.779]  This whole thing's a false flag.
[01:35:04.779 --> 01:35:07.240]  And then they're stirring up radical Islam, bringing it in.
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:15.946]  I'm going to get somebody who actually fought this in the Middle East and was in the CIA for a long time as somebody who actually was a case officer and a Marine before that.
[01:35:15.946 --> 01:35:17.807]  RobertDavidSteele.com is the website.
[01:35:17.807 --> 01:35:19.548]  We'll talk to Robert David Steele here in just a moment.
[01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:29.615]  Before I go any further, if you want to support us, listen, sign up for our free email news alerts at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:35:29.615 --> 01:35:31.256]  Because if we get censored off the web itself,
[01:35:32.645 --> 01:35:36.428]  I'm told by the experts I can still send you videos or articles directly to your email.
[01:35:36.428 --> 01:35:41.652]  Plus we send you a lot of special reports or articles, you name it, but it's key to do that.
[01:35:41.652 --> 01:35:53.201]  Also, just spread the videos and articles in every platform we're on even more so that we're so big as they try to take us down, it's obvious to everyone and blows up in their face and creates the Streisand effect that I'll talk about in a moment.
[01:35:54.445 --> 01:35:58.906]  But InfoWars has been banned from one of the biggest and largest online advertising platforms.
[01:35:58.906 --> 01:36:00.727]  By the way, it took me years to learn all this.
[01:36:00.727 --> 01:36:05.528]  I love how Steele, who's a technology guy, says, Alex, that's not AdRoll, that's Google.
[01:36:05.528 --> 01:36:08.649]  That's just their front company for liability protection.
[01:36:08.649 --> 01:36:11.490]  And that's exactly what I've known.
[01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:12.870]  It's Google doing this, okay?
[01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:15.811]  This is Schmidt, and they always want to have these people so they can deny it.
[01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:20.252]  So I'm going to have to sue Google, and I guess that'll get to Trump as well.
[01:36:22.131 --> 01:36:24.653]  They're trying to work with Trump and hoping he'll go along with all their censorship.
[01:36:24.653 --> 01:36:25.834]  It's not going to happen.
[01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:29.897]  The problem is, again, you've got Rince Priebus and all of them trying to keep info from Trump.
[01:36:29.897 --> 01:36:35.382]  So now more than ever, InfoWars needs your support to help defend against incoming attacks and keep fighting hard.
[01:36:35.382 --> 01:36:37.023]  Defend InfoWars specials.
[01:36:37.023 --> 01:36:38.525]  Defend free speech specials.
[01:36:38.525 --> 01:36:40.186]  Now live at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:40.186 --> 01:36:42.288]  We're just launching big sales we weren't even going to have.
[01:36:43.516 --> 01:36:46.239]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, back in after two-plus months being sold out.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:48.582]  Best Colloidal Silver out there.
[01:36:48.582 --> 01:36:49.843]  33% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:49.843 --> 01:36:55.169]  Supramel Vitality, known concentrated herbs into oil form that are just amazing.
[01:36:55.169 --> 01:36:57.812]  Brain Force, amazing healthy nootropic for the brain.
[01:36:57.812 --> 01:37:02.057]  Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs, two more limited editions.
[01:37:02.057 --> 01:37:04.060]  Those are available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:37:05.575 --> 01:37:10.476]  The globalists hate that InfoWars is not beholden to the mega banks or government handouts.
[01:37:10.476 --> 01:37:13.357]  We don't get George Soros money or taxpayer money like MSNBC.
[01:37:13.357 --> 01:37:16.678]  But it means our message cannot be censored or controlled.
[01:37:16.678 --> 01:37:21.119]  Because we are not establishment funded, we are powered solely by your support.
[01:37:21.119 --> 01:37:25.440]  Help defend InfoWars and take advantage of these new mega specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.561]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:27.538 --> 01:37:34.900]  And again, we're going to have big articles coming out on this in the next hour or so on InfoWars.com about the attacks we're under.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:49.623]  But whether it's a non-GMO heirloom seed pack for the spring coming up, or shortwave radio, solar panel systems, great state-of-the-art car jumper systems, whatever the latest, coolest technology is, we buy them in bulk and sell them.
[01:37:49.623 --> 01:37:52.303]  We have a whole Made in America apparel line of clothing.
[01:37:52.303 --> 01:37:54.764]  We also have it at lower prices, you know, Made in Latin America.
[01:37:54.764 --> 01:37:56.244]  Whatever your choice is, we have it.
[01:37:57.516 --> 01:37:59.097]  Deport George Soros, 2017.
[01:37:59.097 --> 01:38:02.639]  Arrest Hillary, 2017.
[01:38:02.639 --> 01:38:06.341]  It's all there, and it's you that makes the info war.
[01:38:06.341 --> 01:38:11.603]  But, man, I tell you, Reddit censors pro-Trump content and new campaign crackdown.
[01:38:11.603 --> 01:38:13.684]  I'm doing an Ask Me Anything tomorrow, 8 o'clock Central.
[01:38:13.684 --> 01:38:16.286]  I was already going to do it on censorship on Reddit.
[01:38:16.286 --> 01:38:17.726]  Now it'll be on censorship on us.
[01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:19.287]  I mean, think about that.
[01:38:19.287 --> 01:38:23.950]  The amount of money they just blew away for us the next year is exactly what we were budgeting
[01:38:24.795 --> 01:38:25.896]  To fund the D.C.
[01:38:25.896 --> 01:38:29.138]  Bureau, London Bureau, and hiring, you know, 10, 15 more people.
[01:38:29.138 --> 01:38:29.958]  You know what?
[01:38:29.958 --> 01:38:30.499]  I'm hiring 100.
[01:38:30.499 --> 01:38:33.220]  I'm going to believe in Providence.
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.221]  I'm going to take action.
[01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:36.222]  I know when I got to hustle, I'll hustle.
[01:38:36.222 --> 01:38:40.245]  And so, just you may hear me plugging a little bit more or asking you, come on!
[01:38:40.245 --> 01:38:40.605]  Here's the deal.
[01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:59.238]  The elite always think people are there to sell out, or I'm looking to join the New World Order, or like, they couldn't believe when they offered me $3 million to join them, and it was $10 million, and it was like one of the, by then it was one of the presidents of a company, it was vice presidents before, and they said, listen, I don't make $10 million in 10 years.
[01:39:01.624 --> 01:39:03.285]  I'm just hooking for a stock split.
[01:39:03.285 --> 01:39:04.867]  Take this three-year deal.
[01:39:04.867 --> 01:39:07.249]  I'm like, no, I don't want your $10 million.
[01:39:07.249 --> 01:39:09.471]  That was 15 years ago, folks.
[01:39:09.471 --> 01:39:10.692]  People say, oh, tell us who did it.
[01:39:10.692 --> 01:39:13.914]  If you're in business and life and you ever talk about sources, it never happens again.
[01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:17.537]  I mean, I've sat there and talked to one of the heads of one of the major banks.
[01:39:17.537 --> 01:39:21.921]  They just laugh at me and they say, the public scum, they'll never appreciate you, we'll beat you in the end.
[01:39:21.921 --> 01:39:24.763]  Well, I'm not joining with them to screw people over.
[01:39:24.763 --> 01:39:27.786]  So the point I'm making is, doing it my way,
[01:39:29.127 --> 01:39:34.428]  We bring in 10 times a year what they were offering over three years, but I spend it on the operation.
[01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:43.951]  The average talk show host, there's only two or three as big as we are, would make this much money a year but have huge mansions and helicopters and jets.
[01:39:43.951 --> 01:39:45.912]  I don't have helicopters, I don't have jets.
[01:39:45.912 --> 01:39:49.593]  A lot of times I fly business if I'm lucky, not even first class.
[01:39:49.593 --> 01:39:54.494]  Sure, I got a decent life, I drive a car that runs well, but that's not my God.
[01:39:54.494 --> 01:39:57.535]  My God is not being a peacock next to my rich neighbors.
[01:39:58.925 --> 01:40:03.960]  What I want in my hierarchy of needs is freedom for my children and defeating these snakes and seeing prosperity.
[01:40:05.077 --> 01:40:06.738]  Infowars is in your corner.
[01:40:06.738 --> 01:40:11.819]  We're wild about Trump because the entire power structure's against him and he clearly is trying to jumpstart the economy.
[01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:16.761]  But Trump's only a manifestation of the global awakening that's happening.
[01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:18.762]  So again, I need your support.
[01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:19.502]  I need your prayers.
[01:40:19.502 --> 01:40:26.024]  Because the attacks are just... I usually ignore them and don't talk about them because they're just... It's constant.
[01:40:26.024 --> 01:40:27.325]  It's a James Bond movie.
[01:40:27.325 --> 01:40:30.126]  In fact, someday, and I'm still around, I'm going to write a book
[01:40:31.323 --> 01:40:32.124]  About what?
[01:40:49.622 --> 01:40:58.127]  I mean, I had the Congressman on earlier getting tears in his eyes as he said, 10 years ago they threatened my family over all this and now I'm gonna release all of it!
[01:40:58.127 --> 01:41:09.053]  I mean, people are ready and it's a spirit of standing up and that's what's happening and that's what Robert David Steele and others are doing and I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers but support our local affiliates as well.
[01:41:10.043 --> 01:41:18.870]  And become sponsors and thank them for what they're doing, because believe me, we don't list our affiliates because of what these dirtbags try on them, okay?
[01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:19.431]  Anymore.
[01:41:19.431 --> 01:41:21.653]  We list the staller ones that have been there for over a decade.
[01:41:22.563 --> 01:41:24.524]  And you threaten them, they say, bring it.
[01:41:24.524 --> 01:41:27.106]  But the point is, that's how much trouble this country's in.
[01:41:27.106 --> 01:41:31.228]  I try not to do the enemy's intimidating for them when I tell you the crap they pull.
[01:41:31.228 --> 01:41:36.271]  But instead of making me scared, all it does is make me jump out of bed early in the morning and have more energy.
[01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:36.932]  So I've been ranting.
[01:41:36.932 --> 01:41:48.279]  Robert David Steele, I want to get into some of these news items, go over these with you, but I mean, the historical moment we're at, I don't have words and rhetoric to describe the real level, the real level of the
[01:41:49.238 --> 01:41:51.679]  Covert action they've done against me personally.
[01:41:51.679 --> 01:42:01.184]  I can't imagine what it's like for people like the congressman we had on earlier, who was always a stalwart exposing it, but kind of said, they threatened my family, I've been quiet for years, I'm going public.
[01:42:01.184 --> 01:42:04.746]  I mean, I think we're reaching the tipping point where people just say, I'm done.
[01:42:04.746 --> 01:42:05.206]  What do you think?
[01:42:06.181 --> 01:42:09.946]  I'm going to introduce you by email to Brendan Sullivan and Danny Sheehan.
[01:42:09.946 --> 01:42:12.729]  I think you need to come to Washington and sit down with Sullivan.
[01:42:12.729 --> 01:42:14.211]  I'd be glad to sit down with you.
[01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:19.839]  I think we need to literally cut these people off at the kneecaps with the best lawyers that money can buy.
[01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.702]  I hear you, but you hear my big rant.
[01:42:22.702 --> 01:42:24.743]  What do we do in this epic moment in history?
[01:42:24.743 --> 01:42:25.983]  I mean, have I got into everything?
[01:42:25.983 --> 01:42:29.885]  Alex, I just told you, you need to come to Washington and sit down with Brendan Sullivan.
[01:42:29.885 --> 01:42:30.265]  Period.
[01:42:30.265 --> 01:42:31.365]  That's it.
[01:42:31.365 --> 01:42:36.988]  Look, I would like to put a lien on Eric Schmidt's house and his jet and his helicopter.
[01:42:36.988 --> 01:42:37.268]  Okay?
[01:42:37.878 --> 01:42:42.060]  This is as big a fight as you're ever going to have in your lifetime.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.482]  And personally, I think President Trump should meet with you.
[01:42:44.482 --> 01:42:46.883]  And Steve Bannon should meet with you.
[01:42:46.883 --> 01:42:48.724]  And we should have a discussion.
[01:42:48.724 --> 01:42:51.566]  But the problem is you have to approach it holistically.
[01:42:51.566 --> 01:42:54.928]  You can't treat this as an isolated legal incident.
[01:42:54.928 --> 01:43:03.553]  Put bluntly, you're not going to win your lawsuit unless we also have an Electoral Reform Act and free the members from the bribery and the blackmail.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.204]  That Google and Facebook and Twitter and Wall Street are all imposing on the members.
[01:43:10.204 --> 01:43:15.827]  Our House of Representatives and our senators are bought and paid for.
[01:43:15.827 --> 01:43:23.392]  And if Trump doesn't address that, you're not going to win this in the courts.
[01:43:23.392 --> 01:43:24.453]  Continue breaking this down.
[01:43:26.329 --> 01:43:27.750]  Alex, I love you.
[01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:40.759]  I think you and the Hartman Report, Hartman and Hagman and Hagman and Reality and David Seidman and Greg Hunter with USA Watchdog, you guys are the lifeblood of the alternative media.
[01:43:40.759 --> 01:43:44.742]  And the alternative media exists because the mass media is corrupt to the bone.
[01:43:44.742 --> 01:43:49.366]  Anybody that says we have a free press in the United States of America is either an idiot or a criminal.
[01:43:50.066 --> 01:43:58.268]  Okay, and that certainly includes James Baker and all these other elites that are lying to us on CNN and on Fox News.
[01:43:58.268 --> 01:44:01.089]  Fox News, for me, is the greatest disgrace.
[01:44:01.089 --> 01:44:07.250]  Fox News, with the exception of Maria and Judge Napolitano, has completely betrayed the public trust.
[01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:10.691]  So you, in this case, may be a gift from heaven.
[01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:17.815]  Alex Jones is the poster child, the test case, the Supreme Court case.
[01:44:17.815 --> 01:44:19.436]  So I support you.
[01:44:19.436 --> 01:44:21.337]  And I really... Well, and it does show... Thank you for the support.
[01:44:21.337 --> 01:44:22.038]  We're all in this together.
[01:44:22.038 --> 01:44:23.358]  But let me ask you this.
[01:44:23.358 --> 01:44:24.599]  What does it signify?
[01:44:24.599 --> 01:44:25.620]  Because you're right.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:33.044]  It's a very bold move to say, after a two-plus-year relationship, you're banned because you're political on your website.
[01:44:33.044 --> 01:44:35.686]  So you can't ever... They're testing the waters, Alex.
[01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:37.767]  And they don't think that you know Brendan Sullivan.
[01:44:37.767 --> 01:44:40.149]  And they don't think Brendan Sullivan is going to take this case.
[01:44:41.485 --> 01:44:43.067]  I'm betting he will.
[01:44:43.067 --> 01:44:51.556]  I'm betting Brendan Sullivan plus Danny Sheehan plus Alex Jones is the biggest legal steamroller you ever saw.
[01:44:51.556 --> 01:44:54.279]  Go for it, Alex!
[01:44:54.279 --> 01:44:55.240]  Well, I have to sue.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:58.683]  I mean, I just... Well, you have to sue, but you have to sue with the best.
[01:44:58.683 --> 01:45:00.886]  You can't sue with any lawyer out of San Antonio.
[01:45:02.056 --> 01:45:02.937]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:45:02.937 --> 01:45:04.818]  I hear you.
[01:45:04.818 --> 01:45:07.140]  Well, I've got a great litigation lawyer.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:10.042]  He's listed in Texas Monthly as the best in the state.
[01:45:10.042 --> 01:45:12.804]  But he would agree that he needs to be a media lawyer.
[01:45:12.804 --> 01:45:16.706]  I will send you Sullivan and Sheehan's email when we get off.
[01:45:16.706 --> 01:45:17.047]  I know.
[01:45:17.047 --> 01:45:17.687]  It has to be done.
[01:45:17.687 --> 01:45:19.869]  I mean, I just... I mean, because here's the deal.
[01:45:19.869 --> 01:45:27.154]  They just dehumanize us when we dominate and we're having such a big effect and we have congresspeople and presidents on and we're covering real news.
[01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.655]  They should sue me for where I've lied.
[01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:31.657]  Alex, you are, right now, quote, unquote, the inconvenient truth.
[01:45:35.191 --> 01:45:35.671]  I hear you.
[01:45:35.671 --> 01:45:37.471]  Well, let me ask you this question, then.
[01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:45.473]  Geopolitically, looking at the players, how would you say things are going for the Republican establishment, the Democrat establishment, and other globalists?
[01:45:45.473 --> 01:45:48.594]  Because all over the place, nationalists are surging.
[01:45:48.594 --> 01:46:03.017]  And as somebody that actually fought radical Islam, but also saw how it stirred up by the West, what's the paradigm, you know, the Rosetta Stone, the code key, the decoder, to understand what's really going on destabilizing the Middle East and then flooding?
[01:46:04.617 --> 01:46:10.100]  Let me make clear that ISIS was created by Saudi Arabian Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.260]  Period.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:22.566]  ISIS was created by Saudi Arabia, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and of course the CIA under John Brennan, who is the highest paid Saudi Arabian agent in the United States of America.
[01:46:22.566 --> 01:46:24.247]  Brennan works for Saudi Arabia.
[01:46:24.247 --> 01:46:26.408]  He doesn't work for the United States of America.
[01:46:26.408 --> 01:46:29.529]  He is a dyed-in-the-wool member of the Deep State.
[01:46:29.529 --> 01:46:32.331]  He has been doing impeachable treasonous acts
[01:46:32.871 --> 01:46:35.953]  Lying to the public about the Russians hacking the election?
[01:46:35.953 --> 01:46:37.974]  I am among those who fought back.
[01:46:37.974 --> 01:46:42.817]  Right now the establishment is winning because Donald Trump doesn't have his act together.
[01:46:42.817 --> 01:46:45.059]  Trump is not doing holistic thinking.
[01:46:45.059 --> 01:46:46.960]  He has no bench.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:53.664]  He really needs to sit down and read the memo.
[01:46:53.664 --> 01:46:55.686]  You know, how Kafka-esque is it
[01:46:56.724 --> 01:47:05.522]  That they're banning sites and banning people advertising and calling for people to be kicked off the web but then they won't even say specifically what it is you've done and you never face anybody in court.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:08.781]  Why should you expect anything less?
[01:47:08.781 --> 01:47:13.363]  This is a fascist country when it comes to the media and the banks.
[01:47:13.363 --> 01:47:15.763]  Donald Trump was elected by accident.
[01:47:15.763 --> 01:47:19.365]  I've written, Donald Trump, the accidental president under SAGE.
[01:47:19.365 --> 01:47:26.447]  The problem right now is that the establishment, which assuredly includes the Republican Party, has got Donald Trump surrounded.
[01:47:26.447 --> 01:47:27.928]  Donald Trump is in enemy hands.
[01:47:28.948 --> 01:47:31.870]  It is absolutely essential that Trump break free.
[01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:34.292]  He made a huge mistake with McMaster.
[01:47:34.292 --> 01:47:36.534]  McMaster was a never-Trumper.
[01:47:36.534 --> 01:47:39.717]  McMaster swore loyalty to Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:39.717 --> 01:47:45.201]  And Reince Priebus did not properly brief Donald Trump, and Donald Trump didn't do his own homework.
[01:47:45.201 --> 01:47:47.923]  McMaster should not be the National Security Advisor.
[01:47:47.923 --> 01:47:49.885]  We don't need a National Security Advisor.
[01:47:50.345 --> 01:47:52.388]  All of our enemies are right here at home.
[01:47:52.388 --> 01:48:00.701]  What Trump should be doing is thinking about national strategy focused on restoring integrity to the electoral process and to the government.
[01:48:00.701 --> 01:48:03.105]  Donald Trump can do that, but not the way he's going.
[01:48:03.766 --> 01:48:08.388]  Let's talk about the fact that I have the exclusive up on Infowars.com.
[01:48:08.388 --> 01:48:14.591]  Russian bank docs show how Putin laundered millions to Hillary and Podesta, not just his brother, but reportedly Podesta himself.
[01:48:14.591 --> 01:48:16.192]  That's Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:48:16.192 --> 01:48:26.957]  And then, of course, in the article we point out that we were meeting with the former vice head of the Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security head, and that he was going to be giving us more information, Kurt Weldon.
[01:48:26.957 --> 01:48:29.218]  Then we ended up having him on the show today.
[01:48:29.218 --> 01:48:31.239]  And it's so huge, going back to this,
[01:48:32.179 --> 01:48:43.547]  The fact that Hillary and the Chinese and all, such huge connections, and then really no connections with Trump, well then how did Priebus get Trump running scared, getting rid of Flynn, and then Trump pretty much admitted that later.
[01:48:43.547 --> 01:48:45.708]  He didn't even know why Flynn's gone.
[01:48:45.708 --> 01:48:51.092]  He just kind of gave, you know, the Vice President and everybody what they wanted.
[01:48:51.092 --> 01:48:59.097]  So here's Trump being nice, just trying to cut taxes and help America, but already he thinks he's going to be nice to the establishment, bring in their guys, and they're already hen-pecking the President.
[01:49:01.247 --> 01:49:06.631]  Alex, Donald Trump desperately needs our help, and I don't know what else I can do.
[01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:10.633]  I mean, if I can't get Donald Trump to, first off, he needs to leave the White House.
[01:49:10.633 --> 01:49:15.837]  He needs to understand that the Oval Office is bugged, that there is no privacy in the White House.
[01:49:15.837 --> 01:49:20.860]  He has, every word he utters in the White House has been recorded and passed on.
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:21.901]  He knows he's under surveillance.
[01:49:22.574 --> 01:49:23.896]  He is under surveillance.
[01:49:23.896 --> 01:49:27.621]  In fact, I think there's a video camera above his desk.
[01:49:27.621 --> 01:49:30.024]  Trump really needs to get out of the White House.
[01:49:30.024 --> 01:49:37.794]  He needs to go to a secure, undisclosed location, and he needs to have a come to Jesus meeting with Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Kucinich, and myself.
[01:49:39.815 --> 01:50:03.623]  I know this, if he came out and told the American people there's been a globalist coup over the country, I don't care if you're left or right, they take your money, they set up one-sided deals, come on, get out of this hate, you know, I politically had to be right-wing to get into office, but I'm really just a populist, which he said in his inaugural address, please understand, the elite you claim you hate is against me, I really want to try to help you, and that's my big concern with the economy.
[01:50:04.508 --> 01:50:09.750]  Is that it's so close to imploding already, it may be too little too late, Ron Paul thinks.
[01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:11.751]  Well, you know, I love Ron Paul.
[01:50:11.751 --> 01:50:19.294]  His book on foreign policy of freedom, commerce, and peace is one of the most brilliant collection of speeches I've ever read.
[01:50:19.294 --> 01:50:20.714]  I loved Ron Paul.
[01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:24.496]  And Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich get along, and thank you for reminding me.
[01:50:24.496 --> 01:50:26.856]  Ron Paul should be in that meeting also.
[01:50:26.856 --> 01:50:28.777]  Well, I've tried to get the two together.
[01:50:28.777 --> 01:50:30.738]  But Alex, he has one really important point.
[01:50:32.162 --> 01:50:44.511]  For Donald Trump to win over the American public, he has to show them my graphic on the independent political landscape that shows that the two-party tyranny is shutting out 70% of the public.
[01:50:44.511 --> 01:50:45.172]  That's right.
[01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:46.333]  If he reaches out to them, he wins.
[01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:55.994]  Yes, but he has to reach out to them first before he slams, before he takes the baseball bat to the establishment.
[01:50:55.994 --> 01:50:57.554]  I mean, there's a real sequence here.
[01:50:57.554 --> 01:50:58.775]  I am a strategic thinker.
[01:50:58.775 --> 01:51:01.316]  Now let's talk about that sequence in the final segment with you straight ahead.
[01:51:01.316 --> 01:51:02.837]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[01:51:02.837 --> 01:51:06.118]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[01:51:06.118 --> 01:51:07.639]  The world is in turmoil.
[01:51:07.639 --> 01:51:12.181]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[01:51:12.181 --> 01:51:14.902]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[01:51:15.282 --> 01:51:19.245]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[01:51:19.245 --> 01:51:23.669]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:26.551]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[01:51:26.551 --> 01:51:30.254]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[01:51:30.254 --> 01:51:32.796]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[01:51:32.796 --> 01:51:36.398]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[01:51:36.398 --> 01:51:38.500]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:41.522]  And it lasts up to 25 years.
[01:51:41.522 --> 01:51:43.584]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[01:51:43.584 --> 01:51:47.967]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:50.529]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-763-5999.
[01:51:50.529 --> 01:51:51.510]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-763-5999.
[01:52:00.737 --> 01:52:10.102]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction, but what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[01:52:10.102 --> 01:52:20.488]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[01:52:20.488 --> 01:52:26.171]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[01:52:26.171 --> 01:52:29.653]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com.
[01:52:30.593 --> 01:52:38.075]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:52:38.075 --> 01:52:41.635]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[01:53:00.299 --> 01:53:02.420]  How will you spend your tax return?
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.841]  Will a new TV or the newest cell phone protect you when the unexpected happens?
[01:53:06.841 --> 01:53:10.482]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes.
[01:53:10.482 --> 01:53:15.304]  You and your family could be left helpless waiting for a slow-acting FEMA to come to your rescue.
[01:53:15.304 --> 01:53:18.865]  In a disaster, local store shelves are emptied in just hours.

[01:53:49.417 --> 01:53:49.837]  Be ready.
[01:53:50.037 --> 01:53:51.379]  With Wise Food Storage.

[01:54:21.525 --> 01:54:22.587]  I don't think so.
[01:54:51.266 --> 01:55:03.453]  Because of the massive censorship being openly announced, openly pushed by the corporate media, the neoliberals, the neocons, and the rest of them, we're announcing a 13-hour emergency live transmission for free speech tomorrow.
[01:55:03.453 --> 01:55:06.494]  I'm not just doing an AMA, Reddit Asking Anything show.
[01:55:06.494 --> 01:55:09.196]  I'll be live at 11 a.m.
[01:55:09.196 --> 01:55:10.276]  Central tomorrow.
[01:55:10.276 --> 01:55:12.938]  Then I'm gonna come back at 8 o'clock at night, and I'm gonna go to midnight.
[01:55:12.938 --> 01:55:20.002]  We're gonna have Paul Watson, Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, the rest of the great crew here, with a focus on free speech tomorrow.
[01:55:20.888 --> 01:55:30.755]  And a focus on all the different ways they're announcing they're going to censor it, how they're going to control it, how they violate our privacy and Amazon and Google admit they're listening to us inside our houses.
[01:55:30.755 --> 01:55:36.619]  I mean, it's so, I mean, I first reported on that like 15 years ago because Google put out a press release to their shareholders.
[01:55:36.619 --> 01:55:39.981]  They were listening to people in their houses and people thought I made it up.
[01:55:39.981 --> 01:55:41.982]  No, the truth is we're not fake news.
[01:55:41.982 --> 01:55:42.783]  We're the opposite.
[01:55:44.212 --> 01:55:54.027]  And we have on all these amazing people, you know, folks that authored our biological weapons treaties and people that have written the top legislation and scientists and just everybody.
[01:55:54.027 --> 01:55:57.913]  That's who we have on the show and folks can't stand
[01:55:59.502 --> 01:56:12.270]  The fact that somebody like Robert David Steele that was, you know, highly decorated in the CIA, a Marine, you name it, who knows all this stuff, who was already well-known when it came into writing circles, but now is so popular, as he said, through this show and other broadcasts.
[01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:14.912]  And I have other broadcasts on other people on other networks.
[01:56:14.912 --> 01:56:18.354]  I'm not in competition with anybody, except the tyrants.
[01:56:18.354 --> 01:56:28.220]  And listen, I can sit here and hustle and work so hard and sit here and beg for you to buy the products we've got that are so good, like the Caveman, the Bone Broth, and Turmeric Formulates, and
[01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:30.986]  Then you kind of, you know, buy a little bit.
[01:56:30.986 --> 01:56:41.370]  It kind of helps when you lose three plus million dollars, because that's that's what we made on last year to fund the operation with this Google platform system of advertising.
[01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:43.330]  That's that's a huge hit.
[01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:48.893]  That literally in the meetings, I said, we got three and a half million dollars to work with this year.
[01:56:48.893 --> 01:56:50.453]  And I'm not going to take profit this year, either.
[01:56:50.453 --> 01:56:51.954]  I'm going to put that money into the next year.
[01:56:52.901 --> 01:56:54.862]  And people say, oh, well, you should do that.
[01:56:54.862 --> 01:56:56.163]  Well, exactly.
[01:56:56.163 --> 01:56:58.984]  But the point is, is that we should be even stronger than that.
[01:56:58.984 --> 01:57:00.605]  We need your financial support.
[01:57:00.605 --> 01:57:02.166]  Big sales for free speech.
[01:57:02.166 --> 01:57:05.328]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:05.328 --> 01:57:11.351]  They're doing this to shut up the tip of the spear that they know is exponentially growing.
[01:57:11.351 --> 01:57:13.112]  So spread the article, spread the videos.
[01:57:13.112 --> 01:57:14.653]  Robert David Steele, I'll see you in Chalmers in a bit.
[01:57:14.653 --> 01:57:14.913]  Go ahead.
[01:57:15.793 --> 01:57:19.954]  Alex, these guys can be sued under the racketeering charges.
[01:57:19.954 --> 01:57:31.637]  That's what I said earlier, because they're colluding with other big groups, censor us, shut up our speech, they label us subhuman like the Nazis did, then they come shut us down, they're wide open.
[01:57:31.637 --> 01:57:33.038]  You need to come to Washington.
[01:57:33.038 --> 01:57:38.899]  You need to sit down with Brendan Sullivan and Steve Bannon and you need to do this this week, before your Sunday show.
[01:57:38.899 --> 01:57:41.320]  The other thing that occurred to me is where do we donate?
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.564]  Like, I mean, you know, if I don't want to buy something, where can I donate money to Alex Jones?
[01:57:46.564 --> 01:57:47.304]  That's right.
[01:57:47.304 --> 01:57:55.831]  Let's create a PayPal link or credit card link on every page to pull down, like when you go to someplace, they say, oh, donate to this or that, add 10% or add a dollar.
[01:57:55.831 --> 01:57:57.272]  Let's put that on everything.
[01:57:57.272 --> 01:57:59.834]  People want to donate to the Free Speech Defense Fund.
[01:57:59.834 --> 01:58:08.781]  Hell, I already launched an organization, which I haven't even announced yet, the CDFS, Coalition to Defend Free Speech, dot com.
[01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:11.523]  I mean, I had them set this up months ago because I knew this was coming, my friend.
[01:58:13.959 --> 01:58:15.040]  Come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:15.761]  Come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:15.761 --> 01:58:17.683]  You need to sue these people for $25 million to $100 million.
[01:58:17.683 --> 01:58:17.844]  Period.
[01:58:17.844 --> 01:58:19.085]  And you need to do it this week.
[01:58:24.209 --> 01:58:25.550]  Well, they're trying to bankrupt us.
[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:26.070]  That's the thing.
[01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:29.972]  As they say in the news, they want to ban everybody to shut us up.
[01:58:29.972 --> 01:58:31.293]  I mean, hell, what's next?
[01:58:31.293 --> 01:58:32.914]  Arrest us once we don't have a voice?
[01:58:32.914 --> 01:58:39.638]  Yeah, but the good news is if every one of your listeners donated $10, you can cover that $3 million in a week.
[01:58:39.638 --> 01:58:40.038]  Exactly.
[01:58:40.038 --> 01:58:43.460]  But they need to be sued to protect everybody else because they're picking me as a precedent.
[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:50.424]  This is a bold... It was national news when Kellogg pulled their money from the same group and other groups just from Breitbart.
[01:58:50.424 --> 01:58:51.525]  I mean, this is 50 times better.
[01:58:51.525 --> 01:58:52.966]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:58:53.146 --> 01:58:59.751]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:58:59.751 --> 01:59:02.913]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslides.com.
[01:59:02.913 --> 01:59:12.699]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:59:12.699 --> 01:59:13.540]  Caveman.
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:18.603]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:59:18.603 --> 01:59:20.705]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:59:21.005 --> 01:59:24.146]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:59:24.146 --> 01:59:29.288]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:59:29.288 --> 01:59:37.451]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:59:37.451 --> 01:59:45.294]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:59:45.294 --> 01:59:50.036]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself, and 4WarsLive.com today.
[01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:56.278]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.623 --> 02:00:04.865]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:00:04.865 --> 02:00:06.646]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:00:06.646 --> 02:00:08.928]  Across the deserts bare, man.
[02:00:08.928 --> 02:00:10.830]  I've breathed the mountain air, man.
[02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:13.072]  I've traveled like I had my share, man.
[02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:15.333]  I've been everywhere.
[02:00:15.333 --> 02:00:17.835]  The world is a dangerous place.
[02:00:17.835 --> 02:00:23.000]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.304]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.564 --> 02:00:34.151]  There's a lot of news I didn't get to because I've just been, not hysterical, but just saddened that they're doing it again.
[02:00:34.151 --> 02:00:36.434]  They're openly calling for all this censorship.
[02:00:36.434 --> 02:00:39.358]  What Robert David Steele points out is absolutely perfect.
[02:00:39.358 --> 02:00:40.420]  We need to just have a drop-down.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:43.303]  We're already buying something at InfoWarsTore.com to add $1, $10, $20 for free speech defense.
[02:00:46.167 --> 02:00:47.729]  But I've just found folks respond better.
[02:00:47.729 --> 02:00:49.712]  We just say, hey, get the product, support us.
[02:00:49.712 --> 02:00:51.915]  But yeah, solid up donations are great.
[02:00:51.915 --> 02:00:58.504]  If I fly to D.C., meet with lawyers, mess with all this, just the time and the stories I can't cover and the things I do.
[02:00:59.827 --> 02:01:02.208]  I tend to not worry about us because it's a war.
[02:01:02.208 --> 02:01:04.129]  I'm affecting the big battle with you.
[02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.669]  But it's true.
[02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:07.450]  If we don't protect ourselves, no one's protected.
[02:01:07.450 --> 02:01:09.771]  So Robert David Steele, I was cutting you off during the break.
[02:01:09.771 --> 02:01:10.572]  I want to point something out.
[02:01:10.572 --> 02:01:14.053]  You're a highly decorated Marine, former CIA case officer on the go.
[02:01:14.053 --> 02:01:14.773]  Yeah, you are.
[02:01:14.773 --> 02:01:18.075]  The point is, is that no page ever says they were decorated.
[02:01:20.388 --> 02:01:25.612]  We have another patriot coming on the show who's exposing all this information.
[02:01:25.612 --> 02:01:32.659]  There's a documentary filmmaker and a lawyer, Mike Cernovich, and it's liberals, conservatives, it's everybody coming together, speaking out.
[02:01:32.659 --> 02:01:36.803]  The answer to this censorship is for all of us to get more vocal.
[02:01:36.803 --> 02:01:37.544]  What else do we do?
[02:01:40.731 --> 02:01:48.339]  You know, I have obviously thought about this a lot, Alex, and I hate to keep harping on this, but I used to be about intelligence reform.
[02:01:48.339 --> 02:01:56.047]  And then I realized when Steyer said that he spent 75 million bribing congressmen and couldn't get any action on climate reform.
[02:01:56.047 --> 02:01:59.151]  That's when I realized that electoral reform is root.
[02:01:59.711 --> 02:02:07.313]  Unless we, the people, and I mean all of us, left, right, center, and the 47% that did not vote.
[02:02:07.313 --> 02:02:11.874]  That 47% is Donald Trump's ace in the hole.
[02:02:11.874 --> 02:02:21.136]  He can mobilize that 47% with what he does so well if he goes on the road with Cynthia McKinney and Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and myself and a few others.
[02:02:22.276 --> 02:02:28.641]  Alex, this is about taking the country back at the grassroots level, but you have to give them something to want.
[02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:30.322]  And that's the Electoral Reform Act.
[02:02:30.322 --> 02:02:34.906]  So I think Steve Bannon needs to come out and meet you and me outside the White House.
[02:02:34.906 --> 02:02:36.347]  The White House is bugged.
[02:02:36.347 --> 02:02:38.429]  There is no privacy in the White House.
[02:02:38.429 --> 02:02:42.332]  Bannon needs to come out and meet some patriots and have a game plan.
[02:02:42.332 --> 02:02:43.933]  And I've written it out on my memo for Trump.
[02:02:44.013 --> 02:02:44.854]  No, no, I understand that.
[02:02:44.854 --> 02:02:50.717]  Everybody wants to get the message out to the President, and I understand, but it's really our audience that ends up going to the rallies, talking to the President.
[02:02:50.717 --> 02:03:00.983]  It's why it's good for him to get out, see the crowds, talk to them, interface with them, because, again, Trump, none of us are perfect, but Trump really does want to empower the people.
[02:03:00.983 --> 02:03:09.108]  The best website for folks to visit, I guess, with yours is robertdavidsteele.com or PHIBetaIota.net.
[02:03:09.108 --> 02:03:10.129]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:12.451]  Oh, Alex, you're a hero.
[02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:13.553]  I really support you.
[02:03:13.553 --> 02:03:18.617]  And please, for goodness sakes, make this a $100 million lawsuit.
[02:03:18.617 --> 02:03:19.919]  You owe this to the country.
[02:03:19.919 --> 02:03:20.579]  No, we have to.
[02:03:20.579 --> 02:03:21.620]  And thank you.
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:21.941]  God bless.
[02:03:23.288 --> 02:03:28.689]  Because if we don't, they just can go put anybody on a lift and say you're a bad person and then just ban you.
[02:03:28.689 --> 02:03:31.890]  I mean, they're already not letting gun shops have bank accounts with major banks.
[02:03:31.890 --> 02:03:35.531]  They're already... This is how they put us in these little reservations.
[02:03:35.531 --> 02:03:37.331]  This is how they bully us and control us.
[02:03:37.331 --> 02:03:39.111]  This is the true fascism.
[02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.312]  This is the true oppression.
[02:03:40.312 --> 02:03:45.873]  And then they've got Nadler on TV saying, pass laws or resolutions to ban Trump's speech.
[02:03:45.873 --> 02:03:48.113]  It's fascist to criticize the media.
[02:03:48.113 --> 02:03:50.814]  And then he comes out, Trump comes out and quotes Thomas Jefferson.
[02:03:52.165 --> 02:03:57.713]  So you can't believe a word that's in the newspaper, and the media says, oh he's lying, the full quote said more.
[02:03:57.713 --> 02:04:00.577]  He goes, yeah, a free press paraphrasing.
[02:04:00.577 --> 02:04:02.660]  Let's pull it up, the full quote.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.004]  Thomas Jefferson, you can't believe a word you read in the newspaper.
[02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:08.289]  The full quote to paraphrase was, let me see how good my memory is.
[02:04:09.924 --> 02:04:14.789]  A press, a free press is key and critical to any open and good society.
[02:04:14.789 --> 02:04:21.495]  But the incredible deception and prostitute behavior of the press makes it the biggest enemy of the press in our country.
[02:04:21.495 --> 02:04:23.957]  So you can't believe a word that's in it.
[02:04:23.957 --> 02:04:24.978]  So it's worse than that.
[02:04:24.978 --> 02:04:33.226]  Trump could have said... Thomas Jefferson called the media, media whores that discredit themselves and the country at the same time.
[02:04:33.226 --> 02:04:34.747]  There it is.
[02:04:34.747 --> 02:04:35.027]  It is...
[02:04:36.232 --> 02:04:46.456]  Melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not more completely deprive the nation of its benefits than is done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood.
[02:04:46.456 --> 02:04:49.317]  Nothing can now be believed which has seen a newspaper.
[02:04:49.317 --> 02:04:53.559]  Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.
[02:04:53.559 --> 02:04:55.940]  So see, it's worse than what Trump said.
[02:04:57.645 --> 02:05:00.948]  Thomas Jefferson went further calling them whores.
[02:05:00.948 --> 02:05:09.534]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[02:05:09.534 --> 02:05:18.121]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[02:05:18.121 --> 02:05:22.965]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[02:05:23.565 --> 02:05:40.574]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia, and the deep states declared war on President Trump, condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity, one has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[02:05:40.574 --> 02:05:52.881]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities, and even shoot downs of Russian jets, if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[02:05:53.341 --> 02:05:58.282]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[02:05:58.282 --> 02:06:01.062]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[02:06:01.062 --> 02:06:02.903]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.903 --> 02:06:09.504]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:09.504 --> 02:06:12.684]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:12.684 --> 02:06:22.066]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[02:06:22.446 --> 02:06:23.287]  Caveman.
[02:06:23.287 --> 02:06:28.370]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:30.791]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:30.791 --> 02:06:33.934]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.934 --> 02:06:36.195]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[02:06:36.195 --> 02:06:39.077]  But you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:39.077 --> 02:06:44.440]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.802]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:47.202 --> 02:06:55.153]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:55.153 --> 02:06:59.819]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself, and forwardslife.com today.
[02:07:00.506 --> 02:07:01.326]  Hey, everyone!
[02:07:01.326 --> 02:07:03.607]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:07:03.607 --> 02:07:07.448]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:07.448 --> 02:07:09.528]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:09.528 --> 02:07:19.811]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:19.811 --> 02:07:25.772]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:26.252 --> 02:07:41.169]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:07:41.169 --> 02:07:41.649]  Thank you.
[02:08:11.542 --> 02:08:16.424]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:08:16.424 --> 02:08:21.647]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.647 --> 02:08:28.450]  Well, the last four years, Matt Drudge, who runs the biggest news site in the world, has only given one interview.
[02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:29.331]  And that was the InfoWars.com.
[02:08:29.331 --> 02:08:32.272]  It was in October of 2015, he came here, unannounced.
[02:08:37.734 --> 02:08:59.939]  Basically in a disguise, as they follow him around everywhere, to say that he had met with a Supreme Court Justice, he told me by name, who told him the whole plan with regulations and internet shutdown and control of free speech and going after sponsors to actually codify into law a system to quote, ban alternative views as fake news.
[02:08:59.939 --> 02:09:01.500]  And notice it all started happening.
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.440]  But then Donald Trump got in in the middle of it.
[02:09:04.485 --> 02:09:07.968]  Now, I've followed Mike Cernovich's work for about a year or so.
[02:09:07.968 --> 02:09:11.291]  Paul Watson's obviously a huge fan.
[02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:17.516]  And he's a lawyer, feature-length film on free speech, a silenced producer.
[02:09:18.912 --> 02:09:21.734]  He is, again, a documentary filmmaker.
[02:09:21.734 --> 02:09:27.178]  He's written three books, produced a documentary on media hoaxes, and is producing a second documentary on free speech culture in the West.
[02:09:27.178 --> 02:09:30.080]  His books have over 1,000 reviews on Amazon and Audible.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:31.861]  His podcast has five stars.
[02:09:31.861 --> 02:09:35.504]  But the reason I want to get him on is we need more people like this guy to be mega-prominent.
[02:09:35.504 --> 02:09:37.445]  He's prominent, we need him to be mega-prominent.
[02:09:37.445 --> 02:09:41.768]  Because if you knew the behind-the-scenes stuff, they're not just censoring us and shutting stuff down.
[02:09:41.768 --> 02:09:45.371]  I mean, let me tell you, it's a war zone.
[02:09:46.269 --> 02:09:50.692]  Okay, a war zone.
[02:09:50.692 --> 02:09:53.034]  This country is in a civil war.
[02:09:53.034 --> 02:10:00.820]  They're openly calling to kill Trump all over the news, trying to organize his assassination.
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:07.285]  Normally I get these calls and I can't go on air with them because people talk about it and then they get cold feet.
[02:10:07.285 --> 02:10:14.631]  But I had the former vice chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and the Armed Services Committee this morning
[02:10:16.158 --> 02:10:31.861]  In a phone call from New York, let's just say meeting with some people, with our investigative journalist, Dr. Corsi, and they decided to just go ahead and release, in the next 48 hours, Hillary and the Communist Chinese and the Russian connection.
[02:10:31.861 --> 02:10:35.382]  And I was, you know, just saying, hey, you know, we'll see.
[02:10:35.382 --> 02:10:36.903]  We're getting intel from Kurt Weldon.
[02:10:36.903 --> 02:10:38.383]  He went ahead and just came on the show.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:50.827]  Earlier in the first hour he talked about how his family was threatened ten years ago and so he kind of backed off of it but now he's done and that he's going to release it because there's no connections to Trump and the Russians.
[02:10:50.827 --> 02:10:52.067]  Hillary's on the payroll.
[02:10:52.067 --> 02:10:55.410]  And I want to be clear, we're not saying we're enemies with the Russians.
[02:10:55.410 --> 02:10:57.311]  We need to reset a real one.
[02:10:57.311 --> 02:11:02.674]  If the Clintons could be sold out of the Communist Chinese, who are 90% of it, or the Russians, that's what they're supposed to do.
[02:11:02.674 --> 02:11:07.077]  And if our intelligence agencies can go over there and get the Russians to sell us, you know, their oil for less or whatever, we should.
[02:11:07.077 --> 02:11:08.418]  That's what your country's for you.
[02:11:10.305 --> 02:11:13.567]  And it's interest not, you know, not for the globalists.
[02:11:13.567 --> 02:11:30.477]  But that's where we've gotten as a society and as a culture that AdRoll, that's a Google front company, basically, from my research, so they don't get the liability, just says, oh, you've been with us two and a half years, and your revenue went a million dollars, two million dollars, 3.3 million dollars.
[02:11:30.477 --> 02:11:33.979]  We're just banning you because you're fake news and you aren't real.
[02:11:33.979 --> 02:11:35.780]  And they're not showing us what's fake?
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:36.820]  Not showing us what we did?
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:38.101]  They approve our ads?
[02:11:38.101 --> 02:11:39.182]  Our ads aren't even political?
[02:11:43.243 --> 02:11:47.647]  And we're, Paul Watts has got an article coming out, we've got screenshots of where they told me all this.
[02:11:47.647 --> 02:11:48.948]  I'm going to get back to it in a minute.
[02:11:48.948 --> 02:11:55.094]  I did, when I set up a free speech expert, Mike Cernovich, you know, a week ago, trying to get him on, it wasn't because we knew this was going to happen today.
[02:11:55.094 --> 02:11:58.577]  The letters labeled today.
[02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.480]  And Reddit censors pro-Trump content in new crackdown.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.765]  And then they're on the news saying, you know, the New York Times is saying, you need to do more Facebook to ban the right wing.
[02:12:07.998 --> 02:12:15.939]  Folks, when they can organize as a group and say, you're discredited, you're not real, and then ban your access to the public, that is so authoritarian.
[02:12:15.939 --> 02:12:17.800]  That's right out of Nazi Germany.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.780]  Right out of the Soviet Union.
[02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:20.780]  So, it's here.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:24.021]  So, I'm doing a 13-hour live transmission at 11 a.m.
[02:12:24.021 --> 02:12:25.101]  tomorrow, kicking off.
[02:12:25.101 --> 02:12:27.082]  Paul's going to be on the show as well.
[02:12:27.082 --> 02:12:31.242]  Doing a Reddit Ask Me Anything, because the censorship's here.
[02:12:31.242 --> 02:12:33.703]  I was already going to go on Reddit about Reddit censorship.
[02:12:33.703 --> 02:12:34.643]  That's why I was going to do it!
[02:12:35.874 --> 02:12:36.754]  And now it's here.
[02:12:36.754 --> 02:12:38.775]  So they're testing, they're pushing.
[02:12:38.775 --> 02:12:42.697]  And as libertarians, as free market patriots, we don't tend to bitch.
[02:12:42.697 --> 02:12:45.898]  We don't tend to complain when somebody blocks us or discriminates against us.
[02:12:45.898 --> 02:12:46.839]  We move around them.
[02:12:46.839 --> 02:12:47.659]  But here's the deal.
[02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:50.260]  They're doing this to us to set the precedent for everybody.
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:54.462]  So Mike Cernovich, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:12:54.462 --> 02:13:00.804]  It's great to see your work and all the things you do on Twitter and, you know, the articles you're putting out and the rest of it.
[02:13:00.804 --> 02:13:01.745]  Danger at play.
[02:13:02.885 --> 02:13:09.271]  I want to get into Milo as well because, again, they knew the stuff about Milo.
[02:13:09.271 --> 02:13:09.931]  Why'd they wait?
[02:13:09.931 --> 02:13:10.652]  Why'd they invite him?
[02:13:10.652 --> 02:13:11.272]  To get rid of him.
[02:13:11.272 --> 02:13:12.533]  To create a chilling effect.
[02:13:12.533 --> 02:13:15.015]  To create a domino effect of shutting down free speech.
[02:13:15.015 --> 02:13:16.277]  He's a sex abuse victim.
[02:13:16.277 --> 02:13:18.038]  I want to go after the folks that actually did it.
[02:13:18.038 --> 02:13:27.306]  But see, this is all about intimidating the superstars of the nationalist awakening globally.
[02:13:27.306 --> 02:13:28.487]  They're sharpening their knives.
[02:13:28.487 --> 02:13:29.027]  They're testing.
[02:13:29.027 --> 02:13:29.748]  That's my view.
[02:13:29.748 --> 02:13:30.789]  What does Mike Cernovich say?
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.763]  Yeah, this is a deep state operation that I was warned about a couple of months ago.
[02:13:36.763 --> 02:13:44.007]  They told me that intelligence agencies are actually now leaking our information through people via Twitter.
[02:13:44.007 --> 02:13:46.568]  So all these doxxings happening online.
[02:13:46.568 --> 02:13:49.690]  These are deep state operations by the intelligence communities.
[02:13:49.690 --> 02:13:52.592]  It's a full-scale character assassination on anybody
[02:13:53.152 --> 02:13:57.634]  Who is bringing young voters to Trump or even waking young voters up.
[02:13:57.634 --> 02:14:06.478]  One thing that fell under the radar of a lot of people because he isn't political, but that YouTube star Felix, who his username is PewDiePie or something.
[02:14:06.478 --> 02:14:09.119]  Oh yeah, number one guy on YouTube, not even political.
[02:14:09.119 --> 02:14:11.460]  They want to debate a test destroying him.
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.220]  It's all a beta test.
[02:14:13.206 --> 02:14:13.927]  Yep.
[02:14:13.927 --> 02:14:15.169]  Yeah, so they went after him.
[02:14:15.169 --> 02:14:18.333]  He was prime target because he's too influential.
[02:14:18.333 --> 02:14:27.826]  You got to realize Alex, well you realize this of course, the next election is going to be about YouTube endorsements rather than caring about whether some idiot
[02:14:28.386 --> 02:14:33.229]  A politician or some conservative endorses you, you're going to want YouTube people endorsing you.
[02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:36.811]  You're going to want the social media stars and celebrities endorsing you.
[02:14:36.811 --> 02:14:40.173]  So right now it's a full-scale assassination on all of us.
[02:14:40.173 --> 02:14:42.174]  And you were always the target.
[02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:43.415]  I've been told I was the target.
[02:14:43.415 --> 02:14:45.296]  Paul Joseph Watson is the target.
[02:14:45.296 --> 02:14:51.299]  And they've told me, and this is the highest levels of government, sources at the highest levels that told me, you better watch out, man.
[02:14:51.299 --> 02:14:52.540]  You better be careful.
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:54.081]  You better never be in the same room.
[02:14:54.461 --> 02:14:56.401]  Was someone where somebody could say that you did something?
[02:14:56.401 --> 02:14:56.862]  Absolutely.
[02:14:56.862 --> 02:14:59.742]  In fact, I was, I mean, I mean, take the PewDiePie thing.
[02:14:59.742 --> 02:15:02.383]  Number one, 54 million subscribers.
[02:15:02.383 --> 02:15:11.565]  His mistake in the last month was, notice, we tracked this, he began to review Paul Watson videos and other videos, and he was making him even more popular.
[02:15:11.565 --> 02:15:16.406]  They saw him as a vector point to spread the awakening of the youth, so they blew him away.
[02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:19.311]  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:22.192]  It was a total deep state operation.
[02:15:22.192 --> 02:15:24.694]  And you saw this too, they went after Milo.
[02:15:24.694 --> 02:15:29.697]  As you know, the Reagan battalion was an unknown, obscure social media account.
[02:15:29.697 --> 02:15:30.777]  They couldn't get one retweet.
[02:15:30.777 --> 02:15:32.718]  It's a neocon fake conservative brigade.
[02:15:32.718 --> 02:15:34.119]  Let's talk about that.
[02:15:34.119 --> 02:15:34.660]  Yeah.
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.722]  So why is Jake Taper, how does Jake Taper know about some Twitter account?
[02:15:39.144 --> 02:15:42.185]  Call the Reagan Brigade that I've never even heard of, right?
[02:15:42.185 --> 02:15:42.926]  This was Quark.
[02:15:42.926 --> 02:15:44.447]  He's Jake Taper's deep state.
[02:15:44.447 --> 02:15:46.488]  I think that you've mentioned that before, too.
[02:15:46.488 --> 02:15:51.170]  He's been well known to have CIA operative connections and he pushed his... I mean, I mean, Anderson Cooper is CIA.
[02:15:52.406 --> 02:15:53.187]  Right.
[02:15:53.187 --> 02:15:54.908]  So CNN is loaded with them.
[02:15:54.908 --> 02:16:03.574]  So what they figured out how to do now is they're creating shell social media accounts, which we saw David Brock do with Correct the Record, George Soros is doing.
[02:16:03.574 --> 02:16:09.959]  Well, now the deep state has a bunch of shell social media accounts that they're building up and they're laundering information
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:18.782]  I mean, just so you know, I personally have been dealing with this.
[02:16:18.782 --> 02:16:22.683]  I mean, I don't want to talk about it on air, but it's, like I said, it's beyond a movie.
[02:16:22.683 --> 02:16:26.984]  I mean, if people knew how criminal this was, they would be, are you kidding me?
[02:16:26.984 --> 02:16:29.845]  I mean, it is, it is, it is unbelievably aggressive.
[02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:40.899]  Yeah, I've told people that I don't lie to people, but I'm still not telling the full truth, because if I told everybody what was really going on, they wouldn't believe me.
[02:16:40.899 --> 02:16:47.525]  Tell us about yourself, because you're a lawyer and a filmmaker, but you've gone from reaching millions a month to millions every few days.
[02:16:47.525 --> 02:16:55.652]  You're exponentially growing, so they see that graph, you know, it's like the New York Times said, you know, basically attacked me, I'm evil, I should be shut down, and then they cut off our funding the next day.
[02:16:55.652 --> 02:16:56.813]  I mean, this is in real time now.
[02:16:57.890 --> 02:17:02.737]  Oh yeah exactly and what they've learned too is I've learned the deep state is coordinated.
[02:17:02.737 --> 02:17:09.345]  They get people on ad revenue because people here's what I don't like about our team because they don't really understand what's really going on.
[02:17:09.345 --> 02:17:12.009]  We say well Google is a private company they can do what they want.
[02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:18.132]  No, it's racketeering because they consortium and work with other groups and then dehumanize us.
[02:17:18.132 --> 02:17:26.196]  Google can't say we're not going to sell to black people or Muslims, but how can they suddenly say conservatives or libertarians and then just dehumanize us?
[02:17:26.196 --> 02:17:27.757]  Isn't it a racketeering discrimination?
[02:17:28.635 --> 02:17:30.496]  Yeah, and they're coordinating with the government, too.
[02:17:30.496 --> 02:17:31.997]  Google isn't a private company.
[02:17:31.997 --> 02:17:35.640]  This is all being coordinated with their intelligence operatives, the State Department.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:43.886]  And they think Trump's dumb and can't control or understand all this, and Priebus is working with him, clearly, and so while Trump tries to change things, his own government's working against him.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:51.245]  Yeah, Race Prevost has been the source of all the White House leaks, as you know, and as I've reported and others have reported.
[02:17:51.245 --> 02:17:54.407]  They really went after General Flynn because he actually cared about Trump.
[02:17:54.407 --> 02:17:57.630]  General Flynn cared about Trump, cared about the base.
[02:17:57.630 --> 02:17:59.171]  They're going after Kellyanne Conway.
[02:17:59.171 --> 02:18:04.455]  But what they realized is that it isn't enough to go after the Trump's official team.
[02:18:04.455 --> 02:18:07.718]  They now have to go after anybody who's a big people.
[02:18:07.718 --> 02:18:08.739]  I'm sure you've heard this.
[02:18:08.739 --> 02:18:09.599]  I hear it every day.
[02:18:09.599 --> 02:18:11.261]  Mike, I never cared about politics.
[02:18:11.921 --> 02:18:14.002]  I read your stuff and then I voted for Trump.
[02:18:14.002 --> 02:18:17.384]  These are 19, 20, 21, 22 year old people.
[02:18:17.384 --> 02:18:21.405]  This is a real problem for deep state that we are bringing in youth.
[02:18:21.405 --> 02:18:23.767]  60% of my audience is under 30.
[02:18:23.767 --> 02:18:24.827]  This is crazy.
[02:18:24.827 --> 02:18:25.467]  Absolutely.
[02:18:25.467 --> 02:18:26.788]  In fact, I mean, look, look, look.
[02:18:27.088 --> 02:18:29.611]  I mean, we had demographics from Google numbers 15 years ago.
[02:18:29.611 --> 02:18:32.253]  70% were above 45.
[02:18:32.253 --> 02:18:35.036]  Then it went where it was like, you know, 18 to 45.
[02:18:35.036 --> 02:18:40.482]  Now, a huge part of our audience, 30-40%, is like 11 to, say, 20.
[02:18:40.482 --> 02:18:46.768]  And it's even better for Watson, yourself, you know, many, many others, you know, that are out there.
[02:18:46.768 --> 02:18:47.189]  What's his name?
[02:18:47.189 --> 02:18:48.270]  Gavin McGinnis.
[02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:49.191]  That's what's scaring them.
[02:18:50.526 --> 02:18:52.369]  Oh no, yeah, they're terrified.
[02:18:52.369 --> 02:18:58.358]  Because even to some extent they're going to go after Sheriff Clark Hart too, even though his demographic's a little bit older.
[02:18:58.358 --> 02:18:59.640]  He's become too powerful.
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.186]  Well he's manly, he's smart, he's good looking, he's John Wayne.
[02:19:03.186 --> 02:19:04.107]  He's a black John Wayne.
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:05.280]  Right.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.721]  So he is in the crosshairs, too.
[02:19:06.721 --> 02:19:09.723]  So I was given a list of the people who are on the hit list.
[02:19:09.723 --> 02:19:12.265]  And I mentioned this a year ago and people go, Mike, you're crazy.
[02:19:12.265 --> 02:19:15.147]  I talked to Milo when I met with him in Alaska.
[02:19:15.147 --> 02:19:18.769]  And I said, hey, Milo, you know, you're about to be framed for something, don't you?
[02:19:18.769 --> 02:19:20.851]  And he goes, oh, honey, don't worry about me.
[02:19:20.851 --> 02:19:21.771]  It's no big deal.
[02:19:21.771 --> 02:19:23.352]  And I go, no, I have intelligence.
[02:19:23.352 --> 02:19:24.773]  Trust me, they're going to come after you.
[02:19:24.773 --> 02:19:26.214]  By the way, I've got Milo's number.
[02:19:26.214 --> 02:19:27.195]  I talked to him some.
[02:19:27.195 --> 02:19:30.097]  I just I have this tendency with somebody who's under attack to kind of let him have space.
[02:19:30.097 --> 02:19:31.498]  But I'm going to call him after the show.
[02:19:31.498 --> 02:19:32.759]  And I had to really think about this.
[02:19:32.759 --> 02:19:34.700]  He got raped when he was a teenager.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.243]  He made the point, well okay, name me who I am, that's kind of Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:19:39.243 --> 02:19:42.386]  I'm not saying all gays come from being raped.
[02:19:42.386 --> 02:19:45.608]  The point is there is a connection there, but he's not the bad guy.
[02:19:45.608 --> 02:19:47.409]  He's never advocated pedophilia.
[02:19:47.409 --> 02:19:54.395]  They set all this up, again, to clearly... So, ask the Republicans why they embraced him, but then...
[02:19:54.895 --> 02:19:58.838]  Knowing all this, this was a controversy three years ago, why are they taking him down now?
[02:19:58.838 --> 02:20:07.283]  Again, because the Republican establishment with the Democrats wants to discipline Trump's support base and cow them into submission and it's not going to happen.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:15.626]  Well, it's the same reason that the local police departments in San Jose and in Berkeley, they let Trump supporters get beat up.
[02:20:15.626 --> 02:20:17.587]  You want to talk about a police state?
[02:20:17.587 --> 02:20:22.851]  What they figured out now is they will run black bloc because it's a CIA operation.
[02:20:22.851 --> 02:20:25.153]  People don't know this, and of course, and people won't believe it.
[02:20:26.735 --> 02:20:29.478]  The Black Bloc first appeared in 1998.
[02:20:29.478 --> 02:20:32.021]  They were trained by the Delta Force at a university in Oregon.
[02:20:32.021 --> 02:20:35.045]  I have all the footage in my film, The Takeover, Police Day 2.
[02:20:35.045 --> 02:20:39.270]  They were trained and then released to demonize peaceful protestors that were anti-globalist.
[02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:41.213]  And that was all even the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:20:42.406 --> 02:20:46.267]  Yeah, and you talked about that in Joe Rogan, actually.
[02:20:46.267 --> 02:20:53.489]  You think about it, the liberals really understood the dangers of free trade and globalism before the right did.
[02:20:53.489 --> 02:21:01.191]  So what had to happen is the CIA trained people to run false flag operations to attack anybody who was against a globalist operation.
[02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:04.751]  The same thing with Occupy Wall Street, which started off very effective.
[02:21:04.751 --> 02:21:06.312]  Wall Street was very, very nervous.
[02:21:06.952 --> 02:21:12.418]  So the black box CIA operatives went in, of course, and had to disrupt Occupy Wall Street.
[02:21:12.418 --> 02:21:16.322]  And now these same people are being used by police departments.
[02:21:16.322 --> 02:21:20.006]  They're getting stand-down orders so that we can be beaten up now.
[02:21:22.188 --> 02:21:24.369]  We even infiltrated their groups three times.
[02:21:24.369 --> 02:21:31.611]  The UT has this multicultural board that has meetings where they actually swear people in as a Politburo.
[02:21:31.611 --> 02:21:44.955]  They're all malice and they give commands to the commies that then go out and beat people up and attack the Blue Cat Cafe and go attack people at abortion rallies, anti-abortion rallies, and then they are being set up as a new police board review.
[02:21:44.955 --> 02:21:48.596]  So literally the dirtiest drug addict head, you know, you know,
[02:21:49.216 --> 02:21:54.898]  Kami's scum are literally run by the University of Texas and the big mega banks.
[02:21:54.898 --> 02:21:55.818]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:55.818 --> 02:21:56.698]  And they're everywhere.
[02:21:56.698 --> 02:21:57.758]  Their tentacles are everywhere.
[02:21:57.758 --> 02:21:59.619]  Their tentacles are on the White House.
[02:21:59.619 --> 02:22:01.659]  Trump, as you know, he's a good man.
[02:22:01.659 --> 02:22:06.760]  He's too good for politics because he doesn't understand how evil and duplicitous his people are.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:08.861]  He's used to the business world where... There you go.
[02:22:08.861 --> 02:22:09.801]  In fact, I was about to say this.
[02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:10.721]  Let me bring this up.
[02:22:10.721 --> 02:22:12.062]  He's not Machiavelli.
[02:22:13.262 --> 02:22:14.283]  Until you attack him.
[02:22:14.283 --> 02:22:18.124]  And he's there saying, if I'm going to make the elite even more money, why are they bitching?
[02:22:18.124 --> 02:22:19.325]  Why do we have one-sided deals?
[02:22:19.325 --> 02:22:20.745]  Why do we ought to get America?
[02:22:20.745 --> 02:22:21.906]  We've made a lot of bad deals.
[02:22:21.906 --> 02:22:23.867]  We've had politicians sell us out.
[02:22:23.867 --> 02:22:25.767]  I'm going to make a better deal.
[02:22:25.767 --> 02:22:26.968]  But see, he doesn't get it.
[02:22:26.968 --> 02:22:29.069]  They wanted to destroy us to begin with.
[02:22:29.069 --> 02:22:30.509]  He's starting to get it.
[02:22:30.509 --> 02:22:33.590]  And that's why they're so freaked out, because he listens to certain shows.
[02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:34.631]  He goes to Drudge Report.
[02:22:34.991 --> 02:22:35.812]  He's late at night.
[02:22:35.812 --> 02:22:37.613]  He now listens to the show.
[02:22:37.613 --> 02:22:38.854]  That's the big freak out.
[02:22:38.854 --> 02:22:40.555]  That's why they're so pissed at me.
[02:22:40.555 --> 02:22:45.399]  And I mean, that's why they're melting down is because we have Trump.
[02:22:45.399 --> 02:22:45.959]  I don't see.
[02:22:45.959 --> 02:22:50.202]  I mean, let's talk about that, though, because where do you looking into the future see this going?
[02:22:50.202 --> 02:22:54.705]  Because they're exponentially every week intensifying the censorship, the attacks.
[02:22:54.705 --> 02:22:55.186]  What do we do?
[02:22:56.778 --> 02:23:01.682]  Yeah, we have definitely, we've woken up so many people that were a real threat.
[02:23:01.682 --> 02:23:13.113]  Another thing Trump does is, I've heard from his people, that they watch Paul Joseph Watson's Twitter, my Twitter, Stefan Molyneux's Twitter, to get a sentiment of what people are actually believing.
[02:23:13.113 --> 02:23:15.455]  And that is another reason why the fake news media...
[02:23:15.635 --> 02:23:21.021]  I was told by two different high-level Trump people in DC, they said, they said, listen, Paul Watson's number one everywhere.
[02:23:21.021 --> 02:23:22.102]  He doesn't even know that.
[02:23:22.102 --> 02:23:23.183]  Why does he do speaking engagements?
[02:23:23.183 --> 02:23:24.464]  We want him as a press secretary.
[02:23:24.464 --> 02:23:27.267]  The media all lied about it and said it wasn't true.
[02:23:27.267 --> 02:23:29.549]  But they're, I mean, they're watching him.
[02:23:29.549 --> 02:23:32.092]  They're looking at him as a focus group every day.
[02:23:33.291 --> 02:23:34.072]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:34.072 --> 02:23:36.294]  Talk about having the finger on the pulse.
[02:23:36.294 --> 02:23:37.875]  That's the beauty of it.
[02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:42.539]  People like Paul Joseph Watts and me, they read all of our replies.
[02:23:42.539 --> 02:23:43.359]  They get ideas.
[02:23:43.359 --> 02:23:45.041]  We'll say, here's what Trump should do.
[02:23:45.041 --> 02:23:48.624]  And then magically, one or two days later, that'll happen.
[02:23:48.624 --> 02:23:51.046]  So there are a lot of good guys in the administration.
[02:23:51.046 --> 02:23:55.470]  But one thing that you've done, and Roger Stone, who's a great man, has done, and we have to keep doing,
[02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:58.211]  We cannot be party loyalists.
[02:23:58.211 --> 02:24:00.351]  We have to call out the snakes.
[02:24:00.351 --> 02:24:01.211]  Let's call them out.
[02:24:01.211 --> 02:24:03.932]  Priebus is a total piece of filth.
[02:24:03.932 --> 02:24:06.453]  The Vice President is getting bullied into submission.
[02:24:06.453 --> 02:24:08.593]  So is the National Security Council.
[02:24:08.593 --> 02:24:09.994]  Let's talk about the number one enemy.
[02:24:09.994 --> 02:24:13.775]  I'd say, I disagree with these names, but tell me what you think, would be Paul Ryan.
[02:24:15.177 --> 02:24:15.898]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:15.898 --> 02:24:17.880]  That was always a big threat.
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:20.102]  Unfortunately, he won in Wisconsin.
[02:24:20.102 --> 02:24:21.183]  He never should have.
[02:24:21.183 --> 02:24:28.109]  Mitt Romney and Evan McMuffin, those are the people who are also behind that Reagan battalion and the PSYOP against Milo.
[02:24:28.109 --> 02:24:30.051]  So that was, again, they worked very closely.
[02:24:30.051 --> 02:24:32.133]  Remember they tried to steal Utah?
[02:24:32.133 --> 02:24:36.517]  That was a Paul Ryan... And again, McMullin, CIA himself.
[02:24:36.517 --> 02:24:37.978]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:24:37.978 --> 02:24:40.541]  He's publicly CIA, involved in our elections.
[02:24:41.414 --> 02:24:42.815]  Yes, exactly.
[02:24:42.815 --> 02:24:46.837]  And Rick Wilson, and there's a billionaire who funds all of it.
[02:24:46.837 --> 02:24:57.161]  It's Paul, his last name escapes me, but there's a billionaire sugar daddy who funds Paul Ryan and Evan McMuffin and all these Reagan battalion operations.
[02:24:57.161 --> 02:24:59.482]  His name escapes me right now.
[02:24:59.482 --> 02:25:01.283]  But he's got... I know who it is.
[02:25:01.283 --> 02:25:02.444]  I've been getting phone calls.
[02:25:02.444 --> 02:25:04.545]  These people think I'm even returning their phone calls.
[02:25:04.545 --> 02:25:05.005]  They're crazy.
[02:25:06.892 --> 02:25:09.134]  Yeah, so they're going after everybody harder.
[02:25:09.134 --> 02:25:11.616]  There's going to be more character assassinations.
[02:25:11.616 --> 02:25:19.322]  They want to do, they had it planned, their own little Hitler-esque, the Night of Long Knives, where they wanted to swipe all of us out of social media.
[02:25:19.322 --> 02:25:21.284]  That was Twitter's original plan.
[02:25:21.284 --> 02:25:26.989]  They were just going to get rid of everybody who had an independent voice, but Trump got elected and that destroyed it.
[02:25:27.669 --> 02:25:41.999]  It was going to be their own Hitler-like move where they thought Hillary was going to win and then they were going to get Paul Joseph Watson, me, Stefan Molyneux, you, everybody else on the same night because then there would be too many of us taken out all at once.
[02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:44.781]  The media wouldn't really know how to cover what to talk about.
[02:25:44.781 --> 02:25:53.486]  I was also told that if Hillary Clinton had won, her Secret Service had reported this, that she was going to actually find ways to frame people like you and me of the crime.
[02:25:53.486 --> 02:25:56.188]  I was told to leave the country if Hillary had won.
[02:25:56.188 --> 02:25:57.149]  That's how bad it's getting.
[02:25:58.493 --> 02:26:01.275]  Well, so what do we do to counter this?
[02:26:01.275 --> 02:26:03.297]  What can we do?
[02:26:03.297 --> 02:26:04.898]  We have to keep waking people up.
[02:26:04.898 --> 02:26:07.461]  We have to keep meeting up in real life.
[02:26:07.461 --> 02:26:14.386]  That's why through that Deplorable event, I'm actually having another event, a big, huge networking event in DC this Friday.
[02:26:14.386 --> 02:26:18.850]  We have to unite in real life and we have to rattle our sabers more.
[02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:20.912]  We have to continue being aggressive.
[02:26:20.912 --> 02:26:25.556]  We have to let Trump know that we support him, but that he has been sabotaged.
[02:26:26.156 --> 02:26:29.258]  Every which way, every which way behind him and around him.
[02:26:29.258 --> 02:26:30.819]  We have to be loyal.
[02:26:30.819 --> 02:26:35.802]  When the media goes after Bannon, Stephen Miller, Kellyanne, we know who has Trump's back.
[02:26:35.802 --> 02:26:37.583]  We have to keep fighting for them.
[02:26:37.583 --> 02:26:42.746]  We have to also, we have to keep calling out what is really going on and being brave.
[02:26:42.746 --> 02:26:51.231]  One thing I noticed about you on the Joe Rogan podcast, which by the way, I think that will be written about in history as an inflection point on culture.
[02:26:51.231 --> 02:26:52.952]  Joe knows more than he'll let on.
[02:26:52.952 --> 02:26:53.593]  He's afraid.
[02:26:54.093 --> 02:26:55.995]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[02:26:55.995 --> 02:26:56.795]  Have you talked to him?
[02:26:56.795 --> 02:26:58.337]  How do you know this?
[02:26:58.337 --> 02:27:12.308]  Well, you can watch where he would say things, and if you study body language, as I have, and study influence and marketing and everything that I have, you can tell that his eyes, if you look in his eyes... Well, I was about to tell you he could finish my sentences, but I have some backstory on that.
[02:27:12.308 --> 02:27:15.391]  I'm not gonna... Well, Joe was threatened, okay?
[02:27:15.391 --> 02:27:16.372]  And a long time ago.
[02:27:17.583 --> 02:27:24.485]  And so, so was the congressman I had on today, former head of the Homeland Security Committee, and he finally just said he's done.
[02:27:24.485 --> 02:27:25.825]  And that's what goes on.
[02:27:25.825 --> 02:27:29.827]  And so a lot of people just say, whoa, you know, I don't want to be involved in all this.
[02:27:29.827 --> 02:27:31.447]  And then they even censored that podcast.
[02:27:31.447 --> 02:27:35.228]  So that's what I'm saying is, there's got to be a limit to what these bullies can do.
[02:27:35.228 --> 02:27:41.310]  I mean, they're such scum, they're out beating Trump supporter women up everywhere, and the media is praising it.
[02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:48.721]  How are we ruled by Nancy Pelosi that thinks Bush is president and Maxine Waters that thinks Russia invaded Korea?
[02:27:48.721 --> 02:27:53.168]  I mean, you know, at what point do we put up with these lesser people dominating us?
[02:27:54.008 --> 02:27:55.649]  And here's what must happen.
[02:27:55.649 --> 02:27:59.951]  I've gotten five people arrested for violence against Trump supporters.
[02:27:59.951 --> 02:28:03.913]  Three of them tried to commit an acid terrorist attack at the Deplora Ball.
[02:28:03.913 --> 02:28:04.854]  We got them arrested.
[02:28:04.854 --> 02:28:06.214]  We had a manhunt.
[02:28:06.214 --> 02:28:08.396]  We were planning a lawsuit against the Berkeley people.
[02:28:08.396 --> 02:28:11.657]  Another thing we have to do is the police are on our side.
[02:28:11.657 --> 02:28:18.341]  We have to not... There's this mindset on the right, the conservative mindset, where, oh, let's just take the higher road.
[02:28:18.621 --> 02:28:20.923]  No, we have to get these people in jail.
[02:28:20.923 --> 02:28:28.109]  Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General, must prosecute these people for their political violence, prosecute them as domestic terrorism.
[02:28:28.109 --> 02:28:31.311]  If he doesn't do that, then it will be open season on all of us.
[02:28:31.311 --> 02:28:33.873]  So that is one thing that we have to have happen.
[02:28:33.873 --> 02:28:40.498]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions must prosecute the left-wing domestic terrorists.
[02:28:40.498 --> 02:28:43.461]  Expanding on that, what happens if we don't defeat them?
[02:28:43.461 --> 02:28:45.282]  What happens if we just roll over to these people?
[02:28:45.282 --> 02:28:45.963]  What would they do?
[02:28:47.014 --> 02:28:48.936]  They want to sell your children into slavery.
[02:28:48.936 --> 02:28:52.620]  The real pedophilia, that's another reason.
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:56.143]  Where was Jake Taper talking about Rotherham?
[02:28:56.143 --> 02:29:01.188]  Talking about the 1,400 people that have been arrested in America over the past couple of weeks.
[02:29:01.188 --> 02:29:03.170]  Pedophilia out of Tennessee, Los Angeles.
[02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:10.195]  No real media coverage, but Milo, who is being re-victimized by the media, and by the way, this is something a lot of people don't understand.
[02:29:10.195 --> 02:29:16.339]  The pedophiles are actually using their attacks on Milo as a way to re-victimize him.
[02:29:16.339 --> 02:29:18.301]  So it's actually a sick, sadistic thing.
[02:29:18.701 --> 02:29:19.202]  Exactly.
[02:29:19.202 --> 02:29:20.423]  I thought that last night.
[02:29:20.423 --> 02:29:21.463]  You are so smart.
[02:29:21.463 --> 02:29:21.984]  Stay right there.
[02:29:21.984 --> 02:29:22.985]  That's why Paul loves you so much.
[02:29:22.985 --> 02:29:26.448]  I don't have time to watch a lot of what you do, but everything I see with your tweets are so smart.
[02:29:26.448 --> 02:29:27.148]  That's it.
[02:29:27.148 --> 02:29:40.700]  You turn it into saying pedophilia is like consensual gay sex to make them look like victims and then make his destruction as a quote pedophile when he's not one, this big cause celeb, and then the right comes in and defends pedophilia when
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:44.883]  Actually, the whole thing's being exposed right now.
[02:29:44.883 --> 02:29:46.625]  And Milo says he's outed three pedophiles.
[02:29:46.625 --> 02:29:48.627]  So, that is exactly what they're doing.
[02:29:48.627 --> 02:29:51.009]  They're trying to get all the gays on the side of the pedophiles.
[02:29:51.009 --> 02:29:51.890]  March.
[02:29:51.890 --> 02:29:54.412]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.412 --> 02:29:57.115]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.007 --> 02:30:09.596]  In a string of unfortunate drop-dead instances of top Russian diplomats, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, has just been added to the list.
[02:30:09.596 --> 02:30:18.185]  Just in the last two months, this marks the fourth case in an unprecedented series of leading Russian diplomats being either shot on the spot or found dead.
[02:30:18.185 --> 02:30:23.030]  All these men played instrumental roles in promotion of relations between Russia and other countries.
[02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:40.641]  As the fake stream media continues to cultivate public hatred toward Russia, and the deep states declared war on President Trump, condemning him as a Russian agent and Putin's puppet, reaches the levels of grotesque absurdity, one has to wonder, are all these deaths merely a coincidence?
[02:30:40.641 --> 02:30:52.949]  You decide, but I'll leave you with a statement from the previous administration spokesman John Kirby, who threatened Moscow with terror attacks in Russian cities, and even shoot downs of Russian jets, if Vladimir Putin continued his fight against ISIS in Syria.
[02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:58.333]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[02:30:58.333 --> 02:31:01.075]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[02:31:01.075 --> 02:31:09.342]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWars.
[02:31:09.342 --> 02:31:10.563]  A 360 win.
[02:31:10.563 --> 02:31:16.408]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:17.108 --> 02:31:25.051]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:25.051 --> 02:31:29.713]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:36.235]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:36.235 --> 02:31:37.616]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:37.856 --> 02:31:39.838]  Select your favorite product or products.
[02:31:39.838 --> 02:31:44.023]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:44.023 --> 02:31:46.405]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[02:31:46.405 --> 02:31:50.890]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:50.890 --> 02:31:52.191]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:31:52.191 --> 02:31:54.634]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:54.634 --> 02:31:56.636]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:31:56.636 --> 02:32:00.480]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:04.121]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:32:04.121 --> 02:32:05.261]  They lost.
[02:32:05.261 --> 02:32:05.742]  We won.
[02:32:05.742 --> 02:32:08.362]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[02:32:08.362 --> 02:32:14.244]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:32:16.605 --> 02:32:22.329]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:32:22.329 --> 02:32:28.594]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:32:28.594 --> 02:32:34.878]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[02:32:34.878 --> 02:32:37.340]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:38.781]  We're the solution!
[02:32:38.781 --> 02:32:39.701]  Americans!
[02:32:39.701 --> 02:32:41.302]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[02:32:41.302 --> 02:32:46.684]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:32:46.684 --> 02:32:48.365]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:32:48.365 --> 02:32:50.246]  DVDs now available.
[02:32:50.246 --> 02:32:53.687]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:32:53.687 --> 02:32:55.868]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:33:06.766 --> 02:33:07.767]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:07.767 --> 02:33:09.870]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.238 --> 02:33:47.565]  You know, I look at this headline, and it's an important story that they threw up real quick, Infowars.com, as I came in today right before the show and announced all this, but it's not even hardcore enough.
[02:33:47.565 --> 02:33:55.971]  It doesn't even really break down the fact that massive shutdown of free speech is accelerating, that the funding's being cut off for independent media.
[02:33:56.932 --> 02:33:59.934]  In a completely discriminatory, criminal fashion in my view.
[02:33:59.934 --> 02:34:04.317]  It's censorship, online advertisers shutting down conservative media.
[02:34:04.317 --> 02:34:14.963]  No, Infowars.com had AdRoll that works for Google say, you are fake news, we don't like your political views, you're banned.
[02:34:14.963 --> 02:34:18.526]  It's Infowars banned off Google advertising.
[02:34:19.466 --> 02:34:20.747]  I'm not mad at anybody.
[02:34:20.747 --> 02:34:26.308]  I just can't sit here in this unfree society climate and just continue basically at this point.
[02:34:26.308 --> 02:34:32.491]  I mean it's really reaching that point because as a culture we're like dodo birds.
[02:34:32.491 --> 02:34:37.072]  And dodo birds are sitting there and the sailors pull up and dodo birds never had any competition.
[02:34:37.072 --> 02:34:38.633]  They never had any predators.
[02:34:38.633 --> 02:34:40.773]  So they don't know what a threat is.
[02:34:40.773 --> 02:34:45.295]  And so dodo birds are kind of calmly sitting there while the other dodo birds are being chopped up and eaten and cooked.
[02:34:45.295 --> 02:34:47.996]  They said dodo birds would hop right up to the fire.
[02:34:49.028 --> 02:34:52.172]  While another dodo bird was being eaten.
[02:34:52.172 --> 02:34:54.614]  And the thing is, I'm not a dodo bird.
[02:34:54.614 --> 02:34:55.876]  You know, I'm freaked out about this.
[02:34:55.876 --> 02:35:01.882]  I mean, you know, I was freaked out when they banned Breitbart's apps on iTunes.
[02:35:01.882 --> 02:35:04.685]  I was freaked out when they, you know, banned us off Google Store.
[02:35:04.685 --> 02:35:08.389]  I just, you know, the general public that's dialed in, they care.
[02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:13.632]  But we ourselves, I guess, just get Stockholm Syndrome, kind of.
[02:35:13.632 --> 02:35:20.136]  Where we just get used to being abused, and lied about, and we're racist because we think Obamacare is a rip-off.
[02:35:20.136 --> 02:35:21.696]  No, we're right about that!
[02:35:21.696 --> 02:35:23.337]  We were proven right about that!
[02:35:23.337 --> 02:35:25.859]  We were proven right about all of it!
[02:35:25.859 --> 02:35:29.401]  And you see these big PR firm rollouts.
[02:35:29.401 --> 02:35:34.804]  You know, censor the alt-right, shut down Milo, shut down Infowars, shut down everything.
[02:35:34.804 --> 02:35:37.066]  And then you see, all over,
[02:35:38.803 --> 02:35:43.226]  How they're cutting off the online advertising for sites.
[02:35:43.226 --> 02:35:44.387]  And notice how they did it on purpose.
[02:35:44.387 --> 02:35:47.549]  Drudge was always right when he said we should create our own internet things completely.
[02:35:47.549 --> 02:35:57.376]  We used to have our own online advertising where we made the ads, we did it, and per capita, we made more money doing that than when I finally accepted Google and everything.
[02:35:57.376 --> 02:36:07.143]  But then by the time I accepted Google, I didn't even have a crew or people in the industry that knew how to go out and sell ads and who knew how to go out and pitch an ad format and have it tailored to us.
[02:36:08.104 --> 02:36:09.824]  It's kind of like calculators.
[02:36:09.824 --> 02:36:11.245]  30 years ago everybody knew how to do math.
[02:36:11.245 --> 02:36:12.425]  Now nobody does.
[02:36:12.425 --> 02:36:13.065]  It's the same thing.
[02:36:13.065 --> 02:36:20.046]  They create these markets that change the whole world where you're all in this gulag and don't even know what you're doing.
[02:36:20.046 --> 02:36:24.687]  And then when the censorship hits you, you can't even see it or care.
[02:36:24.687 --> 02:36:26.387]  That's genius.
[02:36:26.387 --> 02:36:31.568]  When it's in your face saying, Infowars told you don't have a right to exist.
[02:36:31.568 --> 02:36:32.789]  You're banned.
[02:36:32.789 --> 02:36:34.009]  We're gonna bankrupt you.
[02:36:35.657 --> 02:36:37.158]  But that'd be sensational!
[02:36:37.158 --> 02:36:39.499]  So just roll over and die in the ditch!
[02:36:39.499 --> 02:36:41.860]  That's the way of the world!
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:43.761]  That's the way of the universe!
[02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:54.187]  That's the way of what we're supposed to do is just be mentally ill, triggered social justice warriors and just admit the colleges are giant mental institutions and everyone just flops around.
[02:36:54.187 --> 02:36:56.828]  I was watching Fox News, they go, the new PTSD is
[02:36:59.011 --> 02:37:01.053]  Oh, Hillary supporters.
[02:37:01.053 --> 02:37:03.415]  And they've been through a big crisis, not having their candidate win.
[02:37:03.415 --> 02:37:08.940]  And then, ahhhhhh, no, ahhhh, I didn't win, ahhhh.
[02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:11.563]  Just teaching people how to be a total basket case.
[02:37:11.563 --> 02:37:16.927]  Mike Cernovich, documentary filmmaker, lawyer, author, free speech activist.
[02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:19.129]  Other points just to look at here.
[02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:20.411]  Getting back into my love.
[02:37:21.658 --> 02:37:24.720]  Lessons from Milo soon to be bounced back.
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:34.426]  Yeah, I think if he doesn't, like Tiger Woods did, and he actually did something, buy into it and say, I'm sorry, and act mentally ill, if he just says, screw you, I'm rock and roll, he'll be bigger.
[02:37:34.426 --> 02:37:36.468]  Because aren't we really the new counterculture?
[02:37:36.468 --> 02:37:38.809]  We don't want to be the fake guys trying to be countercultures.
[02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:39.810]  He got spiked hair.
[02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:41.291]  Not against spiked hair.
[02:37:41.291 --> 02:37:44.773]  We're actually really countering the globalist dominant culture.
[02:37:44.773 --> 02:37:47.675]  And as long as we never apologize or back down, we win, right?
[02:37:49.333 --> 02:37:49.373]  100%.
[02:37:49.373 --> 02:37:51.274]  That's why I threw the deplorable.
[02:37:51.274 --> 02:37:54.516]  A lot of people go, Mike, why are you throwing an inauguration party?
[02:37:54.516 --> 02:38:01.080]  And I said, because our party will be the biggest party and that'll send a message to the globalists that we are the future.
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:03.162]  We have the support of the American people.
[02:38:03.162 --> 02:38:05.944]  Yeah, Milo definitely cannot back down.
[02:38:05.944 --> 02:38:08.365]  He has to take this on aggressively.
[02:38:08.365 --> 02:38:14.890]  He has to go at them savagely and he will come back and he will come back bigger because he has a built-in audience.
[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:20.019]  However, to your earlier point, here's what bothers me about the right.
[02:38:20.019 --> 02:38:23.967]  When Google censors you, people go, oh, it's a private company.
[02:38:23.967 --> 02:38:25.890]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:38:25.890 --> 02:38:26.752]  Our own side.
[02:38:27.645 --> 02:38:31.446]  Stabs in the back, turns the knife when you're being attacked by the left.
[02:38:31.446 --> 02:38:33.806]  They join in these dog piles.
[02:38:33.806 --> 02:38:35.366]  What is wrong with the right?
[02:38:35.366 --> 02:38:39.067]  Why do they do that to the people who are actually fighting hard?
[02:38:39.067 --> 02:38:41.647]  Because they're cowards and they're not real conservatives.
[02:38:41.647 --> 02:38:49.869]  They were always opportunists that joined it for political power to be whores to the system, not to build a new world, not to build a future.
[02:38:49.869 --> 02:38:51.949]  And so they're just opportunistic scumbags.
[02:38:51.949 --> 02:38:56.390]  And once people are known to be opportunistic, we must know their names and hate them forever.
[02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:59.815]  And stand with those that stand for justice and a future!
[02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:03.562]  Yeah, we can never forgive what they have done.
[02:39:03.562 --> 02:39:07.025]  We can never forgive the assassination that they're doing on Milo.
[02:39:07.025 --> 02:39:13.210]  So yeah, Milo can bounce back, but it's going to be hard because he's being gaslit now.
[02:39:13.210 --> 02:39:21.297]  What the media is doing now is they're running a psychological operation on him to try to make him believe that maybe he did something wrong.
[02:39:21.297 --> 02:39:25.900]  Again, to re-victimize him because that is the way their sadistic impulses lead them to.
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:27.402]  They want to hurt real victims.
[02:39:27.842 --> 02:39:31.650]  They want to hurt him now because for them this is a very erotic thing.
[02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:38.264]  The media coverage and the media attacks on Milo is actually an erotic experience for the pedophiles in the media.
[02:39:40.658 --> 02:39:41.759]  Cernovich is our guest.
[02:39:41.759 --> 02:39:43.319]  By the way, they just came out seconds ago.
[02:39:43.319 --> 02:39:45.680]  We're going to retweet this at Real Alex Jones.
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:48.942]  Milo resigns from Breitbart News Network.
[02:39:48.942 --> 02:39:52.723]  Today, Milo Yiannopoulos, senior editor of Breitbart News, announced his resignation from the company.
[02:39:52.723 --> 02:39:55.605]  Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved.
[02:39:55.605 --> 02:40:01.627]  They have allowed me to carry conservative libertarian ideas to communities that otherwise never have heard them.
[02:40:01.627 --> 02:40:03.668]  They have always been a significant factor in my success.
[02:40:03.668 --> 02:40:08.050]  I am grateful for the freedom from the friendships I have forged there.
[02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:09.131]  I would be wrong to allow
[02:40:11.218 --> 02:40:17.648]  My poor choices of words attract from my colleagues important reporting, so I am resigning from my position immediately.
[02:40:17.648 --> 02:40:19.030]  This decision is mine alone.
[02:40:20.162 --> 02:40:22.963]  When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them.
[02:40:22.963 --> 02:40:28.104]  For me, this means stepping aside, my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.
[02:40:28.104 --> 02:40:31.305]  So this is all part of the intimidation cycle that's going on.
[02:40:31.305 --> 02:40:33.405]  I'm not endorsing everything he said or did.
[02:40:33.405 --> 02:40:38.907]  The point is, is you can see the shy-op in all of this.
[02:40:38.907 --> 02:40:42.888]  And this will only leave blood in the water, just like Flynn, and will intensify everything.
[02:40:43.973 --> 02:40:46.537]  Yeah, I mean, now they're going to go after you.
[02:40:46.537 --> 02:40:48.500]  You harder, Paul Joseph.
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:54.190]  Hell, they just took $3.3 million from us in one day, blew up all our money for the next, to expand the operation.
[02:40:54.190 --> 02:40:55.332]  Hell, I think they're already coming after us.
[02:40:56.612 --> 02:41:00.456]  But it won't even rate an article with our name in it.
[02:41:00.456 --> 02:41:01.297]  We're nobody.
[02:41:01.297 --> 02:41:02.418]  Go ahead.
[02:41:02.418 --> 02:41:08.303]  Well, I mean, they even went after Brittany Pettibone, who set up a GoFundMe to buy a microphone for a podcast.
[02:41:08.303 --> 02:41:11.166]  She and her sister Nicole had been on Infovoice before.
[02:41:11.166 --> 02:41:16.291]  All she wanted to do was raise $500, $600 to help her with the microphone.
[02:41:16.291 --> 02:41:20.635]  And then GoFundMe said, you advocate a so-called traditionist lifestyle.
[02:41:21.355 --> 02:41:22.657]  Did you hear that?
[02:41:22.657 --> 02:41:23.558]  Traditionists!
[02:41:23.558 --> 02:41:24.239]  Traditionists!
[02:41:24.239 --> 02:41:29.665]  If you want to live on a farm, a man and a woman have kids, like a biological unit, you're not allowed to exist!
[02:41:29.665 --> 02:41:31.648]  It's a damn cult takeover!
[02:41:31.648 --> 02:41:32.849]  Thank God Trump came in!
[02:41:32.849 --> 02:41:34.451]  You know, here's the good news.
[02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:36.613]  Every time they try to censor in history, it doesn't work.
[02:41:36.613 --> 02:41:37.615]  So, good luck for them, right?
[02:41:38.595 --> 02:41:40.655]  Well, good luck for them, but they're taking scouts.
[02:41:40.655 --> 02:41:43.336]  The General Flynn was a frame-up, by the way.
[02:41:43.336 --> 02:41:46.176]  That was another deep state sign-up.
[02:41:46.176 --> 02:41:48.917]  That's why we haven't seen the transcript of General Flynn.
[02:41:48.917 --> 02:41:50.657]  People just expect us to move on.
[02:41:50.657 --> 02:41:55.698]  Well, where's the transcript?
[02:41:55.698 --> 02:41:56.138]  That's right.
[02:41:56.138 --> 02:41:57.219]  Where's the full transcript?
[02:41:57.219 --> 02:42:03.240]  Well, they admitted it was discussing having meetings about sanctions with the President, and the President's allowed to do.
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:04.820]  You cut out when you said, where's the transcript?
[02:42:05.896 --> 02:42:09.619]  Where's the transcript of Mike Flynn allegedly talking about Russia?
[02:42:09.619 --> 02:42:11.101]  Where is it, right?
[02:42:11.101 --> 02:42:12.041]  It doesn't exist.
[02:42:12.041 --> 02:42:12.802]  It's fake.
[02:42:12.802 --> 02:42:13.883]  It was a media psyop.
[02:42:13.883 --> 02:42:16.165]  That story in the Washington Post is fake.
[02:42:16.165 --> 02:42:17.726]  Mike Pence believed it.
[02:42:17.726 --> 02:42:19.108]  Flynn got hit.
[02:42:19.108 --> 02:42:20.389]  Flynn was on the vanguard.
[02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:21.890]  Milo's on the vanguard.
[02:42:21.890 --> 02:42:26.334]  I predict major hit pieces on Paul Joseph Watson and others within the next couple weeks.
[02:42:26.334 --> 02:42:28.716]  And they're going to frame him for things he never even said.
[02:42:31.172 --> 02:42:36.576]  Well, it's an incredible time to be alive, and as angry as I get about this, it just shows what bullying scum they are.
[02:42:36.576 --> 02:42:39.397]  And I'm not just saying this to be positive or a cheerleader.
[02:42:39.397 --> 02:42:48.123]  Look at how nationalism, normal human, traditionalist, not conservative, not liberal, just traditionalist, you know, like a chicken and a rooster.
[02:42:48.123 --> 02:42:50.805]  Like a, you know, a dog and a bitch.
[02:42:50.805 --> 02:42:51.545]  You know, like a...
[02:42:53.007 --> 02:42:54.008]  Vixen and a dog.
[02:42:54.008 --> 02:42:55.649]  You know, that's a male and female fox.
[02:42:55.649 --> 02:42:56.909]  You know, this is what we do.
[02:42:56.909 --> 02:42:57.770]  We have babies.
[02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:58.290]  We live.
[02:42:58.290 --> 02:42:59.431]  We have a nest.
[02:42:59.431 --> 02:43:05.675]  They're saying our nest are evil and just existing should be eradicated because they want to run around with green hair.
[02:43:05.675 --> 02:43:07.676]  I don't care if you want to run around with green hair.
[02:43:07.676 --> 02:43:12.499]  The point is you were programmed by globalists to turn loose of your life force and roll over and die.
[02:43:12.499 --> 02:43:15.181]  And if you want to roll over and die, that's your prerogative.
[02:43:15.181 --> 02:43:16.682]  But stop trying to kill us.
[02:43:18.049 --> 02:43:19.391]  Yeah, we live in it.
[02:43:19.391 --> 02:43:22.154]  But as you've talked about before though, they are a death cult.
[02:43:22.154 --> 02:43:26.380]  If you want to understand globalism, then you understand that they are a death cult.
[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:28.523]  They want people to have no hope.
[02:43:28.523 --> 02:43:31.487]  Right now, I talk to people who are under 25.
[02:43:31.487 --> 02:43:33.790]  They feel like they have no prospects for the future.
[02:43:34.270 --> 02:43:42.916]  It's because the globalist people, I mean look at Soros, his bags have physically showing up the evilness of his weight.
[02:43:42.916 --> 02:43:52.763]  It's really like something out of Star Wars, some kind of like dark side thing where his face is disintegrating because of how evil he is and that's what people, that was the same thing with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:43:53.283 --> 02:43:59.068]  They want to destroy the hope of the youth because that is another way that they harm children.
[02:43:59.068 --> 02:44:05.774]  They want everybody spiritually bankrupt, to believe in nothing, to become a nihilist, and then to become a slave.
[02:44:05.774 --> 02:44:08.116]  And then of course, if you're a billionaire,
[02:44:08.874 --> 02:44:09.394]  We're good to go.
[02:44:25.521 --> 02:44:30.922]  They want to farm us and have us totally broke back and never organizing and never fighting back.
[02:44:30.922 --> 02:44:32.843]  Because it's not just they want us to be slaves.
[02:44:32.843 --> 02:44:34.643]  That's in their in-game perfect world.
[02:44:34.643 --> 02:44:45.185]  They know if they let humanity and its spirit rise, there's no place for the vampires but literally under the old castle and creeping out once in a while at midnight, you know, at 3 a.m.
[02:44:45.185 --> 02:44:48.166]  when everybody's got their doors locked and is ready for them.
[02:44:48.166 --> 02:44:50.486]  They want to be out in the open light.
[02:44:50.486 --> 02:44:52.066]  They want to bring in a great darkness.
[02:44:52.066 --> 02:44:54.227]  They want to have their way and somebody like
[02:44:54.927 --> 02:44:58.450]  A Milo that could have become one of their Renfields, one of their procurers.
[02:44:58.450 --> 02:45:00.512]  He never went down that road completely.
[02:45:00.512 --> 02:45:02.193]  He turned against them, so you're right.
[02:45:02.193 --> 02:45:03.574]  They believe they owned him.
[02:45:03.574 --> 02:45:05.716]  Because a Catholic priest raped him.
[02:45:05.716 --> 02:45:12.201]  So they're saying he's ours and we'll now take the work he's done against us and we'll destroy him.
[02:45:12.201 --> 02:45:15.103]  Yeah, number one is they offer to buy you out.
[02:45:15.103 --> 02:45:19.547]  Milo had been offered a lot of opportunities to be bought out.
[02:45:19.547 --> 02:45:20.408]  He turned them down.
[02:45:20.408 --> 02:45:22.369]  Two is character assassination.
[02:45:22.369 --> 02:45:24.471]  And if that fails, three is they kill you.
[02:45:28.032 --> 02:45:30.055]  You know, you're a smart guy, Mr. Cernovich.
[02:45:30.055 --> 02:45:31.156]  What else is on your radar?
[02:45:31.156 --> 02:45:34.040]  What else do you want to put forward to the public and the viewers and listeners out there?
[02:45:35.282 --> 02:45:52.546]  I have information again from the highest levels that one third of the people in Deep State are pedophiles and one reason they freaked out so much and the reason they created, they lied about this thing with the pizza stuff because there is an active pedophile ring in D.C.
[02:45:52.546 --> 02:45:58.248]  and then they tried to make it seem like it was just about some dumb pizza parlor, which of course is not the story at all.
[02:45:58.248 --> 02:45:59.588]  That was a side out from the media.
[02:46:00.288 --> 02:46:00.908]  That's right, and
[02:46:22.892 --> 02:46:27.496]  I'm talking to the former head of Homeland Security in the committee today.
[02:46:27.496 --> 02:46:30.098]  He said, Hillary, you should have just backed off.
[02:46:30.098 --> 02:46:31.379]  You should have just gone away.
[02:46:31.379 --> 02:46:32.639]  Kurt Weldon.
[02:46:32.639 --> 02:46:33.981]  I never heard that from Weldon before.
[02:46:33.981 --> 02:46:36.863]  I was given that by high level sources that a deal was made with them.
[02:46:36.863 --> 02:46:37.843]  Stop grabbing kids.
[02:46:37.843 --> 02:46:38.444]  Stop doing this.
[02:46:38.444 --> 02:46:39.585]  Leave the country.
[02:46:39.585 --> 02:46:41.967]  We understand you got a lot of kill switches can cause a crisis.
[02:46:41.967 --> 02:46:43.208]  Just leave.
[02:46:43.208 --> 02:46:44.188]  Vampires go.
[02:46:44.188 --> 02:46:46.250]  And we won't, you know, we understand it's destructive.
[02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.950]  We do this.
[02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:47.911]  We won't go after you.
[02:46:47.911 --> 02:46:49.552]  They broke their deal.
[02:46:49.552 --> 02:46:52.595]  And so right now, the country is in full civil war.
[02:46:53.683 --> 02:46:57.804]  Between the forces of pure evil and people that just want prosperity.
[02:46:57.804 --> 02:46:59.585]  And Trump's a strong man.
[02:46:59.585 --> 02:47:03.006]  He'll run over you if you mess with him, but he's not out to hurt the average person.
[02:47:03.006 --> 02:47:06.427]  And that's why they're so pissed, because he's not one of them.
[02:47:06.427 --> 02:47:12.209]  And they are absolutely scared to death, and Trump now knows they're never gonna give him quarter.
[02:47:14.298 --> 02:47:21.666]  The problem is, not everybody's got the will, the steel will of Trump, and some of the people around him are bending under the pressure.
[02:47:21.666 --> 02:47:30.696]  Their wives, their husbands are being threatened, they're being manipulated, and instead of just going, I'm going to run you over like Trump or I or you would do, they tend to cower in fear.
[02:47:33.459 --> 02:47:36.681]  What was the most important line in the presidential debates?
[02:47:36.681 --> 02:47:38.902]  Trump called out Deep State.
[02:47:38.902 --> 02:47:42.864]  Now people realize, remember Trump said, oh there's a lot of... Limbaugh's come out.
[02:47:42.864 --> 02:47:44.525]  It's now safe to talk about Deep State.
[02:47:44.525 --> 02:47:45.606]  Yeah, we've come so far.
[02:47:45.606 --> 02:47:46.526]  That's the thing.
[02:47:46.526 --> 02:47:49.228]  We've already come light years in our fight against them.
[02:47:49.228 --> 02:47:53.070]  Do they understand that they're fighting old wars that we're already fighting in the future?
[02:47:54.246 --> 02:47:57.828]  Yeah, we're fighting, and they don't understand the fourth generation warfare tactics.
[02:47:57.828 --> 02:48:04.153]  They actually don't understand, which is the irony, they don't understand how powerful we truly are.
[02:48:04.153 --> 02:48:11.818]  If they really, if they try to kill you, if they ultimately kill me or somebody like that, then the civil war right now is a cold one.
[02:48:11.818 --> 02:48:13.079]  The civil war will go hot.
[02:48:13.599 --> 02:48:36.745]  So if they are thinking that they're going to actually murder us and attack us the ways that they think they're going to do, they're going to find out that we have a lot of people who do love us and support us in the military, in law enforcement, and there will be... That's right, and let's say it's spiritual, so it's like a sixth sense or a biological internet, the transmission's already going out, and now everybody's like, it's like Fight Club, everybody gets it without even being told.
[02:48:38.191 --> 02:48:39.212]  Right, and that's the thing.
[02:48:39.212 --> 02:48:41.154]  There's an understanding now.
[02:48:41.154 --> 02:48:44.817]  Everywhere I walk around now, people look and they're just like, it's like the head nod.
[02:48:44.817 --> 02:48:45.958]  You know, like people get it.
[02:48:45.958 --> 02:48:47.999]  People recognize me everywhere.
[02:48:47.999 --> 02:48:50.682]  And, you know, for you I'm sure it's ten times like that.
[02:48:50.682 --> 02:48:55.686]  People are, our reach, it really, it sounds weird saying it because you're a humble man, I'm a humble man.
[02:48:55.686 --> 02:48:56.647]  No, it's not a power trip.
[02:48:56.647 --> 02:49:00.190]  It's to let people that aren't public know we're having a victory.
[02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:01.971]  And this message is working.
[02:49:01.971 --> 02:49:02.692]  We're the majority.
[02:49:03.911 --> 02:49:09.115]  Right, so even if I was at Costco and a 70-year-old man goes, hey, can I get my picture taken with you?
[02:49:09.115 --> 02:49:13.579]  So everybody from the youth to people who are 70 years old, they're retired.
[02:49:13.579 --> 02:49:14.019]  Exactly.
[02:49:14.019 --> 02:49:15.600]  We're not discounting old people.
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:17.742]  The key is the enemy's targeting the youth.
[02:49:17.742 --> 02:49:26.189]  The fact that the youth's waking up at an explosive level, and it's pro-life, anti-globalist, pro-gun, and it's really a paradigm shift.
[02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:29.031]  If you're old, it means you already served the system or fought it.
[02:49:29.031 --> 02:49:33.395]  So you're more important than ever, older folks, to reach out to the youth that are finally ready to listen.
[02:49:34.304 --> 02:49:42.215]  Oh, especially too, and that is why the number one advice I give to everybody who wants to be active, start a YouTube, start a blog.
[02:49:42.215 --> 02:49:43.577]  We're building bigger websites.
[02:49:43.577 --> 02:49:44.258]  Do something.
[02:49:44.258 --> 02:49:49.626]  Even if only 10 people are watching your YouTube videos, that is amazing, right?
[02:49:49.626 --> 02:49:51.128]  Everybody has to realize now.
[02:49:51.468 --> 02:49:55.010]  Listen to you, of course, but be content creators.
[02:49:55.010 --> 02:49:55.990]  Get your message out.
[02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.510]  Absolutely.
[02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:59.651]  To win this, everybody has to transcend just this operation.
[02:49:59.651 --> 02:50:01.912]  I'd love nothing more to see us defeat them and roll it over.
[02:50:01.912 --> 02:50:02.413]  I'd be done.
[02:50:02.413 --> 02:50:02.913]  Believe me.
[02:50:02.913 --> 02:50:06.134]  Because it's either you're totally obsessed with us all the time, or you're not engaged.
[02:50:06.134 --> 02:50:08.395]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:50:08.395 --> 02:50:09.816]  It's crazy what an epic moment.
[02:50:09.816 --> 02:50:12.597]  Well, Mike Cernovich, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:50:12.597 --> 02:50:15.078]  What's the best website for people to visit you?
[02:50:15.078 --> 02:50:19.520]  DangerInPlay.com is my blog, and then they can find me at Twitter at C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[02:50:20.552 --> 02:50:23.256]  All right, well it's good to have you out there fighting hard.
[02:50:23.256 --> 02:50:25.258]  Great job, and you're absolutely on target with Milo.
[02:50:25.258 --> 02:50:30.084]  I'm going to call Milo and try to get him on to respond, because we're not going to run from Milo.
[02:50:30.084 --> 02:50:35.491]  He got raped when he was a teenager, and he made jokes that, well, you know, that which doesn't kill me only makes me stronger.
[02:50:35.491 --> 02:50:37.974]  Had his sexual identity set by that, a Catholic priest.
[02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:48.418]  And I'm not bashing his proclivity or his persuasion now, but I would say that he was directed into something he probably wasn't even part of, but I'm not going to attack his identity now.
[02:50:48.418 --> 02:50:51.279]  The point is, is that he's not the pedophile.
[02:50:51.279 --> 02:50:53.560]  He's spoken out against it many times.
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:56.661]  Why are they burning him and destroying him now?
[02:50:56.661 --> 02:50:57.261]  We'll be back.
[02:50:57.261 --> 02:51:00.422]  Stay with us, final segment, until another host comes in.

[02:52:00.894 --> 02:52:01.994]  Think about this.
[02:52:01.994 --> 02:52:14.559]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[02:52:14.559 --> 02:52:18.580]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[02:53:33.734 --> 02:53:40.217]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:53:40.217 --> 02:53:43.539]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:53:43.539 --> 02:53:45.600]  So the body is an amazing thing.

[02:54:05.256 --> 02:54:10.979]  Alright, Paul Watson's got a big article coming out about the open censorship, the scans and photos and documents.
[02:54:10.979 --> 02:54:13.941]  I sent it to him, it better be in the article.
[02:54:13.941 --> 02:54:20.085]  Dealing with ad rolls saying we're banned because we're fake news and evil and horrible, because we're dehumanized.
[02:54:20.085 --> 02:54:24.327]  They're telling black folks they can't vote or own a house and can't get a home loan.
[02:54:24.327 --> 02:54:26.608]  Just, you know, no conservatives or libertarians apply.
[02:54:26.608 --> 02:54:28.429]  You can't work with us.
[02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:32.652]  If you're a gun dealer or a sporting goods store, you can't have ads.
[02:54:34.582 --> 02:54:35.565]  And Kit wrote a great article.
[02:54:35.565 --> 02:54:35.986]  I love Kit.
[02:54:35.986 --> 02:54:37.450]  He's so prolific.
[02:54:43.626 --> 02:54:51.388]  It's just that his headline needs to deal with Infowars, censorship, online advertisers shutting down conservative media, and part of crackdown on speech I would add.
[02:54:51.388 --> 02:54:53.788]  So major ad agency, there it is.
[02:54:53.788 --> 02:54:56.549]  We need to Twitter this out, we need to Facebook this out.
[02:54:56.549 --> 02:54:59.630]  You guys print that for me, I'm going to read it during the next segment.
[02:54:59.630 --> 02:55:03.410]  Major ad agency suspends Infowars over support for Trump.
[02:55:03.410 --> 02:55:09.392]  Now here's the deal, I need to get all my reporters talking about this or we won't be here in a year.
[02:55:09.392 --> 02:55:10.772]  Or you'll be paid half what you were.
[02:55:11.772 --> 02:55:18.076]  I mean, this is like life and death, because I never really spur folks to pitch things or be involved in trying to raise capital.
[02:55:18.076 --> 02:55:26.900]  We've got a great crew here, but we're so virile and so confident, we're sitting there just being attacked every five minutes with huge lies.
[02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:28.501]  We just ignore it.
[02:55:28.501 --> 02:55:33.724]  Well, this is the type of thing that gets a blow in, and we've got to put a bandage on this hole.
[02:55:33.724 --> 02:55:36.606]  We've got to pull this arrow out and move on forward.
[02:55:38.598 --> 02:55:39.739]  And I'm not mad at anybody.
[02:55:39.739 --> 02:55:42.020]  It's just, this is, this is your crazy moment, okay?
[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:45.181]  I mean, they just ran in here with this latest article.
[02:55:45.181 --> 02:55:46.762]  Look at this out of Rolling Stone.
[02:55:46.762 --> 02:55:53.966]  Alex Jones, Misinfo Wars, 7 Bat Bleep Conspiracy Theories.
[02:55:53.966 --> 02:55:59.489]  They either misrepresent what I said, or they tell the truth but think you're an idiot.
[02:56:00.325 --> 02:56:01.807]  And it goes on.
[02:56:01.807 --> 02:56:03.249]  Satan is taking over America.
[02:56:03.249 --> 02:56:13.622]  No, there's not Satanism everywhere in the movie and the culture and in the Grammys and the Emmys and the Oscars and, you know, Lady Gaga doesn't say she's into Satan and has to have somebody with her because ghosts attack her at night.
[02:56:13.622 --> 02:56:15.164]  See, I mean, this is what she said.
[02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:16.366]  She's into Satanism.
[02:56:16.366 --> 02:56:17.227]  Oh, but it doesn't exist.
[02:56:17.227 --> 02:56:17.868]  Okay, I got it.
[02:56:18.632 --> 02:56:21.874]  Then, Bill Gates' eugenics is trying to wipe out minorities.
[02:56:21.874 --> 02:56:25.037]  Then I go into him saying there's too many people in Africa, we have to reduce their population.
[02:56:25.037 --> 02:56:27.659]  He meets with Oprah Winfrey to reduce her population.
[02:56:27.659 --> 02:56:28.359]  All of it.
[02:56:28.359 --> 02:56:30.401]  But they just know that you're not really reading.
[02:56:30.401 --> 02:56:31.081]  They hope you aren't.
[02:56:31.081 --> 02:56:32.923]  Now look right here.
[02:56:32.923 --> 02:56:34.123]  I highlighted it.
[02:56:34.123 --> 02:56:43.630]  Jones goes on to say IBM, for whom he says Gates is just a front, was set up as a eugenics trust with the express mission of creating a world race
[02:56:44.605 --> 02:56:47.986]  Worldwide race-based system and fund Adolf Hitler.
[02:56:47.986 --> 02:56:52.067]  IBM's head, Thomas Watson, got the highest award from Hitler.
[02:56:52.067 --> 02:57:00.669]  The numbers on the Jews' arms was the IBM International Business Machine number, and there's a best-selling New York Times book, IBM and the Holocaust!
[02:57:00.669 --> 02:57:09.151]  I mean, what's crazy is, they think pop idiots read this, and they're just getting inoculated, being told this isn't true, even though it's true.
[02:57:11.343 --> 02:57:19.705]  Then I said to this woman, no, Obama didn't send a tornado, but they say I did because I covered weather weapons.
[02:57:19.705 --> 02:57:23.066]  I mean, even the Huffington Post admits IBM and the Holocaust.
[02:57:23.066 --> 02:57:27.627]  The highest award Hitler ever gave was to Thomas Watson.
[02:57:27.627 --> 02:57:33.708]  So, I mean, I just stand over this, and it's just either disinfo, or it's true what I said, and it's all admitted.
[02:57:33.708 --> 02:57:35.789]  But see, I'm cursed with actually being informed.
[02:57:37.182 --> 02:57:37.963]  Here's what's happening.
[02:57:37.963 --> 02:57:39.665]  We've got colloidal silver at 33% off.
[02:57:39.665 --> 02:57:41.166]  It just came back in.
[02:57:41.166 --> 02:57:43.629]  We've got more of those limited edition prints.
[02:57:43.629 --> 02:57:44.169]  These are different.
[02:57:44.169 --> 02:57:46.632]  This is a different print color and a different paper.
[02:57:46.632 --> 02:57:48.914]  But when those are gone, they're gone.
[02:57:48.914 --> 02:57:54.760]  Of Trump and of Ronald Reagan, by the official Republican Party artist that does these, those are available.
[02:57:55.761 --> 02:57:57.081]  Maybe we should get some video of them out there.
[02:57:57.081 --> 02:57:58.202]  They're total collector's items.
[02:57:58.202 --> 02:57:59.442]  We've got a lot of other products.
[02:57:59.442 --> 02:58:00.922]  Caveman is in.
[02:58:00.922 --> 02:58:03.083]  The Paleo Bone Broth with Turmeric.
[02:58:03.083 --> 02:58:04.083]  That's so good for you.
[02:58:04.083 --> 02:58:04.863]  And so much more.
[02:58:04.863 --> 02:58:06.984]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:06.984 --> 02:58:08.084]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:08.084 --> 02:58:09.765]  We have the Victory One Series.
[02:58:09.765 --> 02:58:11.845]  President Donald J. Trump.
[02:58:11.845 --> 02:58:12.785]  1776 Reborn.
[02:58:12.785 --> 02:58:14.666]  Only 1,000 of these already half sold out.
[02:58:15.908 --> 02:58:17.729]  You must drill these out yourselves.
[02:58:17.729 --> 02:58:18.869]  They're totally legal and lawful.
[02:58:18.869 --> 02:58:21.550]  Read the ATF letter, but you cannot have somebody else do it for you.
[02:58:21.550 --> 02:58:27.292]  Infowarstore.com and support us and spread the word and buy the products.
[02:58:27.292 --> 02:58:29.073]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[02:58:29.073 --> 02:58:32.854]  From body armor with nanotech exclusively available to so much more.
[02:58:32.854 --> 02:58:33.895]  Hey, we've got enemies.
[02:58:33.895 --> 02:58:35.555]  We've also got friends.
[02:58:35.555 --> 02:58:40.477]  And we call on God to give us providence as we go full steam ahead.
[02:58:40.477 --> 02:58:42.518]  Back in 70 seconds as I finish up.
[02:58:43.118 --> 02:58:45.019]  Then I'm gonna come back with David Knight.
[02:58:45.019 --> 02:58:48.200]  I'm gonna play this Rush Limbaugh piece because it's game-changing.
[02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:50.880]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:55.362]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:55.362 --> 02:59:06.385]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extractors.
[02:59:06.445 --> 02:59:11.507]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:11.507 --> 02:59:14.088]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:14.088 --> 02:59:15.789]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:15.789 --> 02:59:18.670]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:18.670 --> 02:59:23.452]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:23.452 --> 02:59:29.695]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:29.695 --> 02:59:35.038]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:35.038 --> 02:59:35.798]  I'm taking it now.
[02:59:36.258 --> 02:59:38.239]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.546 --> 03:00:15.189]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:15.189 --> 03:00:20.354]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:22.541 --> 03:00:25.163]  David Knight's coming here in the next segment to host.
[03:00:25.163 --> 03:00:29.725]  I meant to get to this Rush Limbaugh clip that's been out the last two days where he says, yeah, the deep state's attacking Trump.
[03:00:29.725 --> 03:00:32.367]  We have a rogue government trying to block things.
[03:00:32.367 --> 03:00:34.608]  That shows there's a major fissure in the government.
[03:00:34.608 --> 03:00:42.693]  Obviously, you know, Rush Limbaugh wouldn't say he's a CIA agent, but he got set up by Ailes and others and has been kind of a patriotic arm of things.
[03:00:42.693 --> 03:00:50.318]  They've done some wars that were wrong and done some things that weren't correct, but they're not out to bankrupt the country and, you know, end the genders and brainwash everybody.
[03:00:52.364 --> 03:01:03.333]  And there's major corporate deals that the Republicans want to make with the Russians, and a lot of calculus has been done, that working with Russia would be better than having war with Russia.
[03:01:03.333 --> 03:01:07.516]  But the neocons and the Rothschilds and others have decided to have that war.
[03:01:07.516 --> 03:01:11.199]  And so, you know, I've been all over the map today, I know that.
[03:01:11.199 --> 03:01:19.025]  I had on Kurt Weldon, the former senior congressman in Homeland Security, the vice chairman, the co-chairman,
[03:01:19.994 --> 03:01:29.981]  The co-chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and the Armed Services Committee just saying, look, I know Hillary's a communist Chinese spy and she also got a lot of stuff from the Russians.
[03:01:29.981 --> 03:01:32.022]  And people say, Alex, you're being anti-Russian.
[03:01:32.022 --> 03:01:36.785]  That's what you're supposed to do if a country's wide open for infiltration and out to be sold out.
[03:01:36.785 --> 03:01:39.827]  It's immoral, it's Machiavelli, that's the world we live in.
[03:01:39.827 --> 03:01:43.630]  Trump is openly saying, don't cross me ever, I'm not going to cross you.
[03:01:45.063 --> 03:01:47.485]  Well, he doesn't control all the agencies or people.
[03:01:47.485 --> 03:01:48.786]  It's just a total war.
[03:01:48.786 --> 03:01:56.372]  I mean, it's beyond any John, you know... What's the movie with the OSS guy wrote?
[03:01:56.372 --> 03:01:57.893]  James Bond movie.
[03:01:57.893 --> 03:02:00.895]  I mean, I almost said John Bond.
[03:02:00.895 --> 03:02:02.537]  James Bond meets...
[03:02:03.905 --> 03:02:09.407]  John Wayne, it is head-spinning the level we've gotten to here.
[03:02:09.407 --> 03:02:21.571]  And just to know how horrible Hillary and Bill are, totally delusional, disconnected, owned by such horrible, evil psychopaths that get off on wrecking families and wrecking culture.
[03:02:21.571 --> 03:02:25.772]  That's their project because they hate seeing you happy and successful.
[03:02:28.424 --> 03:02:32.808]  And again, the article just went up on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:02:32.808 --> 03:02:35.110]  Can somebody print it for me?
[03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:37.433]  And I've got all these other articles that are attacking us.
[03:02:37.433 --> 03:02:39.054]  We can put it up on screen.
[03:02:39.054 --> 03:02:43.639]  I can read Paul's article that way, the old-fashioned way, right off the TV screen.
[03:02:43.639 --> 03:02:44.279]  You handed it to me?
[03:02:44.279 --> 03:02:44.580]  Well, good.
[03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:45.220]  Come bring it to me.
[03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:45.541]  Here it is.
[03:02:47.833 --> 03:02:56.937]  Major advertising agency Adderall has suspended its syndication of InfoWars product ads across millions of websites and platforms due to our support for Donald Trump.
[03:02:56.937 --> 03:03:07.522]  They're just saying, again, that's a form of ending net neutrality, because you claim you just advertise, it's there, you follow their rules, they approve your ads, and they later say you can't exist because you're fake news.
[03:03:07.522 --> 03:03:12.344]  A letter sent to InfoWars explaining the decision cites the political content of our website.
[03:03:12.344 --> 03:03:13.165]  Is there a screenshot there?
[03:03:13.165 --> 03:03:14.465]  Because I asked you to put that in.
[03:03:14.465 --> 03:03:15.426]  If not, have the crew add it.
[03:03:17.363 --> 03:03:18.444]  I'm gonna blow up, man.
[03:03:18.444 --> 03:03:21.025]  I'm gonna blow up.
[03:03:21.025 --> 03:03:25.887]  The letter also implies that the suspension... And I just can't wait to show the leftist side so they pick it up and celebrate.
[03:03:25.887 --> 03:03:26.767]  Oh, shut him down!
[03:03:26.767 --> 03:03:27.528]  Arrest him!
[03:03:27.528 --> 03:03:27.988]  Kill him!
[03:03:27.988 --> 03:03:28.388]  Beat him!
[03:03:28.388 --> 03:03:28.728]  Yay!
[03:03:28.728 --> 03:03:29.549]  Arrest Trump!
[03:03:29.549 --> 03:03:30.629]  Ban Trump's free speech!
[03:03:30.629 --> 03:03:33.831]  Ban Trump's Twitter!
[03:03:33.831 --> 03:03:36.872]  I want... That's why this morning I sent it to Paul.
[03:03:36.872 --> 03:03:39.553]  That's why I sat there for like an hour sending all this out.
[03:03:39.553 --> 03:03:42.715]  Not because I wanted to wipe my ass with it!
[03:03:46.621 --> 03:03:49.943]  And I sent screenshots because the media will say this doesn't exist.
[03:03:49.943 --> 03:03:54.267]  Their favorite thing is to say none of this exists.
[03:03:54.267 --> 03:03:56.668]  You understand?
[03:03:56.668 --> 03:04:01.912]  There's no 18,000 IRS agents to give you a $5,000 a year fine.
[03:04:01.912 --> 03:04:03.914]  Obamacare is free.
[03:04:03.914 --> 03:04:05.715]  There's no Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:04:05.715 --> 03:04:06.876]  There's no New World Order.
[03:04:06.876 --> 03:04:10.178]  There's no Islamic jihadis being brought into Europe and the United States.
[03:04:10.178 --> 03:04:11.179]  No, no, no.
[03:04:11.179 --> 03:04:12.200]  None of that exists.
[03:04:16.315 --> 03:04:20.442]  Oh, we had 100,000 people sign a petition for Trump to do something about it when he was president-elect.
[03:04:20.442 --> 03:04:24.729]  And I looked at the crew, and somebody said, oh, you weren't serious about mailing that to Trump, were you?
[03:04:24.729 --> 03:04:25.791]  It might piss him off!
[03:04:25.791 --> 03:04:29.156]  No, if I said something on air, you better believe that's what I meant.
[03:04:29.156 --> 03:04:30.438]  And playing games is over.
[03:04:31.718 --> 03:04:35.041]  People just have to take action, and we're going to beat these people.
[03:04:35.041 --> 03:04:44.649]  And I'm going to go back during the break, and I'm going to get the emails with their names and everything else posted in here from AdRoll so you can see what they said to us, so you can see it for yourself.
[03:04:44.649 --> 03:04:50.715]  Because I'm not going to have the Snopes, assholes, and all the other pieces of fucking shit sit there and say none of this exists.
[03:04:50.715 --> 03:04:54.938]  You want war, you goddamn cowardly pieces of chicken neck filth?
[03:04:54.938 --> 03:04:56.940]  I'm going to sue your ass into hell!
[03:04:56.940 --> 03:04:57.561]  Get ready!
[03:05:01.152 --> 03:05:09.158]  Last week, Bill Gates, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made a dystopic, bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could originate on a computer screen.
[03:05:09.158 --> 03:05:18.185]  By a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create synthetic viruses and super-contagions and deadly strains of the flu, he also said that this could kill tens of millions.
[03:05:18.345 --> 03:05:23.269]  A respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:28.473]  And there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[03:05:28.473 --> 03:05:30.935]  But he's also said this at TED Talks.
[03:05:30.935 --> 03:05:32.937]  How we can get this down to zero?
[03:05:32.937 --> 03:05:34.638]  First we've got population.
[03:05:34.638 --> 03:05:41.384]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by
[03:05:41.584 --> 03:05:43.144]  Perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[03:05:43.144 --> 03:05:50.107]  Lowering population by 10 to 15 percent still wouldn't yield Bill's desired result of zero, but it would reduce population by a billion people.
[03:05:50.107 --> 03:05:58.049]  So Gates speaks of population reduction and mass killings while his foundation is vaccinating large portions of Earth and sending out genetically modified mosquitoes.
[03:05:58.049 --> 03:05:59.690]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.
[03:05:59.690 --> 03:06:00.390]  Sounds legit to me!
[03:06:01.431 --> 03:06:02.992]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.992 --> 03:06:07.917]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:07.917 --> 03:06:11.440]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:17.264]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:17.264 --> 03:06:25.972]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:26.352 --> 03:06:31.919]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:31.919 --> 03:06:38.947]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:38.947 --> 03:06:43.512]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:43.752 --> 03:06:47.056]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.

[03:08:01.243 --> 03:08:04.985]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[03:08:04.985 --> 03:08:06.205]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[03:08:06.205 --> 03:08:07.186]  Alex Jones.
[03:08:07.186 --> 03:08:08.006]  From Infowars.
[03:08:08.006 --> 03:08:08.806]  Infowars.
[03:08:08.806 --> 03:08:09.146]  Yeah.
[03:08:09.146 --> 03:08:09.907]  Alex Jones.
[03:08:09.907 --> 03:08:10.727]  Alex Jones.
[03:08:10.727 --> 03:08:14.209]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:08:14.209 --> 03:08:17.090]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:22.012]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:08:22.012 --> 03:08:26.834]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[03:08:26.834 --> 03:08:28.855]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:08:29.515 --> 03:08:32.258]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:08:32.258 --> 03:08:43.268]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[03:08:43.268 --> 03:08:45.530]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[03:08:45.530 --> 03:08:48.073]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[03:08:51.713 --> 03:08:54.495]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:08:54.495 --> 03:08:57.578]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[03:08:57.578 --> 03:09:03.782]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[03:09:03.782 --> 03:09:05.984]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[03:09:05.984 --> 03:09:07.905]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:09:07.905 --> 03:09:09.347]  Move, bitch!
[03:09:09.347 --> 03:09:10.407]  Get out the way!
[03:09:10.407 --> 03:09:12.889]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, InfoWars.com.
[03:09:12.889 --> 03:09:14.030]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:09:15.592 --> 03:09:16.913]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:09:16.913 --> 03:09:17.974]  Infowars.com.
[03:09:17.974 --> 03:09:19.035]  Infowars.com.
[03:09:19.035 --> 03:09:20.076]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:09:20.076 --> 03:09:22.158]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:09:25.581 --> 03:09:30.265]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:09:30.265 --> 03:09:31.946]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:09:31.946 --> 03:09:33.287]  And David Knight's about to take over.
[03:09:33.287 --> 03:09:34.828]  Paul Watson's due to the show tomorrow.
[03:09:34.828 --> 03:09:36.249]  We're going to do a 13-hour broadcast.
[03:09:36.249 --> 03:09:39.011]  And I apologize for blowing up and cussing.
[03:09:39.011 --> 03:09:40.692]  But there's a fight inside of me.
[03:09:40.692 --> 03:09:43.694]  Just like when you saw him stealing land from people, you got angry.
[03:09:43.694 --> 03:09:46.096]  At a certain point, I can't hold back anymore.
[03:09:46.096 --> 03:09:46.897]  I love the crew.
[03:09:46.897 --> 03:09:47.497]  I love Paul.
[03:09:47.497 --> 03:09:47.958]  I love Kit.
[03:09:47.958 --> 03:09:52.421]  I get mad because these articles even aren't as hardcore as it really is.
[03:09:52.421 --> 03:09:53.582]  And like a godsend, David.
[03:09:54.718 --> 03:09:56.299]  Because I get frustrated with myself more than anybody.
[03:09:56.299 --> 03:10:02.804]  It's not, you come in and you go, Alex, it's Google and the Federal Trade Commission and all their monopolies Obama let them have.
[03:10:02.804 --> 03:10:04.325]  They're involved in all this criminal stuff.
[03:10:04.325 --> 03:10:05.606]  They're about to go down.
[03:10:05.606 --> 03:10:11.770]  This is racketeering, organizing all these groups to shut down their opposition while they hope Trump isn't aware of it.
[03:10:11.770 --> 03:10:14.692]  And I was just like, it was like being injected with heroin.
[03:10:14.692 --> 03:10:17.814]  I was like, yes, oh, I can get off the show now.
[03:10:17.814 --> 03:10:18.334]  He gets it.
[03:10:19.861 --> 03:10:23.086]  It's not that the rest of the crew doesn't get it, it's so epic.
[03:10:23.086 --> 03:10:31.978]  So I've been on the phone with Kurt Weldon this morning about incredible stuff, and I'm not bitching, it's just... A normal spy chief would deal with less than I deal with, okay?
[03:10:31.978 --> 03:10:33.921]  I mean, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying...
[03:10:35.546 --> 03:10:51.718]  I've got to keep track of so much stuff, and so I apologize I never take breaks, sometimes I blow up, because they just took, it was $3.3 million last year through AdRoll and Google, okay, with just our milquetoast ads, okay, because we know the rules, they approve the ads, they've refused some before.
[03:10:51.718 --> 03:10:53.939]  It was set to be over $5 million this year.
[03:10:53.939 --> 03:10:58.803]  Everybody knew in the meetings I had with you, I had with Corsi, I was like, this money
[03:10:59.881 --> 03:11:02.002]  Just in the pie was going to be our extra money.
[03:11:02.002 --> 03:11:04.162]  We'll still get it from the great listeners.
[03:11:04.162 --> 03:11:06.103]  But it means more is coming.
[03:11:06.103 --> 03:11:07.103]  More censorship.
[03:11:07.103 --> 03:11:08.064]  More control.
[03:11:08.064 --> 03:11:10.405]  Just what Drudge told us a year and a half ago.
[03:11:10.405 --> 03:11:11.365]  It's all happening.
[03:11:11.365 --> 03:11:11.885]  Bombshell.
[03:11:11.885 --> 03:11:12.545]  Major adage.
[03:11:12.545 --> 03:11:13.646]  It's been simple wars.
[03:11:13.646 --> 03:11:15.306]  And the reason I blew up was not at Watson.
[03:11:15.306 --> 03:11:17.227]  I sent him copies of the email.
[03:11:17.227 --> 03:11:18.327]  He probably was due diligence.
[03:11:18.327 --> 03:11:19.888]  I don't know if I should put these up.
[03:11:19.888 --> 03:11:20.068]  Yeah.
[03:11:20.888 --> 03:11:24.611]  And so I blew up and was like, I want the emails because I know them.
[03:11:24.611 --> 03:11:26.132]  They'll say we're lying!
[03:11:26.132 --> 03:11:27.673]  Because there's a new level.
[03:11:27.673 --> 03:11:28.854]  They have Rolling Stone out today.
[03:11:28.854 --> 03:11:30.095]  I'm told it's in the newspaper.
[03:11:30.095 --> 03:11:31.756]  It's in the magazine.
[03:11:31.756 --> 03:11:36.119]  Saying, I'm crazy, IBM has no connection to the Nazis.
[03:11:36.119 --> 03:11:39.401]  So they're like picking things they know are true.
[03:11:39.401 --> 03:11:40.282]  Well, you're a smart guy.
[03:11:40.282 --> 03:11:41.823]  I don't mean that condescendingly.
[03:11:41.823 --> 03:11:43.284]  David, what do you think's happening?
[03:11:43.284 --> 03:11:46.126]  Because they've just declared war on us.
[03:11:46.126 --> 03:11:47.607]  They're saying kill Trump.
[03:11:47.607 --> 03:11:48.708]  They're lying.
[03:11:48.708 --> 03:11:49.669]  But also more and more,
[03:11:51.345 --> 03:11:57.647]  They just tell lies that are verifiably false, like there's no IRS penalties.
[03:11:57.647 --> 03:12:03.970]  So, you know, in Obamacare, so what do you think the tactic is that I'm going to have a call to action and let you take over with the specifics?
[03:12:03.970 --> 03:12:07.551]  Yeah, forget about the Hollerith codes with IBM tattooing on people's arms.
[03:12:08.231 --> 03:12:11.912]  When we're talking about what's going on here, we've got to understand the background.
[03:12:11.912 --> 03:12:18.375]  We have all these people talking about, whoa, what about Donald Trump's business interests here and his involvement with Trump Hotels and everything.
[03:12:18.375 --> 03:12:20.216]  Let's take a look at Google's interests.
[03:12:20.216 --> 03:12:22.677]  Let's take a look at Jeff Bezos' interests.
[03:12:22.677 --> 03:12:25.718]  Because I talked about it yesterday when we were talking, still looking at
[03:12:26.198 --> 03:12:30.019]  The removal, the political assassination of Michael Flynn.
[03:12:30.019 --> 03:12:31.379]  Who was at the center of that?
[03:12:31.379 --> 03:12:32.500]  Who got that information?
[03:12:32.500 --> 03:12:33.880]  They run the whole show.
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:44.163]  And the Washington Post was bought by Jeff Bezos for $250 million, but he got $600 million contract from the CIA to run their... People ask why am I pissed?
[03:12:44.163 --> 03:12:45.403]  They hold out a sign.
[03:12:45.663 --> 03:12:55.711]  Whether I'm black, white, Christian, Muslim, whatever I am, I can come, I can put ads up for my products, I follow their rules, and then they say, secretly, you're banned, because you're not human, you don't exist.
[03:12:55.711 --> 03:13:11.805]  The discrimination of this, and stealing $5 million, clearly is what it would be, last year 3.3, of an ad thing we had that was working, that we invested in, that we spent time in, to sell our products, to fund our message of freedom, and they blow us away like we don't exist!
[03:13:12.125 --> 03:13:12.866]  Man, I don't care.
[03:13:12.866 --> 03:13:16.489]  If somebody breaks into my car and steals my stereo, it's not that it's a $200 stereo.
[03:13:16.489 --> 03:13:17.750]  It's my windows knocked out.
[03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:18.771]  They violated me.
[03:13:18.771 --> 03:13:19.732]  I'm pissed.
[03:13:19.732 --> 03:13:32.905]  I am 50 times more pissed about this because they're trying to steal my birthright and because it makes me so angry it turns loose all this tidal energy that I was, that I don't want to, oh my, I mean, look, David,
[03:13:34.422 --> 03:13:45.349]  Well Alex, when they say that you can't do this because we're a political organization, because we make comments... Yeah, we're not allowed, because it's FTC, or it's FCC, or it's Federal Election Commission.
[03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:48.731]  They're applying Democrat claims like they said with Drudge two years ago.
[03:13:48.731 --> 03:13:53.274]  They want to shut Drudge down, Congress said, because he's political and he has advertising.
[03:13:53.274 --> 03:13:55.955]  Well of course I have a view as a private citizen on guns.
[03:13:55.955 --> 03:13:56.516]  You hit the keys.
[03:13:56.516 --> 03:13:57.796]  I forgot the keys in the article.
[03:13:57.796 --> 03:13:58.337]  See, there's so much.
[03:13:58.877 --> 03:14:05.803]  They're saying we're political so we don't have speech and we're not allowed to make money outside of any law.
[03:14:05.803 --> 03:14:15.570]  They're just exercising like TPP, which was in there, Global Corporate Governance, and even though TPP didn't pass, they're still implementing it and carrying it out.
[03:14:15.570 --> 03:14:17.472]  See, I'm glad you're here because you made me
[03:14:18.152 --> 03:14:23.638]  Talk about, when you put an ad up for Caveman and they serve that ad on somebody, that's not political.
[03:14:23.638 --> 03:14:28.743]  But they're going back and they're investing... They say your site's political so you can't get funding.
[03:14:28.743 --> 03:14:30.585]  Well everything's political!
[03:14:30.585 --> 03:14:33.048]  Of course I want lower taxes, it's not political!
[03:14:33.048 --> 03:14:34.109]  It's called survival!
[03:14:34.109 --> 03:14:38.873]  Just like Google lobbies to have a 0% tax corporately in America, asshole!
[03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:47.758]  And all I want is 35% jerk and I can't live because a bunch of assholes like Schmidt believe I don't have a right to exist!
[03:14:47.758 --> 03:14:48.939]  Screw you!
[03:14:48.939 --> 03:14:51.340]  Screw you thinking you own me, you son of a bitch!
[03:14:52.199 --> 03:14:54.280]  I'm sorry, David, I'm going to get out of here and let you take over.
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:58.403]  Please plug the specials, people who financially support us, because clearly more is coming.
[03:14:58.403 --> 03:15:00.765]  We need money to continue on against these people.
[03:15:00.765 --> 03:15:02.166]  I'm sorry, I'm just too pissed to go on.
[03:15:02.166 --> 03:15:03.127]  You can take over.
[03:15:03.127 --> 03:15:04.428]  Well, you know what?
[03:15:04.428 --> 03:15:09.231]  What we're saying, Alex, here, is that these are not ads that in and of themselves are political.
[03:15:09.431 --> 03:15:12.753]  There's absolutely nothing political about selling iodine.
[03:15:12.753 --> 03:15:14.114]  You've got a picture of an iodine bottle.
[03:15:14.114 --> 03:15:17.256]  You've got a picture of Caveman as a paleo supplement.
[03:15:17.256 --> 03:15:18.877]  There's nothing political about that.
[03:15:18.877 --> 03:15:30.444]  But they go back and say because... They think we don't exist and they think we should roll over and die and let these assholes all be tax exempt and then tell us just to disappear and we have no free speech.
[03:15:30.444 --> 03:15:34.426]  We're going to defeat Zuckerberg and Schmidt and they're all enemies!
[03:15:34.426 --> 03:15:35.647]  And I want to show them tomorrow.
[03:15:36.007 --> 03:15:42.752]  I want three million dollars here tomorrow on air of products sold to show them no matter what they do, we're going to the next level.
[03:15:42.752 --> 03:15:43.913]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:15:43.913 --> 03:16:00.445]  We've already had a Supreme Court decision, Citizens United, which the left doesn't like, but the Supreme Court said, yeah, the Supreme Court said in Citizens United that corporations can run ads, political ads, that they have the right to be involved in the political process and that's a direct action.
[03:16:00.765 --> 03:16:04.827]  What we're talking about here is censorship of something that is not even a direct action.
[03:16:04.827 --> 03:16:08.009]  These are not political ads that they're refusing to run.
[03:16:08.009 --> 03:16:19.296]  What they're saying is because you have political opinions, because you are a news site, and we're a news site with commentary and analysis, they're saying no, we're not going to allow you to use our ad system.
[03:16:19.296 --> 03:16:25.800]  Now that's way beyond shutting down Citizens United, and yet Citizens United won in the Supreme Court.
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:27.441]  This is a fight we have to have.
[03:16:27.441 --> 03:16:28.481]  This is a fight we can win.
[03:16:28.481 --> 03:16:30.842]  But we have to look at what is behind this.
[03:16:30.842 --> 03:16:39.166]  Just as I was saying yesterday, when you look at the nexus of the people that brought down Flynn, of course, at the center of it was the Washington Post.
[03:16:39.166 --> 03:16:50.832]  And if you look at the Washington Post's involvement with the CIA, the CIA has, as of three years ago, I don't know what the size of the contract is now, their initial contract with Jeff Bezos' Amazon was $600 million.
[03:16:50.832 --> 03:16:52.292]  He only spent $250 million on the Washington Post itself.
[03:16:55.799 --> 03:17:02.563]  So this is his biggest customer, perhaps his biggest customer that he has as far as his database goes.
[03:17:02.563 --> 03:17:06.706]  And of course, they also shut down WikiLeaks when they didn't like what WikiLeaks was doing.
[03:17:06.706 --> 03:17:10.308]  They shut them down on Amazon's data servers.
[03:17:10.308 --> 03:17:14.850]  When we look at what's going on with Google, because they have a lot of influence in these ad servers here.
[03:17:14.850 --> 03:17:16.972]  This is a story from the New York Post, Alphabet.
[03:17:17.512 --> 03:17:19.254]  Which is Google's spinoff.
[03:17:19.254 --> 03:17:24.959]  Believes it has a lot riding on who President Trump picks to lead the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission.
[03:17:24.959 --> 03:17:27.621]  Several sources close to the situation told the New York Post.
[03:17:27.621 --> 03:17:38.291]  For example, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes on Trump's shortlist likely would open a probe into whether Alphabet improperly pressured mobile phone makers to install Google Apps on their phones.
[03:17:39.028 --> 03:17:49.257]  So, we have this situation where they have a vested financial interest in manipulating the political outcomes, and yet do you see Google being targeted?
[03:17:49.257 --> 03:17:49.898]  No.
[03:17:49.898 --> 03:17:51.659]  They're the ones doing the targeting.
[03:17:51.659 --> 03:17:59.947]  And of course, Trump, when he was running, said when he was being attacked by the Washington Post, he started talking about how he was going to look into antitrust violations by Amazon.
[03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:16.017]  And when he met with the tech entrepreneur heads, Jeff Bezos was there, he was invited, he came, and he had a place at the table, but it was at the far end of the table on the corner, and if you go back and you look at those pictures, he looks very forlorn.
[03:18:16.017 --> 03:18:29.943]  Look, we have to understand what the basis of this is, where this is coming from, and we have to understand that if we allow them to shut down people, to strangle people, to strangle Breitbart, to strangle Infowars financially,
[03:18:30.825 --> 03:18:33.868]  That is a very, very serious thing.
[03:18:33.868 --> 03:18:36.431]  And that is something that I don't think is going to hold up in the Supreme Court.
[03:18:36.431 --> 03:18:40.896]  I don't think it's going to hold up if people understand what is truly going on here.
[03:18:40.896 --> 03:18:47.083]  In a related vein, let me read you this story from the New American, how France is criminalizing pro-life speech.
[03:18:47.083 --> 03:18:49.946]  Listen to the penalty that they've enacted in France.
[03:18:49.946 --> 03:18:51.748]  They say, this is their slogan.
[03:18:52.148 --> 03:18:55.852]  Said the French Minister for Families, Children and Women's Rights.
[03:18:55.852 --> 03:18:57.814]  Of course, he doesn't really want children.
[03:18:57.814 --> 03:19:02.319]  He says, freedom of expression does not signify a right to lying.
[03:19:02.319 --> 03:19:05.062]  So you don't have a right to lie.
[03:19:05.062 --> 03:19:08.065]  Well, who's going to decide whether you are lying or not?
[03:19:08.065 --> 03:19:09.106]  Well, that would be him.
[03:19:09.927 --> 03:19:15.734]  He would be the one who would sit there and judge whether or not your news is fake, whether or not what you say about abortion is fake.
[03:19:15.734 --> 03:19:29.309]  So they have a new law in France that is opposing a punishment of a maximum of two years in prison and a fine of $30,000 for quote, spreading or transmitting allegations or indications liable to intentionally mislead with the purpose of deterring
[03:19:29.950 --> 03:19:36.354]  From abortion on the characteristics or medical consequences of a voluntary interruption of a woman's pregnancy.
[03:19:36.354 --> 03:19:38.495]  That's their euphemism for abortion.
[03:19:38.495 --> 03:19:41.577]  A voluntary interruption of pregnancy.
[03:19:41.577 --> 03:19:42.177]  So there you go.
[03:19:42.177 --> 03:19:47.501]  In France, if you say anything to oppose abortion, you can get up to two years and $30,000.
[03:19:47.501 --> 03:19:49.102]  That's the way they criminalize speech.
[03:19:49.102 --> 03:19:58.387]  They set themselves up as the arbiters, or they come out and they say, sorry, we're not going to let any ads go out if you're even remotely vocal about politics.
[03:19:58.387 --> 03:19:58.768]  Stay with us.
[03:19:58.768 --> 03:19:59.288]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.587 --> 03:20:12.455]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:12.455 --> 03:20:16.598]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:16.598 --> 03:20:18.759]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:18.759 --> 03:20:24.203]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:24.363 --> 03:20:34.351]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:34.351 --> 03:20:40.836]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:40.836 --> 03:20:44.139]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:44.139 --> 03:20:46.221]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:46.221 --> 03:20:49.323]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:49.363 --> 03:20:51.805]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:21:00.872 --> 03:21:06.597]  Attention investors, 2017 is the year of Trump and financial markets are rising at all-time highs.
[03:21:06.597 --> 03:21:11.481]  But economic uncertainty may be greater than after any election in our lifetime.
[03:21:11.481 --> 03:21:15.224]  And as retirement approaches, there's little time to recover your losses.
[03:21:15.224 --> 03:21:17.426]  You need to hedge against uncertainty.
[03:21:17.426 --> 03:21:18.467]  That means transferring
[03:21:18.507 --> 03:21:18.787]  I think so.

[03:22:00.322 --> 03:22:05.930]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[03:22:05.930 --> 03:22:08.333]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[03:22:08.333 --> 03:22:09.274]  Two of them, actually.
[03:22:09.274 --> 03:22:11.337]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[03:22:11.337 --> 03:22:15.723]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[03:22:15.723 --> 03:22:17.846]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[03:22:18.326 --> 03:22:22.287]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[03:22:22.287 --> 03:22:31.231]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[03:22:31.231 --> 03:22:33.591]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[03:22:33.591 --> 03:22:35.112]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[03:22:35.632 --> 03:22:36.452]  Don't worry.
[03:22:36.452 --> 03:22:41.993]  Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[03:22:41.993 --> 03:22:43.394]  Try Harry's free.

[03:24:04.331 --> 03:24:16.177]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:16.177 --> 03:24:18.198]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:18.198 --> 03:24:20.278]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this hour.
[03:24:20.278 --> 03:24:23.340]  And of course as we're just talking about the new
[03:24:24.890 --> 03:24:32.254]  VK from AdRoll saying they're not going to carry our ads because we have political content on our site and yet the ads are non-political.
[03:24:32.254 --> 03:24:34.695]  We have a special going at InfoWars store right now.
[03:24:34.695 --> 03:24:37.156]  This is one way that you can support us.
[03:24:37.156 --> 03:24:39.257]  Your contribution is our budget.
[03:24:39.257 --> 03:24:45.861]  We don't get any money from the government, we don't get any money from George Soros, any other sources like these other news media outlets get.
[03:24:46.441 --> 03:24:48.924]  Like MSNBC or others.
[03:24:48.924 --> 03:24:54.630]  No, it is simply the products that we sell, the very best products that we can find that we sell to you.
[03:24:54.630 --> 03:25:00.196]  And we have now put out a special, the Defend InfoWars special is now live at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:00.196 --> 03:25:03.259]  We have put on sale Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, 33% off stock price.

[03:25:18.473 --> 03:25:24.018]  This is something, folks, we have to make sure that they are not allowed to strangle people financially.
[03:25:24.018 --> 03:25:25.539]  And that is truly what is behind this.
[03:25:25.539 --> 03:25:31.004]  As I said before, they want to talk all the time about Trump's hotel connections and his internal business connections.
[03:25:31.004 --> 03:25:32.465]  Well, we need to take a deep look
[03:25:33.323 --> 03:25:46.695]  At the political connections and the vested crony capitalist interests of people like Google, people like Amazon, Jeff Bezos, how they are connected to the deep state and the intelligence services as well.
[03:25:46.695 --> 03:25:47.755]  Now, in this hour,
[03:25:48.616 --> 03:25:53.157]  I want to continue with what we were talking about yesterday in terms of Pence joining the EU.
[03:25:53.157 --> 03:25:58.139]  I did a report on that last night on the Nightly News, and you can see that on Alex Jones' YouTube channel.
[03:25:58.139 --> 03:26:10.502]  There's been an update on this today, and I want to get into that, but I'm going to save that, and I'm going to save the attacks and the jokes on Trump about Sweden, and we're going to go back and take a look at what's truly going on in Sweden.
[03:26:10.502 --> 03:26:16.204]  They're blaming now, implying that Donald Trump is responsible for riots that erupted in Sweden's capital.
[03:26:17.145 --> 03:26:19.607]  Just a couple of days after all this happened.
[03:26:19.607 --> 03:26:22.129]  It doesn't validate Donald Trump.
[03:26:22.129 --> 03:26:23.951]  No, he provoked it.
[03:26:23.951 --> 03:26:28.214]  Again, the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, the CIA involved in that.
[03:26:28.214 --> 03:26:30.356]  So we're going to give you their spin on the story.
[03:26:30.356 --> 03:26:32.638]  We're going to give you the background on the story.
[03:26:32.638 --> 03:26:34.660]  But this is a short segment that we have here.
[03:26:34.660 --> 03:26:35.941]  I'm going to do that in a longer segment.
[03:26:36.815 --> 03:26:39.759]  I just want to cover some of the other breaking news that I saw online.
[03:26:39.759 --> 03:26:46.246]  I just talked about France putting up a penalty to gag people in terms of talking about abortion.
[03:26:46.246 --> 03:26:50.391]  If they don't like what you have to say, they say you have no right to lie.
[03:26:50.391 --> 03:26:54.817]  And if I'm the French government, or if I'm the American government, the arbiters of truth
[03:26:55.711 --> 03:27:01.896]  Then they're going to say, well, no, I'm sorry, you're lying, you're fake, and we're going to censor you.
[03:27:01.896 --> 03:27:03.137]  But they're going beyond that in France.
[03:27:03.137 --> 03:27:09.883]  They're going to get people up to two years $30,000 fine if they talk about abortion and they don't like what they have to say.
[03:27:09.883 --> 03:27:11.264]  Now, what's happening here in America?
[03:27:11.264 --> 03:27:13.106]  Of course, I reported yesterday that over the weekend
[03:27:13.871 --> 03:27:22.155]  Norma Corby at 69, who was Jane Roe in Roe v Wade, she died and she spent her entire life trying to undo that.
[03:27:22.155 --> 03:27:23.976]  She actually didn't even have an abortion.
[03:27:23.976 --> 03:27:26.558]  She'd had two children before that she'd given up for adoption.
[03:27:26.558 --> 03:27:28.699]  She was still very young, she was very naive, she said that.
[03:27:29.540 --> 03:27:43.285]  And she said she was abused and taken advantage of by many people but no one worse than the lawyers and the legal system and she spent her entire life trying to undo Roe v. Wade and with guilt that she didn't deserve.
[03:27:43.285 --> 03:27:46.386]  She didn't need to have that guilt but with a concern
[03:27:47.286 --> 03:27:51.908]  Of the 35 million lives at that point, it's more than that now.
[03:27:51.908 --> 03:27:55.769]  The point that she did an affidavit back in 2000, trying to stop that.
[03:27:55.769 --> 03:27:58.149]  Now, what is going to be happening going forward?
[03:27:58.149 --> 03:28:04.831]  We have the Hill talking about Trump officials weighing the fate of the birth control mandate that Obama gave us.
[03:28:04.831 --> 03:28:12.594]  They say the era, and this is the way the Hill reports it, I want you to hear the way they spend this, the era of free birth control for women could be coming to an end.
[03:28:13.427 --> 03:28:15.428]  Now, I have to say this.
[03:28:15.428 --> 03:28:21.549]  One woman's free birth control is another woman's mandate to pay for it.
[03:28:21.549 --> 03:28:25.210]  And so that alone ought to be enough to stop this.
[03:28:25.210 --> 03:28:29.192]  And it should never have gone through and passed through the Supreme Court.
[03:28:29.192 --> 03:28:33.773]  Except that we had a Supreme Court Justice that I still to this day believe that Roberts was blackmailed.
[03:28:34.654 --> 03:28:39.461]  He wrote both the dissenting and the concurring opinion on Obamacare.
[03:28:39.461 --> 03:28:43.987]  So, you know, they said, well, no, we can't do this, but we can do it if we call it a tax, okay?
[03:28:43.987 --> 03:28:44.868]  Well, it's a mandate.
[03:28:44.868 --> 03:28:51.256]  And they go on to say in the Hill, the requirement that insurance companies cover contraception at no cost is believed to be on the chopping block now that Tom Price
[03:28:51.877 --> 03:28:54.680]  Has been put in charge of health and human services.
[03:28:54.680 --> 03:29:08.594]  They say conservative Republicans, this is the way they spend this again, conservative Republicans have opposed the mandate since it was issued by the Obama administration saying that it infringes on religious liberty by requiring employers to pay for contraception coverage regardless of their beliefs.
[03:29:08.594 --> 03:29:10.115]  That's another aspect of it.
[03:29:10.115 --> 03:29:12.638]  You should not be forced to pay for somebody else's health care.
[03:29:13.408 --> 03:29:17.771]  At the point of a gun, which is what is implied with the IRS enforcing this.
[03:29:17.771 --> 03:29:22.094]  But you should also not have to do it in addition to violating your religious beliefs.
[03:29:22.094 --> 03:29:27.197]  And of course it's not just conservative Republicans, it was the Supreme Court that agreed on that.
[03:29:27.197 --> 03:29:31.600]  And then they go on to say that reversing this would not require an act of Congress.
[03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:31.821]  Why?
[03:29:32.461 --> 03:29:35.764]  Because Congress already abdicated their authority over this.
[03:29:35.764 --> 03:29:44.711]  They punted it to the bureaucracy so the bureaucracy can undo it, just like Obama continued to enact things by executive order and Trump can undo those things by executive order as well.
[03:29:44.711 --> 03:29:46.592]  That's the hope that we have right now.
[03:29:46.592 --> 03:29:47.293]  Stay with us.
[03:29:47.293 --> 03:29:50.475]  We're going to come right back.
[03:29:50.475 --> 03:29:51.857]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.857 --> 03:29:54.399]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.399 --> 03:29:57.101]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.115 --> 03:30:09.123]  Last week, Bill Gates, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made a dystopic, bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could originate on a computer screen.
[03:30:09.123 --> 03:30:18.151]  By a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create synthetic viruses and super-contagions and deadly strains of the flu, he also said that this could kill tens of millions.
[03:30:18.311 --> 03:30:23.235]  A respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[03:30:23.235 --> 03:30:28.439]  And there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[03:30:28.439 --> 03:30:30.901]  But he's also said this at TED Talks.
[03:30:30.901 --> 03:30:32.903]  How we can get this down to zero?
[03:30:32.903 --> 03:30:34.604]  First we've got population.
[03:30:34.604 --> 03:30:41.350]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by
[03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:43.111]  Perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[03:30:43.111 --> 03:30:50.074]  Lowering population by 10 to 15 percent still wouldn't yield Bill's desired result of zero, but it would reduce population by a billion people.
[03:30:50.074 --> 03:30:58.019]  So Gates speaks of population reduction and mass killings while his foundation is vaccinating large portions of Earth and sending out genetically modified mosquitoes.
[03:30:58.019 --> 03:30:59.639]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.
[03:30:59.639 --> 03:31:00.340]  Sounds legit to me!
[03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:02.661]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:02.661 --> 03:31:04.682]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:04.682 --> 03:31:07.583]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:07.583 --> 03:31:13.646]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:13.646 --> 03:31:21.009]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[03:31:21.149 --> 03:31:22.831]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:22.831 --> 03:31:30.378]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:30.378 --> 03:31:38.406]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:38.406 --> 03:31:39.367]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:40.576 --> 03:31:44.501]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:44.501 --> 03:31:48.085]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:48.085 --> 03:31:54.813]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:54.813 --> 03:31:58.898]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:32:01.164 --> 03:32:03.006]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:32:03.006 --> 03:32:09.611]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:32:09.611 --> 03:32:12.773]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[03:32:12.773 --> 03:32:22.561]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[03:32:22.561 --> 03:32:23.402]  Caveman.
[03:32:23.402 --> 03:32:28.466]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:32:28.466 --> 03:32:30.588]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:32:30.868 --> 03:32:34.029]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:32:34.029 --> 03:32:39.170]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:32:39.170 --> 03:32:47.313]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:32:47.313 --> 03:32:55.255]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:32:55.255 --> 03:32:59.896]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullwarslife.com today.
[03:33:14.554 --> 03:33:19.398]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:33:19.398 --> 03:33:21.079]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:21.079 --> 03:33:22.721]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:22.721 --> 03:33:28.485]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.485 --> 03:33:32.268]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.268 --> 03:33:32.889]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:32.889 --> 03:33:35.511]  I want to get to this story that covered over the weekend.
[03:33:35.511 --> 03:33:37.613]  It really didn't get very much attention.
[03:33:37.613 --> 03:33:42.997]  The fact that we had Vice President Pence go to Munich on Saturday, then to Brussels on Monday.
[03:33:43.689 --> 03:33:46.538]  Declare his undying love for the European Union.
[03:33:46.538 --> 03:33:47.741]  Very, very different.
[03:33:47.741 --> 03:33:48.845]  Exactly opposite.
[03:33:49.514 --> 03:33:50.815]  Of what Donald Trump has been saying.
[03:33:50.815 --> 03:33:52.036]  So we're going to break that down.
[03:33:52.036 --> 03:33:53.678]  There's now a story today on Reuters.
[03:33:53.678 --> 03:33:55.439]  It was covered on the Drudge Report.
[03:33:55.439 --> 03:33:57.241]  Had it red-linked up at the top.
[03:33:57.241 --> 03:33:58.282]  So this is an update.
[03:33:58.282 --> 03:34:02.265]  We find out that the week before, Steve Bannon went to Germany as well.
[03:34:02.265 --> 03:34:07.130]  And so there's some sources in the German government that talked to Reuters about that.
[03:34:07.130 --> 03:34:08.471]  I want to cover that with an update.
[03:34:08.471 --> 03:34:10.813]  But first, I want an update.
[03:34:10.813 --> 03:34:14.236]  The story that was broken a couple of weeks ago by the Daily Caller.
[03:34:14.236 --> 03:34:15.897]  There were several brothers
[03:34:16.638 --> 03:34:22.323]  From Pakistan, they're working as very high-paid IT staffers for Democrats.
[03:34:22.323 --> 03:34:32.552]  And of course, they put them together in a pool, but some of the people that they're doing work for were people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the disgraced head of the DNC who was hacked and pwned in public.
[03:34:32.552 --> 03:34:33.213]  Remember all of that?
[03:34:33.835 --> 03:34:44.363]  We saw all of her collusion behind the scenes, her conspiracy with the media, with other people to make sure that Hillary Clinton got it, that Bernie Sanders didn't.
[03:34:44.363 --> 03:34:46.044]  So she left in disgrace, left the DNC.
[03:34:46.044 --> 03:34:51.108]  But then, on her own staff, she's got people who were, they found, hacking into their computers.
[03:34:51.528 --> 03:34:52.769]  Stealing computer equipment?
[03:34:52.769 --> 03:34:54.950]  So this was a couple of weeks ago.
[03:34:54.950 --> 03:35:07.177]  Now we find, and interestingly enough, surprise surprise, they were now taking $100,000 from Iraqi politicians while they were administering IT for the House Democrats.
[03:35:08.393 --> 03:35:17.584]  And at the time we looked at this, these brothers, they were making like between $160,000 and $165,000, far more than domestic IT staff that they hired.
[03:35:17.584 --> 03:35:19.426]  I don't know why these guys were making so much money.
[03:35:19.426 --> 03:35:20.147]  They were very young.
[03:35:20.147 --> 03:35:21.569]  One of these guys was making $160,000, was only 20 years old.
[03:35:23.886 --> 03:35:26.066]  And they were going bankrupt.
[03:35:26.066 --> 03:35:28.527]  They were all having their cars repossessed.
[03:35:28.527 --> 03:35:32.008]  It's like, how do you have your car repossessed when you're making that kind of money?
[03:35:32.008 --> 03:35:34.248]  I mean, did they buy McLarens or something?
[03:35:34.248 --> 03:35:52.532]  They got a million dollar hypercar and they can't afford the payments on it, so they go to... When you look at a situation like that and you've got somebody, and they pointed it out at the time, when you have somebody who is working in IT, working in a sensitive position, one of the things that you do to vet them from a security position is you look at their financial situation.
[03:35:53.211 --> 03:35:56.635]  Is this person behind on their mortgage payments?
[03:35:56.635 --> 03:35:57.716]  Behind on their car payments?
[03:35:57.716 --> 03:35:58.757]  Are their cars getting repossessed?
[03:35:58.757 --> 03:36:02.942]  Well, that's a real red flag because if they're doing that kind of stuff, then guess what?
[03:36:02.942 --> 03:36:08.328]  They might be stealing information from you and giving it to the Iraqis, who are giving them $100,000.
[03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:11.310]  So this thing continues to unfold.
[03:36:11.310 --> 03:36:13.851]  We're going to see more information about this.
[03:36:13.851 --> 03:36:15.852]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:36:15.852 --> 03:36:21.073]  The Democrats and the Muslims and their Democrat incompetence.
[03:36:21.073 --> 03:36:23.534]  It's a story that just keeps on giving.
[03:36:23.534 --> 03:36:26.835]  And we're going to find out more about this story as we go along.
[03:36:26.835 --> 03:36:29.476]  But I want to get to this new story from Reuters.
[03:36:30.481 --> 03:36:41.913]  Saying that before Pence did his Neville Chamberlain apology tour to the European Union, to the new, I guess we could call the European Union really, it's the Fourth Reich, isn't it?
[03:36:41.913 --> 03:36:47.098]  Hitler didn't succeed in taking over Europe, but the European Union did.
[03:36:48.137 --> 03:37:00.752]  They did it in the ash heaps of, actually, if you go back and look at the Bilderberg Conference, they had their first conference ten years after, and at the same place where the Germans had their last victory.
[03:37:02.043 --> 03:37:04.525]  And so they set that up right there.
[03:37:04.525 --> 03:37:06.326]  Not a coincidence, I don't think.
[03:37:06.326 --> 03:37:09.889]  We've talked about that at length, and especially if you look at the people who were involved.
[03:37:09.889 --> 03:37:13.132]  They were also involved in that Market Garden campaign.
[03:37:13.132 --> 03:37:16.255]  There was a betrayal of the people, the allies who were there.
[03:37:16.255 --> 03:37:19.217]  They knew they were coming, so there was espionage, there was undercover stuff.
[03:37:19.217 --> 03:37:21.860]  So, ten years after the date, they begin Bilderberg.
[03:37:21.860 --> 03:37:23.661]  And what's one of the first things that they do at Bilderberg?
[03:37:23.661 --> 03:37:25.543]  Well, they talk about how we've got to have a united Europe.
[03:37:26.365 --> 03:37:34.787]  We have to have political union, and one of the ways that we're going to achieve that is to have an economic union with the Euro.
[03:37:34.787 --> 03:37:36.428]  We're going to have a common currency.
[03:37:36.428 --> 03:37:37.848]  So they put that in place in 1955.
[03:37:37.848 --> 03:37:39.589]  It took them a while to do it.
[03:37:39.589 --> 03:37:41.249]  They did it very gradually.
[03:37:41.249 --> 03:37:42.950]  And now it is starting to unravel.
[03:37:43.965 --> 03:37:52.921]  We've had Donald Trump, we've had Steve Bannon, we've had Ted Malik, who is tipped to be Donald Trump's ambassador to the EU.
[03:37:52.921 --> 03:37:56.247]  They have all, in no uncertain terms, said what we want to see happen.
[03:37:57.117 --> 03:38:00.119]  is individual sovereignty from these Western European nations.
[03:38:00.119 --> 03:38:01.020]  That is the cure.
[03:38:01.020 --> 03:38:04.302]  We don't want to see a massive consolidated Europe.
[03:38:04.302 --> 03:38:06.083]  As a matter of fact, Ted Malek was very clear.
[03:38:06.083 --> 03:38:14.889]  He said, when he worked at the State Department before, he said, I had something to do with the breakup of the Soviet Union and I think it's time that we break up another union right now.
[03:38:14.889 --> 03:38:16.410]  So he's been very clear about this.
[03:38:16.410 --> 03:38:23.514]  Now we see this report, and of course we had to give you an update if you didn't see the report, Pence joins the EU.
[03:38:23.514 --> 03:38:25.356]  Pence went to Munich
[03:38:27.018 --> 03:38:28.739]  Like Neville Chamberlain.
[03:38:28.739 --> 03:38:37.342]  He said, the only thing he said that was contrary to what the Europeans wanted to hear was, hey, you guys have got to pay up for yourself, for your defense.
[03:38:37.342 --> 03:38:39.423]  Germany is only giving like 1.2%.
[03:38:39.423 --> 03:38:49.726]  All these NATO countries are required to give at least 2% of their budget, their GDP, they're required to contribute 2% of their GDP to NATO.
[03:38:49.726 --> 03:38:50.967]  So that's the only thing that he said.
[03:38:51.727 --> 03:38:52.969]  That they didn't want to hear.
[03:38:52.969 --> 03:38:53.950]  But he reassured them.
[03:38:53.950 --> 03:38:56.133]  He said, NATO is very important.
[03:38:56.133 --> 03:38:59.237]  It is not obsolete, as Donald Trump had said.
[03:38:59.237 --> 03:39:06.988]  And then he goes to Brussels, the heart of the European Union, on Monday and gives a glowing endorsement of the European Union.
[03:39:07.894 --> 03:39:16.725]  Some of the things that he said was, after I came out of the meeting, Donald Tux said I wanted to ask him about three things, and one of them was the idea of a united Europe.
[03:39:16.725 --> 03:39:18.427]  He gave us everything that we asked for.
[03:39:18.427 --> 03:39:24.354]  He gave us, and Pence said, we have a strong commitment to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union.
[03:39:25.117 --> 03:39:26.938]  He didn't say we want to see it disappear.
[03:39:26.938 --> 03:39:28.279]  So this is why they did this.
[03:39:28.279 --> 03:39:33.621]  And of course, The Guardian said Pence sounded exactly like Joe Biden.
[03:39:33.621 --> 03:39:34.742]  What a surprise!
[03:39:34.742 --> 03:39:46.588]  Because you've got Pence, you've got Priebus, you've got these people who are part of the Republican establishment, and they always sound like the establishment Democrats, don't they, when it comes to international matters like this?
[03:39:46.588 --> 03:39:49.830]  As a matter of fact, though, I said last night, I believe that he truly is.
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:53.041]  A George H.W.
[03:39:53.041 --> 03:39:59.783]  Bush to Trump, because we saw that George H.W.
[03:39:59.783 --> 03:40:03.864]  Bush really was the establishment's man pushing back against Ronald Reagan at the time.
[03:40:03.864 --> 03:40:07.926]  But now, this article today from Reuters that I was talking about, in the week before U.S.
[03:40:07.926 --> 03:40:13.768]  Vice President Mike Pence visited Brussels and pledged America's steadfast and enduring commitment to the European Union,
[03:40:14.588 --> 03:40:21.453]  White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon met with a German diplomat and he delivered a different message according to people familiar with the talks.
[03:40:21.453 --> 03:40:32.802]  Reuters says, Bannon and these people said, signaled to Germany's ambassador to Washington that he viewed the EU as a flawed construct and he favored conducting relations with Europe on a bilateral basis.
[03:40:32.802 --> 03:40:36.825]  In other words, we're going to deal directly with Germany.
[03:40:36.825 --> 03:40:38.947]  We're going to deal directly with England.
[03:40:38.947 --> 03:40:40.928]  We're going to deal directly with France.
[03:40:42.008 --> 03:40:45.470]  We're not going to deal directly with the European Union.
[03:40:45.470 --> 03:40:53.574]  What we'd prefer to do is to deal directly with these individual countries, bilaterally, not multilaterally, through the EU.
[03:40:53.574 --> 03:41:00.457]  And of course, that's what we've heard from Trump, that's what we've heard from Ted Malik, and now they're saying that's what they heard from Steve Bannon the week before Pence went.
[03:41:00.457 --> 03:41:02.078]  A White House official who checked with Bannon
[03:41:02.638 --> 03:41:08.568]  In response to this Reuters article, confirmed the meeting had taken place but said the account provided to Reuters was inaccurate.
[03:41:08.568 --> 03:41:11.513]  He said they only spoke for about three minutes and it was just a quick hello.
[03:41:11.513 --> 03:41:13.256]  So the question is this.
[03:41:13.256 --> 03:41:14.578]  Are we seeing now a setup?
[03:41:15.487 --> 03:41:19.591]  Of Bannon, like we saw a setup of Flynn with Pence at the center of this.
[03:41:19.591 --> 03:41:29.280]  Remember, it was Pence who was so embarrassed that Flynn casually mentioned the sanctions or whatever when he's talking, doing his job to the Russians.
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:36.607]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed and I, you know, he lied to me, he misled me and I don't, I still to this day do not believe that Flynn lied to him.
[03:41:36.607 --> 03:41:38.949]  I believe it was something that was mentioned casually in passing.
[03:41:39.614 --> 03:41:47.399]  That he didn't think it was relevant, that it wasn't relevant, and yet Pence used that as a wedge to get him removed.
[03:41:48.266 --> 03:41:51.147]  Is he going to use this as a wedge to get Bannon removed?
[03:41:51.147 --> 03:41:58.248]  Because they're going to go after every single person who is not a part of the establishment Republicans and Democrats.
[03:41:58.248 --> 03:42:05.050]  And they go on to say, Bannon's message, though, was similar to the one that he delivered to the Vatican conference back in 2014.
[03:42:05.050 --> 03:42:10.971]  In those remarks, he spoke favorably about a European populist movement and described a yearning for nationalism.
[03:42:10.971 --> 03:42:13.232]  So people don't believe in this kind of pan
[03:42:14.324 --> 03:42:15.745]  European Union.
[03:42:15.745 --> 03:42:20.128]  Western Europe, Bannon said at the time, was built on a foundation of strong nationalist movements.
[03:42:20.128 --> 03:42:23.290]  I think it's what can see us forward.
[03:42:23.290 --> 03:42:30.476]  They say they encounter unsettled people in the German government, and they were holding out hope that Bannon might temper his views once in government.
[03:42:30.476 --> 03:42:33.358]  See, they didn't believe that he really believed this stuff.
[03:42:33.358 --> 03:42:38.821]  They thought once he gets power, he's going to say and do whatever he needs to keep that power.
[03:42:38.821 --> 03:42:38.962]  No.
[03:42:39.986 --> 03:42:42.749]  No, just like Trump, he really meant what he said.
[03:42:42.749 --> 03:43:02.387]  And so the question is, as we see this division, as we see these guys coming there, you know, when he spoke in Brussels, Tusk came out and although he said, we got everything we wanted, he then took a swipe at Pence and a swipe at Trump and railed against the, quote, brute force, egoism and arrogance
[03:43:03.539 --> 03:43:05.460]  of the Trump administration.
[03:43:05.460 --> 03:43:08.060]  So that's how they respond when you give them overtures.
[03:43:08.060 --> 03:43:14.102]  They respond in the same way that Hitler responded to the weak Neville Chamberlain when he went there to appease them.
[03:43:14.102 --> 03:43:16.343]  This is what we can expect from the European Union.
[03:43:16.343 --> 03:43:23.224]  What they wanted to see was if Bannon and Trump and Ted Malik are going to stick to their guns, and they will.
[03:43:23.224 --> 03:43:27.326]  But the question is, will there be a division that will force them out?
[03:43:27.326 --> 03:43:28.126]  What is Trump going to do?
[03:43:28.962 --> 03:43:33.004]  Clearly, there's a lot of Europeans who don't believe what Pence said.
[03:43:33.004 --> 03:43:34.505]  They think that's not the policy.
[03:43:34.505 --> 03:43:37.827]  Because he's saying one thing, and the President is saying something else.
[03:43:37.827 --> 03:43:51.655]  And as they point out, with elections looming in the Netherlands, France, and Germany, this year European officials said they hoped that Pence, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could convince Trump to work constructively with the EU.
[03:43:51.655 --> 03:43:54.196]  This is what I was concerned about.
[03:43:54.196 --> 03:43:55.497]  We're looking at Tillerson and others.
[03:43:56.212 --> 03:44:07.216]  I said if you're going to get somebody to work with you, or you're going to have them running in a three-legged race, you better make sure that the guy is going to be running in the same direction as you, if you're in a three-legged race.
[03:44:07.216 --> 03:44:12.817]  You've got to make sure that he's not running in the opposite direction to a different goal.
[03:44:12.817 --> 03:44:20.260]  And so now we've got people who say, well, you know, Trump wants to have different people giving different opinions, and now we've got different opinions being given in Brussels.
[03:44:20.260 --> 03:44:22.801]  So that's a very dangerous situation that we've got going on there.
[03:44:24.605 --> 03:44:26.847]  I was just going to pop in and tell you.
[03:44:26.847 --> 03:44:28.909]  The internet takeover has begun.
[03:44:28.909 --> 03:44:30.690]  The Google algorithms, the articles are coming out.
[03:44:30.690 --> 03:44:33.692]  They're delisting libertarian, nationalistic, patriot sites.
[03:44:33.692 --> 03:44:36.114]  They're covering up Islamic terror.
[03:44:36.114 --> 03:44:38.216]  The Pope says Islamic terror doesn't exist.
[03:44:38.216 --> 03:44:39.557]  They're creating an alternate reality.
[03:44:39.557 --> 03:44:42.339]  They're moving against advertising platforms everywhere.
[03:44:42.339 --> 03:44:43.660]  They're coming after everybody.
[03:44:43.660 --> 03:44:45.262]  They've stolen the internet.
[03:44:45.262 --> 03:44:50.266]  They've made themselves the artificial false net neutrality where you've got to go through them.
[03:44:50.266 --> 03:44:53.689]  And now they are announcing that we're delegitimized and saying
[03:44:54.833 --> 03:44:57.414]  In the New York Times, we need to be arrested and shut up.
[03:44:57.414 --> 03:45:01.415]  But first they'll cut our funding off, diminish us before they come next level.
[03:45:01.415 --> 03:45:04.736]  That's why they're walking on the fighting side of us right now.
[03:45:04.736 --> 03:45:06.797]  That's why this is a maximum alert.
[03:45:06.797 --> 03:45:09.598]  And I hope Google and this whole globalist AI program would have rolled over.
[03:45:09.598 --> 03:45:10.278]  They're not.
[03:45:10.278 --> 03:45:11.359]  Trump needs to break them up.
[03:45:12.139 --> 03:45:18.561]  They were set up through NASA, through deep state operators of the CIA, and they're working against this country, and they're so belligerent.
[03:45:18.561 --> 03:45:23.642]  We had an election and elected our president, and they're saying, no, you're not in charge, Google.
[03:45:23.642 --> 03:45:25.823]  You're not in charge, AdRoll.
[03:45:25.823 --> 03:45:27.964]  And Trump called the media the enemy?
[03:45:27.964 --> 03:45:31.445]  They're just the minions and the sellouts and the mercenaries and the scum.
[03:45:31.445 --> 03:45:31.985]  That's right.
[03:45:31.985 --> 03:45:38.227]  It's the people that are on top, the technocrats that worked all this out, like Bill Gates.
[03:45:38.227 --> 03:45:39.327]  They're the real enemies.
[03:45:40.393 --> 03:45:41.735]  And so I'm normally very controlled.
[03:45:41.735 --> 03:45:43.097]  I try not to cuss on air and things.
[03:45:43.097 --> 03:45:44.839]  We delete it out for stations.
[03:45:44.839 --> 03:45:46.561]  But here's the deal.
[03:45:46.561 --> 03:45:49.305]  If the people just move, we're going to defeat these folks.
[03:45:49.305 --> 03:45:50.006]  But here's the thing.
[03:45:50.006 --> 03:45:51.969]  You have to know the assault's happening now.
[03:45:51.969 --> 03:45:53.411]  And all of us have to get upset.
[03:45:53.411 --> 03:45:56.334]  And we have to codify it and lay it out and break it down.
[03:45:56.334 --> 03:45:57.736]  Because it's all being done by stealth.
[03:45:58.655 --> 03:46:00.295]  We've got to follow the lawsuits.
[03:46:00.295 --> 03:46:09.678]  We've got to take the action, and you've got to financially buy the products and spread the articles and the videos through your email list and on other platforms, not just Facebook and Twitter, because everywhere.
[03:46:09.678 --> 03:46:14.739]  I told you, I saw three videos that had over 20 million views on our own Facebook alone.
[03:46:14.739 --> 03:46:18.120]  And the New York Times was like, yeah, you said there was a video with 12 million views.
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:19.600]  It was like 12 million when I saw it.
[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:20.420]  The other two was 20 million.
[03:46:20.420 --> 03:46:21.261]  It was Paul, and I went and looked.
[03:46:21.261 --> 03:46:22.321]  It was gone.
[03:46:22.321 --> 03:46:22.581]  Yeah.
[03:46:22.581 --> 03:46:23.061]  It was gone.
[03:46:23.061 --> 03:46:23.941]  And Paul's like, yeah, I saw that.
[03:46:23.941 --> 03:46:24.461]  Everybody saw it.
[03:46:24.461 --> 03:46:25.302]  We showed it on air.
[03:46:25.302 --> 03:46:26.322]  We have video of it.
[03:46:26.322 --> 03:46:26.802]  It's gone!
[03:46:28.083 --> 03:46:29.164]  Twelve million views!
[03:46:29.164 --> 03:46:29.905]  That's what they do!
[03:46:29.905 --> 03:46:34.189]  They're just... Because folks, they tried to ignore us and act like we didn't exist.
[03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:38.113]  Now it's admitted that InfoWars, every week, rivals the Super Bowl.
[03:46:38.113 --> 03:46:39.134]  In viewers.
[03:46:39.134 --> 03:46:40.255]  So what are they gonna do?
[03:46:40.255 --> 03:46:41.356]  Well, they're gonna try to shut us down.
[03:46:41.356 --> 03:46:42.557]  A lot of people are like, good!
[03:46:42.557 --> 03:46:43.799]  I'm sick of InfoWars.
[03:46:43.799 --> 03:46:46.321]  You know, I've got my own radio show, it's not as big.
[03:46:46.321 --> 03:46:49.104]  InfoWars makes your show bigger than other networks.
[03:46:49.104 --> 03:46:50.946]  We're trying to raise the tide of humanity.
[03:46:50.946 --> 03:46:51.907]  We're not in competition.
[03:46:53.075 --> 03:46:54.637]  And this is it.
[03:46:54.637 --> 03:46:55.718]  They are trying big.
[03:46:55.718 --> 03:46:57.160]  I believe they're going to fail.
[03:46:57.160 --> 03:46:59.502]  But people have never seen me this focused or angry.
[03:46:59.502 --> 03:47:03.747]  It's because we have plans for the next year that the enemy knows are going to be successful.
[03:47:03.747 --> 03:47:04.828]  And I just want to warn them.
[03:47:04.828 --> 03:47:05.869]  You saw this congressman.
[03:47:06.894 --> 03:47:13.158]  Come out, who was the former, you know, Vice-Head of the Homeland Security Committee, and a lot of other things.
[03:47:13.158 --> 03:47:18.902]  And the, yeah, Kurt Weldon, the Armed Services Committee.
[03:47:18.902 --> 03:47:20.743]  And he said, look, I'm not shutting up anymore.
[03:47:20.743 --> 03:47:24.085]  I know who the real Russian agents are and the communist agents are from China.
[03:47:24.085 --> 03:47:25.526]  I'm bringing them down.
[03:47:25.526 --> 03:47:27.007]  And they reached out.
[03:47:27.007 --> 03:47:28.248]  It's way beyond Fight Club.
[03:47:28.248 --> 03:47:32.031]  I mean, the other people reaching out, the phone calls, it's just, it's like,
[03:47:32.651 --> 03:47:35.612]  And everybody's like, they're pure evil, they're pedophiles, we gotta fight them.
[03:47:35.612 --> 03:47:41.314]  It's like people know, and everybody that already knew but couldn't get the public to wake up, now that the public's awake, they're ready to move.
[03:47:41.314 --> 03:47:47.655]  It's like in V for Vendetta, the inspector, the head of detectives, says, why didn't you do this before?
[03:47:47.655 --> 03:47:48.576]  I mean, why didn't you speak out?
[03:47:48.576 --> 03:47:50.236]  He goes, I was waiting for you, inspector.
[03:47:50.236 --> 03:47:52.297]  I was waiting for you.
[03:47:52.297 --> 03:47:53.617]  Well, they now know we're awake.
[03:47:53.617 --> 03:47:56.318]  They knew the plan was to bring in hardcore, hot tyranny.
[03:47:57.216 --> 03:47:58.217]  When O'Killary got in.
[03:47:58.217 --> 03:47:59.377]  They admitted it all.
[03:47:59.377 --> 03:48:02.279]  And so people just went, come to Jesus, we gotta do the right thing.
[03:48:02.279 --> 03:48:06.121]  We've got a beachhead right now, but man, they're moving.
[03:48:06.121 --> 03:48:09.482]  Well, it's like the Chinese character for crisis.
[03:48:09.482 --> 03:48:11.203]  It's danger and opportunity.
[03:48:11.203 --> 03:48:12.684]  This is a very dangerous moment.
[03:48:12.684 --> 03:48:18.887]  We're right here on the edge of a knife, and we have an opportunity to do something about it with Trump in power.
[03:48:18.887 --> 03:48:21.729]  But it's a very dangerous situation, and it could go either way.
[03:48:22.805 --> 03:48:36.500]  They should look though at the Netherlands and Spain and Italy and France and Brazil and everywhere else where nationalist movements are exploding and the poll numbers show it and no amount of fake elections are ever even going to be able to expose that, you know, stop that.
[03:48:36.500 --> 03:48:41.805]  And so this is an incredible time to be alive right now and I just hope people realize
[03:48:42.574 --> 03:48:44.195]  We're not saying we're wonderful.
[03:48:44.195 --> 03:48:45.035]  We don't want to be slaves.
[03:48:45.035 --> 03:48:46.356]  This is a normal behavior.
[03:48:46.356 --> 03:48:55.861]  But if people realize what we're going through to bring you this information, we're not bringing this stuff out about Russia funding Hillary in the last 20 years to bash Russia.
[03:48:55.861 --> 03:49:00.684]  We know the globalists have ganged up on Russia, controlled it, their allies trying to get away from globalism.
[03:49:00.684 --> 03:49:02.024]  We're not even bashing the Chinese people.
[03:49:02.024 --> 03:49:03.025]  It's the Communist Chinese.
[03:49:03.025 --> 03:49:07.267]  But Hillary and them claiming Trump's this, trying to bring him down, it's a total lie.
[03:49:07.267 --> 03:49:09.348]  And people in government that know are going to bring it all out.
[03:49:09.348 --> 03:49:09.989]  It's already coming out.
[03:49:10.609 --> 03:49:15.810]  I mean, we're already getting, you know, secret documents, stuff like that, that, you know, bring to Kurt Weldon and he goes, yeah, that's real.
[03:49:15.810 --> 03:49:17.871]  See, I mean, just get more is coming.
[03:49:17.871 --> 03:49:19.311]  So they want to fight.
[03:49:19.311 --> 03:49:20.331]  I mean, I'm not scared at all.
[03:49:20.331 --> 03:49:21.311]  I got so much energy.
[03:49:21.311 --> 03:49:22.972]  I feel like line 20 dudes up.
[03:49:22.972 --> 03:49:24.552]  I'm ready to go to town, you know, physically.
[03:49:24.552 --> 03:49:25.412]  I'm not saying I'm gonna be violent.
[03:49:25.412 --> 03:49:26.372]  You know what I mean?
[03:49:26.372 --> 03:49:26.632]  I'm ready.
[03:49:26.632 --> 03:49:27.632]  I was born for this.
[03:49:27.632 --> 03:49:28.313]  Okay.
[03:49:28.313 --> 03:49:33.654]  And all their crap and all, it seems like anytime I'm exhausted and not wanting to do this anymore, I just kind of go half assed.
[03:49:33.654 --> 03:49:34.874]  They pull another thing.
[03:49:35.254 --> 03:49:37.697]  And they just don't get who we are versus who they are, David.
[03:49:37.697 --> 03:49:38.938]  I mean, I know you well.
[03:49:38.938 --> 03:49:39.459]  You're a family guy.
[03:49:39.459 --> 03:49:40.580]  You're not out looking to be a tough guy.
[03:49:40.580 --> 03:49:42.562]  But somebody tries to intimidate you and stop you.
[03:49:42.562 --> 03:49:43.183]  What's it make you do?
[03:49:43.183 --> 03:49:43.903]  That's right.
[03:49:43.903 --> 03:49:44.684]  It makes you angry.
[03:49:44.684 --> 03:49:45.965]  It gets you energized.
[03:49:45.965 --> 03:49:46.746]  Absolutely.
[03:49:46.746 --> 03:49:47.107]  Absolutely.
[03:49:47.107 --> 03:49:48.909]  So they want to fight.
[03:49:48.909 --> 03:49:50.030]  They better believe they got one.
[03:49:51.118 --> 03:49:52.119]  Go ahead, sorry, I'm going to get out of here.
[03:49:52.119 --> 03:49:54.741]  Well, you know what you're talking about in terms of things disappearing.
[03:49:54.741 --> 03:49:59.065]  I want to go through and look at this Sweden thing, because now this has become the brunt of jokes.
[03:49:59.065 --> 03:50:02.548]  Yeah, yeah, Sweden, there's no Islamists raping, it's not the capital of rape in Europe.
[03:50:02.548 --> 03:50:02.888]  No problem.
[03:50:02.888 --> 03:50:04.329]  There's no Islamic crime, everything's fine.
[03:50:04.329 --> 03:50:14.718]  So we got this article in The Guardian, and they're talking about the fact that last night we had Colbert, and we had Seth Meyers, and they're just laughing, haha, nothing in Sweden, nothing to see.
[03:50:14.718 --> 03:50:17.200]  Oh, you know, he's- Trump's going to lose, haha.
[03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:24.286]  He actually saw this on Fox News, and he actually confuses Fox News with reality, is what Seth Meyers said.
[03:50:24.286 --> 03:50:33.755]  And then you've got Colbert saying, well, we're going to have... Oh, notice we've got Fox News now, and the neocons more and more teaming up with the collapsing left.
[03:50:33.755 --> 03:50:37.339]  The whole system's just desperate together, trying to prop their hill of crap up.
[03:50:37.799 --> 03:50:42.603]  Yeah, he's got this comedy thing saying, never fjorget, okay, fjorget.
[03:50:42.603 --> 03:50:44.084]  We're going to talk about what's going on with it.
[03:50:44.084 --> 03:50:45.985]  We're going to talk about how the Washington Post spins this.
[03:50:45.985 --> 03:50:48.307]  Terrorist burning, Islamic invasion.
[03:50:48.307 --> 03:50:48.667]  That's right.
[03:50:48.667 --> 03:50:50.249]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:50:50.249 --> 03:50:57.934]  We're going to talk about the riots and how it is spun by the Washington Post, even saying, hey, these police that were talked about, they recanted that.
[03:50:57.934 --> 03:51:00.216]  Well, no, we've got other police saying the same thing.
[03:51:00.216 --> 03:51:00.757]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.340 --> 03:51:01.600]  I think so.
[03:51:21.707 --> 03:51:30.111]  Xtendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.

[03:53:04.237 --> 03:53:06.759]  Did you quit using that computer, or did you buy a new one?
[03:53:06.759 --> 03:53:08.481]  Well, I called Geeks On Site.

[03:54:13.959 --> 03:54:15.763]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[03:54:16.533 --> 03:54:21.416]  So we've been talking about the fact that we've been removed by AdRoll in terms of serving ads.
[03:54:21.416 --> 03:54:22.496]  We have now responded.
[03:54:22.496 --> 03:54:31.181]  One of the ways we're going to respond is with a special, the InfoWars, Defend InfoWars specials that have now gone live at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:31.181 --> 03:54:34.182]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 33% off.
[03:54:34.182 --> 03:54:36.604]  Supermail Vitality, 25% off.
[03:54:36.604 --> 03:54:38.665]  Brain Force, 25% off.
[03:54:38.665 --> 03:54:42.847]  And the Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs, just $19.95.
[03:54:42.847 --> 03:54:44.528]  Folks, we are not supported.
[03:54:45.208 --> 03:54:46.528]  By government funding.
[03:54:46.528 --> 03:54:52.370]  We're not given grants by people like Soros, like MSNBC and others are.
[03:54:52.370 --> 03:54:58.212]  When we look at how we're going to fund the operation, Alex looks at it like a capitalist, because that's what we say, well, you know, what can I do?
[03:54:58.212 --> 03:55:01.753]  I need to sell something to people in order to support my operation.
[03:55:01.753 --> 03:55:06.694]  So we go out and we get the very best products that we can, offer them at the very best price that we can.
[03:55:06.694 --> 03:55:08.635]  That's how we choose to fund our operation.
[03:55:08.635 --> 03:55:09.615]  You have to do that.
[03:55:09.615 --> 03:55:10.795]  We need to be able to advertise.
[03:55:10.795 --> 03:55:13.536]  And so now they're trying to cut off our ability to advertise.
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:18.003]  So they can't get a boycott on us because we don't have sponsors.
[03:55:18.003 --> 03:55:20.985]  But they can try to shut down the way that we communicate to people.
[03:55:20.985 --> 03:55:24.067]  So if you want to support us, take advantage of these specials.
[03:55:24.067 --> 03:55:26.489]  Again, we try to have a win-win situation with you.
[03:55:26.489 --> 03:55:30.512]  That's why we put these things on special when we need to fund InfoWars.
[03:55:30.512 --> 03:55:41.420]  So we've put these things like Colloidal Silver, Supermail Vitality, BrainForce at 25 to 33% off the Defend InfoWars special now live at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:41.420 --> 03:55:42.281]  I want to take a quick look.
[03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:44.610]  At what's going on in Sweden.
[03:55:44.610 --> 03:55:49.795]  As I started to talk about it, of course, all the comedy show hosts are yucking it up last night.
[03:55:49.795 --> 03:55:50.575]  Oh, look at this.
[03:55:50.575 --> 03:55:53.678]  Supposedly we got attacks in Sweden.
[03:55:53.678 --> 03:55:57.101]  And then we have riots in Sweden to back him up.
[03:55:57.739 --> 03:56:06.723]  And we've been talking about how there has been an explosion in rapes and serious crimes in Sweden because they've taken far more than the rest of Europe.
[03:56:06.723 --> 03:56:11.365]  They have the highest per capita number of people that they've taken in in terms of refugees.
[03:56:11.365 --> 03:56:16.408]  And in the places where it has been concentrated, as we had the story yesterday, Paul Joseph Watson put it up in Malmo.
[03:56:17.423 --> 03:56:24.645]  They had about 43%, if I remember the numbers correctly, 43% of the population is immigrant and about 90% of those are Muslim.
[03:56:24.645 --> 03:56:27.005]  They have a crime wave explosion.
[03:56:27.005 --> 03:56:30.966]  So, what does the Washington Post do when you actually have a riot two days after?
[03:56:30.966 --> 03:56:40.368]  Well, they say, on February 20th, that was yesterday, as the talk show hosts are yucking it up and having a lot of fun with, oh no, there's no problem in Sweden.
[03:56:41.048 --> 03:56:45.129]  We don't have anybody who's a card-carrying member of a specific organization.
[03:56:45.129 --> 03:56:52.692]  No, it's just a widespread crime wave that's been caused by the open border and the immigration policies of the government there that they're trying to cover up.
[03:56:52.692 --> 03:56:56.373]  So they say on February 20th, riots broke out in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood.
[03:56:56.373 --> 03:57:02.535]  The riots come two days after President Trump implied that immigrants had perpetrated a recent spate of violence in Sweden.
[03:57:03.115 --> 03:57:07.578]  And I say, just two days after President Trump provoked widespread consternation.
[03:57:07.578 --> 03:57:08.719]  Do you hear that?
[03:57:08.719 --> 03:57:11.301]  First, they imply that Trump is to blame, of course.
[03:57:11.301 --> 03:57:16.324]  It doesn't vindicate Trump to see these riots that went on for over four hours.
[03:57:16.324 --> 03:57:17.825]  A crowd burned about a half dozen cars.
[03:57:17.825 --> 03:57:19.747]  They vandalized several shop fronts.
[03:57:19.747 --> 03:57:21.348]  They threw rocks at the police.
[03:57:21.348 --> 03:57:23.069]  They went after a photographer.
[03:57:23.069 --> 03:57:24.370]  He was attacked by a dozen men.
[03:57:24.370 --> 03:57:25.391]  They stole his camera.
[03:57:25.391 --> 03:57:28.913]  Okay, but you know, hey, freedom of press, that's a great thing, right?
[03:57:28.913 --> 03:57:30.214]  They don't respect that either.
[03:57:30.214 --> 03:57:31.635]  And of course,
[03:57:32.972 --> 03:57:37.353]  They come out and they imply that Donald Trump is the one who is causing this.
[03:57:37.353 --> 03:57:39.174]  That he provoked this, is what he said.
[03:57:39.174 --> 03:57:41.755]  He provoked widespread consternation.
[03:57:41.755 --> 03:57:43.555]  That's the way the Washington Post does it.
[03:57:43.555 --> 03:57:46.416]  The official mouthpiece for the CIA.
[03:57:46.416 --> 03:57:50.397]  Then they go on and say that this was Tucker Carlson on Tonight.
[03:57:50.397 --> 03:57:54.298]  It featured filmmaker Amy Horowitz, Ami Horowitz.
[03:57:54.298 --> 03:57:56.699]  I think it's a guy, so he probably pronounces it Ami.
[03:57:57.259 --> 03:58:02.682]  But they said the two Swedish policemen that he interviewed that provided the basis for the report recanted that.
[03:58:02.682 --> 03:58:04.603]  They said, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:58:04.603 --> 03:58:09.106]  I told them what was happening and I think they had pressure.
[03:58:09.106 --> 03:58:12.108]  I think they disavowed this from pressure from their superiors.
[03:58:13.171 --> 03:58:21.035]  Tonight on the Nightly News, I'm going to cover this in more detail because we're out of time with this, but what I had here was articles going back to the first week of February.
[03:58:21.035 --> 03:58:25.138]  We had, first, one Swedish cop talk about what was going on with the violence.
[03:58:25.138 --> 03:58:28.439]  They came after him, and he says, I know they're going to come after me, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[03:58:28.439 --> 03:58:29.900]  And then another one came out, and guess what?
[03:58:29.900 --> 03:58:33.322]  They're not the two cops that Omri talked to.
[03:58:33.322 --> 03:58:35.663]  So this is, we're going to talk about that tonight.
[03:58:35.663 --> 03:58:36.944]  Join us, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:36.944 --> 03:58:38.525]  Eastern, for the InfoWars Nightly News.
