[00:00.000 --> 00:06.360]  This is the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:06.360 --> 00:07.960]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:07.960 --> 00:12.400]  Coming up, they're making their deep state coup move against the president.
[00:12.400 --> 00:13.600]  They're making a move on us.
[00:13.600 --> 00:17.080]  Top Democrats have officially announced a plan to completely deperson me from the internet,
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.600]  banking, and the world.
[00:18.600 --> 00:20.800]  As it is known, this is total tyranny.
[00:20.800 --> 00:22.840]  Senator Ron Wyden leading the charge.
[00:22.840 --> 00:23.840]  It's all coming up.
[00:23.840 --> 00:27.760]  But first, this critical report on the treasonous intelligence community that's hijacked this
[00:27.760 --> 00:30.200]  nation that Trump's trying to remove.
[00:30.200 --> 00:34.720]  There has never been a more treasonous atmosphere hovering over Washington, D.C. than there
[00:34.720 --> 00:35.720]  is today.
[00:35.720 --> 00:41.520]  The Daily Caller reports, Florida Democratic Representative, I'll See Hastings, made this
[00:41.520 --> 00:44.520]  joke about President Trump during a rally in Florida.
[00:44.520 --> 00:49.520]  He said, do you know the difference between a crisis and a catastrophe?
[00:49.520 --> 00:53.520]  And no one held their hands or every answer for us.
[00:53.520 --> 01:00.520]  He said, a crisis is if Donald Trump falls into the Potomac River and can't swim, and
[01:00.520 --> 01:08.960]  he said, at a catastrophe, as anybody sees, he says that.
[01:08.960 --> 01:14.280]  The left's constant barrage of death threats regarding the commander-in-chief has become
[01:14.280 --> 01:20.320]  par for the course, all in thanks to the narrative developed by the groaning sore losers from
[01:20.320 --> 01:21.920]  the intelligence community.
[01:21.920 --> 01:27.600]  Now you're seeing this collective response together with particular actors such as Robert
[01:27.600 --> 01:32.200]  Gates, General Petraeus, people who have not particularly been in the political fray, who
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.440]  remain really quiet.
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.000]  Some people thought because they were looking for new positions in the administration as
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  things shifted.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.400]  But you can see this is definitely a line that was crossed.
[01:41.400 --> 01:49.200]  And we take a significant offense at those who claim that John doesn't have integrity,
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.000]  that John liked the Congress, that John did this or John did that.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.680]  And so we wanted to push back against that.
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.800]  We wanted to be supportive of John's time in government.
[01:57.800 --> 02:05.120]  The fact that he's using a security clearance of a former CIA director as a pawn in his
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.560]  public relations strategy, I think, is just so reflective of somebody who, quite frankly,
[02:11.560 --> 02:15.760]  I don't want to use this term, maybe, but he's drunk on power.
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.760]  He really is.
[02:16.760 --> 02:19.720]  And I think he's abusing the powers of that office.
[02:19.720 --> 02:24.920]  I think right now this country is in a crisis in terms of what Mr. Trump has done and is
[02:24.920 --> 02:25.920]  liable to do.
[02:25.920 --> 02:34.000]  What really gets under my skin is Mr. Trump's lack of decency, integrity, honesty, and his
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.440]  act of commitment to this country's well-being and national security.
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.520]  Mr. Trump is motivated by whatever is in the best interests of Mr. Trump.
[02:42.520 --> 02:45.840]  That has been his modus operandi for decades.
[02:45.840 --> 02:47.440]  Why has the country turned around?
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.440]  You little liar?
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.520]  He was going to change once he assumed the solemn responsibilities of the office of
[02:51.520 --> 02:52.520]  presidency.
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.520]  That's why, for my first year, I sometimes spoke out when he was in front of the agency's
[02:57.520 --> 03:02.280]  memorial wall and spoke about his, the size of his inauguration crowd.
[03:02.280 --> 03:03.980]  But I did it very, very selectively.
[03:03.980 --> 03:05.320]  I gave him a year.
[03:05.320 --> 03:08.520]  I said, maybe he is going to adapt and change.
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.520]  But it seemed like...
[03:09.520 --> 03:10.520]  You never did that, you liar.
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.520] ...we did it every month, every month.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.200]  Things just got worse.
[03:13.200 --> 03:19.400]  And he did not live up to, I think, what Americans expect of the presence of the United States,
[03:19.400 --> 03:26.080]  to speak with great forcefulness, but to do it with integrity and honesty.
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.080]  Mr. Trump, time after time, I think, has really just disappointed millions of Americans,
[03:31.080 --> 03:33.200]  which I'm trying to give voice to.
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.200]  And so I know a lot of people think...
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.200]  Oh, the common people.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.200] ...that she should be doing this.
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.720]  I don't consider what I'm doing political at all.
[03:37.720 --> 03:38.720]  Like when you were in the Communist Party.
[03:38.720 --> 03:40.720]  I've never registered as a Republican or a Democrat.
[03:40.720 --> 03:41.720]  But you have to realize...
[03:41.720 --> 03:42.720]  No, that's right.
[03:42.720 --> 03:45.440]  He started his illustrious career by voting for the Communist Party.
[03:45.440 --> 03:48.960]  You know, that's who he wanted to win the presidency back in the 70s, so he voted for
[03:48.960 --> 03:49.960]  the Communist Party.
[03:49.960 --> 03:53.920]  When he came to be head of the CIA, I filibustered him, because I thought he was bad news from
[03:53.920 --> 03:54.920]  the very beginning.
[03:54.920 --> 04:00.240]  Brennan's delusional mind has even led him to believe he can sue the president over his
[04:00.240 --> 04:02.720]  cherished security clearance.
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.440]  And as expected, all is not well in Treasonville.
[04:06.440 --> 04:12.440]  They are beginning to cannibalize their misguided mission, turning on each other and the unraveling
[04:12.440 --> 04:13.440]  continues.
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.200]  As Zero Hedge reports, the FBI has been dealt a major blow after Washington, D.C., judge
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.440]  ruled that the agency must respond to a FOIA request for documents concerning the bureau's
[04:25.440 --> 04:32.040]  efforts to verify the controversial Steele dossier before it was used as the foundation
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.400]  of a FISA surveillance warrant application and subsequent renewals.
[04:37.400 --> 04:42.240]  Problem is, the Steele dossier isn't worth the paper it was printed on.
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.120]  Will the judge's FOIA request put an end to the Russia collusion fairy tale once and
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.120]  for all?
[04:48.120 --> 04:54.400]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com Well, yes, but it's not about Russia now.
[04:54.400 --> 04:59.040]  It's about paying off an old girlfriend, or it's about paying for your pet rabbit to
[04:59.040 --> 05:00.760]  be flown for your daughter.

[06:11.120 --> 06:15.120]  76 days to the most important election in U.S. history.
[06:15.120 --> 06:20.960]  To undoubtedly one of the most important elections in world history, the battle for the republic
[06:20.960 --> 06:21.960]  is here.
[06:21.960 --> 06:27.440]  It's Wednesday, August 22, 2018, I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from deep of the heart
[06:27.440 --> 06:32.800]  of Texas, the Central Texas Command Center, resisting the globalists, attempting to retake
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.720]  the republic with your help and friends around the world waking up as nationalists and populists
[06:37.720 --> 06:38.720]  as well.
[06:38.720 --> 06:43.520]  Like a lie, and Trump is surrounded by the hyenas, the lies, the fake indictments of every
[06:43.520 --> 06:48.920]  major republican going for reelection, let us know that this country is facing fifth
[06:48.920 --> 06:53.680]  generational warfare, but if we are aware of the globalists and who's funding them, we
[06:53.680 --> 06:59.400]  can take their offensive against us and let it be their water loo, their battle the bowls.
[06:59.400 --> 07:02.120]  This my friends, is the turning point.
[07:02.120 --> 07:08.120]  We stop them here, it'll be just like in World War II when Hitler was stopped in Russia
[07:08.120 --> 07:10.040]  and then the tide turned.
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.080]  Stay with us because this is the most banned broadcast in the world.
[07:14.080 --> 07:17.680]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.960]  You can feel it, you can see it, the enemy knows they're on the rocks.
[07:21.960 --> 07:26.520]  They know they are on the spikes, but they are fighting back and trying to take us with
[07:26.520 --> 07:27.520]  them.
[07:27.520 --> 07:29.400]  Even if they can take me out and take Trump out, they'll lose.
[07:29.400 --> 07:35.840]  I can see the long term permutations of this, because evil can froth and push and try to
[07:35.840 --> 07:41.040]  get control and it can dominate for so long, but once people are aware of it, well you
[07:41.040 --> 07:49.000]  know what Johnny Cash says, sooner or later their system comes down.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.880]  We knew it was coming, I could see the plan.
[07:52.880 --> 07:58.960]  I was not that important when they ran tens of thousands of articles a month last year
[07:58.960 --> 08:06.640]  and a half lying about me to make me a household name with everyone so that they could then
[08:06.640 --> 08:12.280]  set the Alex Jones precedent or the Alex Jones statute is what one of the crew members
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.240]  called it and now they're actually calling it that.
[08:15.240 --> 08:20.360]  You heard a fire in a theater, well now they're saying the Alex Jones rule, built on straw
[08:20.360 --> 08:26.760]  men things I never said and pushed by media that knowingly lied about WMDs and helped
[08:26.760 --> 08:33.000]  fund the Arab Spring and killed millions of people.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.640]  This is an interview with Recode with the very Nosferatu looking and behaving Senator
[08:38.640 --> 08:48.080]  Ron Wyden along with Senators Murphy and others.
[08:48.080 --> 08:56.920]  They are saying openly as well as Senator Warner that I must be removed from the internet
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.040]  itself and then I cannot even have infowars.com, we have the audio coming up.
[09:03.040 --> 09:12.120]  He then says but Alex Jones is only the first and the model, we're going to remove thousands
[09:12.120 --> 09:19.080]  of sites worse than him and he talks about how I'm a pollution and how I'm a disease
[09:19.080 --> 09:26.680]  just like Brian Stelter does, there's a handbook and then they re-up the lie about Sandy Hook,
[09:26.680 --> 09:30.560]  they say it's hurtful to say nobody died, they're the ones constantly saying it.
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.360]  I have talked to my lawyers and we are going to move against that because to say I'm being
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.840]  sued when they twisted what I said about Sandy Hook and then they say that I'm still saying
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.200]  what they said I said and then all of these groups and organizations saying in my words
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.120]  things I never even said if they're claiming that's hurtful to the families and they're
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.440]  the ones that are hurting the people, see how that works?
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.200]  And they say that I say there's Martian colonies with slave children, never said that and it's
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.000]  just unbelievable lies.
[10:04.000 --> 10:17.160]  So again we have Senator Murphy, Senator Wyden, Warner and others openly saying remove everyone,
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.320]  we're going to be going over that audio here in just a moment, we're going to walk through
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.440]  Michael Cohen who it turned out made something like 10 million dollars while the president
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.520]  was president-elect and president that Trump knew nothing about because Trump wouldn't
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.360]  take lobbyist and Cohen was doing it on his own and he was involved, he now pleads guilty
[10:37.360 --> 10:43.920]  in this corrupt cab service that Trump had nothing to do with and now because he is in
[10:43.920 --> 10:48.880]  all this trouble he's saying that oh I may come out and say that you know that Trump
[10:48.880 --> 10:57.720]  knew about the WikiLeaks hack and I may come out and say that Trump is this big criminal
[10:57.720 --> 11:01.320]  and that this was campaign violation.
[11:01.320 --> 11:12.920]  Obama had campaign violations in the hundreds of millions of dollars in just one election
[11:12.920 --> 11:18.960]  and it was 85 million in funds, they didn't marker say where they came from most of it
[11:18.960 --> 11:24.120]  foreign, totally illegal, 85 million dollars actually from foreign governments, the Chi
[11:24.120 --> 11:31.440]  Coms, the EU name it, that's even in Politico, but Trump hits women that he dated over 10
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.120]  years ago, it's incredible.
[11:34.120 --> 11:36.800]  So and then they got the former head of the federal elections commissioners come out and
[11:36.800 --> 11:43.800]  said this is not illegal but it doesn't matter folks because Hillary and all these people
[11:43.800 --> 11:51.040]  are up to their eyeballs and beyond in billions to their foundation, paper play, illegal servers
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.720]  that they put secret documents on as a drop box in her bathroom so other governments can
[11:55.720 --> 12:03.040]  break in and get it, it's well known, she didn't drop secrets off under a trash can
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.400]  or under a traffic cone or under a park bench like spies have been caught doing, you just
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.360]  put it in your server, you take this stuff illegally off the state department and you
[12:13.360 --> 12:17.960]  stick it all right there the most secret stuff knowing everybody can get it and then they
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.520]  go to her email and they say hey I want this information, she goes well donate a million
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.920]  dollars and you can talk to me on the phone, million gets you the conversation, once there's
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.680]  a million well then the hundreds of millions start flowing in and her looting Haiti and
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.040]  keeping 99% of the money and just everything we know the Clintons have done, Bill Clinton
[12:38.040 --> 12:44.000]  you know Trump's corrupt that's right he hurts women oh and now we're supposed to oh yes
[12:44.000 --> 12:53.840]  let's get him right ahead of this election this is so predictable so they want the impeachment
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.200]  they can't stand the country's coming back we have this cabal of Brennan's and Obama's
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.040]  and Clintons and Haydn's who just stay in there in this revolving door allowing their
[13:03.040 --> 13:11.560]  own people to commit all these incredible crimes and then meanwhile we've got representative
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.200]  Duncan Hunter a rising star great record out in California in a key district they can't
[13:17.200 --> 13:25.520]  seem to take and so oh he's being arraigned he's being indicted and I read the indictment
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.680]  they paid a couple hundred dollars for his daughter's pet rabbit to be flown on the plane
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.880]  and the secretary put it on the card of the congressman's office and not on his personal
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.720]  card oh and then the congressman's allowed to buy a staff dinner on campaign money but
[13:40.720 --> 13:47.720]  he bought him drinks and over the couple years it was thousands of dollars of drinks he's
[13:47.720 --> 13:54.600]  a horrible person and oh it's like Netanyahu his wife's been indicted because over a decade
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.040]  at state dinners she didn't pay for the food and at state dinners with world leaders at
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.800]  his house they had the government chef come in and pay for the food that's right and look
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.320]  all I'm saying is this is this is the standard for Trump and Republicans or Netanyahu because
[14:10.320 --> 14:16.800]  they're not in favor of the globalist and Soros doesn't like them so I was reading this the
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.920]  worst thing on there was an Italian vacation the hotel and stuff and it turned out he was
[14:22.920 --> 14:29.600]  doing liaison work while he was there yes it was a workcation but at worst he'd pay
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.080]  a small fine Obama paid fines 300 to something thousand dollars out of the campaign money
[14:35.080 --> 14:42.280]  for 80 something million that they improperly brought in and didn't label but the investigation
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.520]  stopped there because Obama's people were running it he just had to pay 300 to something
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.840]  thousand dollars but oh my gosh 80 something million that's okay but if you fly your daughter's
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.600]  pet rabbit or buy her two thousand dollars worth of video games bought his children two
[14:56.600 --> 15:00.520]  thousand dollars worth of video games where they're out on the road with him and they're
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.240]  in a hotel and he's telling the secretary yeah go buy him a PlayStation and buy him

[20:28.400 --> 20:37.080]  consistent about the globalists it's that they are corrupt they are power-seeking they
[20:37.080 --> 20:45.920]  are liars and they have formulaic ways of engaging in fraud and you could see them kicking
[20:45.920 --> 20:55.120]  myself and now thousands of other prominent well-spoken authoritative popular media individuals
[20:55.120 --> 21:00.760]  off of facebook off of twitter off of google off of apple platforms and now the purge is
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.280]  accelerated i'm going to get to shocking information the most incredible yet which proves everything
[21:06.280 --> 21:12.360]  that we were concerned about is dead on it's just a progression another mile marker on
[21:12.360 --> 21:21.280]  the road to 1984 but we're now 76 days out from the midterms the democrats are laser
[21:21.280 --> 21:27.720]  focused on inditing every republican member of the house they can they've indicted what
[21:27.720 --> 21:38.880]  just three of them in the last month all of it on just technicality stuff like they did
[21:38.880 --> 21:46.120]  tom delay of texas he was a record-raising fundraiser for republicans he was popular
[21:46.120 --> 21:52.400]  and what they do they indicted him five or six times it didn't matter it's took him
[21:52.400 --> 21:59.840]  every dollar he had millions of dollars and later he was found not guilty but over and
[21:59.840 --> 22:07.560]  over and over again they took him here in travis county democrat controlled they took
[22:07.560 --> 22:18.360]  him out of congress and they destroyed him and that's what they do they mean business
[22:18.360 --> 22:21.600]  and finally trump came along and stood up to him and they don't know what to do so this
[22:21.600 --> 22:26.040]  is up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com and this is where we are trump slams big
[22:26.040 --> 22:31.760]  tech censorship americans deserve same free speed rights as the media and our own millie
[22:31.760 --> 22:38.680]  weaver ran into jim acosta at this very rally last night and she's like you say that trumps
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.920]  trying to take your free speech he's not he's saying you're liars when you say that he's
[22:42.920 --> 22:48.440]  a traitor or the enemy and acosta walks around that and then she says well you want alex
[22:48.440 --> 22:54.640]  jones band on cnn and he goes well he said sandy hook didn't happen so imagine questioning
[22:54.640 --> 23:00.960]  a event five years ago when others questioned it and then saying okay i think it happened
[23:00.960 --> 23:04.320]  that's everybody's right to say that and then they always bring it back up like i'm saying
[23:04.320 --> 23:11.120]  it now and twisted and then say i don't have a right to speak with that little magic magic
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.360]  sandy hook term they use and that's what the lawsuits of all of this in the tens of thousands
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.200]  of articles every month is about positioning towards that you'll hear us senator calling
[23:20.200 --> 23:24.400]  for me to be totally banned from the web and quote thousands of others in just a moment
[23:24.400 --> 23:32.120]  senator ron white that videos up on info wars dot com we were talking to jim acosta and
[23:32.120 --> 23:37.560]  then the aggressive security guys you're just acting like he's some type of celebrity with
[23:37.560 --> 23:48.920]  a costa is a joke stories on info wars dot com but here's trump laying it out that these
[23:48.920 --> 23:52.840]  are public commons they've advertised them as commons and now they're screaming against
[23:52.840 --> 24:00.000]  conservatives and it will not be tolerated here it is and we're also standing up to social
[24:00.000 --> 24:07.280]  media censorship that's the new thing that's the new thing you know i'd rather have fake
[24:07.280 --> 24:18.480]  news like cnn i would rather have fake news so then have anybody including liberals socialists
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.280]  anything then have anybody stopped in sensing you gotta live we gotta live with it we gotta
[24:23.280 --> 24:27.080]  get used to it we're gonna live with fake news there's too many sources every one of
[24:27.080 --> 24:33.320]  us is sort of like a newspaper you have twitter you have whatever you have facebook but everyone
[24:33.320 --> 24:38.160]  you can't have censorship you can't pick one person and say well we don't like what he's
[24:38.160 --> 24:44.880]  been saying he's out so well live with fake news i mean i hate to say it but we have
[24:44.880 --> 24:52.160]  no choice because that's by far the better alternative we can't have people saying censorship
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.760]  because you know what it can turn around it can be them next it can be them next that's
[24:57.760 --> 25:01.720]  right he's absolutely on target of course i'm not banning me as the test case and then
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.520]  going on to quote thousands of other sites that are quote worse than jones and why because
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.360]  senator ron widen waves a magic wand of fake news that's cnn and msnbc lies about what
[25:12.360 --> 25:18.000]  i've said and done that even if i did the things they said i'd done i have a right
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.200]  to be on air but no they misrepresent and say that i said get your battle rifles and
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.720]  attack them where i offered a million dollar reward yesterday if you can show where i said
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.440]  use battle rifles on the media or get your battle rifles ready for the media i said antifa
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.200]  says they're coming to members of congress's house they've already attacked and shot people
[25:36.200 --> 25:41.080]  they're already attacking they say that they've dox law enforcement and ice hell i got a new
[25:41.080 --> 25:46.360]  video of a guy that said he was going to kill ice up in dallas and steven crowder went and
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.800]  tracked him down that's coming up next segment that's what i'm talking about so i'm sure
[25:50.800 --> 25:54.080]  saying we have to defensively have a right to protect ourselves and then they lie and
[25:54.080 --> 26:02.880]  twist it and then now off those lines senator ron widen says that we have the alex jones
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.040]  case now and now that we have that precedent in in mob behavior in congress and the democrats
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.080]  and and senator warner and all them saying we're gonna ban everybody jones isn't enough
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.240]  senator murphy they're running the plan with big tech and big tech wasn't listening to
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.800]  this just a year ago they thought trump might act against them so they kind of backed off
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.160]  but now they believe trumps gonna be gone they're making a move it's so bold it's so
[26:27.160 --> 26:32.960]  illegal and it's so dangerous folks we knew it was coming next i told you i was patient
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.960]  zero domino number one here he is on the recode radio show the full articles on info wars
[26:38.960 --> 26:47.440]  dot com here it is and so what i'm going to be trying to do in my legislation is to really
[26:47.440 --> 26:56.280]  lay out what the consequences are when somebody who is a bad actor somebody who really doesn't
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.960]  meet the decency right right the principles that refer talks to you like your little kid
[27:01.960 --> 27:07.600]  he looks like a cross between a vampire and you know sandusky or something in my view i
[27:07.600 --> 27:11.720]  mean you watch video and he's really creepy looks like a reptile he's really a sicko but
[27:11.720 --> 27:17.320]  his ideas are worse he's super anti-gun anti-family once open borders total globalist and he wants
[27:17.320 --> 27:22.800]  your free speech now and he says if we say someone's a bad actor if we say they're bad
[27:22.800 --> 27:28.320]  well then they're just memory hole they're bye bye let's go back to nasferatu the polls
[27:28.320 --> 27:34.520]  that reflect our values if that bad actor blows by the bounds of common decency i think
[27:34.520 --> 27:41.840]  you got to have a way to make sure that stuff is taken down so that's that that's a hornet's
[27:41.840 --> 27:45.520]  nest with people like this the idea of what they take down who decides there's a lot of
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.000]  people uncomfortable with tech companies deciding these things i think they do already by downgrading
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.040]  them i think they're already doing a version of that they're already making decisions why
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.160]  do you think they're resistant to it i know they're resistant to being called media companies
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.880]  i think that's precisely what they are the companies have because we're america lady
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.000]  and this is 1984 and these tech companies are about moral high ground they help run the censorship
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.560]  in china and get people arrested and executed which you guys go along with you're the people
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.640]  that invade all these innocent countries you're the monsters and you want to shut us up because
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.880]  you ghouls know the people are awake let's go back to it the companies have responsibilities
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.320]  they're monopoly yeah individually odd monopolies too because there's so many of them they are
[28:24.320 --> 28:30.720]  they are monopolies and these people that were innovators at the beginning and try and
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.560]  give consumers a fair a fair shake now seem to be interested in monetizing at um at all
[28:36.560 --> 28:43.760]  costs so by the way you know if we were talking about really horrible pornography i think
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.680]  they would have moved pretty quickly right you know to deal with it and i think it's
[28:47.680 --> 28:52.640]  also worth noting that with respect to alex jones are probably a thousand accounts out
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.400]  there that are as bad as alex jones right right there you go they're coming after everybody
[28:57.400 --> 29:05.800]  this is unbelievable let's talk tough let's talk comfort let's talk about down home value
[29:05.800 --> 29:13.440]  made in the usa blue jeans like you wore as a kid remember there's a place down in tennessee

[34:01.480 --> 34:08.200]  an absolute certain fact that senator sessions now attorney general is a hundred percent compromised
[34:08.200 --> 34:14.600]  or he's got dementia or a brain tumor or something i don't know the few speeches you see him give he
[34:14.600 --> 34:23.720]  can hardly talk he worships uh the real head of the justice department uh rosenstein they are
[34:24.760 --> 34:28.840]  doing nothing but now what in in dining three republican members of the house
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.880]  in just the last month and a half and they've got a whole bunch of others they're going to be
[34:33.880 --> 34:42.920]  in dining literally for things one one billionth as bad as what the clinton's did the clinton's took
[34:42.920 --> 34:46.520]  four billion dollars illegal their foundation stole three billion dollars from haydie
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.880]  had illegal servers hundreds of millions of dollars from the russians selling out our uranium
[34:52.920 --> 34:58.440]  i mean the list of crimes are staggering obama even politico admits mishandled eighty four
[34:58.440 --> 35:03.000]  million dollars in campaign contributions just in one round and he was fined three hundred and
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.720]  something thousand dollars so that'd be like charlie manson kills share and tate and a bunch
[35:09.720 --> 35:17.160]  other people and he gets a parking ticket uh but you get a parking ticket and you get the death
[35:17.160 --> 35:23.240]  penalty you park and don't pay the meter you get the death penalty that's congressman
[35:24.520 --> 35:30.760]  hunter out of california they paid to have his daughter's pet rabbit flown on the campaign money
[35:30.760 --> 35:35.480]  and bought drinks a bunch of times and dinner for the campaign people with the money which everybody
[35:35.480 --> 35:42.120]  does it's insane and now you've got michael cohan who we now know is running his own criminal
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.080]  enterprise he's pled guilty ten million dollars or more of illegal lobbying because trump wouldn't
[35:47.080 --> 35:53.160]  allow lobbying he just did it uh this the taxi service where's the collusion you have the former
[35:53.160 --> 35:57.080]  head of the federal elections commission i'm going to cover that right now roger stone coming out
[35:57.640 --> 36:04.680]  last night saying trump used his money and taxes were paid on the money and it went through his own
[36:04.680 --> 36:11.640]  company and then was paid through his lawyer and so it's totally legal but it doesn't even
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.160]  matter it's not russia gay if there's nothing there and i've got a special guest joining us the last
[36:17.160 --> 36:25.080]  30 minutes who actually broke some of the original information that was in politico last year about
[36:25.080 --> 36:30.760]  the real russian meddling but through leftist groups and sorrows through ukraine and we're
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.240]  gonna have the recordings everything the exclusive coming up on how that really happened and how the
[36:37.240 --> 36:44.120]  democrats and hillary and all of them were involved so real collusion but again none of it matters
[36:44.120 --> 36:51.160]  because jeff sessions is totally asleep at the switch whether he be compromised or whether he
[36:51.160 --> 36:57.880]  you know uh once the man twice the child i i don't know but i tell you this people are cowards
[36:57.880 --> 37:02.600]  they're rolling over and they're making their move on the president and you notice senator
[37:02.600 --> 37:12.360]  widen has joined other top senators democrats warner and murphy saying we want alex jones
[37:12.360 --> 37:17.640]  completely banned i just played the clip and there are thousands of sites as bad and they go on to
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.440]  say or worse it's like a 35 minute interview we're gonna play more coming up and they're just
[37:22.440 --> 37:27.320]  they're the authority they're the boss and cnn and the new york times are actually the watchdogs
[37:27.320 --> 37:31.640]  along with the southern probably lost center and media matters it's come out who actually get in your
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.520]  accounts and watch what you do and even know how much money you're getting paid by youtube it's all
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.920]  racketeering it's all torches interference and the point is they're going for broke because they
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.200]  control the justice department and trump before was saying don't censor people or i'll go after you
[37:46.200 --> 37:51.720]  google now they don't care they believe trumps can be taken out that's why suddenly you saw me be the
[37:51.720 --> 37:57.080]  first person to be purged they're making their move roger stone former head of the trump campaign
[37:57.080 --> 38:01.960]  former business partners they hadn't been partners in over a decade with paul manifold to respond to
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  manifold and and the jury and and and then now all of this and clearly they're making their move
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.080]  roger i want to get into all the inside baseball you've got for us but as it just stalled it is
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.720]  what i just said the last four or five minutes accurate yes i think you're right on the money
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.960]  alex and we've got some breaking news here in the segment but first let's talk about the results
[38:25.960 --> 38:32.920]  yesterday it's not surprising to me that manifold was convicted on eight counts what's shocking is
[38:33.640 --> 38:41.560]  that he was had 10 counts against him dismissed this is a stacked deck and the entire
[38:41.560 --> 38:50.280]  muller probe is an effort to undo the results of that last election now when rod rosenstein was
[38:50.280 --> 38:56.440]  appointed deputy attorney general with the assistance of former white house chief of staff
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.400]  ryan's previous they put in front of the president a document which changed the order
[39:03.400 --> 39:11.560]  of succession uh at the justice department you will recall when president nixon ordered the
[39:11.560 --> 39:18.840]  firing of watergate special counsel archibald cox the decision first went to attorney general
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.000]  alia richardson he declined and resigned then it went to the first deputy attorney general
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.040]  william ruckels house he declined and resigned then it went to the solicitor general robert
[39:32.040 --> 39:38.440]  bork who carried out the president's order that is no longer the line of succession
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.080]  rosenstein put a document in front of the president which they told him was a housekeeping
[39:43.080 --> 39:50.520]  matter that changes the line of succession from sessions to rosenstein to a u.s attorney in texas
[39:50.520 --> 39:57.480]  who's a bushy to a u.s attorney in north carolina who's another establishment republican in the
[39:57.480 --> 40:04.360]  under the control of rosenstein this is a hijacking of the justice department put in place just in
[40:04.360 --> 40:10.920]  case the president fires sessions and rosenstein he would have to go four deep into the justice
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.320]  department before he could find a loyal acting attorney general and that's right and and and
[40:17.320 --> 40:23.080]  doing deep research worse than the democrats is the power combination of the neocons ally with
[40:23.080 --> 40:27.240]  the democrats and that's why they're so arrogant and clearly the fact that they were going to make
[40:27.240 --> 40:32.280]  this bold censorship move that trump and others had told them don't do now trump's striking back
[40:32.280 --> 40:36.600]  with opening salvos going after facebook for discrimination and so much more and i'm told
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.560]  a lot of stuff's about to happen next week they don't seem to care they've had their marching
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.840]  orders they've decided they're making their move and the behavior is so vicious that it makes me
[40:46.840 --> 40:51.320]  think they might even try to take trump out before the election but regardless they want to get that
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.720]  impeachment going but i don't think the president should think that he's got time to keep the economy
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.360]  getting better and you know try to win the midterms i think he will probably win the midterms uh but
[41:00.360 --> 41:05.560]  or the republicans will but just their whole demeanor their whole posture shows me that they're
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.720]  going to go for broke and i think the president needs to move on them legally and lawfully right now
[41:11.240 --> 41:18.280]  well alex yesterday i heard from two completely credible sources uh that the that the mother
[41:18.280 --> 41:27.320]  probe is very close to charging don trump junior with lying to the fbi now let's be clear we've
[41:27.320 --> 41:35.160]  said it here numerous times on info wars that the right the trump tower meeting was a not illegal
[41:35.160 --> 41:43.160]  and b a setup we still have no answer as to who approved the visa for the russian woman sure we
[41:43.160 --> 41:48.120]  know it's a total fraud and and so again he's got a fire muller and all these people in rozenstein
[41:48.120 --> 41:53.400]  before all this fraud comes out he's got to move against them now well here's the key question
[41:53.400 --> 42:01.160]  we'll moving on a member of the first family finally give darin trump what he needs the impetus
[42:01.160 --> 42:07.240]  to clean out this entire nest of criminals this is unbelievable i think the answer is yes
[42:07.240 --> 42:13.560]  you heard it here first on info wars again if there's any further proof that the president should
[42:13.560 --> 42:22.040]  never sit down with mother's people for a deposition the uh the catching uh potentially
[42:22.040 --> 42:28.760]  of don trump junior in some minor discrepancy regarding the meeting is a classic example
[42:28.760 --> 42:35.880]  of the perjury trap they're trying to walk the president i'm a giant fan of don trump junior
[42:35.880 --> 42:42.520]  read his tweets you know he rhymes me up don trump the candidate he's a true believer i happen to know
[42:42.520 --> 42:49.080]  that he is a fan of info wars he's been a very effective advocate for the president's proposals
[42:49.080 --> 42:55.960]  and his platform and his reform agenda but now mother threatens to indict him for perjury we're
[42:55.960 --> 43:01.000]  going to break it down we come back this is huge world exclusive we all know that the outside toxins

[47:40.600 --> 47:44.680]  up there on mainstream corporate news how do you know they're lying when their lips are moving and
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.040]  the lying has only intensified they are trying to shut everybody down right now they know america's
[47:50.040 --> 47:53.800]  awake they're gonna try to convert us to an absolute tyranny if they can remove president
[47:53.800 --> 47:59.880]  trump this is a literal life and death fight for the future of this country every conservative every

[48:10.040 --> 48:14.600]  out and vote you've got a call congress you tell them you know that they're criminals when they're
[48:14.600 --> 48:21.320]  going after uh the press and the president you've got to understand that we're facing an organized
[48:21.320 --> 48:27.880]  crime syndicate that is absolutely trying to kill a populist movement to take this nation back we
[48:27.880 --> 48:34.200]  are in a soft civil war they want to go into a hot civil war they're financed by a bizarre nazi
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.720]  collaborator trump needs to send soros you know over to germany or over to the hungry so we'll
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.440]  go back to roger stone here with mega bombshell information you were up against the break start
[48:46.440 --> 48:53.720]  over from with your sources about the situation with who moller is planning to indict next this
[48:53.720 --> 48:59.240]  is incredible and then what you believe the consequences of that will be roger stone my
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.920]  information alex is that robert moller is threatening to indict donald trump jr for
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.800]  lying to the fbi in interviews that he gave in connection with the perfectly legal trump
[49:11.800 --> 49:18.680]  tower meeting i have thought for some time that if the special counsel moved on a member of the
[49:18.680 --> 49:28.120]  first family avanka jared kushner eric or donald trump jr that it would be the last straw i think
[49:28.120 --> 49:34.520]  they have held this back knowing that it may be the thing that pushes trump beyond the breaking
[49:34.520 --> 49:41.160]  point but the point you made is a good one alex what we have here is a coup d'etat wrapped up in
[49:41.160 --> 49:48.600]  a faux legality uh oh the special counsel that's the federal government you can't question him he has
[49:48.600 --> 49:54.040]  full authority two courts have ruled that he does which i think is extraordinary because
[49:54.040 --> 50:00.360]  the court's rule that his appointment is legal because he has the oversight of both acting
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.040]  attorney general rod rozenstein and the president but rozenstein and the president are both at a
[50:06.040 --> 50:12.360]  minimum witnesses in the investigation that comey pardon me that moller is conducting into the
[50:12.360 --> 50:18.840]  termination of fbi director james comey meaning they're both conflicted the two government officials
[50:18.840 --> 50:25.320]  with theoretical oversight over moller are conflicted which is why moller's appointment
[50:25.320 --> 50:32.040]  should be voided uh this is a coup d'etat there is no question about it and again
[50:33.400 --> 50:38.040]  they're all conflicted beyond that rozenstein's involved in the dossier that's all been proven
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.600]  to be fake roger the democrats have been caught being in bed with the russians in bed with the chinese
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.520]  we've got breaking news in the third hour confirming all of this using state department
[50:48.520 --> 50:55.000]  money that was trying to topple russia laundering it back through ukraine back to the killery campaign
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  this is all confirmed and will americans stand for obama who got fined 340 something thousand
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.720]  dollars for 84 million dollars that was improperly marked and there was no investigation of that
[51:05.720 --> 51:10.360]  like you said oh here's a slap on the rest and then meanwhile we have duncan hunter and people
[51:10.360 --> 51:16.200]  literally being indicted for having campaign money pay to fly his daughter's pet rabbit
[51:16.200 --> 51:22.360]  and buying campaign members drinks after dinner i mean this is a and buying his kids video games
[51:22.360 --> 51:26.840]  the secretary when they're on the road buying them some video games because they were bored i mean
[51:26.840 --> 51:31.320]  this is her 375 thousand dollars no bomb had to pay excuse me i mean this is just out of control
[51:31.320 --> 51:37.640]  no maxine waters leans on the federal government to bail out a bank that she and her husband
[51:38.200 --> 51:43.640]  own stock in and who's and her husband is on the board of yeah and of course she pays no penalty
[51:43.640 --> 51:49.080]  whatsoever no this isn't a greigious double standard here's the difference it's an opening
[51:49.080 --> 51:54.520]  shut case on the clinton's you want russian collusion 145 million dollars from the russian
[51:54.520 --> 52:01.960]  energy company to the clinton foundation while the uh uranium deal was on the table for approval
[52:01.960 --> 52:08.200]  that's about as clear as you can get uh wouldn't take much of an investigation a second year law
[52:08.200 --> 52:14.200]  student could get an indictment from a grand jury they are completely busted but because the mainstream
[52:14.200 --> 52:20.520]  media will not cover any of that or they give it scant coverage uh the at the outrage uh and
[52:20.520 --> 52:27.240]  knowledge of the american people has been slow to build but building it is poll yesterday showed
[52:27.240 --> 52:35.080]  that 50 percent of the people thought paul manafort's prosecution was entirely political uh and this
[52:35.080 --> 52:42.680]  was a mom myth uh poll from new jersey hardly a right wing outfit but a credible pollster so i think
[52:42.680 --> 52:47.960]  the american people are catching on to what's going on here uh and the question is will it
[52:47.960 --> 52:53.880]  reach critical mass in time for the election will it reach critical mass in time for the president
[52:53.880 --> 53:00.600]  to do what needs to be done clean house and roger it's not like the stock market's plunging it's at
[53:00.600 --> 53:06.040]  all-time highs the economy's coming back uh we see the best numbers ever recorded for black and
[53:06.040 --> 53:11.320]  hispanic small businesses startups and already record profits uh that's why you see a doubling
[53:11.320 --> 53:16.360]  in black and hispanic support for trump in only one year and even their own skewed polls show
[53:16.360 --> 53:23.800]  a collapse away from the democratic party an acceleration over to the true americana uh you
[53:23.800 --> 53:30.040]  know gusto that everybody really wants everybody wants to you know be a winner and and people get
[53:30.040 --> 53:35.560]  this so the democrats are in full insane cuckoo land mode and i'm just concerned about how they're
[53:35.560 --> 53:40.520]  going to counter strike uh next because again we we now know and all of you saw it at someone
[53:40.520 --> 53:43.480]  for wars dot com we played the audio earlier we'll come back and talk about this for five minutes

[53:49.400 --> 53:54.520]  from the internet and that anyone that has his content should be fined and that he must be
[53:54.520 --> 54:01.400]  unpersoned and that thousands of others are just as bad that they are going to have the media matters
[54:01.400 --> 54:06.520]  run who can be on the air and who can't i mean this is this is this is this is chinese communist
[54:06.520 --> 54:11.560]  level and they're just announcing it uh out in the open we'll talk about that when we come back

[59:59.640 --> 01:00:14.680]  before you slip into unconsciousness i like to have another kiss another
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.520]  oh
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.480]  all right ladies and gentlemen roger stone has broken down a world exclusive here but again
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.480]  we're up against the break i want him to be very clear because what he's told me off air is even
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.840]  worse than what he said on air roger i know you don't you don't want to destabilize the country but
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.160]  the truth is the truth and i think the president needs to know what you've been told by high level
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.840]  sources because you're under molar investigation and what people might be keeping from him so just i
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.560]  i'm not telling you what to do but i think you just give it to us straight tell folks how bad it is
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.760]  this the simplest way to put this is special counsel robert moeller is planning to indict
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:13.480]  dyle trump jr for the crime of lying to the fb i uh in the various interviews he gave
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:21.080]  pertaining to the perfectly legal meeting at trump tower that is uh that is good information
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:28.440]  we stand by it uh and we are reporting it first remember this is info wars tomorrow's news today
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.560]  why have they been holding back because they know the president will
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.880]  go absolutely he's got the power to fire all of them and you've got rozenstein's changing it over
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.560]  to he's in charge of everything you've got you've got sessions in la la land you know counting daisies
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.320]  on the wall uh and not knowing what time it is i mean clearly these people have engaged in a coup
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:56.920]  and i think the president i think if the president addressed the nation addressed the nation uh you
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.960]  know at 8 p.m one night and just laid all this down says i'm firing them they're crooks they're
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.120]  scum and you know and i believe in you the voters and i believe this election coming up and if you
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:10.440]  think it's i'm wrong then impeach me but if you think i'm right you like the economy and you like
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.080]  getting these parasites out of control well then stand with me baby i think he should draw the line
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.280]  of the sand like colonel travis well to answer your question as to why he's waited i think he was
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:27.240]  waiting for the conviction of manifold and the guilty plea of cone to set the stage and build
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:36.360]  momentum for his next big scout now uh the daily beast huff pow mother jones the rest of the fake
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:44.040]  news media is of course actively predicting that roger stone will be indicted next alexa i if i have
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:50.600]  to say one more time it's tedious but i'm not involved in any russian collusion i know nothing
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:58.680]  of any collaboration with wiki leaks or any other crime that pertains to the 2016 presidential election
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:05.400]  this is a witch hunt this is an inquisition but i need help uh i talked to a top lawyer that i would
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:11.560]  like to retain uh and he tells me my defense is going to cost more than two million dollars so
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:19.080]  folks can go to stonedefensefund.com uh and it would be a godsend i'm not going to roll over
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:25.400]  like the rest of the info wars uh banned i am going to fight but it will bankrupt me it will
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.000]  destroy me financially unless patriots come forward with their assistance and let's expand on this
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.240]  you you're coming to the break you had this one of these new york times reporters on the same
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:43.480]  ones that's been stalking me they will not quote anything you said it's all twisted and you were
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.320]  saying she's calling you at 10 o'clock at night wanting to know about me and russia and she sat
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.840]  there and said how much does russia pay or how much do you how much you've been working with rt
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.200]  and i said never never worked for them haven't been on in years when she just started laughing
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.960]  do these people actually believe that that i've worked with the russians uh obviously so this
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:08.920]  woman is a feature writer i am told i declined to speak with her because it can come to no good
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.480]  this is a hatchet job you want to see a hatchet job there's one around me right now in mother
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.240]  jones i have written a rebuttal which i'm about to post i mean these people have no regard for
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:27.080]  facts or truth or context they lie by omission they lie by half truths they lie by just outright
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:34.200]  falsehood that is the mainstream media today it is pathetic thank god we have outlets like oh i
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.120]  don't know info wars to tell you what's really going on we're going to break in 10 seconds but
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.440]  can you believe that may now have more democrat senators openly saying take me completely off the

[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:48.040]  lee stranahan with huge breaking news on russia gate concerning hillary that is damning proof of
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:54.040]  where the real collusion was roger stone coming back in the fourth hour and more but first a history
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:01.160]  of the info war certainly for some alex jones can be scary and abrasive
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:14.200]  but if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying to see for yourself
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.480]  what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you and the information you find
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:27.400]  could be life changing he predicted 9 11 and if there was an outside threat like a bin lad who
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.840]  was a known cia ass in the 80s he's the boogeyman they need this were welly and phony system he
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.600]  exposed the cremation of care ceremony and bohemian grove
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:49.640]  he educated us about the relationship between the third rike and modern global prison planet
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:55.560]  dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks he helped reveal the so-called bill de berg group
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:02.520]  at all and most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites he was the loudest voice reporting on
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:09.960]  the union between the communist chinese and silicone valley they falsely edited him
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:19.960]  they lie about his reporting of sandy hook they lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:30.600]  and now he is being de-platformed by facebook apple and google private companies are being harassed
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.640]  and encouraged to stop doing business with him and then we get hit say you don't use our software
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:42.040]  youtubers are being censored for talking about him we just got taken down by youtube they just
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:47.160]  killed our stream really yeah and some americans are actually celebrating this
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:57.800]  this is america in 2018 will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:06.840]  your eyes will you do nothing while history is being recorded will you sit and do nothing
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:16.280]  or will you do your own research discover the truth and stand for freedom crashing through
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:24.280]  the lies and disinformation and that's one of our latest great hires a patriot from a marine
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.000]  always marine greg reese he moved her from Hawaii he saw him do the whole volcano piece on our water
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.400]  filtration and joining us just for two short segments i'm having back up in the next few weeks
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.600]  for a full hour once we're getting him on all the shows here because i always forget about what a
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.840]  great guest he is professor darryl hamamoto i'm not going to get into his old background that
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:45.000]  would take all the time but he's a recipient of the rockefeller foundation research fellowships
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.120]  he's been an insider ucla he's been exposing for many years being persecuted for it how
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.200]  they're bringing in a system of total control and we're going to use the universities as the
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.640]  invasion force of anti-free speech nationwide and he's been totally proven right he's had a lot
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.120]  of points he wants to get into he's in vietnam right now you can talk about seeing with chai
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.600]  comms the crisis of academic humanities modern language rise of islamification on the college
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.880]  and how this union's working together i call the classical liberal and again he's been persecuted
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.680]  a lot uh for being a real liberal and so uh you've got the floor for this segment the next
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.880]  kind of kind of run through your report to everybody and what you see happening good to
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:31.000]  have you back professor thanks so much alex it's great to be back with you here today
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:39.000]  as you mentioned i'm here in uh vietnam i wanted to see what uh official uh marxist
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.200]  leninism is all about and i have to say and i've only been here for about three weeks now
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:52.200]  but i have experienced a much higher degree of personal freedom than than than one experiences
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.480]  in the united states of america i happen to live in the sacramento area which is that whole region
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:05.240]  is going up in smoke right now because of the uh the fake climate change types of eco fascism that's
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:12.440]  been uh imposed on the on the people of california but here in vietnam uh i i walk here with a high
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.560]  degree of personal safety i get to eat fresh fruit uh food and fruits and vegetables i get to go
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.360]  through open-air markets and some people may complain that well what about the sanitation well
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:31.000]  it's it's it's excellent here now the problem is is that um because this is such a beautiful
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.960]  verdant country that's enriched with resources including incredible oil reserves in the south
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:45.400]  china sea um some of our competitors most notably the people's republic of china have moved aggressively
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:52.920]  into the region and i happen to live i'm living currently in the uh residence hotel only five
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:59.480]  minutes away from one of the most beautiful beach areas probably in the world and a section of that
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:05.640]  beach was immortalized in the series of a few years ago called china beach it's the china beach of
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:14.440]  the um the american wars it's called here the the war against american military but i snuck on to one
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.200]  of these luxury resorts the other day and i was challenged by a guard and i responded in english
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:27.720]  which was sort of my passport my entree into the facility and i picked up one of these brochures
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:34.920]  and it's called the premier village danang resort managed by aqua hotels i don't know what aqua
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.920]  hotels is i'm going to do my research but i bet you anything it's a chai com operation but anyway
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:48.200]  they're they've occupied they privatize this incredible beach area and you know i haven't
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:54.840]  been to really many high high end five star resorts but if i have this this would fit that
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.480]  description if you looked into dictionary under high end resort you'd say you'd have a
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:05.480]  photograph of this beautiful uh facility here so i walked in there i went to the lobby i checked
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:11.640]  up facility it's beautiful they have these uh this incredible landscaping and the picture
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.480]  beach itself looks like something i couldn't believe was it was actually beach it looked like
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:22.200]  a photograph looked like a painting it was super real and i heard mostly not chinese language but
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:29.640]  strangely enough uh korean language because it seems that a country that was desperately poor
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.040]  that lived under military dictatorship for many decades after the end of world war two then liberalized
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:44.440]  its economy it created a huge um and productive upper middle class and these this this is what i'm
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.040]  seeing here at the hotels now i'm also projecting that this is this process is going to be taking
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.360]  place uh throughout vietnam in fact the area that i'm living right now there's construction going on
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:05.240]  non-stop five-store hotels um much of it subsidized or financed by the chinese and by the way i should
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:12.360]  add that um the vietnamese people who have remained free most of it throughout its entire
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:20.040]  existence before it became republic have for centuries resisted foreign domination most notably
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:26.920]  the han people or the chinese uh yet they're coming in um and we have this first wave of
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.480]  subjugation from the standpoint of economic investment now the upper edge along people
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.400]  i assume that they bought into the program that the people's republic of china the developers
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:46.200]  have brought in but on the street level there is from what i can tell a great deal of resentment
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:52.440]  against china the chinese people in fact i don't think i've seen a single chinese tourist here
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.760]  well i was about to say for folks that don't know i mean i'm not a professor or historian like you
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.000]  but i've read a lot about it hasn't there been hundreds of wars between vietnam and china and
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.360]  china's always for over a thousand years trying to invade and i even had some shootouts in just
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.880]  the last few years and china's tried to take over uh uh some of the islands and claim that the oil
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:19.160]  out there that's always belonged to uh vietnam belongs to them absolutely in fact uh high none
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:26.280]  island is a hotly contested area and just that goes last week or week and a half ago um part of the
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.280]  chinese blue water fleet came sailing to the east china sea and in effect was saying this is ours
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:37.000]  this is ours this is ours and it's disturbing everybody and this is one of the reasons i'm
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.720]  here it's disturbing everybody in the region all the way down to malaysia well probably that's so
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.880]  important because how can china be taken over africa everywhere because they got 900 billion
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.280]  dollar deficit every year of our money to do it and it was all set up and the globalists did it on
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:58.200]  purpose china has been the chosen new imperial power we'll be right back listen to what chris

[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:26.040]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones and i wanted to get
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.080]  professor daryl homo moto has been exposing for many years the the cult of brainwashing going on
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.680]  at universities and how they're being prepared is this invasion force to take over the country
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.640]  which now happened i didn't know he was in vietnam and been there for a month or so and and you know
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.920]  talking about fascinating is vietnam borders and it's north a large border with china china's been
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:52.040]  trying to take it for thousands of years in fact i was looking up during the break almost two thousand
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.000]  years they've been having wars on a thousand and now they're economically taking over so vietnam's
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.560]  always getting invaded by everybody and before the you know the french and and before that it was
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.920]  the japanese were there for a while and then the u.s came and uh so definitely fighters
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:12.280]  so as i guess it's in their ethos that they're constantly getting attacked by gambodia and
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:18.680]  laos and thailand and and you know the philippines and everybody else so it goes on and on but but
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.680]  this is just interesting and i heard him say yes yes exactly but we've already gone to break
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:30.280]  i was elaborating professor on china is the new chosen global imperial power with a communist
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.560]  operating system with billionaire generals that rule at all it's it's a total fraud and our elites
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.760]  have decided that that's the model for here and i'm sure you've seen the news that that silicon
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.480]  valley's preparing china censorship and preparing it here i'm being the platform finish your point
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.920]  about china and then i wanted to get some of your other points because we have limited time today
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:55.640]  yes alex i just wanted to underscore for your audience that you've been absolutely right because
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:01.400]  so far as china is concerned because some people might be dismissive of saying all its alarmism
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:08.760]  we've been hearing this since the 1950s but but this is real i'm seeing it here i'm i'm listening
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:14.520]  i'm reading i'm talking to people i'm attending uh academic conferences uh and this is something
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.960]  that i needed to do i needed to be here to to witness it but china is the world power as
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.040]  you've alluded to yes you stated outright many many times on your broadcast that china has been
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:33.560]  selected by the globalist the banker families that small 0.0001 percent of the elite it's it's
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:40.600]  been designated as the wedge to bring down the entire developed industrialized west which
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:45.720]  would include japan by the way japan is not happy about what's going on in china in this
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:51.720]  region as well and the alliance between us and japan is strengthening and ironically the the
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:58.520]  military alliance between vietnam and the united states is warming up because all these nations
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:05.240]  and the american people need to understand this understand fully comprehend the enormity of this
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:13.000]  21st century behemoth that is threatening to bring in to to realize that vision that was has
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.840]  been workshopped for decades of the new world order and this is why i'm here i'm trying to get the
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:26.280]  specifics i'm trying to gather the empirical data that will help support my pioneering efforts in
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:33.400]  systematizing and developing what i call new world order theory that i hope will be talked to new
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:40.360]  generations of students uh instead of this amoral and i want to have you back for a full hour to
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.000]  get in that because that's because you you have tried as a top phd in there very respected who's
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.280]  also been at the rockefeller schools to bring in a real system of world understanding that's
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:54.520]  based from the elite perspective i mean not looking down on us like the elite do but knowing how they
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.680]  look at things people have a real bird's eye view from their perspective to understand that's the real
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:04.520]  world system that's taking over versus populist and self-determination and that you and and and
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.520]  just what you're mentioning about vietnam like ho chi men said okay i might not be a communist
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.440]  i'll work with america let us be independent but then the saboteurs actually did not want that
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.160]  they wanted communism to stay in power so they actually told the us to go in and invade but
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.520]  didn't let us win to actually uh cause this cultural schism here domestically these people are very
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:30.440]  very sophisticated and only studying their long range gaelian dialectics do you have any way of
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:38.040]  beating it that's absolutely true and um what you've been alluding to earlier is that in the
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:44.440]  universities we have had imposed on ourselves and i felt suckered to this early on as well myself
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:50.760]  this is why i'm so familiar with this system but we fell victim to foundation globalist
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:57.560]  funded forms of knowledge which are completely false it's ideology master rating is social
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:04.200]  science and i'm talking about race and ethnicity theory gender and sexuality theory and what's
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:10.360]  called world systems and these people themselves have a one term and if i can express to your
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.320]  audience this one term that you they should understand and what it's a code word for it's
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.680]  that term intersectionality and they talk about the whole world is run on the basis of your racial
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.320]  your ethnic your class and your national which is the opposite of martin Luther king of the
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:34.040]  renaissance or true liberal enlightenment that's the most illiberal garbage it's exactly true it's
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.040]  it's antithetical to the western humanistic tradition which puts men and god at the center
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:48.200]  of the world not these superficial characteristics because genetically we're very similar culturally
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.000]  i mean you just go to a different country and you just realize families the unifier and that's
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.520]  why they're attacking that that is what we are that's it's our it's our human it's our god-given
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:05.320]  physiological human endowment that has been systematically destroyed over the past 30 to
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:12.520]  40 years with the willing complicity of the entire academic establishment which is funded by
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:18.680]  you know the government federal agencies military and most of all banker interest so we have been
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:24.440]  kept in the dark we have had the blinders on purposely in the university and this is why you
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:31.080]  see this misbehavior about from these brainwashed individuals i'm not talking about the antitha
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.520]  frustrated college right i'm talking about the professors themselves because the entire
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:43.080]  reward and punishment system within the university from top to bottom has been structured in a way
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:50.520]  to punish people who deviate from this false orthodox oh it's total it's total radicalization
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.680]  it's totally insane i mean i know a bunch of well-known liberals and people that uh one of the
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.920]  famous uh anyways actually a well-known director and film editor he got tired of hollywood went back
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.600]  to ut to become a psychiatrist basically and in the program because he's white they told him
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.440]  you're kicked out of the program there's too many whites and he goes that's racist and he's a big
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.840]  liberal and that's the university of texas officially saying you're white doesn't matter
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.000]  we're not going to let you graduate even though you're about to graduate and and he's like fine
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.960]  this is insane but that's i mean it's becomes it's like it's like nazi like that's exactly the case
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.920]  in fact um uh anthony burgess whose name should be mentioned in the same brand as as people like
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:38.040]  orwell and and uh alice huxley uh anthony burgess wrote a book called the the wanting seed and it
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:44.520]  was published in 1960 he was talking exactly about these issues that people had to feign
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:51.400]  being homosexual or gay in order to fit in to the new regime and the same goes for your racial
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.920]  identity if you're a quote-unquote white whatever that means and those people are an admixture
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.800]  because you know we were sure i mean i'm part native american and stuff yeah yeah i mean we're
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.400]  all this including so-called pure brit asian people have all kinds of genetic material floating
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.720]  around in there someplace to the greater glory of all humanity i believe so this in itself is a
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.960]  completely false path that we put on so-called critical race and ethnicity theory that's taught
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.200]  in all the college and university it steals individualism they make you this group they say
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.240]  promise you'll come back in the next week or so to do a full breakdown on this world system

[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:37.560]  intersectionality i mean i try to look at the gender studies all of it and then it's always
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:42.840]  an expanding vocabulary and then now the new thing is they're saying they're being mean to people
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:49.400]  period if you call medically so they're not trying to take it with a medical system a a woman
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:57.800]  female parts a vagina no it's now you got to call it front hole so uh that's that's that's
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.040]  what's going on here and it literally is a takeover of language culture everything
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.920]  by this big corporate system that's always directing it so you're not allowed i saw an article
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:11.240]  today where a big chef in england is being criticized because he's taken jamaican seasoning
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.400]  and put it into his italian restaurant and so the mainstream news there is a chef jamie
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:22.760]  oliver accused of cultural appropriation for his jamaica punchy jerk rice so i mean that's
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.240]  what culture is as marco polo went to asia and brought over the spices the idea of like you
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.960]  know coconuts floated from one island to another is the coconut cultural appropriation you know
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.760]  there's a footage of the white kid with dreadlocks in san francisco being beaten up by the you know
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:42.680]  black students or whatever because hey you're not uh you know it's cultural appropriation so so
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:48.920]  again mtv bombards us with with a twisted view of what a culture is then when people adopted
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:54.680]  to be left alone and to not be beaten up well you get beaten up for that you get beaten up for that
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:01.160]  too and i see these articles everywhere can white people uh you know uh be discriminated against or
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.080]  is there such a thing as reverse discrimination well that's ridiculous you could pull up
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:10.520]  at an island in the middle of the pacific ocean that has your headhunters on it and they're going
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.560]  to kill their neighbors that they're genetically identical to across the uh bay because you know
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:21.400]  it's it's it's it's territorial land and if they don't know who you are they might kill you or they
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.080]  might not they might think you're big medicine but the whole point is it's tribal so they've got
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.080]  brown skin but they'll kill somebody with brown skin if they're not in their tribe they'll kill
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:36.120]  somebody with white skin if it's not the tribe vice versa the kkk you know back when it was powerful
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:42.600]  was just another gang of ms-13 people organize themselves to that so people so let's organize
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.720]  ourselves into egalitarian ideas of culture and ideas and what we stand for not how we look
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:52.360]  and that would actually be an open free society that's all been betrayed by the big corporations
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.360]  the last 30 years they've gone with this race-based divide and conquer model and and professor daryl
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:03.560]  hamamoto was finishing up with uh basically how this is the heart of the whole operation a lot of
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.720]  people say well professor it doesn't make sense it's causing discord it's sabotaging culture but
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:14.360]  isn't that really the plan what's the end game of this and and from your own Rockefeller you know
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.960]  studies do you have a degree in that uh you know inside their own systems how did they develop it
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:27.080]  and why has it now become their main game plan well as you stated on your uh really really
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:33.560]  ahead of its time perceptive documentary end game the end game is to gum up the works to to bring
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:39.320]  the great western enlightenment rational and scientific and humanistic tradition to a grinding
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:46.520]  halt because that creates prosperity it creates awareness mass literacy and this is exactly what
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:54.920]  the top stratum of the the so-called leadership uh is in fear of they're afraid of healthy sentient
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:01.000]  intelligent spiritually infused individuals and groups of people in societies and how do you
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.720]  cripple it you start with the basic uh perceptual apparatus with the words with the language and
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:13.640]  toward that end i call upon the new president-elect of the modern language association and this is
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:19.880]  the umbrella academic uh organ that controls the people in english and comparative literature
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:26.600]  who are to a large degree responsible for the social cultural economic and philosophical
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:33.080]  incoherence and absurdity of the present day that's the mla modern language association
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:40.200]  the president judith butler i call upon you judith butler to get back to the knitting of
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:47.560]  doing the work that that uh that is the charge of the western humanistic tradition not all this
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:55.720]  deconstruction performativity gender fluidity and all these other abstractions that have no basis
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:38:03.240]  whatsoever in reality if albert einstein could be wrong about mechanics and physics what makes
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:10.040]  you think that you have the exclusive purchase on academic truth and humanity is you don't
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.120]  well think of the authoritarianism of the san francisco cultural linked to wiki links rights
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.920]  about and others where they're saying don't use the word mother and father it's hurtful this this
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.920]  is not misguided at the top as you know it is admitted total sabotage of the human condition
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:33.000]  it is a a cultural spiritual virus that's been deployed people can find your books at trine day

[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:46.200]  they've been unable to show again it is absolutely critical that everyone watching and listening
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.520]  just slow down for a minute there's a lot of advertising a lot of pitches out there and think
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.600]  who's the most demonized in the world alex jones why is that well he's exposing the entire globalist
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.000]  program from the perspective of the globalists it's it's been caught up in all their disinformation
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.960]  and hype and rabbit trails and false paradigms so for whatever reason we've broken through we're
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.840]  having the effect they want us shut down and then they want everybody else shut down so

[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:15.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:21.640]  all right ladies and gentlemen uh in my stacks of news this is one of the things i probably
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.120]  should have gotten to right at the start of the show but i've got major democrat senators
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.600]  calling for me to be completely shut off the internet and quote thousands of other sites
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.280]  so they're making their move and if they get trumped out of there they're coming after everybody
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.160]  i mean this is true authoritarianism and you can't roll over to these calendars and have a good
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:47.880]  future for yourself and your family notice i noticed a pattern when illegal aliens kill people
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.880]  the liberal juries let them go because you can't ever say an illegal alien did anything wrong
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:59.240]  hitting runs drunk driving you name it and molly tidbits the illegal alien grabbed her
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:06.840]  raped her killed her he admits he did it and i have MSNBC post going oh big deal some girl what
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:12.120]  it doesn't matter just like kate steinling get shot in the back and and and they let him go
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:17.000]  and it's over and over and over and over again it's like these black islamist who have a dead
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.240]  three-year-old kid that they say died in a ritual in a weird compound and the kids are the ones calling
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.920]  out saying help us they're trying to attack schools that's what the prosecutors have
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:33.000]  and the and the white judge goes she's a liberal she goes you may go it's racist that you were held
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  i don't care if there's a dead child i don't care if there's underground tunnels i order the compound
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.120]  covered in dirt nothing was there nothing happened move forward everything's fine because you've got
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.680]  massive crime from illegal aliens because statistically the average person that comes here
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.760]  as a migrant isn't a bad person but there's a percentage that are criminals fleeing justice
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.280]  so they're what twice as likely to commit crime some areas like 40 percent of crime are the illegal
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.640]  aliens so and there's a lot of raping and things going on that trump talked about during the campaign
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.000]  so instead of admitting that trumps right about this and that hey we got to have a border
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.440]  and the folks are trying to flee up here because it's dangerous down there
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.080]  elizabeth warren on tibet's murder quote
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.880]  sad she's dead but we have to remember these are quotes we need an immigration system that
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:31.320]  focuses on where the real problems are illegal aliens coming across with their kids sometimes
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:37.320]  kids alone and then time magazine puts a fake photo of a kid up there with trump saying
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:42.040]  she was taken from her mommy when she wasn't that's the real problem someone fleeing collapsing
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:48.440]  latin america and then blaming their problems on us that's more important than women raped and
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:57.000]  murdered shot in the back because we're not humans you see what a sick freak let's play a clip from
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.480]  msnbc one of their pundits saying something even sicker and we'll go to millie weaver's
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.520]  going to ride shotgun with us into the next hour and we're going to have a special guest in studio
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:11.000]  here it is i'm so sorry for the family here and i know this is hard not only for the family but
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.480]  for the people in her community the people throughout iowa but one of the things we have
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:24.120]  to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective that focuses on where real problems
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:31.320]  are last month i went down to the border and i saw where children had been taken away from
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.040]  their mothers i met with those mothers who had been lied to who didn't know where their children
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.840]  were who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children and there was no plan for how they would
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:48.120]  be reunified with their children i think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.640]  real threat and i don't think mamas and babies are the place that let's stop right there and
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:58.680]  coming up later i'll play the clip the videos on info wars dot com there's an article about it we're
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:05.400]  at msnbc house says all that girl's no big deal oh big deal elizabeth warren again dismisses molly
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:12.280]  tidbits but it gets worse msnbc had a guest on not not her it's it's it's one of the guest
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:17.880]  saying oh it's just some girl big deal that's the quote so so we'll get that so so so this is what
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:23.560]  they're doing we're going to come back and uh get to the gem of costa and and millie we were
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:29.960]  asking him a few questions uh but millie just on this subject of uh tidbits and and her murder
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:34.360]  did you hear her being murdered it's not a real problem and all these massive numbers of rapes
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:38.200]  and murders committed by illegal aliens and the serial killer illegal aliens coming in from all
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:44.120]  over the world from germany to you know to russia to latin america to china and you know sometimes
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.120]  killing dozens of people and no one knows what their names are or they or the islamic attacks in
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:53.400]  europe and the daily truck attacks none of that's a problem did you know that uh millie well i guess
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:58.680]  apparently according to democrats they don't seem to see that as a problem but the rest of americans
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.880]  whose children they have to worry about every day especially people living in border cities
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:09.560]  are terrified they don't feel safe in their own country and trump is speaking directly to those
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:14.280]  people when he's telling them we're going to have a secure border we're going to keep your families
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:22.040]  safe so it doesn't matter how much virtue signaling the left does trump is actually providing a need
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.720]  that is primitive to most people which is safety and security and the left doesn't seem to care
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:33.400]  whether or not people get killed by these illegal immigrants many of the which who do come over as
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.240]  murderers and rapists they come over to commit crimes knowing that they'll just be deported
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:43.080]  and they can come right back in again so that yes the democrats don't seem to care and it's
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:48.280]  going to actually fall really bad on the democrats during this next election
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:58.280]  why do you think the democrats are just such criminal scum i mean they came out and said that
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:03.080]  ms-13 where god's children and trump shouldn't call them animals when they know that they do
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:09.880]  satanic rituals killing innocent people on record uh to the they believe to get themselves closer to
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:14.760]  satan and the main group they feed on is other hispanics who then they intimidate and scare and
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:19.080]  not reporting on them then they take over whole towns whole neighborhoods whole whole areas and
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.720]  the democratic party is saying that ms-13 is good i mean the democratic party are like villains out
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:30.600]  of a movie well you know i actually had the opportunity to speak with a young latina girl
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:36.280]  who was a trump supporter who was telling me a story about how she actually used to be a democrat
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.720]  and didn't even support president trump and it was her mother who lives in la who started to get
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:48.200]  her to realize that trump was going to help make their city in la more safe because she said they
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:56.680]  had a massive problem of ms-13 gangs and other latino cartel gangs coming into latino american
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:03.400]  communities and having latin on latin crime and black on latin crime massive gang problems they
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:09.480]  don't feel safe in their communities so she actually said that one of the main reasons she switched
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:16.280]  and decided to support trump was the fact that he's advocating to keep closed borders and have
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.160]  secure borders so he's actually speaking to the latin american community and that's why that's
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.400]  why their support for him's doubled but but but here's the question i'm asking you because
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.240]  you've been around the country a lot as a roving reporter doing a great job i'm only weaver joins
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:35.320]  us here why are the democrats openly saying gangs and ms-13 are good and actually wetting
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:39.720]  themselves to it i think it's because they want to move them in as an organized crime
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:43.560]  enforcement arm which we know more and more they're actually using for low-level political
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.800]  intimidation antifa isn't turning out to be the good army they wanted but they think
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:53.320]  things like ms-13 will be somebody they can work with well it's because many of the democrat
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:58.200]  politicians i know at least personally firsthand in california from the research i've done on the
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:04.280]  politicians in california many of them are in bed with cartels many of the politicians in this
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.640]  democrat state california are in bed with cartels they get money from cartels they get threats from
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:15.960]  cartels many of them are cartel family members so the reality is is that um they're going to be on
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.480]  the side of cartels because it helps them to get campaign funding helps them to get access to that
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:26.760]  illegal money um just remember that when these deep states and things are trying to fund their
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:32.840]  operations a lot of times they are using these gangs and cartels to traffic drugs and get money
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:39.160]  to be able to perform their operations so we were seeing that the dnc the democrat party
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:45.080]  has definite connections with cartels and gangs and mafias and that's why there's
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:52.680]  two all right millie weaver skype's breaking up we'll play her on pause for a moment please thank
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.680]  you uh while that gets cleared up let's go ahead since we found it and play this clip
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:03.640]  from msnbc where the house is like oh some girl's dead so again it's beyond elizabeth waran here it is
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.480]  the republican party is actually not working on behalf of the american people they are working
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.320]  on behalf of donald trump and he's been able to bully them into their silence and i don't think that
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:16.200]  today changes much unfortunately i'm sure we'll hear what he has to say about uh this at his his
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:22.040]  rally but fox news is talking about you know a girl in iowa and not this right and tomorrow morning
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:26.600]  we know who wake up and tweet and sort of you know besmirch the reputation of michael koan and all the
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:32.440]  people around so there you go talking about some girl that got raped and kidnapped and you know
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.480]  murdered i mean big deal her life's over at 24 just like that kate steinle was 20 something got shot
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:45.160]  in the back and died in daddy's arms jeary said you go free and you got CNN hosts that when you show

[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:18.920]  you know melanie i want to get into the cost of video coming up uh when calen robertson

[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:31.560]  to this poor lady killed in iowa murdered kidnapped raped the illegal alien admits he did it here
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:36.920]  illegally and imagine if you know american gets arrested illegally out of mexico doing that it's
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:42.200]  all over the news but here they try to cover it up so when guns kill people at a high school
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:49.720]  it's it's the end of the world but when an illegal alien kills somebody you know they don't care or
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:55.880]  when a gun is used they don't care when it's against a citizen and it's just amazing how they try to
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:01.960]  openly say don't cover this i don't talk about it and i think it just shows a tone deafness
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:08.200]  of the democrats where they'll say for two weeks ban alex jones off the internet he's
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.920]  evil blah blah blah and then they take me off a bunch of platforms and trump says it's wrong
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.400]  to do that and they go no one took him off you're crazy there's no conspiracy in the same
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:23.320]  publications new york times washington post vox they'll have the same author two days later
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:30.280]  say no one's taking alex jones off what do you make of all this well i definitely see the double
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:36.200]  standards here on the left notice if it were an instance like with michael brown who was shot
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:41.080]  and killed they would never be saying oh well you know you know this happened but you know we've
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:47.000]  got to just overlook it and look at our policy that we're trying to look at here they would never
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.680]  done that with the michael brown shooting but here they are with this instance here where it doesn't
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.600]  fit their political agenda to acknowledge what actually happened and talk about the issue at
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:03.640]  hand here where we have real problems with border security and yes there are illegal
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:09.080]  immigrants who come here and rape women and kill people and these people need to be vetted they
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.520]  need to be screened at the border and sent back into mexico where their government can deal with
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.440]  them so they don't want to acknowledge the real policy because it doesn't fit their political
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:25.960]  agenda so like i said the left just likes to have manufactured outrage and emotional hysteria
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:31.720]  over subjects that they can use to commit their political agendas and what you just said is so
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:37.000]  smart that that's really the answer to this to explain to the leftist you got michael brown
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.720]  being killed by the police you have the media lying about what happened turns out the cops
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.520]  told the truth just the fact you have all these riots and stuff over that went on and on for years
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.320]  and imagine if people said hey just move on to real problems not michael brown you know getting
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.760]  getting shot uh you know let's talk about something else people would go crazy but it turns out that
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:02.360]  was a justifiable shooting this one the guy goes kidnap sir murders her admits he does it they're
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:08.840]  like that doesn't matter it's just the the it's like their comic book villains as i keep saying
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:16.440]  that because the democrats have really taken on pure evil exactly and they're utilizing the mainstream
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:22.280]  media which we're going to get into and talk about jimacosta in order to propagate the minds
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.200]  of the left in order to make them have hysterical reactions to people on the right and to automatically
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.680]  make assumptions about them and that's why it's getting harder and harder to have this dialogue
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:39.080]  with leftist because like at the protest yesterday many of them said turn your back on fake news turn
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:44.760]  your back on republicans don't talk to them the protesters won't even talk to us anymore
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:52.360]  um they're shutting down dialogue just like a cult it's very concerning and even though jimacosta
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:58.600]  seems scared and concerned about people saying cnn is fake news and yelling at cnn we should be
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.760]  concerned about the cult-like mentality of the democrats and how they're shutting themselves
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:08.200]  off from even engaging in discourse with the right that's right millie you're still on twitter

[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:05.880]  islamic wing they would they would they showered feces on him you name it and the media spun and
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:11.320]  said oh nothing's happened into tommy well uh it backfired a major national movement started out of
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:17.000]  it uh and now they were forced to release him and so giving us the details in studio is kaelin
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:24.440]  robertson uh at kaelin rob c a o l a n rob on twitter for now of course he's here right while

[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.080]  to millie we were this all ties together in the next segment so stay there we're not chucking
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.600]  i want this millie but good to have you here in studio good to see you powerful stuff you said when
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:42.280]  he was in prison those speeches you gave you know you say you're not really a on-air guy you're
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.720]  behind the scenes guy building great websites and great camera work for tommy uh but uh what's what's
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.000]  the most send me asking the questions what's the most important thing you want to tell the public
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.640]  or maybe recap what happened and how tom he's doing and he's he may be on thursday and what's
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:11:00.040]  unfolding well obviously he's doing a lot better than expected um a lot of people including me didn't
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.120]  actually think that he would be able to get out of that situation uh it was so serious and you know
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.680]  what his mental health really has obviously deteriorated that's exactly what the state wanted
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.840]  that's what the police wanted you could see it on tv he had that look of prisoner of war like
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:18.040]  yeah well exactly they got what they wanted not the final goal which is for him to disappear
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:21.720]  completely but for him to be completely broken down they put him in solitary confinement for 23
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.600]  and a half hours a day he could barely move barely do anything obviously he was mentally tortured by
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.520]  other inmates the muslim inmates who are throwing feces through the door and doing all these horrendous
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.960]  things nothing was done about it he wasn't moved in fact he was moved from the first prison which
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:38.120]  was pretty much fine where you could go to the gym and roam around freely to a much more high
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.360]  security uh not mostly majority that was that was something that we poured earlier on but it was
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:47.960]  still a huge huge huge muslim presence prison uh which caused major mental turmoil and they stuck
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.400]  his shell by the mosque yeah it's it's sort of a religious praying center but everybody he uses it
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.760]  is a muslim so they have to walk by his cell door like four times a day screaming the abuse he's
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.200]  got to sit there listening to all that he's got no one to talk to all he's got is some letters to
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:09.400]  read and one can of tuna and crackers a day exactly uh and he walks out of prison basically
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:13.560]  broken broken by the state which is exactly what they wanted to do he well i've seen like
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:18.840]  vietnam prisoner of war films and they have that it's not a wimpy look it's like they're a thousand
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:25.240]  miles off and now he has that he has that look now yeah yeah exactly is he coming out of it
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.040]  yeah he is he's a he's a fighter he's been through this before he's been through absolute hell before
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.200]  what like a year or so before and then they tortured him and yeah yeah yeah um he'll recover he'll
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.680]  come out fighting he'll do exactly what they don't want him to do uh but he needed this time with his
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:43.000]  family to be able to recoup he went away for a couple of weeks and he just needed to be able to
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.800]  you know get his energy back and he's going to come back a hundred miles an hour although they're
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:49.080]  trying to take him back to prison again i don't know if you know about the second court case i did
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:55.000]  in fact i should have started with that tell folks uh that's the headline uh trader uk government
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.320]  trying to take Tommy Robinson back to prison yep that's that's pretty much it so they're
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.840]  going to have a brand new trial they basically threw out the first one because it was on democratic
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.520]  they said that everything was wrong with it uh and now they want to do a brand new one from scratch
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:10.040]  so we don't know what's going to happen everything is uncertainty which is how they want him to exist
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:14.280]  they want him to exist in a constant state of uncertainty so he can't plan anything he can't
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:17.560]  plan any videos he can't plan any of his life because he doesn't know where he's going to be in a
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:21.480]  month he doesn't know when he's going to be back in prison whether he's going to be uh under house
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:25.720]  arrest he has no idea what's going to happen um and that's exactly how how they wanted it well you
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:31.720]  know he is a prisoner of war for our sovereignty he really is a hero yeah uh but they saw that they
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.920]  saw him rising through the ranks they saw him go from an average guy in lutan walking around the
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:40.360]  street seeing something that was wrong in his own town rising through the local population
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.080]  straight onto mass media all on his own and he saw they saw what he was doing and how many people
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.760]  a true leader yeah he could click his fingers and get tens of thousands of people on the street
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.080]  no other politician in britain can do that it's terrifying for them and the direction that they're
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.960]  trying to push him down will well in the end result if they keep doing this it will reversal that
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.880]  because they're you know if they want him thrown in jail and they want him uh completely mentally
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:05.000]  destroyed that's how you make someone disappear and that's how you take away the power and then
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.080]  there's the old john wane angle but the real deal like you know nine auntie fun there's only like
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:13.160]  two or three of you and you kick their butt uh you know when they're trying to kill you and then
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:16.360]  over and over again this happens he's trying to have a picnic with his family a couple of his
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:20.920]  llamas has come over they're attacking he kicks their ass he's not a big guy that it's it's it's
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:25.480]  the real john wane factor here yeah well it's been violently as we look at the video it's been
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.960]  violently attacked so as the whole crew it's been happening for years but this is this isn't something
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:33.400]  that should surprise anyone but what i thought was as soon as we started making things mainstream as
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.080]  soon as things like that started to be put into the public light on the internet that it wouldn't
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.000]  be allowed to happen anymore that people would be so outraged by what was happening in 2013 on the
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.840]  rise of the edl the internet wasn't around back then but now it is and i thought this sort of
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:48.360]  stuff would stop because it would bring it to the surface but in fact they fought back just as hard
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.720]  as they did before but i've watched the body language the jail guards they brought him out the
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:55.720]  police around him now now everybody's like in awe and you can tell they all admire him they all
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.880]  know they're working for traders i think we've really reached the tipping point in the uk oh yeah
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.520]  i mean people are walking around in fear i live in london and i can see the way it's changed ever
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:09.000]  since i moved there in 2013 it was pretty calm before things were obviously escalating i can't
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.640]  even cover it all now the acid attacks the beatdowns the stabbings and the shootings oh where i live
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.680]  the truck attacks yeah all the residents where i live pay a fee every month to have private police
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:21.640]  on lots of the street corners because the police just can't cope with the massive demands so you
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.120]  can see police in these purple uniforms which have been paid by the residents which is all i saw
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:29.880]  when i was doing the south africa documentary with lauren southern it's basically turning into
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.640]  johannesburg oh we gotta talk about south africa when you were saying and i was seeing a year ago
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:36.920]  they're gonna take a white farmer's land now it's happening now they're killing them in mass
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:41.720]  and then the government says we're not letting you leave we're gonna kill you yep it's absolutely
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:44.760]  terrifying that they're actually letting this happen that the governments are working with
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.000]  are working with south africa and they're like the british and south exactly so we're not letting

[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:41.960]  well we've got taylan robertson of course the right hand man of tommy robertson who's been
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:47.880]  convalescing the last three weeks since he got out of the gulag uh for covering the giant child
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:53.000]  kidnapping rings that they say don't exist which he first exposed 12 years ago that are now confirmed
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.800]  riding shotgun is investigative journalist millie weaver who just confronted jimma costa one of
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:03.960]  the biggest liars in the fake news media at the mafia organization cnn that's driving to have us
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:09.880]  unpersoned and uh millie we've got uh taylan here and he's breaking down the parallels from having
[02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:13.960]  had private police forces everywhere the breakdown of england always known as one of the lowest
[02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:18.440]  crime rates in the world now having one above new york city on average the acid attacks the
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:22.520]  stabbing attacks you were in south africa we'll talk about that with laura southern you also
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:28.280]  were in australia uh mobbed by supporters but also mobbed by people trying to keep it from speaking
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:33.720]  i mean it this is an image millie of the left worldwide on the march funded by big corporations
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:39.640]  the chai cons trying to dominate populist everywhere calling us nazis but that's just not the truth
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:45.480]  uh this is an amazing kind of be alive millie exactly alex and what's happening with tommy
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:52.760]  robinson is a case in point example as to why it's so valuable to live in a country that has a
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:58.600]  constitution like we do in america that affords us the right to have political speech um i don't
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:03.480]  believe that they would have had the right to have thrown tommy robinson in jail in america if
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:07.960]  you were an american citizen but yet they can do that in the uk because they don't have the
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:13.160]  constitution to restrict their government now i really wanted to get to the jim acosta interview
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:18.840]  because there's some very interesting subtleties that went on between the interview i did with
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:23.160]  her we're gonna do that and then as an investigative journalist i will get kaylan's take on this
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:29.800]  phenomenon as well effect is the next segment uh we will uh uh get back to uh kaylan and in south
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:33.320]  africa and the latest on tommy robinson and more but but but you're right we'll finish up with you
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:40.600]  now uh set up the video go through the subtleties for us so let me just uh do a little intro really
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:47.000]  quick i initially asked jim acosta about his support of the hashtag free press movement
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:53.880]  where essentially he's criticizing president trump for criticizing the mainstream media he claims
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:59.320]  that he's uh doing a dangerous thing by demonizing the mainstream media to the american public and
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:05.560]  thus putting the media at risk well here's the thing with that um on the same time he's pushing
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:13.720]  hashtag free press free journalism he's advocating cnn is advocating for info wars to be banned and
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:19.400]  shut down off of social media platforms so he can't have a double standard there where he's
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:24.920]  advocating for free press and then at the same time he's campaigning for other news organizations
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:32.200]  to be censored so again they equate trump this is critical that they equate trump with shang their
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:36.600]  liars with them assaulting him and they say you're gonna have the blood on your hands when we get
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:41.000]  attacked clearly setting up a false flag in my view or provocative one and then it's and then
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.200]  they go oh but jones denies sandy hook more made up twisted garbage right from hillary clinton
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:50.360]  but if i did say that i don't believe official news stories if i say i believe the moon's made
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:55.720]  of cheese that is my right i mean they are literally just just total hypocrisy talk about cnn
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:24:00.200]  it's crazy so let's go ahead and again uh this was last night trump's event tell us tell folks where
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:07.160]  it was uh this was in charleston west virginia at donald trump's rally um and he gave an amazing
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:12.360]  speech where trump actually called out uh the censorship that's been happening with info wars
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:17.640]  and you alex jones and he warned against it so it's interesting i didn't even hear his speech
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:23.240]  because i was outside interviewing but i actually called jimacost out on um basically the same lines
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.480]  that trump called the mainstream media out um let's go ahead and uh roll some of the clip from
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:34.680]  let's start with the costa here it is last night hey jimacosta what do you think about alex jones
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:39.800]  being banned is that okay i don't really have a comment i'm sorry well given that they had
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:46.040]  hashtag free press as a fellow journalist as a no come on i'm not gonna do anything attack
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:52.520]  as a fellow as a fellow journalist you know hashtag free press was trending um are you
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:57.960]  concerned at all i certainly support freedom of the press i support freedom of speech i certainly
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:03.880]  don't uh like what we've seen over the last couple of years uh the president attacking the press
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:10.200]  i think that that's really put a spotlight on the importance of a free press and i think anybody
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:16.520]  who you know responsibly exercises that right to free speech uh right of freedom of the press that
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:21.080]  that ought to be respected well don't you think that it's within the president's first amendment
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:26.200]  for him to criticize and make comment against the media absolutely it's well within his first
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:30.840]  amendment rights to make comments about the media but it's also within uh my first amendment
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.960]  rights to say that i don't think it's a good idea for the president of the united states to demonize
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:40.120]  the press and to call us the enemy of the people and that sort of thing i think that kind of speech
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.280]  now you are the enemy put journalists in harm's way and that's something that i've consistently
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:49.080]  said uh and i would certainly say it to you guys well you know it's interesting because
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.760]  you know some leftists out there will say info wars is fake news but then many on the right
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:26:00.680]  you've even heard says cnn is fake news and vc is fake news so what do you think about
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:05.640]  because he's saying he can't ban somebody and if you don't mind uh i'd like to make this the
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:13.000]  last thing that i said because i had to get going please stop please stop please stop my personal
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.520]  my personal opinion is that you can't put cnn in the same category as info wars with all due respect
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:21.880]  i think if you look at what the sandy hook parents are going through right now with respect to
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:26.920]  what about iraq all people you killed you're interrupting me i think if you were to take what
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:30.680]  take a look at what the sandy hook parents are going through right now with respect to info wars
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:35.400]  that there is a conversation going through they keep saying i'm saying it it's the media
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.120]  saying said in uh the public sphere what's being said on social media and what is being
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:45.560]  told to a lot of people out there who trust what you say and for example i don't think it's right
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:50.040]  to say to the sandy hook parents out there that what happened was a hoax i don't think that that's
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:55.160]  appropriate uh so you know i yeah so do you think the answer is too bad and so you don't have a
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:59.560]  first amendment if they say you said that is that you know listen everybody has a right to free
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.120]  speech everybody has a right to freedom of the press but i also think uh that you have to be
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:08.760]  responsible in exercising that right and what you say and what you this is one of the biggest liars
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:14.520]  on purpose it's called lying constantly those things that was calling for info wars to be banned
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.120]  don't you think that's kind of hypocritical though things have to be fact-based and truth-based
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:22.680]  but don't you think as a fellow news organization you shouldn't be calling for other news to be banned
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.080]  we deal with the truth we deal with the facts and i would recommend that you guys do the same thing
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.160]  in my personal opinion but don't you think it's better to just counter i understand but don't you
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.880]  think it's better to just counter people rather than ban them so again that is one of the biggest
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.840]  liars out there but at least he had the courage to talk to her as you know it looked wimpy if he
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:44.360]  ran off well you gotta listen to the end though alex the ending's like the best part i warned him
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.600]  about the pendulum swinging the other direction and he looks back and he looks kind of terrified
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:57.080]  essentially jim acosta noticed when he says oh well we can't compare it cnn to info wars you know
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:04.280]  what maybe we can't because info wars has has not had to make nearly as many retractions for fake news
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:11.720]  as cnn and in fact paul does of watson one of our star reporters actually has 200 000 more followers
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:16.680]  on twitter than jim acosta does so maybe they're out of our league well i mean tech stelter he can't

[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:44.760]  tommy's been through what's happening in the uk the danger but then you've you've been to australia
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:49.720]  you've been to south africa you've been all over uh they're now at the uk government others are
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:54.920]  saying take the whites farmers kill them and it's like i'm i'm an anti-white supremacist guy
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:59.560]  but then you sit there and you see the left organizing all these other minority groups
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:03.800]  for a majority worldwide 90 percent of the world's not white that whites are inherently evil you need
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:09.160]  to be killed five other african countries have wiped out all the white farmers and then collapsed
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:14.280]  back into the jungle this is what happened now they're trying i mean i saw them saying to australia
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.240]  the the the a nc president a month ago don't let whites flee they have to stay here but we're
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.160]  going to kill you he says we're going to slit your throat these are the quotes uh we're going to
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:28.440]  take your property that's the defense minister right there and it's like hitler's speeches but
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:33.160]  hitler didn't say we're going to kill you he did it secretly and was wrong this guy is saying this
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:39.640]  and it's just the craziest stuff on earth and most these a nc folks aren't even zulu that we're
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:43.560]  actually in south africa as you know you've been there i've read history books on it the zulu
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:50.040]  or you know nomadic very tough very night like very you know cool but it was kind of a wasteland
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.440]  compared to other areas of africa the dutch came in 400 years ago made it green then there was huge
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.160]  african migration into the area because there was cities and towns and prosperity so the idea that
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:02.600]  whites that have been there 400 years are bad and so because they're white they deserve to have
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:07.640]  their land taken and killed when most of them are poor is well i'm ranting i mean it's just just
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.240]  the whole gestalt go ahead go well this is happening globally this kind of rhetoric isn't
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:14.920]  just in south africa it's not just in the political chambers are there it's happening in australia
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:18.840]  it's happening in the uk it's happening everywhere this kind of creeping anti-white racism you see
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.120]  it with tweets with political people in america you see it tweets and political people in the
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:26.520]  uk kill all whites of the verified account they get away with it but what happens is in south
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:30.440]  africa the only reason that's different is because it's 30 40 years ahead where those people are
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:36.120]  running the country it's super super scary seeing it on the ground we actually interviewed some of
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:41.160]  the top members of the black first land first group which say that they want to kill white
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:46.040]  journalists and they want to confiscate white land using the army and the force and they want to
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.560]  make south africa black again we interviewed the senior deputy leader of that and she didn't
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:54.440]  know who lauren southern was but she was very very honest about what she wanted to do with that
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.840]  country her views she said every single place she went up and down the whole of south africa
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:03.480]  were accepted everywhere she went everybody embraced her views to violently remove white people
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.920]  and that is basically the symptom of a country that says marxism pushed on it far left ideologies
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:13.000]  pushed on it and then this kind of victimhood where they need you know marxism and and communism
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.200]  needs someone to blame everything liberation theology which is why they want to keep the
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.000]  whites in south africa because if they leave they'll go oh my god there's no one else to blame
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.640]  and then well then that is going to happen they're going to start blaming each other they're going
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:25.080]  to start separating into black tribal groups and then basically the whole south africa will
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.480]  just revert back to tribal warfare uh which and that's happened in five other countries
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:35.880]  these were the this is the zimbabwe application oh yeah i mean there's so many people in south
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:40.440]  africa told us that it's turning into zimbabwe actually our black hotel security guard told me
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.960]  that uh south africa was better under apartheid and then it was turning into and again we're not
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:49.320]  defending it you replace one evil that's that's kind of an old centralized system with a true
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:55.640]  evil system oh yeah i mean there is a massive storm and cloud of evil over south africa it's
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:00.120]  sweeping the west but it's going to be catastrophic for the people there it was so heartbreaking
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:03.400]  interviewing all the families who have been affected by this who have had their daughters
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:06.440]  raped mutilated murdered you know i interviewed the woman who said that she had to clean the
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:11.000]  skin from the rim of the bath from the 12 year old boy that was boiled alive in one of the house
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.880]  robberies and it's so people are so desensitized to it now there because they see it in every
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.520]  single part of life it's but we're taught only white people can be racist or be barbarous
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:25.960]  that's totally not true i mean in south africa and africa the more barbarous the better that's
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.920]  how you extract the power that's how you do it and if you're an albino they torture you and
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:34.920]  eat you if you're african i mean and it's and when christianity tried to fix it notice the
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:39.240]  chikoms come in they build a fence and give no one anything they just extract everything
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:42.920]  the west brought medicine and railroads and everything oh yeah they did but don't worry it's
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:47.800]  all leaving now oh well no well wherever white's colonized uh you'll have other cultures go to
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:51.080]  it and embrace all the greatness of it and then as soon as the whites are persecuted they leave
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:54.760]  everybody follows them for wherever they go next but this kind of evil has existed for hundreds
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.960]  and thousands of years across across the world but the only thing that's so annoying about it now
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:03.080]  is the selective outrage by nobody seems to care uh but at the time of the romans i mean when they
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.600]  would march into germany in places people were boiling people alive and killing and it was
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:11.880]  barbarous as well i think it was christianity i think is what the west had to offer that was special
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:17.080]  oh yeah and the christian beliefs of the farmers in south africa was absolutely inspirational they
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:20.440]  were absolutely dedicated to the bible it was the one thing that was keeping them all together
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:23.960]  it's the one thing oh hollywood acts like it's it's you know a lethal weapon movie where there's
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:30.680]  some racist guy going uh no really they're like super spartan very really poor but just working
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:34.920]  all the time yeah yeah yeah well christianity is the only thing that keeps them together in south africa
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:39.480]  christianity made the west and it made goodness it took away so much evil that was plaguing our
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:43.560]  societies for thousands of years um and now it's declining obviously we've seen evil takeover the
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:46.840]  west as well we've seen what's happening in sweden in britain in australia in america
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.400]  everywhere evil is taking over again and it's it's absolutely terrifying it's very very sad
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:57.320]  tell us about australia you went there too i thought australia was fine before i went there
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.360]  no one really talks about australia they think is you know it's just a little country over in the
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.600]  corner and if everything goes terribly in europe we would probably just flee there that's what a lot
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:09.720]  of people seem to think uh but no they same rhetoric that we've seen in britain that we're
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:13.960]  seeing in america the same kind of anti-white march's rhetoric and far left social justice
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:19.000]  rhetoric is taking place there just as much we had a coach full of people trying to turn up to our
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.920]  melbourne speech overturned the windows were smashed the towers were smashed by antifa
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:27.880]  the police find us 63 000 just to police the event uh at every single turn they tried to cancel it
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:32.520]  we went to new zealand the venue pulled out a few hours before and told us to get off the premises
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.160]  within an hour and thousands of protesters protested it in the city nearby just this is
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:42.520]  lauren southern stefan molyneux and so it would be just as difficult to organize an event in portland
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:49.000]  or in um london as it would in melbourne or new zealand the virus has spread globally and and let's
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:56.040]  be clear the eugenesis one of one of the release bio weapons to knock out the third world christians
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:01.000]  and others have stopped it and now the globalists just said well we'll just go and and brainwash
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.200]  the third world that out numbers you tend to want we'll make them racist we'll bring them in use them
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:12.760]  politically as a weapon and every western company country is accepting the takeover except russia
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:18.440]  and now trump is trying and that's why they hate russia so much russia is not going along with us
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:22.360]  no no they're not a lot of people are looking to russia and eastern europe as the last countries
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:25.720]  of bastions of nationalism and patriotism and countries that actually care about the room
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:29.320]  and again you know why because they're the line on the east that's constantly been slammed into
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.400]  for thousands of years oh yeah well they they have a cultural memory yeah hard times create strong
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.560]  men and it's exactly the case in eastern europe and russia and in good times create weakmen this
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.320]  is what we've seen in britain and the rest of europe we've seen flimsy demasculated men floating
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:44.760]  around letting everything letting their entire continent just be given away in a silver platter
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:48.920]  to the rest of the world brought up by this marxist ideology the globalism ideology which has
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:51.800]  been indoctrinated to their children and their children's children throughout the education
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:56.040]  system it's so sad seeing it actually play out this has started in the 60s but only now are we
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:59.320]  actually starting to see the impacts of it only now are we starting to see do you know how many
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:04.360]  people are arrested in london in the uk every single day for hate speech it's nine and five of
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:09.720]  those are convicted that means thrown in prison it's shocking you make a hitler joke that john

[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:33.720]  don't want it to happen they don't support it but they're not surprised by it everyone's desensitized
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:38.040]  essential to censorship which is what they wanted when you start being censored and when they start

[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:07.000]  so what i'm going to do this segment is just talk about some generalities
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:13.160]  and then we'll start the fourth hour with lee stranahan who's his own talk show host and own
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:19.560]  journalism school guy uh and and and so he'll host the uh show from the perspective of the

[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:30.040]  view of the citizen journalism school dot com uh you know as a guest here but i want to just talk
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:34.360]  about generalities with him in this segment the next and i'm gonna i'm gonna go and work on a
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.440]  bunch of big things we've got happening but i'll definitely be listening because you you get punch
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:44.440]  drunk to russia russia russia russia russia and then if you pull back it was actually an article
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:55.480]  in politico last year in january that ukraine's ever since sabotage trump backfire so this is
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:04.360]  before trump even got inaugurated zero one eleven this is like nine days before and i remember this
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.560]  was like a 21 page report and i already knew all this basically from our sources when he'd been
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:12.920]  in the new york times you know new york times it used to be pure evil like they had articles
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:20.680]  hillary's uranium problem hillary's ukraine problem in like 2015 and stuff but now they're
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.920]  just pure lies i mean it is like these people are like the mafia i mean i wouldn't get in a room
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:30.600]  alone with them i wouldn't talk to them i mean they are they are like hungry wolves that have
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.560]  that haven't eaten in two weeks i mean they're just like tongues wagging eyes wild like they
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:41.800]  got rabies or something so this next hour he's gonna play these exclusive clips i'm gonna ride
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.640]  with him a little bit to get into it but he's gone out and interviewed the people from the
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:52.600]  original roadmap in politico at the embassies in the government all of them that witnessed that
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:57.320]  he's got the proof this is unbelievable but let me explain how money laundering works with the
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:03.720]  clinton's they send stuff out to the state department money billions of dollars out to
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:08.120]  haydee or russia or wherever to take over those governments and then a large portion
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:13.160]  comes back into the foundation or into the campaign and they don't even try to hide it
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:18.200]  meanwhile you've got republican congressman three of them indicted the last month
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:24.200]  for buying their campaign drinks you're allowed to buy the campaign manager's
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:30.200]  dinner not drinks under federal law and flying the daughter of the of the congressman out of
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:39.080]  california dunkin hunters pet rabbit so you've got obama with 84 million dollars of secret money
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:45.400]  and he got a 375 thousand dollar fine on 84 million i mean that's associative press so
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:51.800]  these people it'd be like having hitler as the head judge the nuremberg trial and then
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:59.880]  he sentences george soros to life in prison for just being a collaborator you're like well
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.600]  i kind of but george orz was 1415 he was a nazi collaborator he's a bad guy maybe he goes to
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:09.960]  prison or something but you know hitler you can't really sit in judgment over soros your you know
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:13.720]  got to help you round up jews because you know they had to have jews that were could speak yiddish
[02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:18.280]  and stuff they could you know send in and capture them so that's all coming up we're gonna we're
[02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:22.760]  gonna go to lee here in just a moment and they get his kind of just stalt of this is boiled down
[02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:27.880]  his first look and then we'll come back and do it all let me just say this now though ladies and
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:34.200]  gentlemen we are running several specials right now new specials uh that are the biggest we've
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:43.160]  ever done and i'll just be honest with you um we had trouble procuring the uh proprietary concentrate
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:48.360]  of the organic chicken broth which is literally the equivalent of i mean we we think it's like
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:53.960]  50 it's hard to quantify 50 60 things of chicken noodle soup but none of the calories basically
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:58.360]  all condense the bone broth essence and then the turmeric root the chocomushroom the b-poll and the
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:05.000]  goji berry alfalfa powder and even more and so it was costing us i think it was like 20
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:11.160]  dollars a keg to make and we went with an even bigger supplier in the u.s but it took him five
[02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:15.320]  months to tool up and we've renamed it this is a new formula under law when you change a formula
[02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:20.680]  you just change the name or you call it plus it's no longer caveman it's now ultimate bone broth
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:24.920]  you know about bone broth and what it does you mix this in with your way you mix them with
[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:29.160]  your smoothies you mix in whatever then it tastes great doesn't really taste wonderful by itself

[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:48.120]  there are so many studies on bone broth so much research this is because we studied the industry
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:51.640]  like three years ago i was doing research on hot products and saw that bone broth was the hottest
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:58.680]  thing in like 2016 2015 and i went and looked at the formulas they were super weak and i said i
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:03.000]  want something you know five ten times stronger than anybody else so they have other formulas out
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:09.080]  though that are 60 bucks that aren't even as strong or good at 39 dollars it's a great deal
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:16.520]  this baby is 1995 out of the gates and how can i do it we quadrupled the order because it was a
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:21.880]  best seller before we did three runs of it but it got so long to get all the ingredients together
[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:26.440]  for each run i said double the order i didn't know i doubled the last order so they quadrupled the order

[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:28.120]  so we'll also talk about what do you think Trump should do to counter this 76 days out Ukrainian
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:33.400]  efforts to sabotage Trump backfire that's a year and a half ago Politico now with exclusive interviews
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:37.160]  in the next hour where the folks are actually in the article is Lee Stranahan Lee we got two
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:43.160]  minutes to break tell us what's coming up and why it's so important no wait Alex Jones I thought
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:48.040]  CNN had gotten rid of you that's what they told me wait I I can't believe I'm seeing you here I
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:51.800]  know they said I'd be shut down immediately instead we've got 10 times the traffic we used to have
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:56.440]  now part of that's because the drudgereport.com and that wonderful patriot but yeah shows me for
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  listening to CNN but yeah this was a big story and I gotta tell you if you or I have run this story
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:09.560]  that Politico ran saying that the Ukrainian government colluded with the DNC they'd call it
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:15.800]  a conspiracy theory right they'd go well Lee hosts the show for Sputnik and Alex Jones is Alex Jones
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:22.760]  but this is Politico who ran that story and Ken Vogel the reporter was later hired by the New York
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:28.680]  Times they didn't retract the story they've never corrected it this is their story that the Ukrainian
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:35.160]  government colluded with the DNC but I've been following that story for over a year and talking
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:40.520]  about it because it's a big story if you think about it at the time it came out we weren't
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:45.400]  thinking about the mute there was no Mueller investigation but if you think about it the
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:53.320]  Ukrainian government colluding with the DNC is exactly what the DNC ends up accusing
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:59.560]  Donald Trump of doing except saying oh he's doing it with the Russians so what you'll see here if
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:05.640]  you look at this story is that this has been a fiction we've been this upside down world
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:14.200]  because the DNC created this narrative in the 2016 election before the Trump power
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:18.920]  sure they knew their Achilles heel was being sold out to foreign government so they projected
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:26.280]  on to Trump what they had themselves had done and because and because we had overthrown by a coup
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:31.880]  because we'd installed the Obama administration did a coup and got Yanukovych out of there we'd
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:36.200]  installed the Ukrainian government by the way Soros went on Farid Zakharian bragged about the five
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:42.920]  billion and the state department so yeah it's all on record and so they had Ukraine as their engine
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:45.480]  so they used money Ukraine money to Russia it was anti Russia

[02:59:56.440 --> 03:00:08.280]  so
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:23.720]  well coming up next segment it's politico's big whistleblower all confirmed they tried to shut
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:30.520]  it down blows the hillary russian connection wide open no it's not to putin it's to the money
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:34.600]  that we're sending in to overthrow putin using that to overthrow ukraine and then send money back
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:38.840]  to hillary it's all confirmed investigative journalist least ran ahead of citizenjournalism
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:44.360]  school.com and populist.tv is taken over but we were talking during the break you were making
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:54.200]  some great points it's bold to have senator widen senator murphy senator you name it coming out and
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:59.720]  saying shut me down shut thousands of conservatives down they're panicking they're trying to mainline
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:04.840]  total censorship like it's no big deal and just sneak it in but now even bill marr and they
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:08.920]  still use turning against them why do you think they're pushing what's the big event do you think
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:13.880]  that's coming that they want us all shut down and why are they particularly seeing us as the first
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:22.680]  domino. I think that the a lot of the stuff that the globalists have been working on it's all coming
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:28.760]  together the thing that screwed them up was trump the globalists they had a plan things were going
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:36.280]  along with the coup in the ukraine and a lot of it relates to nato here's what it is after the
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:41.160]  break of the soviet union there was no reason for nato right what's the way it was to defend against
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:47.400]  the soviet union so they've had to create a bogie man and that's a part of what's feeding into this
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:54.200]  so everything is going along fine then someone like trump comes along who does not go with the
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:02:00.600]  establishment uh democrats or republicans that doesn't quite fit in and they and he's criticizing
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:08.120]  in nato he's specifically going away why we need nato very common sense terrified them and so
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:15.400]  so those people when they see their plan getting ruined one of the things that ruined it was media
[03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:21.560]  with people like you and the the globalists are going along here when they listen to alex jones
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:30.200]  they go they hear it with the ear if they know you know what you're talking about so to the casual
[03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:36.760]  observer they go well alex he's just ranting about who's carol quigley well they know who he is right
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:42.840]  and so they're that concerns them and you this is why you're a real threat to them because you
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:49.400]  actually your depth of knowledge about this stuff is far greater than most people so that that's why
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:52.920]  i think they're coming after you well that is it because i've had some of them off record you
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:56.440]  know try to get me hired and i can only talk about one of them because he didn't run in front of john
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:01.080]  harmon might be so works with this producer now he's had affiliate relations when i had roth cop
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:04.920]  head of the kissinger group going look you see it you need to be with us blah blah blah you know you
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:09.160]  can actually influence things they don't they they think everybody's so dumb that don't want to read
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:15.480]  policy papers or no one would you know would read uh you know they're different plans and so it does
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:21.720]  freak them out but i think they're over worried about my show can the youth are just breaking with
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:27.240]  them period and i think it is because i get into actual policy you're right that freaks them out
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:31.400]  they think i'm more dangerous than i really am they don't get the world's already moved on
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:42.120]  yeah it's uncontainable at this point and they don't they don't like that they see it i saw this
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:48.920]  one i used to work at mbc it was a graphic artist on access hollywood ten ten years ago and i could
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:54.440]  see the breakdown of the network when i was working at mbc they didn't it was when youtube
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:04:00.760]  would just come out they didn't know what to do with it and and you could see the i had conversations
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:10.280]  with executives there uh and and they they were like yeah we don't get it and and it just shifted
[03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:14.840]  everything in the industry very very quickly and so someone like you coming along getting a much
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:21.560]  bigger audience than them covering topics they would never cover in a million years it would never
[03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:28.120]  talk about uh any any of the global stuff you're talking about they would never talk about well
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:31.640]  they always just said it didn't exist i had i remember i had the host of abc nightly news here
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:35.560]  i showed him like seven clips people calling for world government world leaders and he goes
[03:04:35.560 --> 03:04:40.760]  that's a different world government they're talking about and i went and he goes plus governance
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:45.160]  isn't government i went yeah it is and then he just went he goes look i'm a paid soldier
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:51.160]  he we went to dinner and he said listen i'm a mercenary and he goes i don't think you see

[03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:18.760]  uh
[03:06:27.800 --> 03:06:31.800]  jim carrey calls for burning trump at the stake figuratively speaking so you think it's bad
[03:06:32.920 --> 03:06:39.640]  in this painting he put out where uh it's uh my shelf in shot hanity fighting and then if you
[03:06:39.640 --> 03:06:43.080]  look at the audience if you pull back and see the full image everyone's nazi's watching
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:49.480]  just just i mean come up with something more original something a little bit a little bit newer
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:55.400]  but now witch hunt so trump keeps pointing out that hey this is a witch hunt nothing about russia
[03:06:55.400 --> 03:07:01.880]  okay maybe koan pled guilty to something illegal with taxi cabs and uh you know manifort might have
[03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:07.080]  kept some money offshore that everybody else does and you know this other congressman you know
[03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:13.320]  dunk and hunter might have paid for drinks for staff on the campaign money my god but now witch
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:18.520]  but he says oh i'm gonna burn trump at the stake figuratively now and i'll give it to him he's
[03:07:18.520 --> 03:07:22.840]  saying figuratively it's like when i say that's high noon with muller you know we're gonna have a
[03:07:22.840 --> 03:07:27.800]  political shootout figuratively but that means figuratively i don't want to hurt muller personally
[03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:31.880]  it's like i don't want to run around in my yard step on dog turds or something i i mean i just
[03:07:31.880 --> 03:07:35.720]  wanted to get off my back but but don't think he's actually saying kill trump i think he's just trying
[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:40.280]  to be provocative and get attention and and say that oh you are a witch and we're gonna burn you
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:47.320]  so uh at you know at the same time though it's it's it's just insane uh so he says he doesn't
[03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:51.000]  want to be part of hollywood because nobody wanted to see his movies anymore and he's a failure
[03:07:51.800 --> 03:07:57.080]  no he failed in hollywood later in life he's he admits he's mentally ill he made fun of charlton
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:02.520]  hasten when he died because he believes the right to self-defense no he's going along with hollywood
[03:08:02.520 --> 03:08:08.360]  he's a follower he's an establishment jim carrey is the establishment jim carrey saying burn
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:13.720]  trump at the stake is the opposite of a trailblazer kanye west
[03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:21.560]  he is a trailblazer donald trump is a trailblazer matt drudge is a trailblazer you the listeners
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:27.880]  and viewers are trailblazers you're amazing so hey carrey has a right to show trump being burned
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:35.000]  at the stake as an artist he said figuratively that's fine i get the allegory but what are you
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:41.080]  really saying yeah let's say he's a witch let's have the mob let's take him down let's do it here
[03:08:41.080 --> 03:08:47.160]  here's that one minute though where kanye west lays it all out here it is we are drugged out
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:55.880]  we are following other people's opinions we are controlled by the media today it all changes
[03:08:55.880 --> 03:09:01.640]  this reality has been forced upon us it is a choice just like what i said slavery is a choice
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:06.360]  istein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:11.240]  so we keep on saying i hate you i hate you you you you how are we gonna get a different result out
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:19.240]  of hate why don't we just try love why don't we just try love we have the resources for a peaceful
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:25.560]  world you know sometimes you need some crazy mother to change something steve jobs is crazy

[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:13.320]  exclusive audio from the report over a year ago by politico about how hillary was involved
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:17.880]  through russian money but the u.s said it back through ukraine trying to manipulate the election
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:24.200]  this is the story cn and others want killed ukraine officials efforts to sabotage trump

[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:40.440]  they think they can de-platform us and that you won't spread the free podcast you won't

[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:12.200]  wing not job source right the way the media denigrates people like alex or me this is a a
[03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:20.200]  mainstream political source so politico publishes an article 2017 right before the inauguration
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:29.240]  saying that the ukrainian government had colluded with the dnc now it's a well reported article
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:36.120]  it's detailed and the thing about it is again if it had dropped today if the friend of mine pointed
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:43.320]  out if this story had come out today you'd go wait the dnc colluded with ukraine would be a big deal
[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:48.360]  because we have the Mueller investigation but don't forget this is before trump was even inaugurated
[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:56.440]  and it told the story of a woman named alexandra chalupa alexandra chalupa is a long time
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:03.720]  operative for the dnc she worked in the clinton white house so she's been you know with the clinton's
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:13.240]  for a long time and she's ukrainian-american and interestingly her sister irina is a fellow at
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:18.280]  the atlantic council and if you know anything about the atlantic council that'll mean something to you
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:25.080]  and her sister andre is a writer who's associated with people like michael weiss michael weiss uh
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:33.960]  you may know from the interpreter cnn and a daily beast editor uh so so very very interesting
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:38.600]  connections if you know some of the atlantic council's a nato lucifob world war three group
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:44.120]  that that that's exactly right so alex you you you get why i'm bringing that up i mean
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:51.480]  these connections are very significant but the crux of the story is this and it's proven by politico
[03:12:51.480 --> 03:12:59.800]  that alexandra chalupa was working for the dnc doing oppo research and she colluded with the
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:07.000]  government not just a couple of officials but with the ambassador charlie who was taking orders
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:14.120]  from petro poroshenko the president so this is as high as it goes and it's it's very detailed but
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:21.080]  nothing happens with the story and again it's politico mainstream reporter nothing happens
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:28.600]  you know trumps inaugurated the woman's soros funds the woman's march and there we go so uh i
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:35.080]  noticed the story a few months after that when i was doing research and other things and i'm like
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:41.000]  well this is really significant this story's there's a big deal here and i started running down
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  details of the story uh by contacting people that were mentioned in it and i there was a
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:55.560]  whistleblower there was a brave person named andre who's featured in that politico story
[03:13:55.560 --> 03:14:01.720]  who when certain officials were denying that this had happened he was the one going no
[03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:10.200]  i worked in the embassy this absolutely happened and uh i was very interested in that person
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:17.560]  because you know he's the whistleblower right so i started to make contact with him about a year ago
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:24.360]  and i wanted to interview him on the record for over a year and you know i have citizen journalism
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:31.640]  school one of the things we teach you is it's a hard lesson to learn but patience where if you're
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:37.560]  if you're getting stories right you have to be patient with the story and not try to chase every
[03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:43.000]  headline that's out there but sometimes you have to stick to it the way a fisherman sticks to you
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:52.920]  know really reeling in a big fish by ignoring some of the smaller ones so uh i have kept on this
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:15:03.480]  and yesterday after a year i got to interview andre and i i did an audio interview now i want to set
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:09.880]  this up this is the person as you'll hear and i think you'll hear in this clip it's a short clip
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:16.520]  i did a 50 minute interview with him on the record and this is a very brave person as you'll hear
[03:15:16.520 --> 03:15:25.400]  he's been threatened right uh uh they're telling lies about him around washington dc they're trying
[03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:34.680]  to ruin his livelihood now it's but he's a truth teller and um i did this 50 minute interview with him
[03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:43.720]  and it confirmed everything that he said in the politico story stay there at least ran ahead right
[03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:49.400]  there the exclusive audio straight ahead as we reboot this key story to expose the real russian

[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:48.360]  appreciate alex letting me fill in form with the rest of the hour here let me just tell you a little
[03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:55.560]  bit about myself i host a uh show on split nick monday through friday called uh fault lines with
[03:20:55.560 --> 03:21:01.720]  nixon stranahan and uh we do that show every morning but the story we're going to talk about
[03:21:01.720 --> 03:21:07.960]  the reason i mentioned that is because so here i am a guy i host a show on split nick which a lot
[03:21:07.960 --> 03:21:13.240]  of media sources well don't we're not don't take anything from that they're funded by russia avoid
[03:21:13.240 --> 03:21:19.240]  that media source and i'm telling it i'm telling this story on info wars a lot of people don't
[03:21:19.240 --> 03:21:26.120]  in alex jones can't take that as a source but the story that we're telling wasn't actually
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:35.560]  originated by me or by info wars it was originated by politico an establishment political organization
[03:21:35.560 --> 03:21:41.320]  and ken vogel was later hired by the new york dimes that's where he works now this is an
[03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:48.200]  establishment reporter and they reported that the ukrainian embassy the ukrainian officials
[03:21:48.200 --> 03:21:55.080]  were colluding with the dnc with this operative named alex janet chalupa that's what this story
[03:21:55.080 --> 03:22:00.920]  was about that's what they discussed and it goes into a great amount of detail about that
[03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:07.560]  and part of what it was there's a whistleblower who worked at the embassy and this whistleblower
[03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:16.440]  was somebody who i'd wanted to talk to to follow up on that reporting so for over a year i worked
[03:22:16.440 --> 03:22:26.280]  on that his name is andre and he was the person who as i as reveal in my interview with him he
[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:34.120]  was worried that this plan where the dnc was collaborating with the ukrainian government
[03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:39.640]  was going to backfire he's a loyal ukrainian who was like well i think this is going this is not
[03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:45.160]  going to work out well but he was introduced to a democratic operative who worked in the clinton
[03:22:45.160 --> 03:22:51.800]  whitehouse named alex janet chalupa she's ukrainian and well let's just hear that's what this first
[03:22:51.800 --> 03:23:01.320]  clip is i interviewed him yesterday and this is i'm so excited because this is uh this interview
[03:23:01.320 --> 03:23:07.560]  brings the story back to life i wanted him to go on the record now you'll hear it in his own voice
[03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:17.400]  this is how he was introduced by the ukrainian embassy officials to alexander chalupa yeah
[03:23:17.400 --> 03:23:23.000]  and uh she asks me you should talk guys you have a lot in common you should get to know each other
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  well and andre you should help her and then she backs off and chalupa introduces herself says
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:38.520]  i work for the dnc and we're working with hillary's team and we are working really closely on getting
[03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:44.360]  dirt and any information connecting at that time presidential candidate donald trump
[03:23:44.360 --> 03:23:52.040]  and his team any of his team members and with russia or any russia mafia as they as she said
[03:23:52.040 --> 03:23:56.680]  and i was like why didn't why why are you looking for that information because we
[03:23:56.680 --> 03:24:04.040]  plan to have a committee hearing in congress uh in september october right before the elections
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:08.280]  to take at that time presidential candidate donald trump off the election
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:15.480]  okay so i want you to get the significance of that there's a few things there first off
[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:22.040]  this is this is not me telling it this is the guy who did it this is the guy who's the source
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:28.120]  for the politico story this is why it's so significant because this is an unimpeachable
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:33.560]  source this is the guy who's the source in the story that no one's ever questioned they just
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:42.360]  ignored it so what he's saying is clearly alexander chalupa introduced herself to him as part of the
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:52.440]  dnc that she was specifically looking for trump and this was in uh march or early april he
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:57.160]  say thinks it's around there but he thinks it was march i'd have to look it up but
[03:24:58.200 --> 03:25:04.600]  let's go with march that was before the trump think about this early march that was before
[03:25:04.600 --> 03:25:10.120]  the trump tower meeting which they're now saying is evidence of russian collusion that's before
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:18.440]  uh that's that's even before uh why i'm trying to think of the other thing that they they always
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:25.720]  use is an excuse for this but early march is when oh i know the dnc break-in the dnc break-in was
[03:25:25.720 --> 03:25:34.760]  reported in june forgive me so this is even before that right they've made up this narrative the dnc
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:41.400]  made up the trump russian narrative before any of the things that they use that came later
[03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:49.160]  to prove it so she's introduced herself to him as i'm with the dnc i'm looking for dirt on trump
[03:25:49.160 --> 03:25:59.000]  or manifold okay paul manifold's been targeted think about this that they're making a big deal
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:05.560]  about these pleasey uh you know being found guilty yesterday on eight counts he's been targeted
[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:13.720]  by the dnc that's what you're revealing here he's been targeted by the dnc since early 2016
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:21.320]  and what you've seen has been a basically a kangaroo trial a you know a show trial here
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:30.280]  for manifold for the person who specifically was being targeted uh by chalupa now andre the person
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:38.680]  i'm interviewing here his job was to coordinate with campaigns not in a a bad way in other words
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:46.360]  every embassy coordinates if you need a press release about something right but they came to
[03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:52.760]  him specifically and he said this in the interview with me and said you will not coordinate with a
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:59.720]  trump campaign so that was the first thing they told him to not coordinate with a trump campaign
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:05.480]  but they also told him to work with this woman alexandra chalupa and andre the reason i say
[03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:12.520]  he's a brave whistleblower is he said i'm why do you want me to do this this is not what we do
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:19.240]  we're not supposed to favor one candidate over the other that's not what we're supposed to do
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:26.120]  and he was threatened over it and they threatened that he would be fired and to his credit he quit
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:32.600]  rather than stick around for the corruption uh he did not talk to alexandra chalupa again
[03:27:33.400 --> 03:27:40.680]  but he told me in the interview that there's other evidence that he's aware of that exist out there
[03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:47.720]  so that's why in the story one of the first things i did was make sure that the entire interview
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:54.440]  got to certain public officials who i know and trust and there's only a couple of them right
[03:27:54.440 --> 03:28:00.520]  there's not many you can know or trust but because this is significant evidence i think
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:08.360]  not of a a conspiracy there's no other way to put it that the dnc was working with the ukrainian
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:18.120]  government as far back as march and don't forget march was also significantly march 2016 was around
[03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:23.880]  the time the loretta lynch started talking about hey maybe we should do stuff maybe we should start
[03:28:23.880 --> 03:28:29.640]  a wiretap program so don't forget that's significant as well when we come back i got a little bit more
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:45.560]  to add to that timeline we'll be back i'm least ready to watch the end for wars
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:57.320]  if you like alkaline water or know someone that does you're going to love the dylan living water

[03:31:58.040 --> 03:32:03.720]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[03:32:03.720 --> 03:32:09.480]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:32:09.480 --> 03:32:15.640]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we
[03:32:15.640 --> 03:32:22.120]  employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:32:22.120 --> 03:32:28.280]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:34.120]  from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:32:34.120 --> 03:32:40.920]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure
[03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:47.080]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:32:47.080 --> 03:32:52.840]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:32:52.840 --> 03:32:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:09.080 --> 03:33:15.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:33:15.400 --> 03:33:25.480]  everybody how you doing i'm leis train and welcome back thanks again to alex jones for
[03:33:25.480 --> 03:33:29.640]  letting me fill in for him this hour you know i think one of the things i'm just gonna say this
[03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:35.000]  i hope again i also show called uh fault lines with nixon's train and split nick money through
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:39.800]  friday seven to ten a but one of the things i like about talking to an info wars audience
[03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:47.000]  i'm going to be honest is i don't have to dumb it down uh what i mean by that is i can mention
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:55.240]  the atlantic council for instance as i did and in that last segment and know that a lot of people
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:34:01.000]  in the info wars audience immediately go okay the atlantic council i understand how that connects
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:06.680]  to certain things if you don't know how that connects okay that's fine it seems like an obscure
[03:34:06.680 --> 03:34:13.560]  reference but it's nice to talk to an audience who actually does understand how these things connect
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:21.960]  at least much more so than an audience that just watches the mainstream media so if i
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:27.560]  reference some of these things that seem a little obscure to some people that's okay other people
[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:35.160]  in the audience may know what i'm talking about the thing about this story that was very significant
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:46.600]  to me was that it was as clear collusion as you could get but it was followed by interference
[03:34:46.600 --> 03:34:51.400]  you know they talk about russian collusion and interference again this is a narrative that the
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:35:00.840]  dnc made up the real collusion and interference was with dnc and the ukrainians but they projected
[03:35:00.840 --> 03:35:06.760]  it on to the republicans this is the craziest thing they projected exactly what they did
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:13.160]  on the republicans but it was the dnc polluting with the ukrainian government not just a low
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:21.480]  level official but with the ambassador charlie right and so this political article exposed
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:27.480]  all that yesterday i did a long interview i'm going to break that up defendant uh
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:36.680]  uh sort of bite bite sized chunk article soon but i just played a clip from in the last segment
[03:35:36.680 --> 03:35:42.360]  from this interview one of the things i was interested in was after this political article
[03:35:42.360 --> 03:35:51.720]  came out did my source he's not hard to find uh did my source get a lot of calls from the media
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:36:00.280]  in other words this should be a big story right so you think the media would crack it down so
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:10.120]  here's what he said let's let's play that clip any reason uh when the story broke uh in politica
[03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:17.400]  how many journalists have contacted you to confirm that story or or get caught
[03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:29.160]  and hardly anybody from washington yeah that's it no nobody contacted him and you'd think like i
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:33.960]  say a big story like this a person not hard to find they would want to get in touch with them but
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:38.840]  they didn't because the reason they didn't want to get in touch with them is because this was a
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:45.240]  narrative that was set right this is a narrative that the democrats had decided upon well before
[03:36:45.240 --> 03:36:49.960]  if you again if you look at the timing and what he's talking about this is march april
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:57.640]  very significant in the timeline it's before the russian hack was announced it's well before the
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:04.760]  trump tower meeting right all the things that they say prove russian collusion this is well before
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:13.560]  that and it's exactly the same narrative now uh i think this is significant especially again talking
[03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:21.720]  to an informal wars crowd because who's one of the people coming after alex right clearly it's cnn
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:29.080]  and the reason cnn is coming after alex here's one of the reasons i think this two reasons actually
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:35.000]  one of them is its legacy media versus new media which alex and i talked about before it's an you
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:44.680]  know an old media conglomerate cnn uh looking at uh upstart like alex getting much bigger ratings
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:51.480]  for much less investment and going we got to shut this down but there's an ideological thing in
[03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:59.000]  there too which is cnn is part of the media establishment that keeps a a narrative going
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  and this is shown here because when this political article resurfaced and it resurfaced again it came
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:16.440]  out originally in uh january 2017 then a few months later i'd been following it for a little while
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:23.560]  before that but sarah sanders mentioned it in a press briefing in a white house press briefing
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:30.280]  and suddenly the whole article flared up again who came to the defense of the media narrative
[03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:42.920]  but cnn okay cnn's job was to tamp down the appearance that this story had any substance to it
[03:38:43.880 --> 03:38:52.440]  so what cnn did was they contacted alexandr shalupa and this is on record there's a cnn article
[03:38:52.440 --> 03:39:00.040]  if you look it up if you look up alexandr shalupa uh uh d you know dnc ukraine
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:07.240]  something like that scandal something like that you'll find this story from cnn there you have
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:12.920]  first on cnn there it is they found it very quickly first on cnn former dnc contractor
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:20.440]  denies working with ukrainian officials on anti trump research okay so what they did was they
[03:39:20.440 --> 03:39:28.040]  here's the way that cnn does their journalism they went to her and they said hey were you colluding
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:35.640]  with the the government of the dnc and she said no i wasn't i wasn't doing apo research at all
[03:39:36.360 --> 03:39:41.880]  and then cnn goes okay thanks and that's what they print if they'd bothered to look
[03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:54.280]  her sister andria chalupa had tweeted out not once but twice my sister alexandr was doing
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:40:01.000]  opposition research for the dnc she tweeted it out her own sister had tweeted that out two times
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:07.800]  right and we also knew from wiki leaks again you even looked at you'll find this very easily look
[03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:17.080]  of wiki leaks alexandr chalupa you'll find that in an email that was exposed by wiki leaks alexandr
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:25.800]  chalupa was reporting on the opposition research she was doing on maniforte to uh louise moranda
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:32.920]  who was the uh director communication communications director for the dnc she's literally reporting
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:37.880]  to him now by the way that's significant again i'm going to get a little deep here for the infowars
[03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:43.240]  audience it's significant because louise moranda was one of the people who was put into place
[03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:52.040]  by the hillary clinton campaign when the dnc made the uh deal with the hillary clinton campaign
[03:40:52.680 --> 03:40:59.160]  the joint fundraising agreement the jfa when they made that hillary clinton demanded that they
[03:40:59.160 --> 03:41:08.120]  be able to pick the communications director so that guy was the guy put into place when hillary
[03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:14.440]  made the deal to take over the dnc so in so in other words when chalupa's reporting to this guy
[03:41:14.440 --> 03:41:19.160]  this is effectively reporting to hillary that's what that's what i want you to understand this
[03:41:19.160 --> 03:41:27.320]  is a guy put into place by hillary so she's reporting on how she was colluding with ukrainian
[03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:36.840]  journalist at the open world uh she misnames it it's the uh it's the open world foundation it
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:41.480]  basically it's part of the library of congress and by the way again a little deep dive for infowars
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:49.240]  people started by george soros who's no longer involved with it sort of i guess but he's one
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:54.840]  of the people who founded it and so she had used that resource which is supposed to be a
[03:41:54.840 --> 03:42:00.760]  non-partisan governmental resource for the library of congress to host these ukrainian
[03:42:00.760 --> 03:42:08.440]  journalists and she was telling the story to again the dnc people so for her to go on cnn
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:14.200]  i mean this is this had all been by the way that email that we just showed from wiki leaks that
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:20.440]  was in the original political article so when cnn to try to debunk
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:27.400]  the sarah sanders talking about the political article they didn't even want to debunk the
[03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:33.080]  political article what did they do they printed what alexander chalupa said and they ignored
[03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:39.480]  what she'd said in the email it's the biggest lamest cover-up ever and this is why cnn is
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:51.640]  terrified of someone like alex because we don't play that game you're an infowars so
[03:43:10.200 --> 03:43:17.000]  two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all

[03:47:49.720 --> 03:47:57.480]  together um and uh i've covered big stories in syria uh where i went over to bay root levinon
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:03.800]  in 2013 been talking about that and and all of these stories that's why it's great to talk to
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:12.440]  an info wars audience because uh if you're like me i think a lot of people who watch info wars are
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:19.960]  interested in research and maybe they're not i've been blessed in that i'm able to do it full time
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:25.320]  so maybe you're like an armchair researcher right and if you don't know what i'm talking about here
[03:48:25.320 --> 03:48:31.640]  don't worry about it but i i bet most of you know what i'm talking about where you start to learn
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:41.640]  like once you figure out who soros is you start to see soros everywhere where most people don't
[03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:47.880]  so you go okay well oh wait one side okay source is this guy he funds all of these different
[03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:56.600]  organizations the civil society groups once you get that you start to go oh wait well this group
[03:48:56.600 --> 03:49:03.000]  is connected to that group and you see things that most people don't you know what i'm talking about
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:08.440]  right if you don't don't worry about it but i think most of you do now i'm going to give you a new
[03:49:08.440 --> 03:49:14.920]  name to plug into that equation so the same way that right now you know the name soros and don't
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:20.920]  look into it i'm going to give you a name that i've only really been on the tail of a trail of
[03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:28.840]  about three weeks now and the name is cortikovsky and i'm going to spell that because i want you
[03:49:28.840 --> 03:49:34.120]  to start being able to plug it into your own research uh it's uh i've had to figure out
[03:49:34.120 --> 03:49:48.680]  some name cortikovsky it's k h o dork d or k o v sky that's what i remember cortikovsky
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:54.440]  cortikovsky that's it that's the name right there god bless and pray they'll put it up i do a radio
[03:49:54.440 --> 03:50:00.600]  show it's nice to be on info wars where i can show you the video too so there's his name cortikovsky
[03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:05.320]  start plugging him into your equations here's what you're going to find about cortikovsky
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:12.600]  you're going to find cortikovsky give her work on a jigsaw puzzle and you're trying to get one
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:19.400]  section of jigsaw puzzle to match up with the other section and then you find one big chunk
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:25.400]  and the whole thing starts to just come together and you're like oh okay that's that solved the
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:33.320]  puzzle cortikovsky is that guy you probably when you've been researching gone okay i see how this
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:40.360]  connects but i don't quite see cortikovsky's guy here's who he is he was at one point he was the
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:46.760]  richest man in russia he came he's one of the russian oligarchs and he came to power in the
[03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:55.320]  nineties okay and remember this is under clinton right and so under clinton we had the rise of the
[03:50:55.320 --> 03:51:02.440]  neoliberals like larry summers and the people at harvard and they brought if this is what happened
[03:51:02.440 --> 03:51:09.160]  in the 1990s clinton administration larry summers the harvard people went into russia they said well
[03:51:09.160 --> 03:51:16.920]  we're going to give you shock therapy is what they called it and and they they went and they basically
[03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:23.480]  gave russia bad advice and helped to loot the country and it was very corrupt and there were
[03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:30.680]  there were actually people who were indicted and charged criminally guys like jonathan hay if you
[03:51:30.680 --> 03:51:36.520]  look him up all these people at harvard who were actually indicted because there was real corruption
[03:51:36.520 --> 03:51:44.280]  going on there between this harvard group clinton connected people and uh and what was going on
[03:51:45.480 --> 03:51:51.320]  just right after the soviet union fell okay this is kind of wild west territory soviet
[03:51:51.320 --> 03:51:58.280]  union has just fallen and a lot of people see well it's going to be freedom but to a certain mindset
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:03.640]  it's like oh no no this represents an economic opportunity the soviet union has fallen let's
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:08.200]  see if we can make some money here this is the way the globalists see these things so
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:15.800]  kortikovsky is one of those guys who comes up in that atmosphere of chaos right he's a relatively
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:23.000]  young guy and he becomes the richest man in russia and the way he does it here's an example of the
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:29.720]  kind of thing he figures out all these soviet assets are going in these auctions that they're
[03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:37.400]  having okay so like an oil company is going to be auctioned off it used to be held by the
[03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:45.560]  soviet union now who's going to own it so what he did was he bought kortikovsky bought the bank
[03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:56.200]  that was going to do the auction called bank menatec m e n a t e p menatec okay he buys the bank
[03:52:56.200 --> 03:53:05.560]  then kortikovsky cancels the other people who are going to bid on the oil company and he buys
[03:53:05.560 --> 03:53:11.800]  the oil company himself does that make sense so he buys he buys the bank that was going to do the
[03:53:11.800 --> 03:53:17.720]  auction he cancels the auction he buys it himself and that's the way he saved he bought a company
[03:53:17.720 --> 03:53:26.760]  that was valued at 45 billion dollars he was able to buy it effectively 300 million dollars okay so
[03:53:26.760 --> 03:53:32.520]  this is the way these guys were able to make money this is very forward thinking stuff right uh
[03:53:33.720 --> 03:53:40.360]  but completely corrupt right and again it was a wild west and while the clinton administration
[03:53:40.360 --> 03:53:45.880]  was looking on all this and fine because there's money to be made by the people you know from
[03:53:45.880 --> 03:53:58.440]  harvard and everything uh so uh while while all of this is happening okay it's horrible hardship
[03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:04.920]  for people in russia people are starving people are dying it's not fun for the people in russia
[03:54:04.920 --> 03:54:12.920]  at all and the oligarchs control the political system they eventually pushed this guy named
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:19.000]  putin into power and they think he's going to be another puppet but what happens is putin
[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:25.640]  kind of when he comes into power this guy who they thought was going to be their puppet goes
[03:54:25.640 --> 03:54:32.680]  no no wait a minute you guys are looting our resources kortikovsky you're about to sell
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:41.240]  the russian oil company to exxon mobile and again if you look it up this is what was happening
[03:54:41.240 --> 03:54:47.400]  kortikovsky in fact if you look up there's an article new york times 2003 who's buying political
[03:54:47.400 --> 03:54:54.120]  influence there's a picture look up kortikovsky george w bus photo you'll find a photo of him
[03:54:54.120 --> 03:55:02.680]  if you look up here's the other thing look look this up senate resolution 322 from the year 2006
[03:55:02.680 --> 03:55:11.880]  senate resolution 322 from 2006 that was a resolution in support of kortikovsky it had one person
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:22.120]  who introduced it and two cosponsors 2006 look at this introduced by joe biden the two cosponsors
[03:55:22.120 --> 03:55:31.800]  are barack obama and john mccain both coming out in favor of this guy kortikovsky who most of you
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:40.120]  never heard of before think about this both of the 2008 presidential candidates supported this guy
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:46.040]  but if you google it right now you won't find any stories about that wouldn't you think of one
[03:55:46.040 --> 03:55:54.440]  reporter go gee it's kind of curious that you both were the only cosponsors on this bill
[03:55:54.440 --> 03:56:01.160]  introduced by your future vice president who's this kortikovsky guy no no no one looked into it
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:08.120]  because that would have disrupted the narrative you can't look into that because it affects both
[03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:15.240]  candidates right it's a it's the republican and the democrat and you see now that they're not really
[03:56:15.240 --> 03:56:21.720]  two parties they're just as bill hicks used to say you know the puppet on the left and the
[03:56:21.720 --> 03:56:27.080]  puppet on the right and oh look it's the same guy controlling the puppet it's kortikovsky behind
[03:56:27.080 --> 03:56:33.880]  both of them and when you start to look it up you'll find that kortikovsky links quite plainly
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:40.200]  with soros and so again this is where the two jigsaw puzzles start to come together so this guy
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:48.360]  kortikovsky most of you've never heard of just look supported by obama and mccain and biden in 2006
[03:56:48.360 --> 03:56:54.040]  there it is there's a photo there it is you'll you'll find he was buying his way through russia
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:57:01.480]  so what happens is Putin comes along and says stop you can't sell them the resources anymore that
[03:57:01.480 --> 03:57:08.280]  you're trying to sell so because what had happened was Putin had said we're going to limit the amount
[03:57:08.280 --> 03:57:16.200]  of foreign ownership of some key resources like oil so the way around that was to go through a guy
[03:57:16.200 --> 03:57:22.920]  like kortikovsky and that's what they did so again a deep dive for people who are info wars
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:29.160]  researchers but once you start to put this name together look into it you're going to see kortikovsky
[03:57:29.160 --> 03:57:34.440]  really piece a lot of things together for the next time i'm lisa rannan thanks very much thanks
