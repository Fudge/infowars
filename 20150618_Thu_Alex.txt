[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:27.560]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us very
[00:27.560 --> 00:36.840]  tragic events have taken place in Charleston on the East Coast a deranged
[00:36.840 --> 00:44.360]  classically mentally ill-looking young man has bust into a church last night and
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.360]  basically sat there for an hour before shooting and killing execution style
[00:50.360 --> 00:58.360]  nine black people on a white-on-black racial attack and this is one of these
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.840]  events that I call a Rosetta Stone there are a lot of them that are but you can
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.800]  take this event and look at every angle of our problems through it and learn a
[01:07.800 --> 01:13.320]  lot number one I don't mean this sarcastically
[01:13.320 --> 01:23.040]  Dylan Roof who's now in police custody who walked around and posted to Facebook
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.480]  and places himself wearing you know South African apartheid attire and
[01:27.480 --> 01:35.240]  patches should have gone and gotten a job at Planned Parenthood are gone to
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.880]  medical school to be an abortionist and then he could kill tens of thousands of
[01:38.880 --> 01:43.300]  black people in his career and be called a great member of society and that's
[01:43.300 --> 01:48.040]  what the smart racists do that's why myself and Jakari Jackson and others
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.120]  have gone out and demonstrated and protested out front Planned Parenthood
[01:51.120 --> 01:57.120]  here in Austin, Texas at a bunch of death-loving scum spiritual kindreds I
[01:57.120 --> 02:04.720]  would say in my opinion crawl out from underneath rocks to come and attack us
[02:04.720 --> 02:15.440]  and it's meant to inflame emotions it's meant to create hysteria and fear some
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.080]  will say is it a false flag well because our government other governments
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.480]  have been caught carrying out mass shooting false flags and because it's
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.320]  in operation Northwoods they would wound people and shoot people at public
[02:27.320 --> 02:30.680]  places and then blame it on their political enemies as a pretext for war
[02:30.680 --> 02:40.360]  with Cuba because this happened in Operation Gladio back in the 1950s and
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.160]  60s and 70s in Europe you have to say we have to look at that I don't think
[02:45.160 --> 02:51.120]  that's what this is it could be
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.280]  but we've seen other demons target white churches black churches Jewish
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.680]  shenagogues it was a famous case back in the late 90s in Fort Worth where a guy
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.040]  went in shot and killed 14 people and mainly a white church it was a white
[03:09.040 --> 03:18.040]  guy doing it he was a Navy veteran and then it turned out he told his neighbors
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.320]  he was under mind control and I thought oh probably it's schizophrenic till they
[03:22.320 --> 03:25.520]  talked to one neighbor and they said no we saw him one day being drug out by
[03:25.520 --> 03:30.640]  people in what look like Navy uniforms and thrown in a white van this is
[03:30.640 --> 03:38.240]  decades after he'd been in the Navy you can look up that case Buford furrow a
[03:38.240 --> 03:46.240]  white supremacist attacker of a Jewish day school lived at a Air Force base in
[03:46.240 --> 03:54.880]  Oregon if you look it up and had national security connected emails take the
[03:54.880 --> 04:01.000]  theater shooting that's a false flag was the shooter the actual shooter we
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  don't know but he didn't know who he was and had been drugged up and told police
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.160]  and told people in next to a jail cell I'm under mind control I'm in a secret
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.880]  government program and guess what he was in a secret government program with
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.440]  computer brain interface and his dad was in highest level secret government
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.960]  operations and then they had a top government psychiatrist who'd run the
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.400]  entire Air Force base again in San Antonio the entire complex of Air Force
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.640]  bases this lady was the head of it she goes two years before this happens and
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.840]  is at the college that the Batman shooters at and basically takes a
[04:39.840 --> 04:47.040]  special interest in him and he meets with her up to five times a week and it
[04:47.040 --> 04:53.240]  just goes on from there I mean the police reports on Sir Hansurian on the
[04:53.240 --> 04:57.280]  JFK shooting that said he didn't do the shooting and he'd been drugged so this
[04:57.280 --> 05:02.640]  could be what's happening Andrew Jackson once called central banks a din of
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.760]  vipers and thieves one way to defeat centralized money printing and
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.600]  evaluation is to start a state-owned bank and Texas is leading the charge
[05:09.600 --> 05:13.480]  zero-head rights the lack of faith in central bank trustworthiness is
[05:13.480 --> 05:18.400]  spreading Texas has enacted HB 483 a bill to repatriate one billion dollars
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.600]  of gold from the New York Fed vaults to a newly established state gold billion
[05:22.600 --> 05:26.440]  depository the bill also includes a section to prevent forced seizures from
[05:26.440 --> 05:31.160]  the federal government section a 2 1 1 6 point 0 2 3 of the bill states a
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.960]  purported confiscation requisition seizure our other forced attempt to
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.440]  control the ownership is void and of no force or effect effectively the state of
[05:39.440 --> 05:42.480]  Texas will protect any gold stored in the depository from the federal
[05:42.480 --> 05:46.560]  government and by being free from the threat of confiscation private citizens
[05:46.560 --> 05:49.840]  can use the gold and silver as money completely bypassing the paper money
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.440]  system this is just a small step to defeat the central banks that print

[08:21.880 --> 08:32.240]  resistance it's Alex Jones. I got up at 5 30 in the morning went in had some
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.200]  coffee got on the elliptical turned on the television and I saw the headlines
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.760]  white man kills nine at black church
[08:41.760 --> 08:49.120]  Dylan Roof the alleged gunman has now been captured 200 plus miles away this
[08:49.120 --> 08:57.080]  just the last 45 minutes Charleston shooting suspect Dylan Roof 21 apprehended
[08:57.080 --> 09:07.280]  he had drug charges currently against him of a controlled substance he'd been
[09:07.280 --> 09:13.160]  in and out of trouble trespassing and other activities and he just looks like
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.920]  the textbook case lunatic and let me tell you if I had a son like that I would
[09:19.920 --> 09:25.520]  not be giving him a gun but that's just common sense there are so many angles to
[09:25.520 --> 09:30.200]  this tragedy how the media is handling it how they're building towards a race
[09:30.200 --> 09:38.520]  war this summer how the answer is to arm every institution or organization that
[09:38.520 --> 09:46.560]  has been seen as a soft target in the past he didn't go out looking for people
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.240]  in their neighborhoods because he knew they'd have guns he went to where he
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.880]  knew he'd find black people who didn't have guns so the coward if the official
[09:56.880 --> 10:02.520]  stories true could have his way with them and reload repeatedly and then leave
[10:02.520 --> 10:09.000]  one person alive so they could tell the story I don't know if this official
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.040]  stories true and the media will attack me I predict by tonight for saying I
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.440]  don't know if it's true his MO fits the type of person that would do something
[10:21.440 --> 10:30.480]  like this this has gone on before but because of operation gladio that was
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.880]  carried out hundreds of operations in Europe from the 50s to the 80s staging
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.160]  terror attacks to blame political opposition left or right NATO would
[10:41.160 --> 10:44.600]  stage a terror attack if a conservative group got too powerful or a liberal group
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.720]  got too powerful or a communist group got too powerful it's been classified by
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.200]  the Italian Supreme Court partially by the US government that they blew up
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.600]  trains did mass shootings shot up churches you name it by the way did you
[10:58.600 --> 11:08.040]  hear 10 were shot 10 white people were shot and killed by five black gunmen
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.600]  of course that was in 1993 when apartheid was ending and then it came out
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.240]  in the news later that it had been organized and probably paid for by
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.400]  groups that wanted to keep apartheid in place so there's the London Telegraph
[11:22.400 --> 11:30.280]  reporting on what many believe is a false flag in 1993 Monday the 26th of July
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.000]  10 shot dead in Cape Town Church black gunmen open fire on congregation
[11:35.000 --> 11:44.160]  attack likely to undermine negotiations in South Africa think so but I want to
[11:44.160 --> 11:51.040]  be clear here my gut has never been wrong and it's not really my gut it's
[11:51.040 --> 11:54.440]  it's it's it's the way this was reported the way it broke the way it's
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.920]  being handled the way they didn't have scripts right up front because I've been
[11:57.920 --> 12:01.640]  watching this pretty much since it was being reported on the news because I
[12:01.640 --> 12:10.720]  woke up early this morning a little bit earlier than usual and bare minimum they
[12:10.720 --> 12:18.880]  this guy was involved somehow his MO fits it that's what my gut tells me
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.040]  because the media wasn't ready wasn't all over this didn't have it all greased
[12:23.040 --> 12:28.480]  like 9-11 or Sandy Hook or the Batman shooting in Aurora, Colorado and I'm
[12:28.480 --> 12:36.520]  not gonna go back over those but Aurora is cut and dry drugging just like sir
[12:36.520 --> 12:43.120]  handsur hand is in the LAPD declassified report what 15 years ago that the police
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.160]  say he has been drugged his hand was pinned sir handsur hand he never shot
[12:48.160 --> 12:56.040]  RFK Robert F Kennedy was shot repeatedly in the back at point blank range with
[12:56.040 --> 13:03.760]  big burn holes in his sports jacket and he was shot by a literal CIA spook on
[13:03.760 --> 13:10.720]  CIA payroll from the skunk works the skunk works provided security that day
[13:10.720 --> 13:13.520]  you know out on the West Coast that's where they have the SR 71 Blackbird
[13:13.520 --> 13:20.040]  and other secret aircraft at the time a guy from a spy plane facility came out
[13:20.040 --> 13:27.560]  to help and boy did he so let's be clear these things have been staged before and
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.680]  what you do is you just drug somebody up and then they don't remember what
[13:31.680 --> 13:38.800]  happens and you set them up we've got to hear from these witnesses we've got to
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.840]  see what unfolds there a five-year-old that survived by playing dead and one
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.440]  person that the alleged killer kept alive to quote tell the story but
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.120]  regardless the mainstream media hyping racial division and race war in this
[13:54.120 --> 14:02.120]  country 24-7 and creating the perception that blacks are being targeted by white
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.640]  people everywhere for extermination has elicited a lot of low-intensity attacks
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.160]  on whites that quite frankly I see almost every day and don't even cover not
[14:12.160 --> 14:15.160]  that I'm covering up that whites are being targeted I'll just mention hey
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.640]  there are attacks on whites they're intensifying here's the crowd statistics
[14:18.640 --> 14:23.280]  it's very sad this is being hyped they want to get a race war going whites will
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.920]  start responding mentally ill criminal types and then it could build towards a
[14:29.920 --> 14:36.400]  crescendo and you see George Soros and the media pushing for this to federalize
[14:36.400 --> 14:43.240]  police after a summer of rage coming up this summer this is it this is the big
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.720]  one with Obama with a year and a half left to try to ram through a bunch of
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.240]  federalization gun control you name it they don't need to stage attacks because
[14:52.240 --> 15:00.560]  you've got 330 million people roughly in this country it's a powder keg so those
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.920]  are just some of the angles here he's been apprehended who knows how
[15:08.920 --> 15:16.320]  obvious this will get if it is some type of staged event and it could be I'm not
[15:16.320 --> 15:20.760]  saying it's a staged event but our government and criminal elements have
[15:20.760 --> 15:32.560]  done things like this before the pastor was a state senator for 14 years the
[15:32.560 --> 15:50.440]  pastor killed in Charleston so it's very very very very suspicious that this
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.920]  is a particular place that was targeted and I will say the whole thing smells
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.400]  but the media wasn't ready with their talking points so that leans towards it
[16:01.400 --> 16:10.080]  not being a false flag again if you just joined us there's an article from the
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.040]  Daily Beast everything known about Charleston shooting suspect Dylan roof
[16:14.040 --> 16:20.280]  the man accused of killing nine inside a black church or pro apartheid flags held
[16:20.280 --> 16:25.600]  strong conservative beliefs notice they keep saying that conservatives are gonna
[16:25.600 --> 16:35.480]  start mass shooting churches and malls and and notice it's starting and if you
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.320]  hype that enough and put that narrative out enough TV shows and movies not just
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.240]  in nonfiction but in fiction you're going to have mentally ill people that
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.320]  are gonna say hey I'm not gonna commit suicide by cop I'm gonna go out and kill
[16:47.320 --> 16:55.120]  a bunch of people and then undoubtedly there's going to be people running
[16:55.120 --> 16:58.960]  frame-up jobs false flags against their own churches burning them down for
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.800]  insurance money burning crosses in front of them shooting up their own
[17:02.800 --> 17:08.920]  churches when you study the criminology this always happens to get attention the
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.640]  media will fan the flames of that and then that will probably cause some real
[17:13.640 --> 17:17.280]  crazies to actually go out and do something as well and really get the
[17:17.280 --> 17:24.240]  ball rolling because they don't want civil unrest about the economy being
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.960]  shut down or about inequity and the globalist and the TPP and all these
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.160]  other big things that we're fighting right now they want to change the
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.800]  narrative to whites and blacks fighting with each other police say they have
[17:38.800 --> 17:48.200]  arrested Dylan storm roof this family needs to be looked into the suspected
[17:48.200 --> 17:53.680]  killer of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston roof 21 is
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.640]  from Lexington South Carolina and has been taken into custody in Shelby County
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.000]  North Carolina at a press conference we'll get Reverend Sheldron's on today
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.880]  about this from all black lives matter at a press conference police chief Greg
[18:09.880 --> 18:15.480]  mullen said a citizen tip led police to his car he would not comment further on
[18:15.480 --> 18:18.960]  whether weapons were found in the vehicle but said roof was cooperative
[18:18.960 --> 18:25.480]  mullen refused to comment on roof admitting to the shooting he was
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.800]  previously arrested on April 26 on a trespassing charge and was awaiting
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.000]  moderation roof was also recently arrested on possession of a controlled
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.480]  substance and again earlier I was talking about mind control with sir
[18:40.480 --> 18:45.960]  hand sir hand in the police report drug didn't shoot RFK other events so many
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.360]  of these shooters and maybe think of McVay the state police found him foaming
[18:50.360 --> 18:53.760]  at the mouth that was in the report slobbering saying I've got a chip it
[18:53.760 --> 19:00.680]  hurts get it out get it out crawling around the ground obviously mind control
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.800]  he was set up that's what they do they give you an amnesiac some trigger word

[24:06.800 --> 24:12.280]  we don't have all the facts but we do know that once again innocent people
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.680]  were killed in part because someone who wanted inflict harm had no trouble
[24:17.680 --> 24:27.040]  getting their hands on a gun. Now is the time for mourning and for healing but
[24:27.040 --> 24:32.200]  let's be clear at some point we as a country will have to reckon with the
[24:32.200 --> 24:36.000]  fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced
[24:36.000 --> 24:46.880]  countries it doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency nope
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.480]  not with guns with baseball bats and knives higher and it is in our power to
[24:51.480 --> 24:54.760]  do something about it England has three times the violent crime rate in the US
[24:54.760 --> 25:02.640]  I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those
[25:02.640 --> 25:09.520]  avenues right now this is live but it'd be wrong for us not to acknowledge it
[25:09.520 --> 25:16.760]  within hours of it happening and the president is out addressing it to hype
[25:16.760 --> 25:22.640]  it come to grips with it yeah come to grips with you giving weapons to al-qaeda
[25:22.640 --> 25:27.480]  and in Libya and Syria and Egypt to kill hundreds of thousands the issue of gun
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.200]  violence collectively and missiles to them the fact that this took place in a
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.040]  black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our
[25:39.040 --> 25:45.760]  history this is not the first time the black churches have been attacked and
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.800]  we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our
[25:50.800 --> 25:58.720]  democracy and our ideals the good news is I'm confident folks this is it they've
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.480]  been hyping race war pushing it as hard as they can saying the NRA is the new
[26:03.480 --> 26:11.800]  KKK even though the NRA was founded in part 50-50 to arm blacks in the south
[26:11.800 --> 26:15.800]  who were being disarmed in fact they were calls by liberal groups to disarm
[26:15.800 --> 26:19.400]  whites particularly today and I just want to point out that's been done
[26:19.400 --> 26:25.000]  before but to blacks in the south the first gun laws were against blacks and
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.040]  then when blacks migrated north to Chicago New York and DC they passed the
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.440]  most draconian laws in the country to disarm blacks and that's why what you've
[26:34.440 --> 26:42.600]  got last number I saw was 14 blacks a week are being shot almost exclusively
[26:42.600 --> 26:47.280]  by other blacks and killed in Chicago you're not going to see a press conference
[26:47.280 --> 26:54.120]  from the president on that or on the 51% of blacks that were never born you're
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.400]  gonna hear them now say gun ownership as Michael Moore has been saying gun
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.840]  ownership is about racist white people you know that doesn't make sense wasn't
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.360]  right they're going to push it now you see it's not about the killer the
[27:06.360 --> 27:12.440]  alleged killer killing people whether you used a bomb or a truck or whatever no
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.480]  it's the gun did it and if you've got guns you want to kill black people no the
[27:18.480 --> 27:25.520]  answer is if I was a black senator especially or a senator period and I
[27:25.520 --> 27:28.920]  gave speeches in public you better bet your bottom dollar I'd be carrying a
[27:28.920 --> 27:32.320]  concealed handgun but see folks don't carry their guns to church and they
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.280]  should let's go back to the president can't believe I'm saying he's the
[27:36.280 --> 27:44.720]  president the traitor in chief members their own community but to all in me they
[27:44.720 --> 27:53.120]  open their doors to strangers who might enter a church in search of healing or
[27:53.120 --> 28:00.120]  redemption mother Emanuel church and his congregation have risen before he is so
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.840]  upset now he cares for the earthquake about black mother dark times I hope to
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.840]  generations of unemployment a black sonia seven years and with our prayers and
[28:08.840 --> 28:16.520]  our love and the buoyancy of hope it will rise again now as a place of peace
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.160]  see they can take this event just like a shark attack super rare but when it
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.360]  happens it's huge news and they can hype it and then you can bet your bottom
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.640]  dollar there will be other racist crazy people that will go out and attack
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.080]  blacks now and vice versa racist crazy black people will go out into the same
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.360]  thing and we just barrel towards the summer with every historical analyst
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.520]  financial analyst cultural analyst saying this summer is going to be
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.040]  explosive probably gonna have a race war Matt Drudge said we could see the fall
[28:50.040 --> 29:00.360]  of America America is being set up for a fall and out of that the new socialist
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.360]  nightmare and again George Soros financed right-wingers that had a beef with
[29:06.360 --> 29:15.240]  the Russian groups and and some legitimate beefs on both sides to then
[29:15.240 --> 29:18.720]  bring that country down and now look what they are basically in flames and in a
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.120]  major depression being financially looted and George Soros is in there
[29:23.120 --> 29:27.800]  funding this whole black lives matter situation to get it going and pointing
[29:27.800 --> 29:30.720]  out a lot of real things that are wrong and are happening police brutality you
[29:30.720 --> 29:36.240]  name it towards this cultural crisis that they will then hold the whole
[29:36.240 --> 29:41.360]  country hostage with to accept tyranny remember what Al Sharpton said we need to
[29:41.360 --> 29:46.120]  federalize all the police we'll be back with the latest on the Charlton shooting
[29:46.120 --> 29:51.040]  because this this shows you where we're going we're on the March the empires on

[30:36.240 --> 30:40.840]  warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds gobbled up as
[30:40.840 --> 30:45.520]  they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria
[30:45.520 --> 30:49.920]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to

[33:29.400 --> 33:45.280]  summer raids by shooter Jennings the globalists are conquering the whole

[33:51.160 --> 33:54.720]  general population's bank accounts and not allowing you to take out your
[33:54.720 --> 34:01.400]  deposits that's mainstream news they're announcing all over the world forced
[34:01.400 --> 34:07.120]  inoculations to begin outside of law they are announcing planetary carbon
[34:07.120 --> 34:13.920]  taxes planetary government is being promoted by the Pope and you'd think
[34:13.920 --> 34:20.680]  the number one story in the world is the tragic cold-blooded murder of nine
[34:20.680 --> 34:29.640]  black people in Charleston Stalin said one man dies is a tragedy 10,000 diets
[34:29.640 --> 34:40.720]  are statistic and it's true how many is it how many black abortions 14 million
[34:40.720 --> 34:51.040]  15 million people don't care that were black children innocent cold-blooded
[34:51.040 --> 35:01.680]  murder chopped up but we're not supposed to care about that we're supposed to get
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.920]  upset only when Obama comes out and says we should get upset and only when the
[35:06.920 --> 35:11.680]  police come out and say this is tragic and cold-blooded and horrible and I get
[35:11.680 --> 35:18.800]  why they said that but when illegal aliens murder and kill on a daily basis
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.240]  it's kept out of the news because it's politically incorrect to point out that's
[35:23.240 --> 35:33.600]  going on and they mainly kill other Hispanics so the media decides when to
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.560]  hype something up if you guys break out of prison they have half a state man
[35:37.560 --> 35:41.800]  hunt martial law in multiple towns searching every house at gunpoint just
[35:41.800 --> 35:47.200]  like Boston it's a big story you let 36,000 violent illegal aliens with
[35:47.200 --> 35:54.560]  felonies out it's no big deal don't even deport them nine black people are
[35:54.560 --> 36:05.040]  killed and they wrenchingly break down every single angle of it rubbing salt in
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.080]  the wound with this whole background that there's this war on black people and
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.240]  there is through abortion through socialism through dependency through
[36:15.240 --> 36:20.560]  weaponization of hip-hop through the media but see never look at the real
[36:20.560 --> 36:28.240]  attack forget 14 15 million dead blacks nine dead black people we've got to get
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.680]  the church as a country together to call for restricting the second amendment
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.840]  because the second amendment is racist the NRA is the new KKK these are the
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.240]  talking points you've heard for years and now you see the plan to get the guns
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.800]  unfolding I'll guarantee you if I was a senator that gave public speaking
[36:47.800 --> 36:57.400]  engagements I would have bodyguards and I would be packing a gun and if this
[36:57.400 --> 37:03.200]  guy really did it which he may have this this this this alleged coward he went
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.400]  to where he thought there'd be disarmed people in a church in a school at a
[37:07.400 --> 37:13.720]  convention center I told you church is schools that's where the shooters are
[37:13.720 --> 37:19.000]  going to target but see if they have ISIS hit people say why'd you leave the
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.160]  border open why'd you fund ISIS so instead oh this convenient person pops up
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.120]  is he mind-control like sir hand sir hand I don't know or like the Batman
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.640]  shooter if it comes out he's being handled by an Air Force psychiatrist and
[37:35.640 --> 37:40.280]  was in a DARPA brain interface program and told people in the jail he's under
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.420]  mind control and woke up in a car somewhere like McVay then I'll say
[37:44.420 --> 37:50.640]  might be a false flag right now too early to tell and the way the media kind
[37:50.640 --> 37:55.520]  of was flat-footed at first means they weren't all ready to go with this but
[37:55.520 --> 38:01.120]  they're still not wasting time and Obama's now out setting the narrative you
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.240]  know we need to grieve we need to investigate but this is guns it's see
[38:05.240 --> 38:12.440]  and this is racism merging the two together to now make it cultural that
[38:12.440 --> 38:19.880]  guns are racist let me explain something can we bring the Barrett 50 cows in here
[38:19.880 --> 38:26.600]  if Weldon can get those you know one is brown and the other is black so see I
[38:26.600 --> 38:30.680]  discriminate when it comes to guns I like them I like them black or like them
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.440]  brown I like them green like the incredible Hulk I don't like shiny chrome ones and
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.140]  they even seem like for I guess no warfare they've got white bodies that go on
[38:40.140 --> 38:46.280]  guns you know I'm kind of discriminatory I don't like white guns but I'll assure
[38:46.280 --> 38:52.760]  you my Barrett 50 caliber rifles have never been used in any murders period
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.960]  no not mine the 50 Cal itself has never been used in a murder it's been used in
[38:57.960 --> 39:03.640]  one crime and there are hundreds of thousands of the Barrett alone in
[39:03.640 --> 39:12.140]  circulation in the US in fact it was 50 caliber rifles that the SWAT team in
[39:12.140 --> 39:19.320]  Dallas used or suburb did to stop that armored vehicle last weekend we're 330
[39:19.320 --> 39:23.360]  million people there's going to be shootings there's going to be car wrecks
[39:23.360 --> 39:26.960]  there's going to be shark attacks there's going to be be attacks there's
[39:26.960 --> 39:30.760]  going to be deer jumping out in front of your car
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.760]  people die things happen anyone that sells the idea that they can take your
[39:35.760 --> 39:42.520]  freedom to keep you safe wants to enslave you period so is it a false flag I
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.040]  don't know are they pushing to destroy the Second Amendment with this you bet
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.120]  are they building and hyping civil unrest and a war against local government
[39:52.120 --> 39:56.680]  so the feds can come in to federalize as the peacekeeper and conquer the states
[39:56.680 --> 40:04.240]  this summer absolutely in fact can you guys queue up Al Sharpton from a month
[40:04.240 --> 40:11.200]  ago saying we need to federalize all the police well the Fed itself has been
[40:11.200 --> 40:18.200]  captured and then it's game over and then the feds can direct the local police
[40:18.200 --> 40:23.440]  to persecute you for your political beliefs and that'll magnify the
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.080]  corruption of the Justice Department hundreds of times here is Al Sharpton in
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.640]  case you're wondering what the motive is disarming the public federalizing local
[40:33.640 --> 41:02.480]  government here it is and the answers federalizing them it's always the
[41:02.480 --> 41:08.200]  answer as if the feds aren't corrupt as if they don't persecute people as if
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.800]  there aren't bad groups in there I mean at the top it's completely corrupt my
[41:12.800 --> 41:16.960]  god they ran fast and furious I forgot about Sirhan Sirhan being a false flag
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.920]  with J with JFK's brother RFK the Batman shooting clearly staged McVeigh
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.920]  clearly drugged I mean that was in the the Oklahoma newspaper that was on the
[41:27.920 --> 41:30.800]  national news that McVeigh was crawling around the ground foaming at the mouth
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.800]  drug look it up saying to the state police I've got a chip it burns get it
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.760]  out and then weird medical procedures were done once he got to the prison and
[41:43.760 --> 41:49.440]  then they had Jolly in West the number two most famous mind control doctor in
[41:49.440 --> 41:56.480]  US history the protege of Dr. Ewing Cameron who ran project MK ultra with
[41:56.480 --> 42:02.280]  kidnapped school children that's on history channel over 5,000 school
[42:02.280 --> 42:07.960]  children were kidnapped and taken to CIA facilities in Toronto by Dr. Ewing
[42:07.960 --> 42:13.360]  Cameron who was able to program them into new identities and to basically work
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.840]  as government delivery agents with multiple personalities to have a one
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.000]  personality that would deliver a message in another personality that was
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.320]  dominant and they had him as sex slaves project monarch I'm not making this up
[42:27.320 --> 42:38.160]  look it up but I've forgotten all the other cases another one was just popping
[42:38.160 --> 42:46.800]  in my head where it was mind control this guy looks like mind control but he
[42:46.800 --> 42:55.240]  may have been culturally mind control his statements were reportedly black
[42:55.240 --> 43:03.440]  people are taking over and taking over our women no actually black people's
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.400]  population is not growing and black people are a test model for destroying
[43:08.400 --> 43:13.480]  everybody and are just in absolute hell with their unemployment doubled and
[43:13.480 --> 43:20.200]  and and just just under total attack contrary to what if he is some cornball
[43:20.200 --> 43:27.720]  you know racist idiot loser who was brought up I mean obviously he was mad
[43:27.720 --> 43:33.800]  he's 21 you think this guy could get a girlfriend so then he got upset if he
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.120]  really is organic attacker and went out because he thought somebody was quote
[43:38.120 --> 43:48.320]  getting his women spoken like someone that can't get any women I can't get
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.040]  any women because of the black people no you can't get any women because you're
[43:52.040 --> 43:58.760]  a freak if you really did this but he's got the thousand-yard stare of
[43:58.760 --> 44:02.680]  somebody who's been mind-controlled David Knight's coming in in the next
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.680]  segment to break down the 10 white people that were shot and killed out of 40
[44:06.680 --> 44:11.840]  plus that were shot a story you probably never heard about and how it turned out
[44:11.840 --> 44:16.920]  that I remember at the time it came on the news you know that a lot of folks
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.320]  said that the pro apartheid people had actually hired contractors and mercenaries
[44:21.320 --> 44:24.960]  to do it because it turned out some of the shooters were white and they never
[44:24.960 --> 44:31.200]  really got to the bottom of it and that of course was to stop apartheid being
[44:31.200 --> 44:38.800]  banned is to kill a bunch of white people so is it a false flag I don't know we're
[44:38.800 --> 44:42.480]  gonna be investigating it Paul Watson has an investigative report on info
[44:42.480 --> 44:48.080]  wars.com Charlton shooting what they're not telling you he just filed this
[44:48.080 --> 44:56.120]  report and info wars.com again the suspect is in custody Theodore Kaczynski
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.640]  L.A. Times Alexander Cockburn was the writer it was declassified that he was
[45:02.640 --> 45:14.680]  in project MKUltra for 30 years and now he's in a supermax in Colorado and never
[45:14.680 --> 45:21.160]  even gets to see the sky and doesn't get to talk to anybody the Department of
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.240]  Justice decides if prisoners can talk to people and guess what he can't talk to
[45:25.240 --> 45:29.240]  anybody we're gonna skip this network break because this is so important and
[45:29.240 --> 45:33.160]  we're going to play Paul Watson special report the David Knights coming in here
[45:33.160 --> 45:42.320]  after that break but one of the reporters or I guess I need to because all
[45:42.320 --> 45:46.040]  these examples of false flags which is popping in my head and and admissions of
[45:46.040 --> 45:51.240]  mass shootings and things that it turned out had been staged and there's so many
[45:51.240 --> 45:55.280]  of them I can't even remember some of them I just it'll pop my head for a minute
[45:55.280 --> 45:58.920]  and then I'll move on to something else it just it's just littered with about I
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.880]  mean is this a false flag I don't know but even if it's not the culture of
[46:04.880 --> 46:13.040]  hyping race war is a form of soft mind control just like 2020 did a report how
[46:13.040 --> 46:17.480]  death education even ABC News got it right after just a few years of death
[46:17.480 --> 46:23.160]  education suicide in young girls tripled it went up almost double in boys but
[46:23.160 --> 46:31.160]  boys aren't as suggestible as girls in those age groups and suicide tripled
[46:31.160 --> 46:34.920]  because 10 and 11 and 12 year old girls were not thinking about how to commit
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.520]  suicide with a shoelace I remember how much trouble we get in watching fake
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.720]  wrestling and then there'd be kids that thought it was real and that you could
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.720]  get up after your body slam somebody and they pick a kid up I never did this but
[46:50.720 --> 46:55.240]  I knew kids that got a lot of trouble and they body slam saw it a few times body
[46:55.240 --> 47:01.120]  slam somebody on the playground and you know break their back or break ribs it's
[47:01.120 --> 47:05.400]  the same thing people watch this they hear this and they they don't understand
[47:05.400 --> 47:12.120]  that you can kill people body slamming somebody well it's the same thing with
[47:12.120 --> 47:20.440]  suicide education and teen suicide is exploded it's like they educate girls on
[47:20.440 --> 47:25.120]  cutting and have seminars on don't cut yourself and then what are the girls all
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.160]  do they all run on start cutting themselves the dare program has been
[47:29.160 --> 47:32.760]  proven to cause increased drug use you going to show them drugs show them how
[47:32.760 --> 47:37.760]  to use it 10 year olds aren't thinking about that it's insane let's go to Paul
[47:37.760 --> 47:42.200]  Watson's report we're gonna come back with David Knight in studio leftists
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.200]  pounced on the Charleston shooting before the bodies were even cold to push
[47:46.200 --> 47:51.000]  that twin agenda of gun control and racial division liberals are hastily
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.560]  exploiting this tragic incident to fabricate the myth that there are
[47:54.560 --> 47:58.920]  armies of white people waiting to commit violent hate crimes against blacks
[47:58.920 --> 48:04.800]  they're even advocating that only white people be disarmed an inverse of early
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.280]  racist gun control laws which targeted black people the reality is somewhat
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.600]  different here's what they're not telling you there's no wave of hate crimes
[48:14.600 --> 48:19.000]  being committed by whites against black people justice department figures show
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.800]  that black people comprise 13% of hate crime victims a figure in line with their
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.280]  population numbers white people on the other hand comprise 65% of hate crime
[48:30.280 --> 48:38.040]  victims and from 2003 to 2006 black people comprise just 7% of hate crime
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.160]  victims black people are responsible for half of all homicides within the
[48:42.160 --> 48:48.080]  United States despite making up only 13% of the population department of justice
[48:48.080 --> 48:54.240]  statistics show that between 1980 and 2008 blacks committed 52% of homicides
[48:54.240 --> 48:59.640]  compared to 45% of homicides committed by whites there's clearly a problem of
[48:59.640 --> 49:05.040]  violent criminality within the black community but hardly anyone is talking
[49:05.040 --> 49:10.080]  about it despite being outnumbered by whites 5 to 1 blacks commit 8 times
[49:10.080 --> 49:15.600]  more crimes against whites than vice versa according to FBI statistics a
[49:15.600 --> 49:21.040]  black male is 40 times more likely to assault a white person than the reverse
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.880]  incidents involving hate crimes including murders where the perpetrator is
[49:25.880 --> 49:31.000]  black and the victim is white are almost universally ignored by the mainstream
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.840]  media for years the phenomenon of overwhelmingly black people randomly
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.200]  attacking white people on the street was disguised by the press calling it the
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.600]  knockout game when in reality it represented a disturbing wave of
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.840]  violent black on white hate crime and once again we're seeing this dumb
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.320]  argument made by liberals who claim that the Charleston shooting isn't being
[49:54.320 --> 49:59.280]  called an act of terrorism simply because the perpetrator is white they
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.400]  seem to be incapable of visiting dictionary.com and finding out that
[50:04.400 --> 50:10.240]  terrorism means to use violence to coerce for political purposes particularly
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.520]  targeting institutions of government news flash when white guys commit acts of
[50:15.520 --> 50:20.680]  terror which are politically motivated they are labeled terrorists
[50:20.680 --> 50:26.440]  Bill Ayers Ted Kaczynski Timothy McVeigh Eric Robert Rudolph they were all
[50:26.440 --> 50:32.080]  denounced as terrorists when Ishmael Abdullah Brinsley shot two NYPD cops in
[50:32.080 --> 50:37.000]  the head last December in a black lives matter revenge attack which was clearly
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.520]  politically motivated he wasn't called a terrorist so by that benchmark neither
[50:43.520 --> 50:48.040]  should the Charleston shooter many on the left even demanded that the German
[50:48.040 --> 50:52.960]  wings suicide pilot be labeled a terrorist simply because he was white
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.120]  when that incident had zero political motivation whatsoever same thing with the
[50:59.120 --> 51:05.520]  Chapel Hill shooting just like the NYPD shooting racial division fueled by the
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.880]  black lives matter movement in coordination with the Obama justice
[51:09.880 --> 51:15.520]  department on one side and white supremacists on the other side who hide
[51:15.520 --> 51:21.400]  behind racism to ignore the very real problem of police brutality meant that
[51:21.400 --> 51:26.080]  the Charleston shooting was all too predictable should law-abiding blacks be
[51:26.080 --> 51:30.320]  made to feel guilty for disproportionately high black homicide rates
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.520]  no but by the same token law-abiding white should not be figuratively put on
[51:36.520 --> 51:42.000]  trial and pressured to atone for their white guilt and relinquish their second
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.680]  amendment rights in response to events like the Charleston shooting so long as
[51:46.680 --> 51:51.320]  the debate continues to be centered around hating on and shaming people for
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.400]  their skin color resentment on both sides will continue to boil over
[51:56.400 --> 52:03.040]  encouraging mentally disturbed people to violently act out with more innocent
[52:03.040 --> 52:09.960]  victims being the price we pay for our obsession with race check out the other
[52:09.960 --> 52:16.200]  videos subscribe to the channel I'm paul joseph Watson for info wars.com
[52:17.200 --> 52:21.520]  we've told you that the soft targets are gonna start getting hit they're gonna
[52:21.520 --> 52:27.480]  claim it's right wingers the fed said the patriots the veterans the
[52:27.480 --> 52:30.680]  conservatives are going to attack minorities they're going to attack the
[52:30.680 --> 52:34.200]  government we need to federalize everything right now and then they hype
[52:34.200 --> 52:38.720]  a culture that with their algorithms and with their actuaries and with their
[52:38.720 --> 52:44.160]  cultural programs they can then predict with certainty almost down to when it's
[52:44.160 --> 52:49.240]  going to happen and in what area when crime is going to be committed that's
[52:49.240 --> 52:55.000]  the new pre-crime computers they've got that are pretty darn accurate so they're
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.200]  hyping this and police departments and folks have noticed it that they're
[52:59.200 --> 53:02.400]  being targeted and again we're not defending corrupt police departments or
[53:02.400 --> 53:06.840]  bad cops the point is it's they're trying to cause civil unrest and a civil war
[53:06.840 --> 53:12.920]  to smoke screen the TPP new banker bailouts in Europe that is diving into
[53:12.920 --> 53:18.640]  a depression right now to me that's the biggest story here what is the tragic
[53:18.640 --> 53:22.720]  death of nine black people at church by this cold-blooded killer if you believe
[53:22.720 --> 53:26.920]  the official story I don't know I mean how could you believe it when the
[53:26.920 --> 53:29.760]  government's been caught doing it over and over again but regardless
[53:29.760 --> 53:35.680]  whether it's hardcore mind control classic mind control or just cultural
[53:35.680 --> 53:40.520]  mind control this obsession with race and this pushing and has caused it and
[53:40.520 --> 53:46.440]  has and as more whites get attacked and as it comes out on the internet you're
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.200]  going to have mentally ill people that are mad because they can't get a girlfriend
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.120]  because they're weirdos who are going to go out and target black people and vice
[53:55.120 --> 54:01.400]  versa Hispanic immigrants in California don't get along very well with black
[54:01.400 --> 54:04.360]  people in fact it's the worst relations out there they're targeting blacks and
[54:04.360 --> 54:10.360]  killing them does that do we blame all Hispanics no this is a time bomb though
[54:10.360 --> 54:14.160]  ladies and gentlemen this is America turning into a giant prison culture we're
[54:14.160 --> 54:17.920]  all divided into our groups and the globalists sit there as the warden and
[54:17.920 --> 54:22.320]  as the jail guards that's the model George Soros isn't pushing a revolution to
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.520]  give you all socialism and free goodies when they're done we're going to live
[54:26.520 --> 54:29.960]  under a federalized hardcore fascist police state that's what he's done in
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.240]  Ukraine funding literal Highling Hitler Nazis we're gonna go to David Knight

[56:38.160 --> 56:41.280]  minutes but you brought to my attention something I'd forgotten about because I
[56:41.280 --> 56:44.800]  remember reading about this years after it happened when I got on air in 95 but
[56:44.800 --> 56:51.360]  there'd been a false flag in South Africa to blame black people and it was
[56:51.360 --> 56:56.560]  never completely proven but it was white gunmen attacking whites in a church
[56:56.560 --> 57:01.640]  let's let's break this down David Knight yeah Alex and I have to say that
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.120]  this the shooting in South Carolina it's absolutely horrific to me the idea
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.960]  that somebody could sit there for an hour with people praying studying the Bible
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.160]  talking about God in the turns stand up and shoot them my control absolutely
[57:15.160 --> 57:19.840]  insane but we need to look at and make sure this doesn't metastasize into a
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.600]  tragedy across this country turn this into a race war we don't want that to
[57:24.600 --> 57:28.320]  happen and so I think it's instructive to look at this situation back in South
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.720]  Africa the 22 years ago and see that there were people in South Africa that
[57:33.720 --> 57:38.320]  wanted to start a race war to keep apartheid from being overturned you had
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.000]  a white minority they were on the cusp of getting a black majority democracy
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.120]  there a lot of people didn't want to see that happen there were outbreaks of
[57:46.120 --> 57:49.720]  violence in the black townships but this was the first time it had happened in
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.640]  white suburbs and it's interesting to see what happens and it's interesting to
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.680]  see how they react to one person with a gun now in the st. James church where
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.040]  they had was 500 gunmen they break into this church in Cape Town South Africa
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.720]  during a church service there's a thousand people there ten people are
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.360]  killed fifty three are wounded they come in with AK-47s five black gunmen they
[58:11.360 --> 58:16.960]  lob in two hand grenades but one guy in the church stands up with a 38 and he
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.600]  fires back and at that point they run they later caught him and they said we
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.920]  had Molotov cocktails loaded and ready to go they were gonna burn that church
[58:24.920 --> 58:27.840]  down with a thousand people but it turned out some of the government were white
[58:27.840 --> 58:32.000]  that's right now initial reports from the police said there were two white
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.520]  gunmen as well as the five black gunmen even mainstream media admitted it was
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.280]  politically motivated stay there back in 70 seconds Charlie Manson leader he
[58:41.280 --> 58:44.920]  wanted to race for that's what helper skelter was see that they've been
[58:44.920 --> 58:48.520]  planning this while we'll be back
[58:48.520 --> 58:52.480]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[58:52.480 --> 58:56.160]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[58:56.160 --> 59:01.280]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.000]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.760]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we
[59:10.760 --> 59:16.400]  get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of
[59:16.400 --> 59:20.280]  former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their patriots their

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.200]  Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.320]  David Nights in studio with us breaking down tip shot dead Cape Town church
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.800]  black diamond open fire on congregation attack likely to undermine
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.400]  negotiations South Africa that was back in 1993 so we're talking about what
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:51.560]  17 years ago or more 22 years I can't even do math anymore it's just so long
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.760]  ago yeah 22 years ago yes I'm saying my head is just spinning though all the
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.160]  angles finish up with this story well one of the things that that's important
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.920]  about this is two things number one the initial report said that there were five
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.960]  black gunmen they came in with AK-47s and hand grenades they also had Molotov
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.680]  cocktails they left when one guy stood up with a 38 chased off five guys maybe
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.000]  seven with a k-47 he wrote the book shooting back yes yes the initial
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.640]  report said that there were seven two white men and five black but then they
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.080]  changed that they wanted to make it all black against all white because they
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.600]  wanted to race for his book that you mentioned is called shooting back the
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.640]  subtitle is the right and the duty of self-defense he did a video he did a
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.880]  book he did tours and he encouraged pastors to understand that something like
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.840]  this could happen in there so alive I don't know I'll have to look him up and
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.280]  see if we can have a reverence shoulders coming on about the 14 million black
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.600]  people that were killed mm-hmm but nobody talks about it and of course that
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.920]  since rose right yeah yeah that's that's far more deadly in terms of a
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.720]  genocidal race for what's going on at Planned Parenthood but the other thing
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.360]  that we need to look at from this is the fact that we don't want to create
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.720]  victim disarmament zones like schools like churches and say this is just going
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.520]  to be this nice little peaceful area we don't want to have weapons there weapons
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.560]  and the whole second amendment is essentially about the right to do this
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.880]  if he did it went there and yes I'm going to tweet out I just forgot to do it
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.080]  I meant to do it this morning and it's a serious tweet it's not it's not sick
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.120]  humor because they'll spend it to that you know was everybody should tweet why
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.280]  didn't Dylan roof just go to work at Planned Parenthood he could carry out
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.840]  the dead black babies every day yeah I mean he could be part of killing 51% of
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.840]  the black people and then he could be lauded as a hero about Time Magazine why
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.840]  didn't Dylan make a lot of money go out and be a liberal and and try to teach
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.000]  blacks to kill their children I mean he wants to kill black people that's the
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.120]  effective way to do it I mean Obama's so upset right now but he's increased
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:55.440]  funding basically for forced abortion in India and Africa through the UN that's
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.400]  right he supports China killing their babies so why is Obama so upset now can
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.600]  you believe he came out within hours after the second amendment yeah yeah oh
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.360]  yeah that's what they're going to do and they're also going to try to turn this
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.400]  into a broader race war and that's why we can look at both of these I think it's
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.040]  very instructive to look at this with it being in exactly the opposite with a
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.640]  white minority being attacked by people who are black when it's a black
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.320]  majority when there's something happening politically in the country a very
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.360]  dangerous time just as we have in this country trying to use that to start a
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.120]  race war and yet what we can learn from that is first of all we need the second
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.880]  amendment people need to take responsibility in the church that I
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.160]  went to in North Carolina the pastor carried concealed he made sure that
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.840]  there were elders or deacons who are always carrying concealed that's what
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.760]  churches need to do that's what schools need to do that's what everybody needs
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:50.680]  to use our right to self-defense it's a duty as well and not let them take
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.440]  this away and not let them make this into a larger tragedy of a bigger race
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.960]  war well thank you for reminding me about that I know jacari's following a
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.000]  report right now he's got some angles I'm gonna see if I can get jacari in
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.760]  here when Reverend Childress is on with us to get his perspective on this but
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.160]  we've got the reporters back there studying every angle of this we need
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.880]  somebody to just ask the question was this a false flag I'm not saying it is
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.200]  because there's enough hype in the media to make people come out from under
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:27.400]  their rocks like this guy but at the same time I mean the the attacker at
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.440]  Aurora clearly mind control for years they've been working on how they can
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.640]  get people to the CIA was working on how they could get people to assassinate
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.440]  others based on deep subliminal programming that they trigger with
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.560]  well they give you basically it years they've been doing that what they do
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.840]  now is they just give you a drug called Halcyon that's what Dennis give you to
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.320]  pull your wisdom teeth and you love it while they're doing it and you can tell
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.600]  somebody while they're on Halcyon you know stick your finger in a light socket
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.280]  they'll do it or put your baby in a garbage disposal they'll do it I mean
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:00.400]  they put them on that wind them up and they go to the pope has written an
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.000]  encyclical calling for a global political authority with power to save the
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.960]  environment a pope once came after Galileo for pointing out that the Sun was
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.040]  the center of our solar system today those who point out that the Sun is a
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.000]  dominant factor in climate are vilified the dogma of man-made global warming has
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.720]  been more of a religion than a science for a long time James Lovelock father of
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.800]  the Gaia hypothesis pointedly said that environmentalism has quote become a
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.040]  religion and quote the outgoing head of the UN intergovernmental panel on
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.800]  climate change said climate change is quote my religion and Dharma unquote the
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.760]  religion of environmentalism even has its own indulgences you can pay for your
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.080]  sins against the environment with carbon credits it was the abuse of
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.880]  indulgences by a former pope that led to the Protestant Reformation today we
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.960]  need a political and scientific reformation of the Church of

[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:17.600]  Carolina the truth is we don't know the truth about Dillon roof and if you
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:24.400]  don't know the history of this sir hand sir hand the LAPD police report did not
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:31.240]  shoot RFK was drugged didn't remember anything and his lawyers have sued and
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.680]  gotten all the documents declassified that they had CIA people there including
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.440]  the guy that shot RFK in the back and the deputy director of the CIA it turns
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.120]  out was there and heard RFK speech that's come out the London Guardian just
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:57.880]  off photo analysis it was just full of famous CIA people and the LAPD knew that
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:04.320]  RFK was killed the unabomber was in MK ultra LA Times reported that as well
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.520]  Theodore Kaczynski McVeigh the state police found him crawling around the
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.920]  ground by his car saying he was drugged and they had a chip in him whether
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.480]  that's true or not the point is he was drug they do the Aurora Batman shooter
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:23.440]  drug under high-level government control connected to an MK ultra program with
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.240]  DARPA at the highest levels of national security and that's been in the news he
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:35.640]  was in a secret DARPA program on mind control and told people in the jail they
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.880]  drug me I'm under mind control help me I'm going through drug withdrawals I mean
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.520]  did you see the photos of the Batman supposed shooter walked out of his
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.800]  noggin there it is Harvard in the making of the unabomber the Atlantic and even
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.440]  the Atlantic admits he was in the central intelligence agency as a
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:03.080]  volunteer in 1968 and over the next few decades for the central intelligence
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:11.880]  agency moving forward in almost every case they either stage it or they find
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:19.160]  a weak-minded person to wind up to do it and you've seen the preconditioning of
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.800]  Second Amendment's racist the NRA's the KKK even though it was founded to arm
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.720]  blacks against the KKK and you're like where do you come up with that violent
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.560]  crime professor lot corrected me using guns violent crime using guns is down
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.880]  61% since 1992 using just department on numbers I crunched the numbers and we
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:50.120]  hired a statistician with a PhD to crunch the numbers and they told us 51%
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.200]  in dropping crime but lot who is one of the top statisticians in the world not
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.880]  just on guns and he's paid by fortune 500 a lot of money to do their step of
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.880]  their projections and stats he corrected me and said it's 10 points
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.680]  higher whatever the mainstream media had the same number 51 52% violent crime
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.760]  using guns down 50 plus percent conservatively since 1992 even the LA
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:22.960]  Times had the headline last year public perceives gun crime is up despite the
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.040]  fact that it's way down that's a paraphrase of the headline there it is
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.240]  related story gun crime is plunged but Americans think it's up study says see
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:37.880]  and the truth is Paul Watson broke it down blacks are eight times more likely
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.000]  to attack whites now part of that's police reporting I believe is somewhat
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.920]  jolted towards blacks but the statistics are there and don't lie it is pushed
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:57.720]  culturally in racist black areas that that let me we further do the new black
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.880]  Panther Party of Florida and Texas have been in the newspapers I've had some of
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.640]  the folks on from those groups saying don't you mug in our neighborhood you
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:11.880]  go out and mug or kill a white person and so then that creates this culture
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.800]  where white supremacists are gonna go and start taking potshots at blacks and
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:22.080]  back in the 1960s and what we're gonna do a report on this right now they're
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.120]  pulling me all the news articles on it Helter Skelter what was Helter Skelter
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:34.640]  why did why did Charles Manson go and cut the baby out of Sharon Tate and her
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.160]  movie star a husband killing them they were gonna blame it on black people and
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.320]  start a race war the black people went and killed the beautiful blonde they
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.160]  attacked our woman Charlie Manson hung out with the top people in Hollywood
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:56.440]  Charlie Manson worked for the CIA that's come out and he was so whacked out though
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.240]  they set him up it didn't go the way they thought and it didn't start the race
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.680]  war and he had this cult of shaved head loons he had a swastika between his eyes
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:13.720]  but in modern media they never talk about what Manson was planning Manson was
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:19.720]  planning a race war to destabilize the u.s. that out of which a socialist
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:28.040]  communist yippy utopia was supposed to rise fast-forward 50 years
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.600]  Charles Manson race war the Beatles and Helter Skelter yeah even the Huffington
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.520]  Post has an article about it that was the plan but I tell the average person hey
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.640]  you know Charles Manson hung out with the top Hollywood folks and rock and roll
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:51.040]  stars and he was a CIA guy and they were planning a race war and people don't
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:59.240]  even know that and his cult believed a hundred percent without question that
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:09.880]  Manson's claims that he was Jesus and his prophecies of race war in 1969 and
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:17.200]  that's what they were pushing then insane and now we got George Soros just
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.600]  overthrew and told CNN he overthrew you pull it up there's clipping him on
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:32.080]  Farid Zarqairi a show that yes he funded and he overthrew Ukraine and then put
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:43.040]  Nazis in can't make that up something begs coming this summer but it's gonna be
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.520]  on every front now here's the deal I've got Reverend Childress joining us I've
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.200]  got Jacarie Jackson coming in to give us his take on this but I tell you the
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.360]  media's power to manipulate we we could send our reporters out on the street in
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.400]  fact I'm gonna do this but I have limited staff because they're all busy doing
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.880]  other reports and just go to the black areas of Austin are predominantly black
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.040]  in East Austin and talk to black folks and see if they're upset about this
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.160]  because I watched black folks when I was downtown this morning when I saw and
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.920]  black folks in their cars and man I would drive by and look they were shaking
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.480]  their heads they were angry they were upset because the media is just
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.040]  assaulting that you know you're being killed the white people are coming after
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.000]  you it's terrible something's got to be done creating the perception that there's
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.320]  this all-out war on black people well there is with abortion and big
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.960]  government and socialism and dependency but they're diverting off into no the
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:49.320]  war is specifically whites with their guns and notice whether it's Al Sharpton
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.720]  or whether it's Michael Moore all other own bodyguards on record and all have
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:17:00.480]  their own guns on record it's those very individuals that keep saying you know
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.200]  why there's guns you know what the NRA is about it's about racist white people
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.880]  out in the countryside that are scared of black people and that's to make it
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:13.120]  racial and they hyped that enough it will become true International
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.520]  Business Times US Race War 2015 the guillotines are ready Michael Savage
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.040]  tells Alex Jones we got to get Savage back on when he said the guillotines are
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.880]  ready I said like the French Revolution he said yes the guillotines are ready
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:34.840]  figuratively the media spun that that we were saying that black people have
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.360]  guillotines and that's how they play on the public cigarettes when people use a
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.160]  metaphor or an or an analogy so I will take calls but I wish I just want to
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.840]  hear what you think about this do you think it's a false flag is there any
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.680]  doubt they're trying to start a race for this summer how do we stop it I just
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.440]  want to get like 60 seconds from you interspersed with Jacari and Reverend
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:04.320]  Childress so we're going to the big round table free-for-all discussion forum

[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:26.680]  lot of people and you know I'm bad about going to calls so 800 259 92 31 but
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:33.680]  every expert we've talked to has been definitive on the fact that they're
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.520]  coming after the guns they're gearing up they're funding their foundations they're
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.800]  finding their local campaigns their federal campaigns they're getting Obama
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.520]  ready with executive action to restrict the Second Amendment it's in the new
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.240]  TPP treaty they're trying to ram through tomorrow while we're all busy you know
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.880]  thinking the end of the world just happened now they had a bill for
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.640]  concealed weapons without permit now dead because of this already dead before
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.640]  it even happened this no doubt is the push to get our guns when the answer is
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.680]  arm yourself they had a white church remember in Colorado there's actually a
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.200]  mixed church for everybody but and a guy came in to kill our body and they had
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.360]  an off-duty cop there who volunteered to be armed they took them out they were
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.720]  able to shoot one person and I'm telling you if you're a soft target like a
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:33.160]  church or a shopping mall or whatever they should invite good people with CHL's
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:40.520]  to have their firearms because thugs are inherently scared notice this reported

[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.880]  happened to cause as much pain as possible well the folks are dead it's not
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.000]  going to bring them back humanizing babies though will get people to stop
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.320]  killing their kids I don't care what color they are and that's the real litmus
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.400]  test every so-called liberal I've talked to this pro-abortion will then when a
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.520]  camera and on go nobody wants these poor black people you're going to take care
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.440]  of them including blacks Reverend Childress is joining us and I just don't
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.000]  get how I'm supposed to get all sad and freak out about nine dead people I mean I
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.920]  don't like it but I'm really upset about how they're going to create racial
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.880]  division coming up after these calls right before I go to Reverend
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.480]  Childress Reuters reports deposit withdrawal surge at Greek banks as debt
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.040]  news titans we warned of this on Monday
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.120]  Greece could be forced to lock down savers cash as debt crisis worsens
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:41.440]  this is going all over the world see this is what's big what's big 14 million
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:48.520]  aborted blacks or nine killed one man's a tragedy 10,000 statistic Joseph Stalin
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:57.960]  it's true how do we humanize everyone and just to be manipulated and played by
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.680]  the globalist whether this event was real or not it was culturally
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.200]  manufactured if it wasn't a false flag by pushing a race war which there
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.920]  admittedly got going as a divide and conquer while the globalist loot us and
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:18.240]  destroy our country and our jobs and our future Tom Joe Jerry Jesse Francis and
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.360]  others we're taking your phone calls right now Tom in New York what's your
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.400]  take on the situation this tragedy yeah Alex you've been right on the ball a lot
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.680]  of what you see and I I'm currently in the area and I've been following this
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.720]  thing I got up about three in the morning something wasn't feeling right
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:39.360]  turn the TV on I've been watching all the different networks with all the
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.520]  PowerPoints that they've been putting out just want to run down some background
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.360]  of this character that we're talking about and all this I guess the alleged
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.560]  trespassing incident he had earlier they showed up on his criminal record
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:57.120]  involved him baseless case in a shopping mall wanting to find out what time they
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  closed how many employees would be there as if that may have been a potential
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:07.880]  setup for an incident along these lines I guess also he was being treated with a
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:13.560]  pharmaceutical known as subsoxone which is supposed to be to take care of
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.000]  heroin withdrawals are open that's right I meant to mention that I mean
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.400]  they're always on some type of manipulative weird drug and I was
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.800]  looking into that drug isn't it in a anti-anxiety anti-psychotic range
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.760]  right the listed side effects for our severe anxiety severe depression
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:41.880]  suicide hallucination as well as amnesia go figure oh he was on an amnesiac what
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.840]  have I been saying for an hour and a half yeah exactly the same thing now it's
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.560]  next involved many hands is for a drug bust in Lexington County South Carolina
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:57.640]  anybody has from that area they'll know very well that that is a complete frame
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:04.320]  up area as far as pullover and planning of narcotics so I don't know what
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.600]  possibly that could have played into it but you know I'm watching all these
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.520]  different things this morning you did talk about the statements he had made
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.040]  when he was in the church the earlier thing I heard slip out not come back
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.840]  sense was the words were muttered while he was doing the shooting that yeah black
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.120]  people were taking over everything but something needed to be done about it and
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.160]  he couldn't handle living in a world like that anymore it was more or less to
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.240]  that effect word for word the other thing I'm looking at this that's really
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.000]  sticking out in my mind was you know we just went from slager to this it seems
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  like when the incident went down went off to slager down there South Carolina
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.040]  didn't waste any time whatsoever handling that as they should have if I do
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.000]  remember right the family of the victim in that case Walter Scott he did not want
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.840]  to hell sharpen the family they didn't want hell sharpened anywhere there to
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.800]  stir anything up oh clearly they've got a divert with the doubling black
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.080]  unemployment with the total screw job of blacks under Obama that was his job was
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.920]  to be the political cover all they've got race and again the goal is
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:17.360]  federalization of police a summer of rage using that as the political diversion
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.600]  to go after the guns it's here the new push to get our guns is here we're in a
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.160]  fighting stance politically we've had all the experts on from Larry Pratt to
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:32.640]  professor lot dr. lot we told you it's coming it's here I don't know this is a
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:38.280]  false flag but they've done them before and it's a false flag and then again he
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:44.840]  was on an anti-psychotic as usual as usual he was on psych meds I mean it's
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:51.000]  always the same something smells here we're on the March the Empire's on the
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.080]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.520]  World War three is heating up in Europe German tanks have rolled into Poland
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.400]  NATO has expanded its anti-missile system and in response Putin is just
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:12.080]  announced adding 40 ICBM missiles to the Russian nuclear arsenal on the ground
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.600]  us airborne troops have been training Ukrainian National Guard soldiers to

[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.640]  steam this is not the first time Ukrainians were put in the middle of
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.600]  an international conflict Germany recruited and maintained five Ukrainian
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.680]  volunteer battalions and an SS division called Galasian during World War two
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.680]  cutting along cultural lines half of Ukraine fought for Germany and the
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.040]  other half with the Red Army and to think all this started with a coup

[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:06.560]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and we're broadcasting worldwide today thank
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.240]  you so much for tuning into the broadcast tragic attacks that took place
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:18.600]  and nine dead in this attack and every time somebody's killed by a psychopath
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:24.840]  or mentally ill person it's a tragedy and we have cases of today of a monk you
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:30.440]  know stabbing to death one of his fellow members of his sect will we blame
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.840]  butcher knives clearly not but there is a move now to blame the second
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.880]  amendment president Obama spoke about an hour ago we took it live blaming the
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:43.960]  second amendment and basically calling for restrictions we know they're heating
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.480]  back up for this and they're saying gun ownership is the new KKK we've heard it
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:54.000]  from Al Sharpton we've heard it from Michael Moore all the usual suspects
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.240]  time and time and time again using this try to disarm the people we know gun
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.160]  crimes down 50 plus percent since 1992 we show those statistics earlier even show
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.720]  the LA Times earlier admitting it but the perceptions being created that gun
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:17.360]  crime is up this is just unconscionable if this is happening and we see massive
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.880]  push towards racial division massive push that that's our problem in America
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:28.600]  to destabilize local governments and basically federalize things that is the
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:36.760]  push that is taking place now separate from that we have tens of millions of
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:43.520]  black people we'll get the numbers from the expert Dr. Reverend Childress from
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:53.000]  black genocide dot org that since Roe v. Wade over 50% of black people in this
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.720]  country were never born now I've gone out to abortion clinics and demonstrated
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.360]  done reports 30 40 times over the years but I've never specifically went out
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.720]  there and made it just about black babies we did that last month saw these
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.680]  horrible red brigade communists come out from under a rock say I you know I we
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.920]  kill our babies how great it is why isn't anybody concerned about innocent
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.400]  babies this guy coldly sat there reportedly for an hour before he killed
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.840]  these people in a prayer meeting including a state senator who was the
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.640]  preacher and then left one person as a witness and one five-year-old live
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.880]  because they played dead pretty smart a little bit smarter of that state senator
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.920]  would have been packing heat and the answer is to start arming the answer is
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:41.040]  to defend ourselves the answer to bad people is good people with guns
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.800]  Obama said no other country has violence like this in the Western world
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.240]  that's not true look at the numbers in England the numbers and areas of Europe
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.280]  upwards of three times the muggings and stabbings and violent crime and
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.200]  burglary numbers yes we have the highest rate in the Western world for people
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.960]  being shot to death that's because we're an armed society and yes there are
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:12.680]  problems with guns but it's a human problem not the problem of the gun and
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.400]  you can't penalize good people because of what bad people do we're going to go
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.920]  to Reverend Childress here in a moment I wanted to get you carry Jackson here for
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.520]  kind of a roundtable discussion we're also going to go to Jesse Francis Joe
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:27.520]  Jerry Vincent and others and take your phone calls but your car before I go to
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.800]  Reverend Childress and we'll put it Reverend Childress's website up there
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.600]  with his URL before we do that just overall in their analyzing different
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.240]  angles of this what's your overall first assumption and are you surprised we've
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.960]  confirmed that he was on a psychotropic style drug oh not at all when we talk
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.720]  about these drugs that mean these people were on myself and get Daniels we went
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.400]  to Fort Hood after this most recent shooting and kid asked the general he
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.840]  said was this guy on any type of drugs and he answered and flat out said yes so
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.560]  we see this time and time again these people who take these mind altering
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.560]  drugs that are supposed to help you but to anybody who had watched these
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.800]  commercials Alex they've seen the fine print when a guy tries to speak real
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.640]  fast this could you stop taking this drug immediately if you have any thoughts
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.880]  of suicide or violence towards others or something to that effect so that does
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.880]  not surprise me at all now as far as far the actions of this individual Mr.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.040]  Roof well I shouldn't call it Mr. Roof of going to this church and killing these
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.120]  people he looks whacked out of his brain yeah I mean you can take one look at
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:32.160]  this guy you they have mug shots of them they have I guess Facebook pictures or
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.720]  wherever these pictures come from and he definitely looks like he's on another
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:41.080]  planet you know he's he has this blank stare this weird haircut the guy looks
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:46.760]  like something's wrong with them and to see this it's very horrible but to
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:49.440]  anybody who would say it lets you immediately take away the guns I was
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.800]  telling you off-air Alex that had a uncle you know he's passed away now but
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.720]  back we had a church up in Michigan if he wasn't packing he made sure that the
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.280]  person watching the door had the heat on him you know it wasn't you know some
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.440]  obtuse thing it wasn't you know very pushy you know he's just politely answering
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.520]  the door opening the door hey come on in and you just had a you know a clock
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.040]  or whatever you had because somebody might come look over somebody they want
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.880]  to shoot at the church yeah or it might be a crazy yeah somebody who just wants
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.240]  to go in there and kick up stuff but that's the reason why you have an armed
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.760]  society so you can defend yourself and this is no way to knock on the police but
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.640]  just this most recent incident dialing 911 did not save the people in this
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.520]  building that's why you need to have the ability to defend yourself and we
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.480]  think about the shootings that happened recently right here in Dallas also this
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.000]  past Thanksgiving here in Austin and yeah the guy goes to a hard target of
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.320]  police station he's able to fire off rounds in both of these cases but the
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.240]  police take them down why because the police are armed they could respond they
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:49.840]  don't have to dial 911 they are 911 that's why you need to be your own 911
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.800]  and have the ability to defend yourself that's right Charles black Charleston
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.560]  church should have been its own 911 they should have been armed 911 didn't save
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.960]  the victims at Charleston there's your headline I mean we have we're in a
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.320]  culture war folks a war for individual liberty what do you think and I want to
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.680]  Reverend Childress and stay with us you carry of your analysis what do you think
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:17.840]  of the instant attempt to claim that guns are now somehow racist well you know
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.120]  they always blame guns whether it's you know the LA Times or when the Elliot
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.200]  Roger case happened briefly or recently and you know he had a knife he used a
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.720]  car but just the simple fact that he used a gun we have to ban all the guns it
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.440]  wasn't let's ban the cars let's go ban the knives and now when we're talking
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.240]  about the simple act of owning the firearm as racist it's nothing new but
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.880]  it's very inaccurate you know because regardless of what they may be doing
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.560]  today the NRA was founded to help minorities learn how to shoot and a lot
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.960]  of people forget that they say the NRA is the KKK which cannot be further than
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.040]  the from the truth and then they know that when they say that on Fox Sports and
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.960]  CNN let's not forget Rupert Murdoch has these messages on his other platforms
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.400]  Fox News he has just to control conservatives but outside of that he's
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:09.000]  pushing carbon change your carbon taxes gun control it's sick oh yeah yeah and
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  they it's a cultural shame and they want you to think owning the gun makes you a
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.080]  white racist southerner you know there I go out to these open carry rallies yeah
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.800]  there's a lot of white people there but you also have black people you also have
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.360]  women it's not just a white male dog you feel welcome there oh yeah and you know
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.000]  most of the people I know whether it's Grisham or Justin the other open carry
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.080]  guys a lot of them are white and you know that I've never felt out of place or
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.280]  you know that your friends with a lot of folks we can do stuff yeah I don't look
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.440]  at what color you are you don't either but that's what these socialists do the
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:42.960]  truth is jacari we're liberals in the Thomas Jefferson since we want free
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.800]  them for everybody we hang out with whoever we want we're not looking at
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.080]  skin color the controlled left all they've got is race now and they're
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.160]  invoking all these white races to come out of the woodwork we know they've got
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.520]  bots spamming in full wars with racist garbage from both sides to get us all
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:01.160]  fighting with each other we've got to stop it I want to get into race war with
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.680]  you after Reverend Childress leaves us I want to keep you with us someone Larry
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.240]  Nichols joins us he's a big guest he used to be basically Bill Clinton's
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.520]  right-hand man he was governor exposed a lot of the murders Clinton Chronicles
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.680]  they've tried to kill him before everything he's written about with
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  Hillary is now coming true he's gonna be joining us normally I'd cancel a
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:23.480]  guest with something big like this happening but he understands how their
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.240]  politics works to stay with us Reverend Childress thank you for holding thank
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.760]  you for coming on on short notice last time we had you on it was about the fact
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.120]  that you spontaneously it already started all black lives matter one of my crew
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.960]  had the idea to do it too we didn't even know that you were doing it we called
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.040]  you to get you to comment on it to try to point out that all black lives matter
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.440]  of course I'm making the parallel here yes nine lives are terrible that been
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.360]  lost this is a terrible situation obviously a mentally ill racist crazy
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:59.640]  person who also has a horrible chili bull haircut who was on psychotropic we're
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.520]  now learning but what about the tens of millions of blacks that were cut up in
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.720]  the womb cold-bloodedly as well the police and Obama keep talking about how
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.440]  cold-blooded it was it goes sit down with people on the church and it was
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.960]  super cold-blooded but it didn't more cold-blooded to kill babies and then go
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:21.920]  have lunch always no no question about that but we your audience and myself I'm
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.720]  not as intuitive as I would like to be there's something systemic about this I
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:35.360]  really believe you do have an excellent observation is if this is being enticed
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:42.640]  or this young man on a drug was given instructions it's amazing to me that he
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.920]  picked such a historical place a a site that would be endeared by African
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.440]  Americans in order to go in and cause this carnage that's right he won't that's
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.280]  a great point he was just trying to kill black people he wanted to stir folks up
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.480]  or whoever advised him I mean does anybody believe this chili bull haircut guy
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:05.480]  that looks like he's got a 70 IQ I mean he looks I don't mean to be mean he looks
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:10.080]  mentally disabled he looks like dumb and dumber does anybody believe he would be
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.720]  I'm sorry go ahead no I appreciate it because it appears to me that he was
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.800]  coerced that this is where that jargon for what I understand he was saying
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:28.120]  inside the church is typical old clan language to entice white men to join the
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.520]  clan but it's like almost like overkill like they were giving him what to say so
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:39.120]  it would be directed towards the clan I mean it was kind of weird to me hearing
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.160]  some of the comments that he made before he allowed this one young lady to live
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.600]  but wise and once again South Carolina now you're now you know out of all the
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.120]  police issues the one involving Walter Scott was the most blatant and now you
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.320]  have this incident South Carolina really is going to have to call home the
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.000]  church call on his faith there must be peace and of course how sharp did Jesse
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.640]  already there I don't know really how this is all going to turn out but it is
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.480]  as you say someone unquestionably systemically is trying to cause race
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.560]  indifference race war I'm just gonna be plain and simple and if I would have
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:23.320]  picked all the states to do it I would have had to say when I thought about it
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.800]  yes South Carolina because they should have been reeling from the Walter Scott
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:33.080]  situation now you have this young man picking a historical black church one
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.600]  with a history one with a state senator and you're right a state senator in
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:42.040]  these times and days needs to know he has to be armed he has to be able to
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:47.360]  protect us I will have someone there and you pick that particular historical
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:53.240]  black institution that site which I understand I think my wife just told me
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:00.920]  that it's also been defined by the state as historical to do this so I think we
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:06.040]  may not ever get to the bottom of it but I think it was coerced I think it was
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:12.200]  planned see when I first came on you know I said I don't want to jump to
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  conclusions and my gut tells me he might have actually done the shooting but
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.920]  that doesn't mean that he wasn't wound up and then I said if he was given amnesics
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.080]  then we know it's a setup because McVay sir hand sir hand and others amnesics
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.720]  came up and they didn't remember anything and like I said my dad's a retired
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.360]  oral surgeon and dentist when people would come in for sedation dentistry he'd
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.920]  give him Halcyon and if you take Halcyon you I mean I don't want to give up too
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.360]  many details give folks ideas but you can give somebody a large dose of that
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.360]  and you can pretty much give him a gun and say kill that person or you could say
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.160]  stick your hand in this you know this this garbage disposal it's mind control
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:55.400]  and that's just one drug in the whole class now we learn and it's in the news
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:03.320]  that he was on a drug that is in beyond psychotropic that is in the amnesic
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:09.120]  class so that's exactly what I would expect to see I mean this is really
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.600]  looking bad this is and like you said I'd forgotten that but studying the clan
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.200]  back in college because you know they have you in US history do a whole
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.560]  semester basically on it that that clan that's how they would recruit they're
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.760]  getting our white women oh my yes this is textbook this just sounds like well
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.280]  you know the Southern Barber Law Center was running the Elohim City white
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.680]  supremacist compound I'm just saying it sounds like something out of central
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.800]  casting so you're saying in your gut this looks kind of like it's been messed
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:42.120]  with here Reverend oh you will find out or maybe you won't find out it was too
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:48.840]  it was it's obviously textbook I think they feel because of the tensions
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:54.320]  already that people won't look and to see indeed that this is some type of
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:59.240]  subterfuge by those who sit in high places let's let's just face it they're
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:05.120]  the only ones that could pull this off but that language certainly was a tip
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:10.040]  off the fact that they would leave someone there you know there's almost a
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.560]  desk was the instructions for him to do this is the way you do this now if he's
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:22.400]  really smart nobody walks out okay but if if he's been basically coerced or
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:29.240]  constrained to do this obviously he is a guinea pig or he's the scapegoat for
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:32.360]  something a lot bigger sure well the mainstream media is going to demonize
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.540]  us for bringing this up and even questioning but if there's a long
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:39.360]  history of staged and provocative events we'd be crazy not to but look at the
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.000]  perfect timing with the White House the Justice Department caught running a
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.160]  false flag fast and furious with the guns it came out CBS News they were going
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.120]  to blame the Second Amendment I mean that was the plan they got a history it's
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:57.200]  all they've got with black unemployment doubling the abortions black folks
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:04.160]  waking up is they're really pushing a race war it's now I'm really going out
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.200]  there but these things are coming to me very strongly this is done just before
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:16.320]  the Juneteenth or Juneteenth celebrations this weekend oh you will have across the
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:23.400]  nation african-americans gathering together for black pride a lot of it is
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:28.560]  basically some of it to blame the established order for our issues and
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  problems but they're gonna be gathering I'm gonna skip this break it's too
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.700]  important I'm sorry last break I'm skipping but please continue this is
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:39.560]  bombshell so everybody gets together gets motivated and then is directed by
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.080]  Obama go after the guns so take the tragedy take all the pain the whole
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.680]  history of abuse and then fuse it in as a weapon of anti-gun it's genius it's
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.640]  perfect timing well yes I hate to say is evil genius but it's genius because you
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.880]  have some of these speakers at these rallies that are basically let's base it
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:05.000]  I'm an african-american they hate America and they will take this this will be the
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  topic of every speech in every celebration across America that's right
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.280]  this weekend wow you really tied it all together last night I've been talking
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:20.480]  about I've been having an ominous bad feeling I mean I've been saying I said
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:24.200]  your stay on air you've been saying that for a while and I said I think it could
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.520]  be race war because I can see all this hype and by race war I mean get everybody
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:30.960]  you know idiots why damn black killing each other won't be like a general like
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.200]  everybody kills each other me and jacar you know go get in the fist fight but
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.280]  but they're hyping this discord hyping this manipulation and I was on the Red
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:43.080]  Guard website Facebook and I was looking at their LA chapter and their Oregon
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.400]  chapter and it was like the time's coming the only good pigs a dead pig
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.160]  you know we're warming up we're getting ready and then I learned their
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:54.480]  foundation funded they got professors handling them and they're really coming
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:59.560]  out of dry ice activating everywhere and that's just a sign like a fever blister
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:04.840]  right rising up or or eczema that you're sick inside these sores are coming up and
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.400]  the super hardcore left is like activating right now and getting ready to
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.640]  make their move and the red flags are coming out I'm telling you this summer
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.560]  is gonna be big and I if they hype this enough then racist blacks are gonna kill
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.920]  whites racist whites are gonna kill blacks mentally ill people are gonna
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:24.520]  start doing stuff and they could really kick something off I'm really concerned
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:30.160]  and it's also two weeks three weeks away from the NAACP convention in
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:35.360]  Philadelphia perfect timing where I will be at to doing my thing but we won't
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:39.040]  talk about reverend shoulders in part more deep knowledge and discernment on
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:43.320]  us because this just makes me nauseated to see as played whether it was staged
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:48.280]  or not they're gonna use the crisis to go after the guns and stir everybody up
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:52.480]  and divert from the anti-human agenda that's particularly aimed at black
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.320]  people from the globalist I will clearly say this and I don't there's not a
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:00.800]  person in America that could doubt me on this that if you were going to do
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:06.240]  something like this this is the perfect time people are making their speeches
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.720]  now for what they're gonna say Saturday and some begin on Friday even all through
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:16.280]  the weekend so if you're going to have a theme across America Thursday's perfect
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.400]  to African Americans this is this is the day this is the day we we finalize our
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:26.560]  sermons for the pulpit of this this is it and I'm saying to myself who was
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:32.160]  doing this I don't want to really believe who's doing it but it's obvious
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:39.200]  people who are very well well well endowed well you know situated and are
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:43.960]  in a position to profit from it so I was on the phone this morning when I heard
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:49.000]  about when we discussed this ministerily I said come on look at the timing on
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:55.720]  this look at look at who's doing it look that speech he gave as he left what
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:00.880]  will course will now be being said across America and now they admit he was on
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.600]  this amnesiac drug I mean he's on a literal mind control drug this guy
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:10.320]  doesn't seem that smart to pull it off I agree with what Reverend children takes
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.640]  a lot of will I mean interrupt it takes a lot of will to reload and kill nine
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:17.640]  people in cold blood sorry oh yeah it just to echo off what he was saying you
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:21.160]  know yeah he may very well had these tendencies to go out here and do this but
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.120]  if let's say he was in his white supremacist group or whatever and he
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.360]  mentions this to people like well if you're going to do what you may try to
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.720]  do it you know this week you know just and they would have a federal handler in
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.400]  there like it at Elohim cities other property law center winding everybody up
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:42.320]  yeah it's a great points but months ago this was was planned they they you
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.360]  know you know you have a very very skilled enemy months ago this kid was
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:54.520]  prepped for this this week and this there's events going on in Selma this
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.400]  weekend there's events going on in every major movies have come out
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.880]  everything's been time just like Pearl Harbor came out right before 9-11 and
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.040]  again I'm not saying the government did 9-11 they they allowed it to take place
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.240]  that's now been basically linked and declassified you you can see the whole
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.160]  rollout Reverend shoulders I'm so glad I got you on because you just crystallized
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  it all for me how do we avert this how do we stop them as Europe goes into
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.760]  depression this week with runs on the banks happening now wow well I didn't
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.360]  know that but it's it's certainly the recipe for total chaos in America because
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.920]  of all the incidents is leading to this one I believe that they thought this
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:41.280]  would be the one to tip everything over once again if the church is a church we
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:48.600]  we turn the other cheek we we stand up we protest we demand love this is what
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.960]  Martin said that we would have protest in Christian love and we really look at
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:01.600]  this situation and and not view all Caucasian as the sentiments that this
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.760]  young man has expressed but also know that we're being set up I'm praying that
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.080]  people would recognize that this is all a setup and then they get they get back
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.400]  to our our church there's also should wake the church up the church has been
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.160]  sleeping now you need the church for peace wow look at the priming look at
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:24.760]  the preparations look at the for the gear up Reverend shoulders we've got to
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.520]  have you on every day on the night news and the radio for the next no I'm
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.120]  telling you because you with your knowledge experiencing this in your life
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:36.560]  being on the front lines you really have knowledge that I don't have I've got
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.600]  knowledge you don't have jacarys got knowledge I don't have I have knowledge
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.960]  all of us together you know trying to look at this I'm getting chills right now
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:49.080]  because because you can see all the preparation building towards this this
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:53.320]  is the big move is a race war to bring in total chaos and then total
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.560]  federalization of with this evil Justice Department they've even gotten rid of
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.120]  the other Attorney General who had baggage to put the new one in for the
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.560]  political persecutions of conservatives and Christians they're dropping the
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:08.440]  hammer jacari I interrupted you you were gonna say something I know you hit it
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:11.880]  right there in the head and as you talk about the Justice Department you know
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.760]  I thought it was very convenient that you know just over this past a few months
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.120]  they switched out holder who was supposed to be gone last year so now you
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:20.840]  know when they come in with their new regulations and we want to do this we
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.280]  want to do that and people bring bring up things like fast and furious well you
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.200]  can't hold us accountable because that was the old Attorney General and I
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.880]  really hope that they do have a change over there in the Justice Department by
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.880]  just can't see that happening in the near future persecution of the
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.960]  libertarians and Christians is worse I mean they're put I mean who knows what
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.920]  they'll do to us I mean it's getting scary and what about the I mean look
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.440]  there are a lot of bad cops they're racist cops you know there's a lot of
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.760]  issues but just saying kill the cops and they let these leftist groups go out
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.920]  and say kill cops and now cops are getting killed then the cops are gonna
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.800]  get more aggressive there's gonna be but it's gonna blow up yes I mean it's a
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.880]  setup yeah it's just getting worse just getting worse well well pitting the
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:09.840]  police against people will certainly bring in martial law very quickly and
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.240]  and they are circling the wagons if I was a police officer I'd have to circle
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:19.240]  the wagons too because they're the ones that have my back it's unfortunate I
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.360]  would also realize there are bad police but in the final analysis I would
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.780]  expect my my comrade to have my back and unfortunately now my back has to
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:32.440]  be covered by the public I'm supposed to protect because they are being incited
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.640]  against me as a police there Reverend I want to do five more minutes with you

[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:40.400]  blackgenocide.org reverend Childress knows his eugenics history he knows his
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:45.520]  globalist history probably better than I do and blackgenocide.org is just a
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.560]  treasure trove of fighting evil I mean my heart I'm gonna be one of these fake
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.240]  liberals like Clinton going up I love black people I'm like a black person
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.880]  you know what I'm a person I got red blood and it makes me sick watching
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:03.280]  black people particularly in the clutches of the nanny state that wants to kill
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:12.240]  him and to know that these top liberals are current grand dragons like senator
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:19.480]  Byrd and others who's dead now he never left the Klan folks and does that mean
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:25.320]  the Republicans are good no they're horrible look at them with the TPP and
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:29.200]  they want to set each other's throats this is cynical it's sick and whether
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.720]  they wound this guy up or whether it was staged or not they're not letting a
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.040]  good crisis go to waste they're gonna rub salt in the one and the scripting of
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:44.520]  oh and they they were there and he just cold-bloodedly killed him and it was
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:47.480]  horrible they wouldn't normally do that because they don't want to incite stuff
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:52.200]  they are inciting I don't know if the police chief is that stupid or was fed
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.920]  this by the Justice Department but if I and then Reverend Childress points out
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:00.240]  Juneteenth's coming up and then the big and double ACP meeting and all this with
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.160]  all these movies and TV shows out about race and the media when you see prepping
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.760]  and see I was saying I didn't see the media where they're talking points at
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:10.880]  first but actually the talking points came before and then they didn't want to
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:16.000]  be seen with their talking points because it's gotten too obvious like when
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.080]  Bloomberg got caught with the emails the night before saying get Twitter ready
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:23.800]  for a big shooting the night before Sandy Hood yeah I mean I'm ranting here
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.480]  Reverend shoulders we just got three minutes left in the short segment I'm
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.640]  gonna come back with Jacari Jackson and Larry Nichols but other points you'd
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:33.400]  like to impart I'd like to invite you back on tomorrow place her as we know
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:38.640]  more about this well it appears that time magazine as you remember when the
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.880]  last time I was on your program it was there in South Carolina where they
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:48.400]  said black black lives matter right now South Carolina has become ground zero
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:54.360]  whatever happens from here certainly will determine the climate in America
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.360]  for a while and I don't know what I'm praying that the people of South
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:05.720]  Carolina show unconditional love and also being that we're all family and
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.160]  that they can really quell this I'm telling you if they hype things up a
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:16.560]  Baltimore will seem like Disneyland from this so it's it's unquestionable that
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.160]  we have to unquestion we pray for the peace of Charleston this pastor the
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:27.040]  this pack now this church is basically without leadership when you kill the
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.080]  people on Wednesday night that's your core group that those are people that
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.240]  really get the the church moving they've all been taken out and so I hope the
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.000]  church rallies but they rally and they have martyred this church you know it
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.240]  could be a white supremacist plot to and on a governmental one or Southern
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.840]  Poverty Law Center type op because there are some white supremacists who do
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:53.520]  want to start a race war like Helter Skelter and what we saw with Charlie
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.960]  Manson but then he was tied into the government as well man I tell you I
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:01.440]  just I can feel it my gut like you said Reverend in your in your spirit
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.240]  something big's about to happen right I just don't know who it is but it's
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:11.760]  obviously that it is the young man was was was prepped for this not this week
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:17.600]  weeks ago this this this is this is going down now of course it's also you
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:21.160]  know they have to see how the people respond it's an anticipation on how the
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:25.680]  people respond this is where you call on God and he could take something evil and
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:29.320]  turn it around to make something wonderful happen and if he doesn't
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:34.200]  that's the answer pray for peace pray for discernment pray the scales be lifted
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.280]  off people's eyes and we use this to come together not apart yes that's the
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:44.040]  design design is to separate and cause the war and cause more government
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:49.360]  intrusion and no question and control to strip us of more of our freedoms that's
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:54.080]  the plan all right God bless you sir we're gonna who's doing it okay thank you
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:58.320]  for having you can join us tomorrow yes sir tomorrow's Friday yes God bless
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.880]  you Andrew Jackson once called central banks a din of vipers and thieves one
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.440]  way to defeat centralized money printing and evaluation is to start a state-owned
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.040]  bank and Texas is leading the charge zero-head writes the lack of faith in
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:16.320]  central bank trustworthiness is spreading Texas has enacted HB 483 a
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.440]  bill to repatriate one billion dollars a gold from the New York Fed vaults to a
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:24.800]  newly established state gold billion depository the bill also includes a
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:29.280]  section to prevent four seizures from the federal government section a 2 1 1 6
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:33.040]  point 0 2 3 of the bill states a purported confiscation requisition
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:37.120]  seizure our other forced attempt to control the ownership is void and of no
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:41.000]  force or effect effectively the state of Texas will protect any gold stored in
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.560]  the depository from the federal government and by being free from the
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.120]  threat of confiscation private citizens can use the gold and silver as money
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:52.120]  completely bypassing the paper money system this is just a small step to
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:55.440]  defeat the central banks that print money for nothing rob do reporting for

[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:39.500]  normally I would cancel all the guests for the day and then get guests that are
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:43.260]  on specifically on the topic of what's happening like reverend Childress earlier
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:49.080]  who believes this is a wind-up toy false flag of some type normally I would do
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.880]  that but with the guests we've got there's no need to do that because he's
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:09:00.920]  such an expert Larry Nichols was the Clinton State House whistleblower and
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:04.880]  government insider he serve as political confidant and advisor pretty much the
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.840]  right-hand man the governor bill Clinton for more than 10 years and help bill
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.800]  Clinton get elected and reelected as governor of Arkansas the film the
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.000]  Clinton Chronicles and others were basically made about Nichols mr. Nichols
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.800]  is under stream of political correctness and was specifically mentioned by bill
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:29.240]  Clinton in his memoir and he's been there with Clinton exposing his murders
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:36.320]  the drug dealing the the attacking people the raping the women he is the
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:41.960]  Clinton expert we're gonna be having him on a lot he's probably on the show 20
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.600]  times over the years hadn't been on in a few years and with the Clintons like an
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:51.560]  old nightmare coming back Larry Nichols is here he wrote a book about it
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:55.000]  predicting what Hillary would do and it's all happening I'm reading the book
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.160]  years ago if I try to find a copy of it around here it's out of print but Larry
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.400]  Nichols has gone through living hell because when the Clintons went from
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.720]  kind of being boss hoggish corruption to being outright murderers and stuff that's
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.840]  when Nichols went up against them because Nichols wasn't going to be part of
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.760]  ripping off the old people and you know killing people and you know you saw what
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.280]  happened to Vince Foster but clearly they're trying to hype a race war they
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:27.040]  pretty much admit that or or or a giant chaos crisis fiasco so then they can
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.600]  federalize the police and come in and take over I mean it's unprecedented to
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.400]  have US presidents and Attorney General rubbing salt in the wounds acting like
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.360]  the police basically are the Klan in the 60s bombing churches I mean even in
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.920]  black-run cities where half the cops are black and the whole city councils black
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.280]  you know you think the cops are killing black people because they're racist no
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.720]  they're killing them because they've been given murder training but you know
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.240]  vicious jujitsu training you name it and beating people's brains out I mean I've
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:01.120]  been to jail for protesting and had him in the Travis County jail for no reason
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:05.160]  didn't smart off nothing run my head in the wall give me a little bruise wasn't
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:09.760]  that hard and then the jail guards like you want to do something go ahead I
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.080]  have the New York police when they arrest me for protesting take my handcuffs off
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:19.600]  in the jail bay five cops and go you want to do something go ahead and make a
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:23.520]  swing and then sit there and start talking trash to me and I was like are
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:27.920]  you kidding I said are you really about to attack me and say I attacked you I
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:38.240]  said whatever and they had some guy come up and taunt me in the jail cell and I'm
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:41.720]  not even going to that the point is it wasn't because I was the most of them
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:45.720]  were white in that precinct and I was white you got some mentally ill jerks
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.840]  who want power who get in there instead of running them out of the departments
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.280]  they're trying to put them in departments many cities but is that a racial
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.720]  issue maybe there's a stereotype that black people commit more crimes because
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:00.480]  of the type of crime and what's happened those cultures in some areas that's
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:06.840]  true but but and there's probably some racism too but in the final equation
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:13.520]  having a war with the police is about bringing in chaos so joining us is Larry
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:16.840]  Nichols Chikari Jackson's riding shotgun Larry when we called him said you
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.240]  don't want to move in another day yeah I want to get Larry back on next week for
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.520]  a full hour just on the Clintons and we'll spend some time on a day you have
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:26.760]  us gone for five hours now let's book him today for whenever you do it next
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.320]  week we really appreciate Larry Nichols coming on but you can see order out of
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:36.800]  chaos you can see that they plan to not relinquish power you can see they've
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:42.200]  been running Obama the whole time you can see that her chief of staff was at
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:46.200]  Bilderberg this year and nobody else showing us where they're going so Larry
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:53.240]  Nichols thank you so much for coming on the broadcast hey Alex how are you my
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.040]  friend it's an honor well it's an honor to talk to you and I'm gonna get you on
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.400]  Skype as soon as we can I know you've got Skype capabilities most days Larry
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.800]  but it's good to see your picture up here on TV with us in radio where do you
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.520]  want to start I mean you really are you were there where they were making the
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:11.480]  biscuits you were there they were making the sausage I mean you know how Bill
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.480]  Clinton was made and Hillary what is going on I mean everybody has a bad
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.880]  feeling in their gut we know bad stuff's coming what do you see happening well
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.520]  it's exactly what you and I had talked about years ago thankfully thanks to you
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:34.360]  and other programs we stopped it you know Bill was using if you'll recall Alex
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:40.960]  Jesse Jackson remember Jesse Jackson was to spoke supposed to start riots in five
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.680]  major cities and then Bill Clinton would of course have to prepare a martial
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:49.160]  law and once they get the provisional government rule in then they'd better get
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:55.160]  to be king forever we stopped it by making it public well now we've got
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:00.760]  problems they're festering it up and no you were so right it's not about race
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:06.720]  salads green yeah there's the underpinning of race the folks all of this
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:14.800]  that's going on is about power power and the Clintons absorb power like we take
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:23.400]  in sunshine now the thing that's going on today you have to be so careful so
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:28.880]  very careful because at any time you know they're gonna start tit for tat
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.160]  we kill some black guys somebody kill some white guys my guys kill some more
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:38.960]  black guys and then you end up in this total chaos and when that happens all
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:46.720]  bets are off and whoever is sitting folks whoever is in power when this thing
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:53.520]  collapses they become king or queen until they don't want to be king or queen
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.960]  anymore and you're talking about some majorly powerful people Alex and they
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:06.600]  want it bad yeah about the Clintons the book that you and I talked about years
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:13.480]  ago that I told your producer what I wish you would do Alex is take the book
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:19.920]  the genius out of the bottle take the front part out because that's dated to
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:27.480]  98 99 put in something current there Alex and then get it out to be sell it
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:34.560]  because in the book of genius out of the bottle it will tell you exactly what
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:40.280]  Hillary's doing exactly every step of the way and as you know how do I know
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:45.660]  because I helped write the book big more sleep all the gala the people that were
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:51.160]  known as the kitchen cabinet for the Clintons we developed this system to get
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:58.760]  a sick perverted pathological liar in the deep south in the mid-70s elected
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:04.440]  governor and to keep him there and with a hippie wife that was a full-blood
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.080]  card carrying ward around her neck member of the United States Communist
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:21.240]  Party Yuri it took some doing but it works and it works today and I hate to say it Alex
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:29.680]  but the reason I'm here with you you and I were together when you were young and
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.440]  I was middle-aged and I'm old and I guess you're still young but it's back
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:40.720]  again back again it's coming it's coming well I'm not that young brother I'm
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:44.360]  probably about the age you were when we first started talking 20 years ago and
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:48.520]  we should probably briefly start at the beginning because why you worked with
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.160]  them at first but then when it got really corrupt you said I'm not gonna be
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.640]  part of this lost everything you name it a lot of people got killed who were
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:59.120]  around you they killed police state police I mean they kill a lot of folks
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:02.600]  trying to shut you up but they didn't want to kill you to turn you into a
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:08.000]  martyr well and because I had to help develop the system I knew where the
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.400]  bodies were anything knew that and then I knew a little bit about how the system
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:20.560]  work and so Alex believe it or not you kept me alive 20 years ago because by
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.720]  staying public they couldn't KO me because if they did everybody would say
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:30.360]  oh okay they did it and it would be it would be then so and that's what Jim
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:33.960]  Garrison said they killed hundreds of people around the Kennedy assassination
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:37.680]  they said why are you still alive he said because I stay in the sunshine that's
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:41.760]  right you stay out in open I remember telling me let me back up just a
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:46.160]  moment you're right you know I forget they're 20 somethings 30 somethings 40
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:51.400]  somethings and even some 50 somethings Alex said don't even remember what the
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:55.880]  Clinton administration was about and who the players are who they were and who
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:18:03.160]  they're going to be again I was with Bill Clinton I was working for Mr. Jack
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:08.880]  and with Steven's folks and in Arkansas deep south in that period of time they
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.400]  owned everything they were as I learned later on in life I learned they were the
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.720]  titular head of the Dixie Mountain and I was in the mountain and didn't even
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:23.000]  know it and was on one of the acid is only one of one of very few people of
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.960]  any that ever walked out of the mob when they were in it but I was their guy I
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:34.120]  was their fair-haired boy with Mr. Witt found this guy named Bill Clinton and
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.640]  he said I'm gonna make a kid governor go do it I did I went and I found out he
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:44.600]  was a pathological liar womanizer I mean this guy's sick his wife is sicker
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:51.320]  Hillary Rodham at that time she wouldn't even be called Clinton it's now come out
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:56.080]  that she's probably had more women than Bill absolutely remember when I said
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:59.960]  that you know you go everybody thought my god how can you do that I can do it
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:06.040]  easy cuz I've watched her I mean she's AC DC I mean she'll do whatever she's
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:13.200]  gotta do to get the power whatever and whoever so I took on the case of the
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:20.560]  Clinton's work with him working for the Stevens build a power system around this
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:27.800]  kid and he wanted to be president United States we all laugh in those days
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.520]  because of Gary Hart and others that were caught throwing around with women and
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.720]  it would be impossible for Bill Clinton to pull it off but we went ahead and
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:41.760]  developed what was called the 86 plan stay there Larry Nichols joins us the
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.560]  real deal folks in the center of the Clinton web he knows the Hillary plan
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:52.720]  you hurting race riots in America to bring in civil emergency that's the
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.720]  plan and I've never seen them geared up like this looks like they're getting
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:02.360]  ready to make their move if you're worried about your health and you're

[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:19.880]  friendly nice guy attitude they have this con game where they just brush
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:23.360]  everything off the establishment protects him oh Hillary's getting money
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:26.960]  from third-world dictators and countries to the State Department to allow

[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:36.560]  Bill Clinton quote brushes it off settles cases for raping women in
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:41.320]  settlements brushes it off feminists say it's great let's just sort segment long
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:44.800]  segment coming up with Larry Nichols Jacari Jackson sir riding shotgun with

[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.800]  hour just so we can get into the whole history of it with Hillary coming up we
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:00.640]  already had him scheduled from last week but in the short segment you were
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:04.000]  getting into the beginning of it and putting Bill Clinton in there and he
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.280]  wanted to be president and then we'll finish up with that in this segment next
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:11.360]  segment what Hillary will do once she gets in power because it's clear it's
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:13.880]  not just trying to start a race war they're trying to start a war with Russia
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:20.120]  they've overthrown Ukraine they've turned ISIS loose they're so bold they're so
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.920]  bold it's like they're going for a broke around the world not just domestically
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:30.320]  Larry Nichols well how it's just imagine this the system we built in a
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:36.200]  third-rate state in Arkansas in the deep south we found that if we got control
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:41.360]  of the media in Arkansas we earned if we got control of the prosecutor this
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:46.960]  attorney general every prosecutor in every county guess what we could do
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.320]  anything we wanted to do and you know what if you got caught so what nobody's
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:57.320]  gonna prosecute you that has now moved to Washington and you're exactly right
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:02.160]  and it's so fed up with people saying all this that the other head this is
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.880]  about global power I mean look what they're doing you're destroying the
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:13.920]  Middle East I know we all said to Obama and it is but remember these people have
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.040]  certain goals they won't and they're gonna get them and the reason Alex I
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:23.160]  think contest about third because I told them years ago 20 something years ago of
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:29.040]  the goals that they were going to accomplish and here they are it's not
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:34.480]  an accident it's not break down some of their goals what they want who they
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.360]  work for where they're going well right now what they want is to get
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:45.440]  absolute control of government because once you control government you make the
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:53.000]  rules the next thing they want to do they want to move us into full more
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.560]  communism it can kind of tick well it's not funny but here you got old Bernie
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.320]  Sanders a socialist running against Hillary nobody will tell the truth you
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.600]  got a socialist against the communists they want us to become a communist
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  society then they want to take the Middle East why because if you can
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:17.080]  destabilize the Middle East Alex now the Clintons knew this 20 years ago if you
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.440]  could destabilize the Middle East you know what you do you got the keys to the
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:27.040]  world you've got the keys and so all of this is moving that away and Hillary
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.400]  but now make a prediction number one Jebus going to be the Republican
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:35.440]  nomination for president for the Republicans and Hillary gonna be the
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:42.520]  next president unless Alex you you but he get on a boat of lightning and
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:49.080]  somehow can get the tea party to rise up together and stop it well that's why
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:52.320]  they're targeting the tea party the Liberty Movement with false charges
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:56.840]  setups denessa shoes she just got out of prison after nine months I mean I mean
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:02.880]  it really is scary the tactics they're using it is and the problem is Alex
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.800]  they've got the media they've got the money they got all these people call
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:12.440]  Rome Mitch McConnell John Boehner they've got all these people playing all
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.760]  these little games acting all these good cop bad cop things and we don't have a
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:22.800]  gathering place we don't have a central place to help and have us and to be able
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:29.400]  to point out what's coming before it comes what we all end up doing now which
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:34.080]  is what I guess I'm here for and the reason the Clintons hate me and the
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.840]  reason I'm the one that the guy mentioned in his dang memoirs all things
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:45.320]  because I know what's coming I know because I wrote the plan and so it's
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.760]  coming and all they got to do is keep us busted up separated and they went
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:56.120]  especially with guys like the Chamber of Commerce you know those people put 50
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:04.200]  Alex they put 50 million dollars up not to fight Democrats to fight two party
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:10.440]  candidates at every level in the RNC you're a better analyst than you know
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:14.000]  the so-called analysts they've got on Fox News you've been there you've seen it
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.040]  and that's the thing we've got the Republic of Democratic leadership with
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:22.600]  the wagon circled right taken over the country and literally shutting it down
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:29.120]  trying to put us under the TPP and now we've got Hillary racing in there to
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:35.320]  finish the job it is just sick beyond belief yeah can I tell Hillary if you
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:38.480]  get some of the genius out of the bottle stay there stay there we're gonna talk
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.520]  about that we're coming back a long segment Larry Nichols the Constable
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:49.360]  and Insider makes me sick physically sick we're in trouble we're on the March
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:57.040]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:09.000]  to discussions on how to pay for temporary unemployment benefits for
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.560]  those whose jobs will be exported at first they were going to take the money
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:16.400]  out of Medicare now it looks like they will try to raise fines on small
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:20.520]  business to pay workers that multinational corporations will fire
[02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:27.960]  it's not Obama trade it's Monsanto trade Merc trade Goldman Sachs trade it's
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:32.480]  not free trade it's traders in Congress trying to pass a secret treaty by
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.200]  subterfuge and subverting the constitutional process for treaty

[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:26.120]  Zachari Jackson in Full Wars News Reporter who we've had in here with his
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:32.320]  excellent breakdown of the tragic shooting South Carolina I don't want to
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:36.920]  say I'm freaked out when Larry Nichols says this show is one of the only
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.720]  larger shows that will cover these issues I've been physically attacked that's
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:44.520]  one thing I like about the Clintons I got physically attacked and told to shut
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:49.960]  up about Waco by five guys four of them attacked me and they were paid when the
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.800]  cops came they tried to arrest me until they saw the surveillance footage and
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:57.560]  they were told not to investigate it I had all sorts of dirty tricks done I had
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:02.880]  the military in plain clothes threatened me in parking lots I had all sorts of
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:06.200]  other dirty tricks where feds would come to my book signings or and say hey
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:09.440]  let's you know bomb the police station or whatever and I'd go outside I'd follow
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:15.640]  them they'd be you know in an unmarked federal police car and that's one thing
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:19.040]  under the bushes I kind of got left alone even though they were involved
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.640]  incredible corruption and they're tied in with the Clintons under the Clintons
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.600]  they come after you and I see more and more of a Clinton hand in Obama with
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.680]  all this persecution of conservatives Christians libertarians gun owners and
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:34.960]  it really is mafia I mean that's what they are and it's a Dixie mafia meets
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:41.120]  the CIA and what's scary is they know they're old they've gotten to this point
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:44.680]  this is their chance they know where the bodies are buried they're blackmailing
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:52.960]  people this is their chance to move on every front and during the break out of
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:57.400]  someone jacari I was like I can't believe as a 41 year old person with three
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:02.400]  children that it's my responsibility to do this but I can't just sit here while
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:06.920]  they hand us over to foreign corporations take our guns forcibly
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.920]  inoculate us double everybody's healthcare prices screw everyone put
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:19.320]  troops on don't treat death list stage shootings you know fast and furious I
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:24.720]  mean I'm not trying to just whine here it's I use the term epic over the top
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:29.920]  legendary awesomely evil Reverend Childress was you know calling it just
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:35.880]  just evil genius I mean it's the thing is they're moving on every front they're
[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:39.320]  trying to start war with Russians they have us troops battling Russians right
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:45.160]  now that's that's hardly ever happened Larry Nichols I'm ranting here in
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:51.200]  jacari Jackson's here with us but I don't think I can overstate how perilous
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.480]  situation we're in talk about what their goals were back then where they're
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:36:01.200]  going now what Hillary's gonna try to do and how racial division seems to be so
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.160]  central and then in the jacari jump at any time as he's gonna join us again
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:07.080]  next week just on the Clintons themselves but but but bringing this
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:11.200]  forward to where we are now to understand because am I wrong in saying
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:15.080]  they seem to be racing to finish things is that out of confidence or out of
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:24.040]  desperation they've got everything the way it was set up to be the thing that
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.160]  I guess you've left out of what we've talked about because I have to live
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:33.960]  every day Alex with the fact that I helped write and in most cases wrote most
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:40.520]  of the plan that is now destroying our country that's a pretty awesome thing to
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:46.120]  wear on you and that's why I've been so dedicated to all these years no matter
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:51.320]  the beatings getting shot at reporters being with you getting shot at yeah you
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:55.920]  know what you just keep going this is going to be tough Alex these people
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:37:01.640]  play for keeps if you haven't figured it out bad now all Hillary's got to do to
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:09.200]  win this campaign is simple don't let anybody get in the race against her on
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:15.000]  the Democratic side boom it's over and you'll notice that Hillary is mean
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.400]  enough that when they go to Elizabeth Warren I assume or somebody else that
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:25.880]  might pose a serious challenge they'll make an offer that they can't refuse the
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:30.760]  mistakes she made against Obama she should have run Obama out of the race
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:34.120]  before he ever got in it and said son you're too young you'll get your
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:37.720]  chance later but to get in my way I will destroy you and you'll never see the
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:42.320]  light of day that's what should be done but Hillary was one fall that Bill
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:51.120]  Clinton didn't have she is obviously arrogant hates me and she just takes
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:54.960]  doing anything except the way she wanted but she's not making that mistake this
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:00.040]  time all you ever he's got to do y'all watch just keep anybody credible from
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.920]  getting in on the Democratic side against her and she wins the race all
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.960]  she's got to do is the other thing that we learned and we used every day Alex
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.840]  how do you win an election number one you control your opposition Hillary and
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:21.800]  her power players are controlling the RNC and they're making sure somebody like
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:27.360]  Jeff Bush on earth is going to be the nominee somebody that cannot be somebody
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.880]  that cannot possibly activate the conservatives in this country and get
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:37.800]  them so excited to come out and vote the fix is in the fix is in yep now not
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.920]  to mention good heavens folks here never even seen anybody that's really good
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:47.040]  many boat machines I have you've never seen anybody on your earth that has
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:52.520]  ever had as many dead people make contributions and both as I have this is
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:57.440]  coming for you this is coming for this country this is coming Alex for your
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:02.000]  children that's why I thought you got a fight my grandbabies that's what I got
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:07.440]  to do what I don't want to do I'm 65 years old I want to sit out in a pastor
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.560]  somewhere and say hey I've been to Nick Rodriguez hell hole in the world I'm
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:17.520]  done I'm finished but you're not going folks I know maybe y'all think this is
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:23.280]  high for sensationalism but you better listen to me you're not going to have a
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:28.000]  country when this thing is done and this thing is going to be in the next
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.320]  election there won't be another election Alex although it'll happen you know hey
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:37.600]  they got elections in Cuba don't they but they're not free they're not fair
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:45.640]  either vote for who they say I will kill you that's right so many people who've
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:50.440]  lived in a quasi-free country because nothing's perfect cannot believe that
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:54.760]  they would actually go under tyranny but the decision has been clearly made
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:59.800]  everything's racing towards that and they're openly announcing yeah we're
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:02.280]  going to start shutting reporters down yeah we're going to arrest you for your
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:07.480]  speech yeah can you imagine 20 years ago telling a reporter that's been
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:13.000]  dedicated or put in the pool reporters that they came at then the event by a
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.640]  presidential nominee are you kidding me no 20 years ago Alex could you believe
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:22.760]  somebody could run for president of the United States and oh gee for three or
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:28.120]  four months I'm not even talking to any questions from anyone are you kidding me
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.240]  and they play the card that she's a woman it's everything boiled down to
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.760]  identity politics and so if you don't like her you hate women I mean it is
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:41.080]  just it is mind-blowing jacari Jackson any because I'm I want Larry to continue
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:43.720]  with his breakdown of this in his warning I just agree with what Larry was
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.600]  saying talking about the sin the censorship of the reporters you recall
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.480]  myself and Joe Biggs went down to the border to talk to Nancy Pelosi even though
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.560]  we had already talked to her media contact we get down there they don't let
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:58.680]  us into the event you know so they do things like this all the time same
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:03.120]  thing when I went to see Obama he came here to the LBJ Center and I actually
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.080]  had my press pass and went through all the credentials and all this stuff I'm
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:08.680]  okay so I'm ready to go and let know you can go stand in that room over there
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:12.240]  I was like I don't understand the room Obama's not in you know that's how they do
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:18.240]  yeah what I was saying was 20 years ago could you have believed this could
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:25.720]  happen oh today trust me it's happening it's happening but you got one other
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:32.120]  problem one of the thing key elements in our system was what we called the
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:39.200]  broken coalition now there are enough blacks in Arkansas in that day to an
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:45.560]  election today nationally what is 12% in that day being a queer was bad there
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:50.000]  weren't that many people that came out and said they were openly gay then you
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.400]  had the women's liberals then you had the hippies then you had the hippies all
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:58.800]  of these segments we figured out you know what yeah there's good old hardcore
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.920]  conservative Christian moral people in Arkansas and there's more of them than
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  anyone of these groups but what if we got all those little groups together then
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:16.440]  we become a power source that can't be touched and we did and it worked and now
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:21.320]  they have what's called the broken coalition which now you have to add in
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:30.680]  what the legal message so everything in that plan is working exactly like clock
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:38.040]  work and the problem is the American people Alex all of you American people
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:44.200]  that still believe that you would still believe that America is or was or
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.600]  whatever anybody still believes in America guys you're gonna have to suit
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:52.680]  up because you're gonna have to let me say hey I'm not gonna get involved I'm
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:57.400]  not gonna do whatever yeah you're you're gonna lose it by giving up are you
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:02.440]  gonna stand and you're gonna stand tall and you're gonna tell the truth well
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:06.640]  that's the thing is is this isn't gonna be boss hog tyranny like you were
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.520]  involved in just good ol boy stuff they want to break the system forever break
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:17.440]  our will and domesticate us this is a hardcore tyranny and I mean they just
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:22.160]  hate prosperity they say we didn't build our businesses they tell people in the
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:24.480]  third world they can't have air conditioning or cars while they're on
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:27.240]  jumbo jets I mean these are some nasty people
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:31.880]  jacari Jackson you've been working here a couple years doing a great job we're
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:36.240]  about to send you and whoever else you think you want to go with you up to
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:41.120]  South Carolina to cover all this tragic event you talk about support I didn't
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:44.760]  even plug anything last hour we're gonna plug right now and also plug mr. Nichols
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:49.320]  who's lost everything doing this but that's why you get more reporters hired
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:53.400]  to us we have enough to always cover all these things as things heat up but
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:44:00.280]  jacari what is it like just just to see it all for yourself I mean here it is
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:10.200]  WTOC television police say he was on suboxone a schedule 3 narcotic which
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:17.880]  is basically a anti-psychotic slash amnesic mind control drug I mean of
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:24.720]  course we knew that was coming it's up on info wars.com it's just so sad
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:30.400]  because we really are being conquered at a fundamental spiritual or cellular
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:42.720]  level I feel whipped I feel empty I feel enslaved and what's sad is I know this
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:48.920]  is just the the feeling of what's coming you know the echo from the future
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:54.360]  because we're heading towards this wall I'm yelling I can hear the you know it's
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.000]  bouncing back like sonar I can see what's there I don't know what allegory
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:04.920]  it makes me sick and I've never felt sick talking about the New World Order but
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:09.280]  to see it really coming into view to see them really grabbing people's bank
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.160]  accounts now in Europe getting ready for that collapse to really see all this
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:19.240]  jacari and I'm not saying I'm a whipped person it's the feeling of knowing that
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:24.440]  they want the power they want to whip us they want to dominate us and break
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:29.320]  prosperity and break goodness because they're evil I think it's that coming
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:34.480]  up against brushing up against evil and it won't leave it won't back off it
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:39.320]  won't shut up it's dumbing everybody down it's like being stuck in a room
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:42.520]  with somebody you hate I think that's the best allegory and we're gonna get Mr.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:45.760]  Nichols take on it but what's your take on that well you know when you see all
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:48.880]  the stuff coming down just like Larry was talking about 20 years ago you know
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:52.720]  I was a small child but I'm trying to get in the mindset of somebody 20 years
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:56.120]  ago do they really well of course you knew Alex but you know was the mindset
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:59.400]  of people back then could they imagine something like this you know if you said
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:03.560]  you know 2015 we'll have all these things going on the things with Russia the
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:07.400]  things here domestically and Larry of course says no and it is very interesting
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:10.160]  to me though how the whole thing is coming about and how many people are
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:14.720]  still blind to it you know well exactly they're just maneuvering right now
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:20.560]  they're just men 20 years ago they were getting everything set up you know they
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:23.720]  got the derivatives in they got the banking laws changed it was all the
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:28.000]  Clintons and the globalists around them and now he went to Bilderberg and now
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.160]  Hillary's got her people at Bilderberg nobody else and now they're getting
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:35.600]  ready to finish us off is that an accurate statement Larry you got it let
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:40.520]  me say something to right 20 years ago the average credit card debt to a house
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:47.840]  sold when Bill Clinton took office was around $5,000 when he left office the
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:52.080]  average family owed $60 something thousand dollars in credit cards and it was
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:57.520]  built based off of a false economy system that's what they've been building Alex
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:00.280]  that's what you're talking about everything feels like it's about the
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:05.360]  blow we've lived off a false economy with these people being led through the
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:09.760]  nose into car out there what it felt like 20 years ago Alex remembers this
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:14.920]  gallery Nichols comes on this program telling what's coming which seems so
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:23.200]  unimaginable it sounded like a poor class B horror flick but it was true it was
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:30.280]  true and now Alex what you're feeling is you're actually seeing that which you've
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:38.160]  known about when in your heart of hearts because of being an American you didn't
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:42.960]  think it could actually happen for sure you thought but you couldn't see it for
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:47.880]  sure now you're seeing it for sure and it's like a prank train guys that we're
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:51.960]  standing out here on the tracks and we're looking at each other and saying
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:57.480]  Alex sorry me with you which one of us both stand up in this track and stop that
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:03.960]  train so that's what it is guys these play people play rough Alex is not
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:10.360]  kidding you these people play rough but nobody believes it well as half you know
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:17.360]  that's been fostered he has got you know some odd people that I knew that I had
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:23.320]  to testify that ended up dead no Bill and Hillary didn't kill them but the
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:30.040]  system that walks them in power the mob they act on their own they don't need
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:35.320]  Bill and Hillary you know it's just like this thing with these emails guys do
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:43.000]  y'all really believe that an Obama heir to Clinton Justice Department is going
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.760]  to investigate Hillary you've heard that gouty guy say you know hey I can't from
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:53.080]  this community I can't go if you a subpoena no we can't it's all being
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:58.480]  played man or McConnell they're playing this like a strata variance can you know
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:03.440]  that because if you are a tea party you're gonna ask yourself this if you
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:07.840]  remember the tea party you would be considered the base of the Republican
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.400]  Party wouldn't you're exactly the kind of person that the party was built that
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:20.560]  the following up the moral majority yes and yet the Republicans turn on turn on
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:27.280]  and commit 50 million dollars to the field not just at the presidential level
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:32.640]  congressional level but at the dog catcher level they despise the tea party
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:38.680]  because they know the one thing that I know the tea party if it will if it can
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:46.400]  be led the tea party can take over the RNC and if we took over the RNC we could
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:51.600]  take back our country with a choice but pretty soon it's not gonna be a choice
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:56.800]  once those Mexicans are made to be able to vote folks you will have seen the last
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:06.240]  national election in this country's history and that's the plan there's
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:09.880]  also a blindness to these corporate mafias and that they all want their
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:15.240]  interest but then they don't really think about at least on the surface how
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:18.480]  that connects down the road I mean all that money in the world power is gonna
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:22.400]  be worthless we have nuclear war with the Russians I mean well I mean it's hard
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:29.680]  core and as you think of all these CEOs why do you think these CEOs are rape

[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.560]  news or the news website info wars dot com because the companies I've been
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.880]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:17.760]  as they should be so I refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:22.600]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms

[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:14.080]  pocketing I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pick pocketing
[02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:18.000]  what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.560]  issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:26.840]  information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:30.120]  one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:33.360]  credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.520]  wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should

[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:10.600]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:18.220]  I know Larry Nichols really well he had been on for five years but he's
[02:54:18.220 --> 02:54:24.920]  put on 20 plus times or more probably 30 40 times really because I was on air
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:28.760]  for most of the Clinton administration right from the start a few years into
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.080]  it and I witnessed it and I remember seeing the Clinton Chronicles right away
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:36.440]  and putting on access TV myself and getting threats over it
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.160]  Democratic Party basically called me and said we want to hire you to work for us
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:44.680]  and it was like high-level people and they said you stop talking about about
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:49.720]  Bill Clinton and then when I kept doing it they started threatening me and I was
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:53.080]  like well go ahead and do something and then a month later it came and beat me up
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:58.120]  I mean I fought back but I mean that's the people don't play games and I mean I
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:01.240]  don't want to sound dramatic here but I mean it was the Clintons I mean they
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.960]  they were telling me shut up and stop talking about Waco and they seemed
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:11.440]  surprised that I started fighting back and that'll get you motivated when four
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:19.240]  guys are punching you and I I just can't believe we're in such bondage and it's
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:22.840]  all sold by trendiness the rest of it I want to get into what this world's gonna
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:26.280]  look like if they're able to take total control as they're trying to do
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:29.160]  briefly Larry's gonna join us for like an hour and a half next Tuesday
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:32.280]  Shikari Jackson's gonna be on the news tonight covering more of this seven o'clock
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:37.640]  with the rest of the crew this whole race war they're trying to start people
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:40.760]  that you notice I'm really calm right now I've been frantically trying to stop
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:46.400]  this now that so much of it's going through we're stopping some of it I'm
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:52.000]  more just in grieving for myself in the country and all of us because we're in
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.320]  deep crap I mean I mean we're in the hands of some really bad people and we've
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.600]  been sold out by the Republican leadership and Larry I remember this
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:03.920]  you did this years ago and I know you don't like to push people to support you
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:07.240]  but I know you lost everything you had doing this and I know your books out of

[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:25.160]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:30.360]  and welcome back to the alex jones show I'm your co-host jacari Jackson I'll be
[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:34.960]  hosting this segment by myself talk a little bit about what we've recapped
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:38.800]  here in the last few hours I've been on air with alex of course we know that the
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  shooting happened in Charleston South Carolina and we have roof the shooter
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:48.800]  and we're asking the question was he on SSRI drugs because we know with many of
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:52.400]  these mass shooters over recent history definitely in the time I've been here at
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:57.200]  info wars and probably before that you have innumerable amounts of these guys
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:02.280]  whether it's adam lanza the shooting at port hood any other place where these
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:08.400]  guys they're taking these SSRIs and it you know gives them these very I guess
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.080]  maybe inhibits them in some certain certain ways and does not allow them to
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:16.080]  feel the things they need to feel the empathy that they need to feel to
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:19.040]  actually be a human being and if you guys can hear these things yourself you
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:22.480]  turn on the TV you're watching these pharmaceutical commercials they say stop
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.080]  taking this drug immediately if you have thoughts of suicide if you have
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:31.400]  ambitions to hurt other people but yet we continue to to prescribe these things
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:34.880]  to people on the street people in the military and not you know knocking the
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:38.800]  military at all it's just what they're giving these guys and instead of giving
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:41.880]  them the counseling and things that they need they say go take this pill go talk
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:45.120]  to this doctor so even if you don't kill anybody we can take all your guns away
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:50.120]  but let's talk more about mr. roof what once again I should not call him roof
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:54.880]  but he goes into a church in Charleston South Carolina a congregation is
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:58.520]  meeting a very small group he goes there he sits there for about an hour he's
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:03.520]  listening to the message and you know he's saying his prayers and he decides
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:07.560]  to pull out a 45 caliber pistol reports are saying that he got it from his father
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:12.280]  for a birthday present and opens fire and kills many of the people in there
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:16.360]  nine people one person was allowed to tell the tale and another small little
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:23.480]  girl she survived by playing dead and it's a very cold very callous way to go
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:26.440]  about it I mean it's you know if you were to drove by in a drive-by shooting
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.800]  and shot that'd been bad enough but to go and meet with people you know maybe
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:32.520]  someone shook his hand you know hey you want to come back you know Sunday or
[03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:37.000]  whatever the church service is and we can talk more about it but he sits there
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  and he decides to shoot the people in the building as we are talking about with
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:45.120]  Reverend Childress a little bit earlier today you know the timing of this you
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:48.920]  know Juneteenth you know it's a very big thing in the black community they get
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:54.120]  together in June and a lot of people can be talking about this obviously and you
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:57.840]  know I'm not saying the guy was no meeting with the feds or anything like
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:00.920]  that but you know he may been meeting with some white supremacists that well
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:04.640]  hey if you have ambitions to go kill somebody why don't you just wait and do
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:07.360]  it this weekend you know it's gonna be a huge story I mean it would have been a
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:10.520]  huge story anyway but now you have many people who are going to gather around
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:14.120]  families friends and they're going to talk about this you know what also be
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:17.760]  said I'm not exactly sure I'm sure many people will tell their churches their
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:20.920]  congregations you know hey let's try to find the most peaceful solution to this
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:24.160]  possible but you also have the people say well let's go out there and you know
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:28.160]  maybe have some type of retribution and going out and attacking people randomly
[03:03:28.160 --> 03:03:31.360]  as this guy did is not going to be the answer you know of course this guy needs
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:35.120]  to be held accountable and I'm sure since they've caught them they have in
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:39.880]  some type of segregation back when I used to work in jail we have the medical
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:44.840]  facility and that's where most of your high-risk inmates were you know guys that
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:48.720]  they pretty much are convinced that they put them in general population they
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.680]  could be injured or not murdered so they put them in a medical facility we have
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:56.760]  a lot of staff and yeah very few inmates to contend with so it'll probably stay
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:04:01.000]  there until they find out exactly what's going on with him and also I'll
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:06.360]  briefly touch on the time we have Hillary Clinton and as our last guest was
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:10.200]  speaking about all the things going on in the Clinton presidency and even in the
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:13.520]  Clinton governorship because he's sitting on a lot of things that I didn't know
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:16.720]  about because I know about Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton now but their days
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:21.280]  prior to before Bill became the governor that's you know new information to me
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:24.800]  and one of the questions I hope we get a chance to talk about when he comes on the
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:28.880]  show next week when he talks to Alex is the cocaine that came into Mina
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:33.360]  Arkansas because we always hear it's a conspiracy theory that the government
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:36.640]  has been involved in bringing cocaine into this country and briefly as we wrap
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:40.240]  up go watch the 60 minutes interview with Mike Wallace we're talking to the
[03:04:40.240 --> 03:04:44.080]  head of the DEA and he says hey you telling me that the CIA brought cocaine
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.320]  into this country the DEA guys said yes I don't know any other way to explain it
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:50.520]  to you so stay tuned nightly news coming up 7 p.m. central
