[00:45.200 --> 00:49.680]  time out to not just rant and rave myself or listen to the interesting
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.480]  and informative guests that we bring you each day I want to hear from you first

[01:14.720 --> 01:24.560]  next two hours and 59 minutes the toll free number is 1-800-259-9231 I was
[01:24.560 --> 01:27.640]  going through my stacks of news last night noticed in the last week I
[01:27.640 --> 01:31.880]  probably didn't cover about half the news I had printed off and wanted to talk
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.000]  about so I will try today to just briefly mention some of the things that we
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.840]  haven't alerted you to also there is a huge important stack of news in front of
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.520]  me today on human rights worldwide on what's happening with the economy what's
[01:48.520 --> 01:55.200]  happening with the cashless society enslavement grid a lot of important
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.720]  audio clips are gonna be playing today as well so we have a big broadcast lined
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.360]  up for you but I would like to hear listeners call in and discuss the
[02:04.360 --> 02:12.440]  Supreme Court in oral arguments saying that they believed in restrictions of
[02:12.440 --> 02:16.040]  the Second Amendment that it was a right but that it can be heavily restricted
[02:16.040 --> 02:24.840]  and then now we're set for them to rule coming up in the next two months big
[02:24.840 --> 02:31.520]  attack on the Second Amendment and how that ties into New York Boston Chicago
[02:31.520 --> 02:39.160]  DC Dallas where police come to your doors Phoenix Tucson the list goes on
[02:39.160 --> 02:45.640]  on Portland where they come to your door and knock on the door and say we want to
[02:45.640 --> 02:49.360]  search for illegal guns or we want to make sure your guns are properly stowed
[02:49.360 --> 02:55.640]  just a safety check ma'am please give us authorization to come in now this is
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.720]  just now getting attention but for at least eight years I've been aware of
[02:58.720 --> 03:06.640]  it starting in Dallas and Tucson Dallas Texas Tucson Arizona people think this
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.480]  is just going on in Boston and New York and Chicago and DC where the people are
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.560]  basically disarmed slaves to a great extent no this is happening right here
[03:17.560 --> 03:22.560]  in the heart of Texas and it's part of a larger program of control so we'll be
[03:22.560 --> 03:25.560]  breaking that down and also I'll be reading some of the comments from the
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.800]  info wars.com page where people comment on these articles about this because
[03:29.800 --> 03:34.160]  they bring up points you know so often I think about points when I'm not on air
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.080]  and then I get on air and it's like I lose 20 or 30 IQ points because I get
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.280]  all excited and hurried and but then if I go back to your comments it reminds me
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.160]  of the very things I'm thinking and more often than not angles that I didn't
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.240]  even think about I learned so much from your emails your comments you post on
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.280]  the prison planet dot-com forums on the info wars dot-com stories and the info
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.720]  wars network where everybody has their own little private MySpace page where
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.000]  you can post your own blogs videos articles really taking off there at
[04:06.000 --> 04:14.040]  info wars dot-com but in the interest of trying I've got a little better over the
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.240]  last year but not as good as I like in the interest of trying that when I do
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.960]  take calls I actually go to them in the interest of that I'm going to come back
[04:23.960 --> 04:27.120]  after this break mention some of the news headlines and then I'm going to go
[04:27.120 --> 04:33.880]  directly to your calls early in the next segment and I want to take 100 phone
[04:33.880 --> 04:43.040]  calls today almost assuredly fail but that is a good goal to shoot for 1-800-259-9231
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.600]  oh we could get a thousand phone calls the question is will I actually go to
[04:47.600 --> 04:53.120]  them or cuts you off in time to go to the next we'll be right back

[06:55.280 --> 07:00.040]  Reserve in 1913 all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.880]  every single loan they issue with never ending late fees over the limit fees and
[07:03.880 --> 07:07.480]  higher and higher interest rates it has become mathematically impossible to
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.880]  repay all debt making all of us slaves to our creditors the federal debt relief
[07:11.880 --> 07:15.320]  system has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally
[07:15.320 --> 07:18.680]  eliminate credit card debt personal loans lines of credit and other
[07:18.680 --> 07:21.720]  unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks we

[07:53.960 --> 08:11.320]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:11.320 --> 08:15.080]  all right there's a bold new program going into effect in boston raising a
[08:15.080 --> 08:19.480]  lot of eyebrows might include it see my eyebrow going up police call it safe
[08:19.480 --> 08:24.040]  homes and it allows officers to enter a person's home and search their kids
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.560]  bedrooms for guns all without a warrant parents are free to turn down these
[08:29.560 --> 08:35.160]  searches assuming they understand that clearly critics say this is a violation
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.520]  of the constitution but the boston police department says hey we're just
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.600]  trying to make our streets safer we're not really trying to arrest people
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.080]  yeah our legal panel here now law professor at pepperdine university out
[08:47.080 --> 08:50.520]  in beautiful california matthew rosengart and former west ester county
[08:50.520 --> 08:54.360]  prosecutor and fox news legal analyst gene perot joins us
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.520]  all right you know matthew it's the lawyer in me but boy knocking on a door
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.120]  without probable cause and reasonable suspicion
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.400]  you know intimidating people just the mere presence of three cops at your door
[09:07.400 --> 09:11.880]  is intimidating i mean this this is unconstitutional isn't it well i think
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.560]  there's a good chance that it is going to be found to be unconstitutional i mean
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.120]  even every any layman anybody who watches law and order or any show knows two
[09:20.120 --> 09:24.280]  things one is they have a right not to speak with the police under moranda
[09:24.280 --> 09:27.640]  and two they have a fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable
[09:27.640 --> 09:32.120]  searches and seizures this program is clearly an effort to
[09:32.120 --> 09:36.520]  undrun the constitution and even if the police play by the book and try to get
[09:36.520 --> 09:39.480]  consent for a search because there are circumstances
[09:39.480 --> 09:43.800]  of course where warrants are not necessary it's clear that this is right
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.560]  for abuse people will undoubtedly be intimidated
[09:47.560 --> 09:51.560]  you have three policemen or fbih and show up at your door it takes a lot of
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.720]  moxie to say no you can't you know but they've got a right they've got to say
[09:55.720 --> 09:59.880]  and gene i guess if a parent wants their local police
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.040]  to come into their home clearly they have no control over their teenagers and
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.800]  now they're just hoping somebody will step in right this is what it is it's a
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.360]  it's a safe home safe streets program it is a crime prevention strategy
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.360]  where police not dressed as police officers not in uniform
[10:16.360 --> 10:19.400]  go to homes in dangerous high crime neighborhoods
[10:19.400 --> 10:23.240]  where parents are happy to see them because the parents are now saying you
[10:23.240 --> 10:26.760]  know what i can't control my own kids i can't control their friends
[10:26.760 --> 10:30.040]  they must give consent police cannot go in there without the consent of the
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.000]  parents and by the way they've agreed not to
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.160]  prosecute any of these kids when i was the da one of the things i did was buy
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.480]  back guns from kids no questions asked i gave them cds i gave money i gave them
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.080]  sneakers we've got to get guns off the street and you know what this is smart
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.000]  with you have to get there there's a bunch of caveats here Matthew and one of
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.120]  them is they will prosecute if they find a gun
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.400]  that's connected to a crime but they're not supposed to go into halls right if
[10:55.400 --> 10:59.320]  it's connected with a they've already said what happens but if they find a gun
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.440]  that's in a home that's connected to a crime then they're gonna prosecute they
[11:02.440 --> 11:06.040]  find a gun sure but think about it from the police officer's
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.640]  perspective what happens if they go in and they find a bag of crack cocaine what
[11:09.640 --> 11:12.360]  if they find one they've already said they're not going to take it
[11:12.360 --> 11:16.280]  well no it's a much easier bottom line because we're not going to take small
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.120]  amounts we know that okay tell me what a small amount
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.480]  okay now that's from a few months ago when boston announced all of this
[11:25.480 --> 11:30.040]  the bigger question here is why is there now a concerted effort to bring this
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.080]  out because for at least eight years they have
[11:33.080 --> 11:39.160]  had knock and talk in texas in arizona in california
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.280]  in oregon in new york and they come to your door and
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.400]  they say we'd like to do a safety inspection of your guns in texas
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.320]  they say we'd like to check for the safety of your firearms that they're
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.480]  properly stowed when there's no law on that in arizona
[11:57.480 --> 12:04.040]  and they target middle class areas in the west and the south
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.800]  with this program but you heard this oh the parents want them in the parents
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.640]  want cops to come to the door and say let us in let us look for guns
[12:13.640 --> 12:16.920]  and i actually went and pulled up what dc and boston are saying they're going to
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.480]  do it's the same wording it isn't an amnesty
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.160]  it's lawyer speak they're going to bust you for anything they find in your house
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.200]  but they're going to tell the dumb cattle that they're not going to
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.520]  and the news is going to play along with it
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.760]  you know we played that mbc news piece from yesterday uh from dc
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.760]  they say you're given total amnesty no you're
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.960]  not so again it's the government lying as usual
[12:47.960 --> 12:52.680]  this is supposedly the united states because we have a fourth amendment we
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.080]  have a right to be innocent until proven guilty we have a right to do
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.920]  process we have a right to be judged by our peers a right
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.280]  to privacy and a warrant now the government's attacking the first
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.880]  amendment the fourth the fifth the second the tenth
[13:09.880 --> 13:15.240]  they're getting rid of all of it wholesale while they build fema camps
[13:15.240 --> 13:21.240]  and militarize the police while mega churches put in thumb scanners for
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.120]  their members to come in i mean this is the orwellian world
[13:26.120 --> 13:29.400]  while the cameras go in the school bathrooms while the children thumb
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.040]  scanning at their school lunches all to track and trace all to
[13:34.040 --> 13:37.880]  control all to train you to be a prisoner
[13:38.600 --> 13:43.240]  it is illegal the supreme court has ruled previously
[13:43.240 --> 13:46.920]  that you can resist an illegal search with force
[13:46.920 --> 13:51.000]  other federal courts and state courts have said that the founding fathers said
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.440]  that if someone came to your house without a warrant
[13:54.440 --> 13:59.000]  without probable cause if people see you dragging a screaming
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.360]  child into your house uh that isn't your child and the child's bleeding
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.000]  they can call the police the police don't have to wait
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.800]  the that's probable cause or uh if your smoke's coming out of your house
[14:13.800 --> 14:16.920]  the fire department doesn't have to wait to batter down your door
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.400]  the founding fathers had lived through tyranny they were geniuses they
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.760]  they could speak five languages on average they they had studied world
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.320]  history it was reasonable it made sense
[14:29.320 --> 14:33.160]  if a cop pulls you over because you've got a headlight burned out
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.080]  and uh there's blood on the back seat
[14:37.080 --> 14:40.760]  and a woman's shoe he can pull his gun out and say get out of the car because
[14:40.760 --> 14:47.880]  he's got probable cause something is suspicious
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.440]  but you cannot just and by the way more lies from fox news and the people
[14:52.440 --> 14:56.920]  pushing it two of them not two of them pushing on the show
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.080]  we now have the newscast footage of them in boston and n dc
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.240]  going out with pilot programs of this they're in full uniform going house to
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.160]  house saying i want to come in and search for legal guns
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.760]  and if there's any legal guns in here you're going to be arrested
[15:12.760 --> 15:16.120]  unless you let me in now
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.280]  you know that's the trick they use when you're coming in from mexico on
[15:20.280 --> 15:24.280]  customs and they say you don't have any
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.640]  prohibited items here you say no and they say no cuban cigars
[15:29.640 --> 15:33.720]  and i was coming back with some college buddies one time and one of them said oh
[15:33.720 --> 15:37.880]  yeah i i got two cuban cigars and they threatened him and
[15:37.880 --> 15:42.680]  pour him up from the trash can he's an idiot
[15:42.680 --> 15:48.920]  he's an idiot if he would just said no
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.680]  they would never have searched his bag and they would have said i don't i can't
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.120]  read spanish i didn't know that's cuban
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.880]  the point is it's a trick
[16:00.840 --> 16:04.360]  now they've had a rest in dallas and a rest in they're doing surrounding
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.320]  communities in brown dallas and they've had to rest in phoenix and

[24:09.240 --> 24:13.320]  mr jones yes sir how you doing sir it's an honor to speak to you honor to talk
[24:13.320 --> 24:18.360]  to you what's on your mind ah well i was uh i just wanted to let you know
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.320]  i started listening to you a few years ago and i've taken a lot of your advice
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.240]  and um i bought some silver and i bought some gold
[24:27.240 --> 24:30.600]  and um i'm looking at this you know a lot of people
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.720]  where i go buy silver from they freak out because of fluctuation
[24:35.720 --> 24:38.920]  and um i'm looking at like five year charts
[24:38.920 --> 24:42.440]  and ten year charts and i'm actually looking at a six hundred year chart
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.080]  and i'm seeing on here where silver was actually a one time
[24:47.080 --> 24:52.120]  far more valuable than gold uh do you know anything about that
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.480]  well i know that silver at certain times in history
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.160]  uh find silver or silver made into spoons
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.640]  silver made into t sets uh was close to the value
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.440]  of gold but i am not familiar with the time okay why don't you enlighten me
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.880]  well i'm actually looking at the chart right now and it goes back
[25:11.880 --> 25:19.800]  to about the uh 1340s and it's showing by 1998 dollar value
[25:19.800 --> 25:26.120]  that uh silver was actually almost two to one over gold as far as value goes
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.800]  and it looks like it goes up into the beginning of the 19th century
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.760]  and it was pretty constant throughout those uh years and it got up to the 19th
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.480]  uh the 20th century where the fed took over and the uh the graph just
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.960]  went sporadically out of control and uh gold went way up and silver went way
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.720]  down so i was just you know i've been buying more silver here recently
[25:47.720 --> 25:51.800]  and i'm just hoping that it goes it goes up again
[25:51.800 --> 25:55.720]  but um well i know this gold just went up again and i appreciate your call
[25:55.720 --> 25:58.760]  the only downside of taking a lot of your calls is each of you get about a
[25:58.760 --> 26:01.960]  minute and a half uh gold is exploding back
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.000]  upwards again that is in the news stack we will be covering

[26:28.360 --> 26:33.320]  his um i guess online magazine um basically just making it sound like
[26:33.320 --> 26:36.840]  yet they're the ones who cracked the case on bohemian grove and
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.680]  he went there with you but yeah he thought that you were crazy but oh yeah
[26:40.680 --> 26:43.960]  you were right and trash in the jim tucker with the boulder

[26:49.880 --> 26:54.920]  the way we live and um i just really look look look look look glenn beck glenn
[26:54.920 --> 26:59.160]  beck glenn beck spends all his time acting like he's a patriot
[26:59.160 --> 27:03.080]  he'll claim he's fighting the law of the sea treaty but but then when it actually
[27:03.080 --> 27:07.000]  comes up for a vote he won't talk about it uh he'll claim he's against the new
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.800]  world order that he'll push every one of their agendas uh glenn beck
[27:11.800 --> 27:19.240]  is really a piece of work and uh john ronson did crack the bohemian grove
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.320]  uh and i've always told that story it's in my film john ronson called me
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.000]  and said we can't sneak in because of liability
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.560]  will be sued will you go into bohemian grove we have a source inside
[27:31.560 --> 27:37.080]  who knows how you can get in and then i indeed sneak i did sneak in with my
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.920]  kansen and then later that day i was out towards the
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.640]  edge of the grove and i did see john ronson uh in past the first gate didn't
[27:45.640 --> 27:49.240]  see him again and i said well you ended up sneaking in he said
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.600]  promise me your word of honor you will not say i came in because i can be sued
[27:54.600 --> 28:01.000]  channel four can be sued and i said okay i uh will not say that i saw you uh at
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.640]  least within one layer of the grove
[28:03.640 --> 28:07.160]  uh but you know we're the ones that snuck in got the video got it out
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.320]  and then he kind of ran around and then double backed on me
[28:11.320 --> 28:14.840]  but i mean if you watch his tv show he says i snuck in
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.320]  what aired on national tv for four years he said only i snuck in
[28:19.320 --> 28:22.600]  now he comes out and says no he snuck in

[28:42.600 --> 28:45.880]  quite some time and then it's like you just you know finally somebody told him
[28:45.880 --> 28:47.800]  to be quiet and he stopped talking about it
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.160]  yeah but was he coming right out and saying the government did it
[28:51.160 --> 28:54.920]  no he was talking to jana davis and letting her say it
[28:54.920 --> 28:58.040]  exactly in fact i've even heard some of those online

[36:15.240 --> 36:18.440]  we have the witnesses we go to oklahoma city
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.000]  where they were following the iraqi republican guard who were with mcvay
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.840]  they were well known and uh they were freaking out over the fact that the
[36:26.840 --> 36:28.920]  federal government had brought them in and was protecting them they were
[36:28.920 --> 36:32.520]  involved in narcotics trafficking
[36:32.520 --> 36:37.160]  perfect go-betweens can you imagine five thousand republican guard trained by the
[36:37.160 --> 36:42.760]  cia when saddam was our boy brought back in later relocated in the u.s
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.480]  perfect operators they're not the usual crackhead that you
[36:47.480 --> 36:50.120]  got to use as an informant to go set somebody up who
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.840]  who's stupid and unreliable uh they're not a u.s citizen who may not carry it
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.080]  out or do it uh and if they get busted or caught you
[36:59.080 --> 37:03.320]  just say they're terrorist and there are five thousand five hundred of them
[37:03.320 --> 37:09.160]  still in the u.s and they uh are ready the government gives one
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.080]  order and they will blow up chemical plants bomb buildings
[37:13.080 --> 37:17.240]  five thousand special ops could bring this country to its knees in one hour
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.960]  and that's another thing the new order has and uh if they want to they will
[37:21.960 --> 37:27.160]  give the order and that's just one force and any of them get caught any of them
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.880]  get killed any of them go to the media no one's
[37:29.880 --> 37:34.920]  going to believe it it sounds too crazy but it did come out
[37:34.920 --> 37:39.000]  five thousand five hundred and they cooked the bomb
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.120]  they did it all they were seen by all the witnesses they were seen on 12
[37:42.120 --> 37:45.880]  surveillance camera tapes fbi agents people say well this would come out
[37:45.880 --> 37:49.480]  people would talk we've interviewed two fbi agents so they've been they've told
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.880]  the la times other publications that yeah they've seen the footage and it's
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.840]  two iraqi men and then jenna davis talked about it she was a local news
[37:58.840 --> 38:02.760]  reporter and then al-hussain hussain sued her and she went to court and beat
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.800]  him and it turned out it was him now state police did arrest al-hussain hussain
[38:07.800 --> 38:10.680]  and a bunch of other iraqis what was it about 14 of them
[38:10.680 --> 38:14.760]  14 or it was 14 the first sweep they caught him trying to fly out they were
[38:14.760 --> 38:17.640]  already on the east coast trying to fly out to uh
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.040]  back to iraq and they were even getting on the planes with the
[38:22.040 --> 38:24.760]  uh they you know they were at the airports when they caught him with the
[38:24.760 --> 38:30.200]  blue jogging suits with the bomb materials uh and uh the state department
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.280]  called uh the fbi called and went and picked them up and ordered them under
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.960]  national security to release them now again state police caught him in
[38:39.960 --> 38:43.080]  oklahoma uh state police arrested him what was it in
[38:43.080 --> 38:47.160]  boston of all places trying to fly out and uh the fed
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.880]  swept in and said release them and we have two different fbi agents on record
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.720]  who saw the surveillance camera tapes and it is these men getting out of the
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.640]  cars now we have a surveillance camera of the news was already following them
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.360]  now when the local news knows about the iraqi hit teams
[39:04.360 --> 39:08.280]  do you think that uh the police know
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.440]  do you think the fbi knows do you think the government knows of course they do
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.280]  i mean locals were freaking out there are iraqis all over the place
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.040]  and they were topless bars with mcveigh but the topless dancers that talked

[39:35.560 --> 39:39.160]  suicide you know we've gone over all of this

[43:35.080 --> 43:39.240]  has a shop caller around its neck or likened to the movie dune with the
[43:39.240 --> 43:44.760]  heart plug the country has a heart plug they just pull it and we die
[43:47.080 --> 43:52.600]  and they'll tell you al-qaeda and iran did it makes no difference that iran is
[43:52.600 --> 43:57.960]  not al-qaeda that they're sheite the polar opposite in islam
[43:57.960 --> 44:02.360]  means nothing to the idiots in the streets and that's why

[44:32.760 --> 44:37.720]  you know the responsibility and to know that we could have such a
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.160]  wonderful future but we've got to be a bunch of gullible idiots

[44:50.680 --> 44:56.120]  air hey hi hey alex how you doing today good good i was
[44:56.120 --> 45:00.680]  wondering if you see any correlation to these changes in our civil liberties
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.680]  and to the loss of some of our rights plus you know you've advocated the 10
[45:04.680 --> 45:08.840]  signs that we're seeing and also some of this rumbling
[45:08.840 --> 45:11.800]  underground buildups that we've been hearing about
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.800]  do you see any correlation at all to the possible
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.200]  uh catastrophe that they talk about december 2012
[45:20.200 --> 45:24.120]  you know i'm getting constant questions and comments about 2012
[45:24.120 --> 45:30.920]  as the buzz intensifies and it's a very complex question i believe the
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.320]  globalist are going to capitalize on craziness
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.680]  going into 2012 they would rather not stage terror attacks or use iraqi
[45:40.680 --> 45:45.480]  cia plants they would rather or a half dozen other plans they've got
[45:45.480 --> 45:48.760]  for provocateur actions they would rather go out and infiltrate
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.400]  you know a messianic nut group and they are they are out there
[45:53.400 --> 45:57.880]  who will and then provocateur something but the globalists also believe in the
[45:57.880 --> 46:01.080]  occult so they think something big is coming
[46:01.080 --> 46:04.440]  uh i don't really put a lot of stock in it i've studied it
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.240]  i'd be really agree but the mayans really said even if you believe what they
[46:07.240 --> 46:11.400]  said and i don't they say it's just the kind of like a new year a new millennium
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.360]  it's it's a it they say it's a new order kind of
[46:14.360 --> 46:17.960]  like the new ageers think you know the age of
[46:17.960 --> 46:21.960]  aquarius began in 2001 uh or the age of aquarius
[46:21.960 --> 46:25.240]  ended depending on which school you look at a new one has begun
[46:25.240 --> 46:31.800]  it's the age of aquarius the age of aquarius you know all of that
[46:31.800 --> 46:37.160]  uh so they put stock in it and you know using the criminology or the
[46:37.160 --> 46:40.200]  or the psychopathic new world order ology ought to come up with a term for
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.200]  studying their you know i study them that doesn't the medial then say oh look
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.200]  jones believes we've entered a new age no i believe they believe that
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.200]  and uh they're completely out of their minds but they are highly intelligent
[46:52.200 --> 46:55.160]  and uh we're in deep trouble
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.160]  is there any more information that's been released about some of these underground
[46:59.160 --> 47:03.160]  facilities that now they believe are three per state you have any more
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.200]  information you have incredible channels of of information and
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.200]  and i'd like to you know get that out here what your opinion is on sure sure
[47:10.200 --> 47:15.240]  let me briefly answer that i appreciate your calls it's it's a really good question
[47:15.240 --> 47:21.240]  number one i am going to make a film on 2012 just just just know that in game two
[47:21.240 --> 47:26.200]  is going to be a 2012 film and i'll just leave it at that
[47:26.200 --> 47:31.240]  after my jfk film and 911 films are released this year
[47:31.240 --> 47:35.240]  i am going to make a 2012 film
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.240]  okay i've been planning that for at least five years
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.240]  and there you go it's time and that's what i'm gonna do i'll just tell you
[47:43.240 --> 47:47.240]  that's the next project
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.240]  but it will be unlike any of the other 2012 films you see
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.240]  it will have a higher budget
[47:55.240 --> 47:59.240]  than any of the quote grassroots 2012 films you're gonna see
[47:59.240 --> 48:03.240]  god willing if i don't die in a car wreck tomorrow or slip and fall in a banana pill
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.240]  but that's up to the creator so we'll see what happens
[48:07.240 --> 48:11.240]  you're asking about underground bases you know i never
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.240]  go to the source of some guy who claims he worked in one
[48:15.240 --> 48:19.240]  or some rumor we have the admissions
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.240]  of underground bases
[48:23.240 --> 48:27.240]  so i always always what is admitted is many many
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.240]  times wilder than for some reason
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.240]  the quote conspiracy theory movement never covers what they can prove
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.240]  they always cover what they can
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.240]  hypothetically quizzling about
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.240]  an example of that is we've had
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.240]  americans in illegal concentration camps since 1986 in the
[48:51.240 --> 48:55.240]  us and it's on the army's own website and publicly admitted but no one wants to talk about it
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.240]  they'll just talk about their brothers got a cousin who saw a truck overturn
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.240]  with signs that said martial law on them
[49:03.240 --> 49:07.240]  and people won't talk about the tens of thousands of
[49:07.240 --> 49:11.240]  declassified examples of lethal and potentially lethal
[49:11.240 --> 49:15.240]  chemical biological radiological agents sprayed in subways and ship channels
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.240]  on public school children on cps grab children on churches
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.240]  on cities no one ever
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.240]  i cover that in endgame we spend 20 minutes on it spending about 30 seconds
[49:27.240 --> 49:31.240]  per example there were thousands we only picked a few
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.240]  sources video admissions i mean they'll just murder you anytime they want
[49:35.240 --> 49:39.240]  it's a god complex the ultimate power trip
[49:39.240 --> 49:43.240]  but instead people want to
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.240]  theorize what chemtrails are
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.240]  by the way chemtrails will be in the new film
[49:51.240 --> 49:55.240]  but it's the same thing with these underground bases
[49:55.240 --> 49:59.240]  it's declassified they don't give you the exact specifics
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.240]  but there is a multi-state network on the east coast
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.240]  built and completed by the mid 1950s
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.240]  centering underneath the capitol the white house the briar green hotel
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.240]  the briar green or briar grove
[50:15.240 --> 50:19.240]  all over the east coast and we know that
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.240]  the government spent billions of dollars in 1950s and 60s money
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.240]  to buy hundreds of giant locomotive
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.240]  drillers that can go through solid rock at about 4 feet an hour
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.240]  hundreds of them and that they
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.240]  have been digging ever since
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.240]  so yes there's
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.240]  underground cities just everywhere and i'll tell you where one is when we get back that is
[50:47.240 --> 50:53.240]  where we are

[54:26.440 --> 54:30.520]  that's now been declassified they of course killed a few patsies to make the public think
[54:31.320 --> 54:39.240]  that it had been you know some rogue group they had to have that enemy and one of the first big
[54:39.240 --> 54:47.720]  underground cities built after after they built the east coast network was built under Fort Hood
[54:47.720 --> 54:53.000]  Texas the largest western military reservation in the world the Russians reportedly by the
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.080]  Urals have a bigger compound they have underground nuke storing facilities under some hills out there
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.400]  and i've talked to multiple troops and i've got other funding documents that that are declassified
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.680]  that show that they did pump billions of dollars into underground facilities there and the mo is
[55:10.680 --> 55:17.640]  that's a nexus point all the way out to carl uh to the different bases in new mexico uh to the
[55:17.640 --> 55:24.200]  different bases in arizona to the different bases in california to different bases in uh the
[55:24.200 --> 55:32.760]  decodas uh into bases in fort worth and yeah they built underground railroads and then as for how
[55:32.760 --> 55:38.440]  big the cities are themselves the swiss have underground cities for their entire population
[55:38.440 --> 55:45.000]  and they admit it and they are set up for two years apiece every town has one the russians
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.600]  have public facilities for their public the chinese have them in the us uh if you're in
[55:50.600 --> 55:55.640]  major cities they still have the signs up in parking garages it will say designated nuclear
[55:55.640 --> 56:02.520]  fallout uh shelter you're meant to go into the underground shelter into the into the car park
[56:02.520 --> 56:08.760]  and die land of the coward home of the slave you see because we thought we were so free and because
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.640]  we thought we were so good the new order likes its russian slaves it likes its chinese slave to
[56:13.640 --> 56:18.920]  a certain extent it doesn't like us so we don't get the facilities everybody else gets
[56:18.920 --> 56:25.080]  and so they just never tell us about them but uh they do have massive underground cities
[56:25.640 --> 56:32.520]  all over the nation uh reportedly some of them have 20 year food supplies uh nuclear power
[56:32.520 --> 56:39.160]  plants underground just everything and it's all for them and they are strongly considering releasing
[56:39.160 --> 56:44.520]  bio weapons and just killing all of us and then they of course will orderly retreat to the facilities
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.840]  and kill everyone on the surface and then they will emerge into their utopia uh these are very
[56:50.840 --> 56:57.160]  very very very sick people and uh they've even done studies on how to shut down the power plants
[56:57.160 --> 57:02.760]  and how to make sure there's not chain reactions on the surface if they do this and that's what we
[57:02.760 --> 57:09.080]  face uh now i don't know they'll implement those plans but that's who runs things i mean they're
[57:09.080 --> 57:13.160]  people that poison your water just to dumb you down so you're more easily controllable i mean
[57:14.360 --> 57:21.080]  they're apt to do anything and uh there is a giant underground city you know fort hood is
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.280]  i saw a report was eight times the size of dallas or something i mean it's just
[57:28.280 --> 57:35.320]  it's just it's gigantic look at a map of fort hood it's just up the road from me
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.280]  and most the troops of course don't even know how big it is or the different facilities that are on it
[57:41.800 --> 57:48.520]  and uh it's uh austin berkstrom the report is uh that under the hilton the old hilton
[57:49.560 --> 57:53.560]  it was a sack command base strategic air command the report is
[57:53.560 --> 57:58.760]  man i probably shouldn't even get into this stuff but they can never track back
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.520]  why not just tell people there's reportedly an underground spur railway spur and it's one way
[58:07.160 --> 58:14.840]  under that out to fort hood but of course i mean what do you expect from the former
[58:14.840 --> 58:20.520]  sack command base yeah they used to have the big nuke nuke bombers out there at it
[58:20.520 --> 58:27.640]  we'll uh be right back okay look i did take quite a few calls but not enough i don't care how good
[58:27.640 --> 58:31.800]  your question is i'm rampaging through them on the other side one eight hundred two five nine nine

[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:07.320]  fighting the iluminati and i don't know this is just a suggestion but hopefully uh you could have
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:13.720]  to prepare about a year or something but i'd like to see a million or five million people
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:21.160]  flood the streets of washington dc in protest against the uh the irs and the federal reserve
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:25.560]  system look at it down well look at it in a couple months there's going to be a big march in dc
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:30.600]  you know for the ron paul revolution and i think it's a great idea but we've got to be prepared
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:35.080]  that if five million hit the streets there's a very good chance the feds would set off a truck
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:39.480]  bomb or something and blame it on us they just couldn't pass up that opportunity i understand
[1:01:39.480 --> 1:01:49.400]  their psychology too well yeah it's sad well i mean once you see once you see human life is bad
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:55.160]  and once you see it as moral to kill us and lie to us it's over and they've all written it and
[1:01:55.160 --> 1:02:02.360]  stated it and that's their policy and we've had a shadow government since 47 that is 61 years
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:06.680]  they've just been doing whatever they want with unlimited funds and the private corporations
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:11.640]  own them and that's it's just we're in deep trouble i mean i mean every cop out there listening
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:15.880]  you're with us you know they decided to release the bio weapons and go to their underground bases
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:20.440]  you're you're going to be dying and of course you'll be dying thinking some patriot released it
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:24.520]  you'll be flopping around vomiting in your apartment dying thinking you know i did it or
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:31.800]  something you're so brainwashed so uh who like what do you think would be the best way to uh attack
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:38.120]  them you know i can't even get people to believe me though i'm starting people are starting to
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:46.360]  listen we first got to wake up the general public and we are and i appreciate your call because so
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:52.120]  much of what we have said has come true so much of what the alternative media has discussed has
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:58.840]  happened our credibility our stock has gone up and up despite the fact that there are a lot of nuts
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:02.520]  who are quote conspiracy theorists who just put out the craziest stuff you can imagine
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:08.200]  people are now discerning between real alternative news and baloney and the feds have tried to put
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:12.600]  hate into our movements and they've tried to put kookiness and viciousness into our movement
[1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:19.320]  and it's really not working people are developing a palette you know a the taste buds uh to really
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:26.200]  be able to to to you to discern or or the olfactory senses have been developed uh that's part of the
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:36.040]  palette uh to to to to to discern and so now people are finally i mean i've got people in my
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.160]  family that are you know harvard doctors who are really smart but they didn't believe me five years
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:44.840]  ago and i have dinner with them now and they're freaking out going yes we you know we we believe
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:54.840]  you what do we do uh so i'm not bragging i have people in my family who are harvard medical school
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:00.120]  graduates the point i'm making is that they believed in the system they thought well i'm a good person
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:05.240]  so the system's good now they've seen and once you pull the veil back once they can see for
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:10.360]  themselves that's the solution one has to see the matrix one cannot really be told about it
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:16.040]  and so now as we enter deeper into the new world order it's our job to wake up those that still
[1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:22.760]  aren't aware of what's happening i mean i got new york footage of police beating peaceful

[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:48.680]  publicly a normal person responds to that like this i just want people to think it's extraordinary
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:53.720]  to fight back even though it is that's that that that's why we're in the situation well we just
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:58.600]  appreciate you for kind of being the i guess the point guy or whatever because i don't know
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:03.560]  hardly you know who else is out there that's got a radio program like you do i don't know of anybody
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:10.520]  do you no i don't know anyone out there that does the show like we do okay well anyway i had three
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:18.680]  questions um yesterday you had mentioned um the dinecore and haliburton um we're doing some kind
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:27.160]  of child what child yes they run a child sex slavery ranks okay all right um let's see that
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:34.520]  that was in the bbc chicago tribune and other major publications uh it came out the governor
[1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:40.040]  of all people called for an investigation of dinecore and haliburton running a child kidnapping
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:47.640]  rings all over central eastern europe uh central asia uh and the middle east now most of them go
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:53.400]  most of them they grab go to sweat shops uh but a large portion do go into sex slavery and that
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:58.920]  that was in the newspaper okay all right and then that's why dinecore and haliburton and all them
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:05.880]  have moved to dubai oh okay yeah yeah that makes sense that they get out from under being or uh
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:11.640]  from being uh part uh prosecuted for that by the way for people listening for the first time you can
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:18.840]  google that that's mainstream news uh just type of something like haliburton dinecore uh human
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:24.520]  trafficking okay in fact it's been that's about two years ago let me just google it let me just
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:31.320]  google it myself keep talking okay um well let's see i had another question you you had talked about
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:39.080]  uh the factor eight i can't tell whether you're saying vector eight factor factor right factor
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:46.760]  okay and then is it the word factor and then the number eight yes okay all right i couldn't i
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:53.160]  couldn't tell that by listening over the radio okay and then um also had you heard anything
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:19:00.680]  uh about uh the patriot act being uh written by or a couple of russians were brought over
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:07.880]  to help write the patriot act no viet din wrote large portions of the patriot act and i appreciate
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:15.480]  your call uh we've got to go to break viet din uh who's not even from the us uh wasn't born here

[1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:15.000]  you'll get a bunch of chicago tribunes bbc you also find prison planet that's a good synopsis
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.080]  stories with just a bunch of links giving you the full spectrum that's what we do we take all the
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:24.040]  mainstream news and then tie it together and show you the big picture dinecore and haliburton
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:28.760]  sex slave scandal won't go away for years i talked about this and was death-threaded and
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:33.080]  finally it broke in the bbc and chicago tribune and then the death threats stopped about this
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:39.640]  because they figure and then dinecore changed its name but uh in fact erin found one that says
[1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:44.440]  us stalls on human trafficking pentagon has yet to ban contractors from using forced labor
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:50.200]  but there's another one that's better erin it's one that's got a headline like governor
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:56.120]  criticizes sex slavery or governor critics and uh that was in the chicago tribune where it really
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:25:01.160]  gets serious but this one gets into how they're slaves i mean i shouldn't laugh it's just so
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:07.400]  unbelievable you uh i mean i laugh because it's just incredible that this isn't bigger news uh
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:13.960]  and uh yes at gunpoint they load them they load men in central asia on planes fly them
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:18.760]  to other third world countries sometimes on the other side of the planet and it gave one case of
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:26.040]  thousands of men working in a giant set of brick factories and they were just uh and they're
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:32.600]  they're chained up at night and then they just work at a in furnaces making bricks hellish work
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:39.000]  and that's it they're actual slaves i don't mean just semi slaves chained during the day to uh
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:45.320]  sewing machines or in india you know the 10 year old children having to weave exotic
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:52.360]  like asian you know oriental rugs that's bad enough i'm talking about flown out and how
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.680]  libertin does it too and you don't think they'll want to do that here that's what this is all about
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:04.280]  and uh but then it says that the minority of it is sex slavery and that's in the hundreds of
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:09.080]  thousands a year it's in the millions total very very wicked
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:19.720]  okay uh let's go ahead now and uh go to woody who i'm told kind of disagrees he says he's a yuppie
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:23.160]  i don't know what that means but uh you're on the air from wyoming go ahead woody
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:29.400]  alex jones it is the honor of my 49 year life to speak with your brother you are the paul
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:35.960]  revere of my generation i'm a wall street former yuppie that's now wide awake about the new world
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.560]  order just an hour of your show a few years ago about those 9 11 put options in the federal reserve
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:49.240]  woke me up and made me an info warrior i listen to your show almost every day i subscribe for
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:55.880]  some planet tv you got me in golden silver years ago i buy storeable food cow band soap and i've
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:00.200]  woken up at least a hundred friends and clients with your and ron paul materials well you're
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:04.280]  awesome i i i thought it was like a joke call or something you know i'm not bashing yuppies you
[1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:09.240]  could call me a yuppie the point is is that the there's the yuppies out there that laugh at all
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:14.040]  this when if they wouldn't laugh we could save this country i used to be one of them here's
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:20.760]  my question for your brother security cameras tied into government databases legally or warrantless
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:27.000]  searches period why don't you make a million bucks for our cause by selling hats your people
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:32.600]  can wear out that simply say security cameras equal warrantly search warrantless searches
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:39.160]  and info wars on the back of the hat well they will claim that you do not have the reasonable
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:45.880]  assumption of privacy outside but if they are running your face or play through a database
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:51.400]  when it's on private property you can't say that and somebody should go and create that precedent
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:57.080]  it'd be it you know what i'd love to be the first one to buy a hat that says that if somebody would
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:03.240]  make it alex god bless your parents for giving you to america and all you see to all you cheap

[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.760]  some young group of kids that are dumb enough to shoot their mouths off and they use that to scare

[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:18.520]  i'm doing really well i'm so happy to actually get to talk to you my boyfriend called in one time
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:22.840]  before like a couple months ago and he didn't get the chance well we appreciate him calling
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:27.480]  what's on your mind what's on my mind is i actually got to watch one of your videos where
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:33.240]  you're uh protesting the thumb scans yes a much skinnier do that in washington
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:38.280]  i a a a much skinnier alex jones yes they don't do that in my stay like i went to go
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:44.840]  i went to go get my license and i was expecting them after i saw the video for them to try and
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:50.440]  force me to do that and it doesn't exist here they were fighting the real id um
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.520]  i actually just woke up one of my friends he's actually i think he's just listening right now
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:03.480]  i said go here listen well say hi to him uh hi dame i hope you can hear it
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:09.320]  uh yeah no i actually like i didn't get to see i didn't know you had a radio show until
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:17.080]  a couple weeks ago really um yeah it sucks over in washington i'm 21 well shana let me explain
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:23.880]  what's happening under international treaty in 2000 signed in australia between uh i was over
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:28.920]  100 signatories i know that you can go pull it up if you want uh world id standards were set then
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:36.360]  then since the mid 90s every state in the union has gone with the federal standardization but
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:45.320]  the feds at that time said uh these the the swivable strip on the on the back uh a digital photo
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:52.600]  for face scan identification uh microchip and or thumbprint and the feds in the mandate for
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:57.400]  highway funds it's no law they just said if the states want their highway funds they must do that
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:03.720]  they had to adopt two of those oh yeah we have this trip in the barcode yeah so so now i forgot the
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:08.680]  barcode sorry now it was like five of them but you had to adopt half of them now they're saying you
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:14.200]  have to adopt all and so that's but i don't think our state's going to go through with that like
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:19.000]  and honestly about the protesting thing when i was in uh when i was in high school right around
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:24.760]  the time that bush was about to get reelected uh my teacher my government teacher would let us out
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:32.120]  of class so we could go hold up signs as a extra credit they said uh bush doesn't care about your
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:37.480]  children why would you vote for him well that's great there are a lot of teachers rebelling
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:44.040]  yeah our teacher got fired no talking about the new world order but i was like 17
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:51.400]  is that how you found out about the show uh i actually i found out about you because of that
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:55.240]  i didn't find out about your radio show until just recently because my boyfriend's like did
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:40:01.560]  you know alex showed us a radio show like i didn't know that and i was pretty oblivious
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:05.080]  to the radio show but when i when i started listening to it i've been really appreciative
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:10.360]  because like i wake up at nine o'clock in the morning to hear you well well you're very nice
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:16.280]  to do that anything um any other comments questions um yeah i'm really i'm really actually sad because
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:20.440]  i've been trying to get my mom into like listening and stuff and opening her mind and she just
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:26.520]  calls me blind and saying i'm just beating into the wants and dreams of conspiracy theorists that
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.440]  the government wants me to believe in how i don't actually look at what's really going on i'm like
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:36.840]  mom this is what's really going on so your mother my mom's 40 well she she's a probably a nice person
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:43.080]  and she no she's not well i mean she's not she's crazy and she yelled at me last night for trying
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:49.000]  to eat cheese really well that's too bad we'll slowly try to wake her up you can't you can't
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:53.720]  ever give up i know i'm glad i'm actually at least getting my friends into this because

[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:44.840]  the night of malta you have jesuit uh uh martin sheen and charlotte sheen or jesuit
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:50.040]  and you go to spirituallysmart.com and you'll see pictures of them at a jesuit retreat
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:55.560]  and you go in and find on the internet uh major general thomas harris's book
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:43:01.880]  uh uh concerning the assassination of abraham lincoln who he was on the military tribunal
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:07.720]  that tried mary sarat and john h sarat uh and the other people were involved with
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:12.200]  john most booth and the murder of abraham lincoln okay were controlled by jesuit priest
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:15.880]  who came in and out of her boarding house constantly that book was written back in the
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:21.320]  1800s well well well here's the deal and i appreciate your call i am not uh omni president
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:30.360]  all seeing know everything okay uh eric john felps i would get these threatening emails
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:33.560]  from different people and it's hard to go through all the emails over the years you
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:40.840]  better have this guy on or you're a uh what is it uh jesuit co agitator something like that
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:46.120]  and i think man that's kind of rude and that's not usually how i have some money on the show
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.680]  and so i kind of ignored it and uh just like the crowd that says i'm a massage and i pretty
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:44:00.920]  much ignore them and there's other people that say even more ridiculous things that i ignore and i
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:07.720]  have had all sorts of guests on tex mars galen ross who talked about the power of the vatican i mean
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:14.120]  i've had so many people on but i don't when i'm gonna have a guest on go let me see what their
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:21.000]  religion is like i had that the head of the uh you know tibetan human rights group on i mean
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:26.840]  that's a buddhist does that mean i'm a buddhist uh does that mean i'm endorsing the buddhist philosophy
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:36.200]  no it means i'm having an expert on who's got the context inside china i mean i bring you big
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:44.280]  guest and i know i'm telling the truth and i know these people that lie about me uh
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:51.880]  uh are deluded and i understand that once people slander and libel and lie about you
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:58.520]  that that that they're never gonna stop and so i don't care just like you know they're making a movie
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:05.560]  with jack black where i'm one of the main characters making fun of alex jones i love it
[1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:12.200]  i do want to take those people's pleasure away and i do want them to know that i enjoy every
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:18.520]  single bit of it because all you do send people to me and they have discernment and they know i'm a
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:25.000]  good guy uh now i've tried to you know when i get accused of something i got a bunch of financial
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:29.240]  news here i want to get to i said i'm trying to hurry today take a lot of calls but this is why i
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:33.480]  have to go off that format why i never can stay on that format of taking your calls because now i
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:41.800]  have to respond to this you say 15 minute rancor i have spent about two hours researching eric
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:48.200]  john phelps over the years and everything he has said is completely insane he says the sun
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:55.320]  orbits the earth and that we're on a pinwheel go and the earth goes up and down with the sun
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:46:00.040]  orbiting it on what did he call it i was rolling laughing a few months ago when somebody sent it
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:05.960]  to me it was uh was it uh see i don't have time i wish you know how to an extracurricular activity
[1:46:05.960 --> 1:46:12.200]  it's sick but i like watching this stuff i like being attacked i don't know why it's just funny
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:19.720]  and uh my favorite ones are the videos saying i'm a Scientologist i mean it is hilarious and it's
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:24.200]  just funny people in my family around the office know it's true and i'll take a break and try to
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:29.960]  find some of it so make more of it i like it and i'm i'm really serious i know you don't believe
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.280]  me you'll just make more and make my day but in a sick it's sick though it actually does hurt
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:41.320]  things overall so i shouldn't it's one of my few vices okay because it's funny but i mean uh what
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:46.360]  there's like a 10-part video on youtube where he's giving like a five-hour speech and man i'll get on
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:50.520]  the stair stepper but i haven't been having time i promise to watch all this stuff last week
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:54.280]  and then i just haven't had time to get back on the stair stepper but i think i'm gonna go home
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:58.760]  today instead of watching the final cut of Blade Runner i'm probably gonna go pull that video back
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:04.840]  up and keep watching it but he says they got anti-gravity machines and Nazis are flying around in
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:14.280]  spaceships and he says uh that the sun orbits the uh the earth and that it's on like a string
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:19.080]  and goes up to the tropic of cancer and there's a string the earth is on i mean you can't make this
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:25.800]  type stuff up you can't make this time this is the funniest stuff in fact maybe i was thinking about
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:31.240]  playing that clip on air but i just i just it gives total madness attention so i shouldn't do it
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:42.760]  look uh it's just hilarious folks it's just hilarious and what you've got is egomaniacs
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:49.960]  that are jealous of me that lie about me that's one camp and then you've got other people who mean
[1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:54.280]  really well and there's a few of them that actually hurts my feelings because i can tell man these
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:48:01.000]  people really believe what they're saying and that's not funny i mean phelps is an egomaniac
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:08.200]  just just just dripping with you know fake pietness and and and fake uh uh you know restraint and
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:14.440]  that he's humble i mean anyone with a discernment this is a raging egomaniac total nut i mean just
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:21.800]  just just off the charts insane uh and and and so it isn't about a controversy see they know
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:25.160]  they know and and this happened with so many others i ignored over the years but i just don't
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:29.720]  even care this is a case point example to educate you about distractions i mean uh
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:35.720]  a big talk show hosts like bogrides would haul off and start attacking me i wouldn't take the bait
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:41.560]  and then i would get their whole audience uh bill cooper just went nuts attacking me uh
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:46.920]  as an egomaniac didn't didn't attack him back got his whole audience which is good i'm not talking
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:55.000]  about ufo's and flying submarines like he was i'm talking about real stuff um people need to hear
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:01.480]  what i'm saying uh who else uh but there have been so many who attack me and i never take the bait
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:10.600]  i mean by never occasionally as an educational point i will uh get into it because it's important
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:15.720]  but somebody driving around in upstate new york somebody driving around in kansas city somebody
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:20.440]  driving around in north texas right now somebody driving around say listen to us on 1330 covers
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:28.040]  like a fourth of the state or k lbj 590 or 96.3 or 90.1 in austin they have no idea what we're
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:36.280]  even talking about that's why they call us nuts on a big major broadcast you talk about the dollar
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:40.600]  you talk about issues you talk about fema cams you talk about things that affect the people
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:46.040]  you talk about ideas of liberty so whether they're protestant or catholic or buddhist they can come
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:51.560]  together and agree on moving forward against tyranny but you have all these different sex
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:58.200]  of uh little niches of patriot groups who are doing it for the wrong reasons so they always
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:02.920]  want to say i've got all the answers i'm the one that's completely right i'm the only one
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:10.360]  and then it's all about them and everybody else is bad and then they minimize how big
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:15.640]  their group gets i mean if you want followers and folks you do the opposite you to be inclusive
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:21.240]  let's say that they don't understand that or know that um but i do bring on the good people
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:28.920]  here that that that that that do want to reach out that do want to wake people up um and there's
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:35.560]  so many of who are good and of course they all then get attacked but um this is not the grand
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:39.800]  inquisition i know mostly people are former catholics so they think that's what they're doing
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:45.640]  they're inquisiting me uh you know it's just an incredible distraction

[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.800]  then and then attack everybody else in the movement and it's an aggressive sick modern
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:21.400]  attitude towards attacking everyone that's why most businesses fail because they just
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:26.360]  are busy being negative and fighting and attacking everyone how about having the best product

[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:05.960]  now here's the news folks and it's serious this is afp us treasury chief says social
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:11.720]  security unsustainable us treasury secretary henry paulson said tuesday that america's social
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:19.160]  security program for the retired is financially unsustainable and needs an urgent overhaul
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:23.960]  paulson speaking after a government panel had completed its annual assessment of social
[2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:29.080]  security and medicare benefits program said waves of retiring americans threatened to
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:34.920]  soon deplete available funds stockpiled in the two programs as the baby boom generation
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:39.400]  moves into retirement these programs face progressively larger financial challenges
[2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:44.200]  paulson said the treasury secretary said the growing number of retirees and the program's
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:48.840]  rising costs can harm america's future prosperity of social security medicare are not overhauled
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:56.120]  or bolstered will stop there bolstered means more taxes for social security the government takes
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:04.600]  about eight percent of your total earnings if you were a seven eleven worker and invested at five
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:10.200]  percent yields a year on average you'd retire after thirty five years with about a million bucks
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.520]  with social security you're probably going to get about a hundred and fifty thousand paid out
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:21.800]  maybe if you're lucky from the time you retire at sixty three and you died seventy six
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:29.080]  and none of that even matters now because they've devalued social security by more than half
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:35.480]  in the last four years so this is all a moot point we'll discuss it get into gold exploding

[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:13.000]  inflation has been more than 50% in the last four years
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  so and that's accelerating that's that's getting worse by the minute it's deepening
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:26.440]  so someone getting a thousand dollars a month on social security is now getting the equivalent
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:34.200]  of buying power of five hundred dollars a month and there's no discussion about it the media and
[2:08:34.200 --> 2:08:40.440]  there's going to be a another at least 15% reduction in the next year maybe 20% inflation
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:45.640]  they're talking about even higher and then the next two years after that it's supposedly going to
[2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:50.680]  run up to 20 30% inflation running the dollar down to almost nothing that's what every forecaster
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:59.720]  we've had on has said you don't have to be a quantum mechanics physicist or a rocket scientist
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:09.080]  or a MIT mathematician to do the math there and so the treasury secretary is talking about this
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:13.800]  being a problem in a decade and how we need more taxes or how the or how the corporations
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:18.920]  need to get control of the there's been no money in social security since the mid 90s Clinton took
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:26.600]  it all and Clinton didn't balance any books he just quote didn't spend as much money it was as
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:33.000]  was in the budget the budget is what they're doing that year nothing to do with the debts the actual
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:44.760]  debts and obligations and so everybody feels like they're alone all these retirees who save
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:49.000]  their whole lives and that's being burned through right now because of devaluation they're not making
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:54.040]  any more money so probably a few investments and that's being eroded their social security check
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:03.880]  won't pay for anything the average social security recipients getting around 650 dollars a month
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:13.080]  you can pull it up at 650 something i saw it a few weeks ago i mean how do you live on 650 bucks
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:24.920]  come on come on and it's being devalued by 15 percent a year at least
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:34.120]  but no let's not talk about that let's talk about how blood drinking lizards secretly
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:38.760]  around the new world order and then everybody hears that and then serious people don't listen to us
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:44.520]  see what they do is they tag on flying saucers blood drinking lizards and all this other bull
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:51.000]  and all this esoteric stuff they tie all that into serious issues that people don't listen to us
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:53.800]  and that's the tactic
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:03.640]  gold rebounds on week dollar gold prices rebounded tuesday and into wednesday now jumping more than
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:08.920]  30 dollars is a falling dollar and a big drop in consumer confidence enhanced the allure precious
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:14.360]  metals as alternative investment when this came out it's at 15 it's more than 30 now
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:27.400]  we've got uh that going on gold sector lifted by booming price you see people had had to explain
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:32.040]  this simply said anderson tell will you explain that everybody knew last week gold was going to go
[2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:37.720]  down we shouldn't know how far down because the people that were in the market had had had bet
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:43.160]  in the futures market and in several other markets that was going to be a lot lower than it was so
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:50.120]  they had to pull out and so explain how that works to people said well it's as simple as this alex
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:53.560]  i mean i don't know if i couldn't tell you i'm in the market i couldn't tell you that at that
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:58.600]  moment gold was going to go down well i mean kitko was saying it yeah kitko was predicting it
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:02.920]  what was going on there is there's a lot of selling that was occurring mostly by the central banks
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:07.880]  to start things to tip it off but then when you when somebody enters into the futures market they
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:13.000]  have a long contract which means they're betting that gold is going to go up if gold goes the opposite
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:18.520]  direction they lose 10 times to every one dollar they invested and if they they only have so much
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:23.240]  money deposited to hold that contract and let's say you got a ten thousand dollar investment well
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:28.840]  if gold goes the wrong way two times the direction that that you have you know to cover your to cover
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:32.920]  your call you're gonna have to come up with the second ten thousand dollars and it's gone and
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:39.320]  last tuesday those contracts came up that was their window to jump out but now it has shot back up
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:45.640]  to above nine fifty today and this is a buying opportunity ladies and gentlemen the fundamentals
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:50.520]  is that gold is only going up all the mainstream analysts are admitting it should be at twenty
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:56.360]  two hundred plus for adjusted inflation for nineteen eighties last time yeah exactly alex i mean you
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:02.120]  can tell i mean the same conditions which created the market of a one thousand and thirty dollars
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:07.640]  an ounce gold still exists today as a matter of fact there are compounding problems so
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:12.120]  things have actually gotten a little worse not something else happened last week for a month
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:19.640]  the major asian gold buyers in china india and in the surrounding pacific realm got together
[2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:25.000]  a mass protest and refused to buy gold they've been doing that for several weeks then they had
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  to capitulate and rushed in for all-time record gold buys last week and this week yeah because
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  of the fact that they're able to buy it at a little bit better price plus also all those
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:39.480]  those long contracts that were forced to sell finally you know those that it takes a little
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:44.120]  bit to adjust that what's going on and then you find a floor you find a support level that was
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:49.400]  right around where is gold right now i'm ten right now gold is what is it nine fifty two fifty so
[2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:54.040]  right now gold is just coming right back up again it's it it was a little bit of a correction
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:58.920]  that market that that supply that was in the marketplace has been absorbed into the market
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:03.880]  the market is now pushing forward and we'll see higher prices and the fact that such a massive
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:07.880]  you know that they're secretive about how much they put but they admit that on a weekly basis
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:13.320]  they've been dumping at least tens of billions onto the market at below price uh to try to
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:19.320]  drive it down because gold and and dr roberts ron paul they all agree gold makes a weak dollar
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:26.520]  and currencies look bad and it's seen as a as a bellwether of inflation and they're really
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:31.240]  panicking they know when it went past a thousand that they and this is the news in the past for
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:37.000]  decades when they suppress gold it worked the last two years they've been failing and it's gone from
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:43.960]  300 an ounce to over a thousand there's no doubt go don't look at a week trend or a month trend
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:49.640]  look at a yearly trend look at a five-year trend look at a ten-year trend gold is going straight
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:57.160]  up this is a buying opportunity now it's already rising now ted i didn't ask you uh on break uh i
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:02.520]  know you locked in some gold at the price of nine ten for buyers do you have any of that gold left or
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:07.480]  has it gone up now that it went up no actually i am i'm working on the same prices that we talked
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:12.360]  about yesterday when we're on air i still have the british sovereigns they haven't changed right
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:19.880]  now they're 256 i also still have the frank coin at 204 both of those and we both have seen gold
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:25.560]  went up what 20 no i'm sorry 15 dollars since yesterday's time when we're on the air 15 bucks
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:30.520]  at increase this stuff is still the same price and that's because i did lock in at the lower level
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:36.760]  my trader mono she says you've got to watch out on these silver dollars supply is so thin on those
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:42.760]  but i'm still going to make the offer 665 dollars per roll of 20 and their uncirculated
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:48.360]  piece dollars now these are these are trading for 33 bucks a piece regular circulated silver
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:53.640]  dollars around 26 27 bucks right now when you can get them and that and they're they pretty much
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:59.480]  have been all sold out nobody's got supply i've got a little tiny supply of of silver that stuff
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:05.320]  is just impossible to get our hands on and the gold market starting to turn the same way and so
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.160]  yeah you're right alex if you're going to be getting involved in the precious metals market
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:13.080]  and i don't know how you couldn't because when you take a look at what the dollar is doing right
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:18.200]  now you know that deals doomed well by the way i talked to ted behind the scenes last week i tried
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:23.400]  to buy silver because you know i'm not a big wig i'm not a high roller and i just said hey i want
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:27.640]  some more of those half dollars and ted went back and looked at his vault and he said okay i got a
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:33.400]  bag and a half left that didn't already sold and he goes oops no there's another some orders here
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:39.160]  she just told me sorry all i've got is 400 dollars worth and i go well that's okay i just wanted to
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:43.960]  buy a thousand you know i'm a small-time buyer but the point here is is that i got a little box of
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:50.040]  silver coins last week and uh you know that's what i do every few months but but he's they're gone
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:54.600]  okay and then i went other places to try to find it i don't just buy from ted and they wanted huge
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:17:02.280]  premiums on half dollars and and and circulated dimes and i mean type in gold shortage type in
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:08.680]  excuse me silver shortage type it into google they're running out everywhere i mean this is insane
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:14.200]  and and they're and that's why they're trying to hold it down they saw the insane hysterical rally
[2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:20.600]  beginning two weeks ago that would have sent gold up to 15 1600 2000 mainstream analyst saying it
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:25.240]  was going to go there in the next few months and so they piled on with everything they had and they
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:31.080]  can't even hold it down for a week this is a buying opportunity tell them about the coins you've got
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:37.000]  ted again now we what we have right now is the british sovereign coin it's 256 dollars per coin
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:44.200]  that coin is a quarter ounce gold uh we also have the uh frank coin which is 204 both of those coins
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:51.080]  are are manufactured they're back in the 1940s uh so they're older material obviously they're not
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:55.640]  making them anymore finite supply we have a lot of people that are getting into gold and silver
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:18:01.720]  right now and they're just is not enough material to go around i wouldn't be surprised a bit if gold
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:06.200]  hits two thousand dollars an ounce you're going to try to buy items and you're just not going to be
[2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:10.120]  able to get what you want what do you mean i mean it's already hard to get silver yeah silver right
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:14.120]  now that that's already happening that's occurring right now just like you said if you type it into
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:19.160]  google i know i'm in the marketplace i know who all my competitors are everybody's talking about
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:25.080]  the same thing what are we going to do headline last week uh for mainstream news was on kitco
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:32.520]  12 major silver distributors sold out that's that's what's going on right now all the wholesalers
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:40.600]  right now are in such short supply um it's ridiculous given the numbers and it's 1-800-686-2237
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:49.400]  again that's 1-800-686-2237 and do it now alex the market is just not going to hold back gold
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:54.840]  is shot up with 20 bucks since yesterday yep that's what it's right now i'm looking at gold
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:18:59.880]  that it's it was up 1110 from this morning and about 20 bucks from yesterday is right
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:04.040]  you know and silver right now all i know is it was at 930 last night and now it's
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:08.680]  952 so i'm just i mean we're almost at 18 dollars and 50 cents on silver
[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:14.520]  you know and 950 bucks on gold i mean come on it's already come back 40 some dollars from
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.920]  its low it didn't take like you said not even a week what is it it's already come back three
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:29.640]  percent in two days yeah 1-800-686-2237-1800-686-2237-800-686-2237

[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:40.200]  everything right now and then the public doesn't read into the news just said look i'm not kidding

[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:55.400]  not exist and that ron paul is insane the trans texas corridor is billboards signs roads they

[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:58.120]  and the pentagon now we are all designated enemy combatants basically and it is the private
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:02.440]  bankers that own the military they own the whole system and the individual is the enemy
[2:35:03.160 --> 2:35:07.240]  they they've been admit new wars won't be against countries it's going to be against crowds and
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:13.560]  rioters and because they say the people are going to revolt and i know the average i mean you'll
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:19.640]  take my uh great uncle you know he was in uh in the army for like 20 years then he would then he
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:23.800]  worked for the post office and then for about six seven years you know that's the kind of job you
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:29.640]  get he went into corrections he's not a bad guy but the system itself he's retired now the system
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:34.520]  itself you know is really dangerous plus you're in there with a bunch of scum and so it becomes
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:41.000]  acceptable just like war turns people into bad folks it's just a nightmare well it is part of
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:47.240]  the brainwashing you know because it's part of part of the part of mental policy which everybody
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:53.400]  sees in the black and white in your outtakes at everybody that's available to the public
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:36:00.840]  and then uh that that's not how it's ran it's ran by the warden okay and the warden has his own
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:09.160]  policy every the warden runs the farm and it's what he says forget what's written and i'll tell
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:15.320]  you if you see the movie shawshank redemption uh in the past about half the time the wardens are
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:21.560]  that corrupt go ahead well it is and uh it's just a it's just a shame and and they teach you that
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:28.120]  they don't just come out right instead but all through the academy and then once you're out it's
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:35.880]  always us versus them and them are just fellow human beings and by the way now that's then what

[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:45.240]  that's what i do and if i if i deserve any credit it's that i mean i i almost cringe
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:51.640]  when somebody like willy nelson calls up and says i want to i've been listening to your show
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:57.640]  ten years i want to come on the show you know why cringe because it's going to drive the other talk
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:02.760]  show host mad with envy and some listeners are going to go crazy thinking i'm a movie star or
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:09.320]  something uh and um but then i think no this will really get attention for 911 truth plus i like
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:20.280]  willy nelson and uh so i'll go ahead and have willy nelson on and you know i've been a nice guy
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:24.440]  i mean i remember a whole time i grew up and then when i was in this movement people would act like
[2:41:24.440 --> 2:41:28.760]  they were my friend they do aggressive things to me or backstabbing things to me and i'd put up with
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:34.600]  it and and they would smile at me with that fake look of sardonic elitism now i don't put up with
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:41.160]  that anybody i associate with me screws me in any way i never talked to him again
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:49.080]  but then there's a frustration of i can't get him out of my life they're always there sucking off of
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:55.480]  me always there creeping around using my name always using my show to build what they do on my back
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:03.560]  so i try to be a moral upstanding person that's how the world works and then well what are you
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.720]  going to do make it you know you got to make a compromise gotta leave people alone you can't
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:14.440]  tell the listeners what i really think of people believe me i mean i was one inch a few
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:19.560]  minutes ago from doing it i just may i just may do a whole show i tell you what i think about
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:26.520]  everybody only because it might just be healthy to do because i'll tell you right now i'm pure
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:33.320]  and by pure i'm pure at the level of i mean what i'm doing and i'm trying to do it for the right
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:38.120]  reasons now all of my works are as dirty rags
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:46.280]  and i got a lot of wickedness in me let's not let's not but that that that is not at my core
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:56.280]  i got a lot of wickedness in me ladies and gentlemen we all do but that is not at my core
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:07.480]  my core loves little babies and puppy dogs and beautiful sculptures and beautiful women not
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:13.640]  not for sex but just to behold their beauty now i i am a good person a nurtured person a loving
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:20.280]  person and i've done everything i've done for the good of others because that's what i enjoy that's
[2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:29.080]  what i've always done but i've also learned not to give people multiple chances to push me around
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:37.960]  life is too short and the backstabbing uh larceness treacherous stuff i've seen is
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:43.000]  unbelievable but i know you've seen that in daily life you've seen that in business you've seen
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:48.040]  that in relationships yourselves and the world is getting worse but don't ever let it get you down
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:52.840]  and don't ever think because other people are cheating you should cheat i see that a lot well
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:58.600]  my wife cheated on me so you know now i cheat on her and it doesn't mean any of us are perfect

[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  of quack nutrition and you know magic cure stuff from these advertisers
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:43.320]  but then still i have to be associated with other shows and people that don't turn it down
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:49.000]  i have to be associated with people that have backstab me talk crap about me
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:54.440]  and then run around and say oh alex is bad he doesn't associate with us why don't you look
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:45:00.920]  in the dirty mirror at at at the reason i don't yeah i noticed the people that do all this bad
[2:45:00.920 --> 2:45:08.520]  stuff they never take responsibility for the things they have done that's just like the government
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:13.560]  in fact before i go back to calls i want to play some of these clips the it's five minutes long
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:19.400]  and it's new york a few days ago these peaceful tibetans are walking along they're about a hundred
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:23.880]  yards from the front of the un building i've been there many times demonstrating and videotaping
[2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:29.240]  myself there's always groups out there protesting and the police run up you hear them saying
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.080]  you get to listen carefully on the actual video at info wars dot com and prison pointed dot com
[2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:37.400]  i don't know if it'll come across on air or even if we can play at all but they say do you have a
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:43.800]  permit do you have a permit and the people are all jacked up they're peaceful monks but
[2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:49.640]  they don't you know they are accustomed to the communist chinese trying to stop them and they're
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:54.760]  gonna protest so they march past the cops the cops start shoving them the monks pull back
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:45:59.800]  keep marching they get to the front more cops pull up violently pull their cars up in front
[2:45:59.800 --> 2:46:05.880]  of everybody they pull out the metal butons the extendable butons and they start beating i mean
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:12.520]  just waylay and full power whacking people with metal butons and then the cops run to the
[2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:20.360]  camera man and they say we're we're gonna kill you the camera man pulls back and then what blew
[2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:24.120]  me away was i don't know 30 40 percent of the comments i mean i went through a bunch of pages
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:28.440]  of it we're seeing good good for the cops they didn't follow orders they were yelling
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:32.840]  the cops have all got their tasers out their taser and people
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:41.800]  people and the the Tibetan women are crying just like China just like China
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:48.840]  does that cop think his pension fund is they want martial law cops so they can take the pension
[2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:53.320]  funds they're the pension funds have already been spent by almost every fortune 500 the
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:59.720]  social security's been gone since 96 the reason they're training you no protest and microwave
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:05.880]  and and and audio cannons is because they because they're gonna hurt everybody don't you understand
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:11.480]  that they're gonna hurt you and you just look in the mirror when all this happens it's the same thing
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:17.240]  and they train the cops you gotta be in control you gotta be in control you can't put up with
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:22.360]  this you can't you know they gotta have permits and so that's their excuse you don't have a permit
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:27.160]  Austin just said you have to have a permit they just lost another lawsuit two days ago
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:33.720]  Austin doesn't care they'll just keep doing the same policy and keep paying out 300 100,000
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:38.280]  20,000 I was looking at the different suits they've lost I think the last one was $100,000
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:45.080]  and was multiple counts of it I know the 27 people the $100,000 lawsuits plus that's what the state
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:50.600]  usually gives out plus in 2000 for banning protests around the governor's mansion
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:48:01.640]  I mean Lee I mean I when Austin cops walked up to me last time I said you've lost a bunch
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:06.280]  of lawsuits what are you doing saying I can't stand here with with signs saying Ron Paul
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:12.040]  and they said we're gonna arrest you it's all on video put it up on YouTube and I just said I
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  can't believe you I was treating with respect being friendly and after that I just said you
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:22.440]  are degenerate scum and I said you go ahead and arrest me and you just better make it good
[2:48:22.440 --> 2:48:28.680]  because I am gonna sue you and again you think and I said you think I want to spend 10 15
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:33.960]  $20,000 dragging you through the process you'll probably lose but it doesn't matter
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:46.440]  it's you you're the one jumping out in front of a bus you're the one doing wrong don't make me do this
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:50.600]  and then I saw sergeants telling captains man come on they got a right
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:56.280]  maybe 20 yards away you can watch the lips moving on the video because we're videotaping
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:00.120]  going I don't think we should and guys throwing their arms up because I told them I said I'm
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:06.920]  gonna sue all of you don't do it you know you've lost lawsuits might have been some Tibetan that
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:10.680]  didn't speak good English I started yelling back at him it had been over man that it tasered me
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:17.880]  and I said it many times that wasn't some chest beating victory that I had to back the cops off
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:24.600]  like a bunch of wolves with a torch around the campfire their eyes coming up out of the dark
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:30.920]  there wasn't a victory it was sick you think I like messing with police you think I like rubbing
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:40.520]  the nose of 150 cops and riot gear and beating them these are aggressive tough guys they like
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:47.880]  to knock heads you think I like having to challenge them and threaten them I have to and now I have
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:56.680]  to drive around in this town now I have to be around to my family does and don't worry they're
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:02.440]  gonna win in the end all you that want to see me fall all you want to see me torn to pieces
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:07.000]  all the other talk show hosts all the cops people in this movement all of you you're gonna get to
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:13.400]  probably see me torn to pieces probably sooner rather than later and you think you win but you
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:19.640]  don't because I was always real I always stood for what was right I never compromised I never
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:26.280]  surrendered and I went in the end and this idea wins and the good people out there we outnumber
