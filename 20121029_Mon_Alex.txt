[00:43.480 --> 00:48.000]  ventura who had an interview in about a month is going to be joining us to talk
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.040]  about a cornucopia of important news and information from the election to the
[00:53.040 --> 00:57.360]  premiere of his third season tv show coming up in a week and a half the day
[00:57.360 --> 01:05.320]  after the election actually to his lawsuit and so much more you know against
[01:05.320 --> 01:09.920]  that navy seal that said he punched him out boy i've been told some details the
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.680]  depositions but i'm not allowed to talk about it yet it will certainly be news
[01:13.680 --> 01:20.400]  making though jesse ventura joining us in the second hour today and then a
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.560]  little bit in the third hour we're going to look at a saccharine and aspartame
[01:23.560 --> 01:28.800]  compared with sucralose and his greater weight gain adult wister rats a
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.320]  similar total caloric intake levels there's a whole bunch of studies this is
[01:32.320 --> 01:35.860]  a new one published in the national institutes of health that's loving
[01:35.860 --> 01:40.320]  government website that's they know that they know it burns out your pancreas
[01:40.320 --> 01:44.280]  they've known what aspartame did when they tried to get it approved three
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.600]  times in the 70s but it killed a lot of the monkeys they gave it to brain
[01:48.600 --> 01:52.680]  tumors you name it so they couldn't get it approved until donald rumsfeld got
[01:52.680 --> 01:59.200]  it approved in 1981 as the head of monsanto because he was deep in the
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.280]  l reagan administration coke is it coke is it so i think we're going to be
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.080]  going over that a bit now obviously ladies and gentlemen i cannot do my
[02:09.080 --> 02:12.600]  customary thing of getting into the top stories 30 minutes into the show i've
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.200]  got to get into this when we come back and as you know thursday and friday i
[02:17.200 --> 02:21.560]  hope this was only hype sunday yesterday on the sunday show four to six
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.480]  central i hoped it was only hype but they've now canceled voting in mariland
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.040]  and other areas on the east coast that's how the washington post here and
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.880]  obama as was easy to predict is is canceling the campaign to defend america
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.600]  from the storm so he can look presidential and romney is trying to
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.920]  act like he's the president as well so it's all about acting like you are
[02:44.920 --> 02:54.080]  presidential to everyone and it's on and i had scott stevens the meteorologist
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.760]  on yesterday he said this storm looks absolutely manipulated they know they've
[02:58.760 --> 03:04.280]  known since 1967 they can create kill weakened strengthened steer hurricanes
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.000]  this one is acting very very strange it's the storm of a century and i mean

[10:04.600 --> 10:08.920]  standard reports and are issuing more threats to kill the president or the
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.880]  the person running for president so that's what's going on here and you
[10:15.880 --> 10:19.240]  can't threaten a presidential candidate like that and it just shows selective
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.200]  enforcement here because they don't want to become a news issue with people
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.200]  being arrested absolutely amazing that this is going on now I have another
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.160]  article here in my stack Americans riot over baseball how will an election
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.600]  or a hurricane again how about an election or a hurricane and that dovetails
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.680]  with Paul Watson's article that just went up at prisonplanet.com info wars
[10:43.680 --> 10:49.600]  net and info wars.com why do we have the three main big sites it's because we
[10:49.600 --> 10:52.600]  have hackers routinely try to bring down the sites and problems so having
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.560]  different systems means it's a form of redundancy it's like three aircraft
[10:56.560 --> 11:00.840]  carriers instead of one and the big mother ship the big capital ship the
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.240]  flagships info wars and there's prisonplanetinfo wars.net and some
[11:05.240 --> 11:09.120]  other sites that are backups prisonplanet.tv is the media video

[11:26.200 --> 11:28.560]  down for no reason but they're going after the big one they gave us notice
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.120]  today that we're not allowed we're gonna have an article later to put out a
[11:32.120 --> 11:37.960]  graphic that says alciata and show a picture of bin Laden and they said that
[11:37.960 --> 11:41.440]  is unacceptable and hate speech we're gonna have an article on it and that one
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.200]  more time our site shut down people say oh well that's just Facebook you know
[11:46.200 --> 11:49.320]  it's a private company you don't have to be on there folks they advertises a

[11:53.480 --> 11:58.920]  worth to YouTube to Facebook they advertise it and it's false advertising
[11:58.920 --> 12:03.560]  when we don't have any porn any calls to violence nothing and they're telling
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.560]  us they're gonna shut our site down we got notice that they said you get your
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.080]  account in order one more thing you're gone your this is this is this violates
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.120]  community guidelines and hatefulness we've got their notice we're gonna put
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.120]  it's very hateful very hateful to point out bin Laden was CIA Tim Osmond code
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.400]  name very hateful to point out they're using al-qaeda and Libby in Syria against
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.120]  those countries I mean now if you don't support al-qaeda you're unamerican well
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.200]  you know what then I'm unamerican I don't support al-qaeda people are like is
[12:33.200 --> 12:39.600]  this is a joke al-qaeda is horrible no the government runs al-qaeda I'm sick of it
[12:39.600 --> 12:43.800]  they use it to take our liberties and I'm tired of it they hired the group for
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.400]  security in Benghazi that killed the ambassador that group is now confirmed
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.360]  what we knew when happened but it's now confirmed of course they couldn't call in
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.320]  back up to fight their own security detail that was the group they hired and
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.840]  a subgroup of that group of the the out-of-control jihadis out of Saudi
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.280]  Arabia that have taken over Benghazi was the first country area they took over
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.880]  in Libya before they launched the overall overthrow of Libya itself and the
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.320]  ethnic cleansing of blacks and the rest of it I've got all this world news it
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.440]  just drives me crazy to know that's why we've got to have twitter.com forward
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.960]  slash real Alex Jones got to follow us there that's why we got to beef that up
[13:19.960 --> 13:23.080]  we've got to get more Facebook's we've got to get more YouTube channels all
[13:23.080 --> 13:29.040]  those HD channels go the Alex Jones channel with 243 million views on it
[13:29.040 --> 13:34.840]  we've got a bunch of other HG channels now that people need to subscribe to so
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.760]  that if they knock out our big channel we've got those others and they sure
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.280]  there's a bunch of other fan channels with over 400 something million last time
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.280]  I checked views but those aren't channels we run we've started a bunch of
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.480]  others because it's like whack-a-mole they're trying to trying to knock us
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.480]  down and we're just popping more moles up on them and again I want to thank all
[13:54.480 --> 13:56.920]  you for spreading the word about the show but don't just think it's always
[13:56.920 --> 13:59.960]  going to be here don't just think that the system doesn't want this shut down
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.520]  we don't make a big deal out of the constant persecution that goes on behind
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.520]  the scenes trying to get our eyes off the price and it didn't work it
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.200]  whenever I get attacked we just grow another tentacle I'm like a starfish
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.680]  we're like a Hydra here you cut one head off to sprout that's always been our
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.400]  rule you know is is that when we attack get attacked we only get stronger that
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.600]  which does not kill you only makes you stronger don't agree a lot with what
[14:24.600 --> 14:28.000]  Frederick Nietzsche said but that's certainly true that which does not kill
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.200]  you only makes you stronger but we've got to resist this we've got to become
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.120]  resilient we've got to say no now I'm gonna get into the hurricane that could
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.400]  suspend the election postpone the election it's all unfolding it's it's
[14:41.400 --> 14:46.920]  totally insane and then we're going to get into what's happening with the
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.760]  election itself but here's the article at info wars dot com and prison planet
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.800]  dot com that they do not want you to see every day now we're able to put news
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.040]  out first and it becomes the big news story of the day and so we're able more
[15:02.040 --> 15:06.200]  and more to set the agenda and the system does not like that they don't
[15:06.200 --> 15:11.360]  like the fact that drudge report can set the agenda even more than we can just so
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.760]  happens on many things we overlap that we want freedom but the point is there's
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.040]  not many out outlets that can do this and and and it's an incredible
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.120]  responsibility folks that I have and that you have to make sure while we're
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.120]  able to still open fire on the globalist in the info war while we're still in
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.360]  this fight we got a slam shells into the breach slam the door shut on the

[17:17.560 --> 17:21.960]  go out and rob and let me tell you Watson there's so many of these he can't
[17:21.960 --> 17:25.480]  even track all these tweets and things and YouTube videos and Facebook's and
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.280]  let me tell you these are established accounts as the weekly standards
[17:28.280 --> 17:31.680]  reporting people threatened to kill Romney and loot none of them are getting
[17:31.680 --> 17:34.440]  in trouble that we know of the secret services that they were visiting people
[17:34.440 --> 17:37.800]  you know what we went to these accounts they're up there threatening anew
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.400]  ladies and gentlemen let me tell you something's going on here this has got
[17:41.400 --> 17:45.840]  Justice Department protection just like fast and furious and it will cause
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.080]  division in this country that could be the false flag like Doug Hagman said
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.400]  two months ago on this show and he's the guy that told us about the prepper but
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.960]  not being able to fly five days six days four was in the news I just wish his
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.480]  intel was turning out wrong it's not and he said that all the Justice
[18:01.480 --> 18:05.880]  Department's planning race riot type stuff and he said and he has that
[18:05.880 --> 18:11.600]  directly from next to the inner circle of big sis and her gals you know the
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.560]  crazed ones up there up top running around doing all the crazy stuff I
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.000]  wanted to mention on air on the family show you know they've been resigning
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.800]  they're not countersuing people suing them that tells me it's all true just
[18:22.800 --> 18:26.040]  imagine up there with those crazed women just attacking those men savagely
[18:26.040 --> 18:30.840]  but they're not even women the point is is that all of this is going on it's
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.880]  like Rome and this is the plan and and and more and more it's coming into view
[18:36.880 --> 18:40.480]  because we're a weekend and a half into people saying they're gonna kill Romney
[18:40.480 --> 18:48.760]  and nothing's been done and again folks I I've made mild comments before about
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.840]  you know Obama is a traitor and a piece of garbage I mean that's true saying the
[18:52.840 --> 18:56.760]  UN's over our military and I've had Secret Service show up here repeatedly
[18:56.760 --> 19:04.960]  over and over again in my face with guns on their sides FBI you name it ATF

[26:26.680 --> 26:33.280]  just goes on and on and on and on many of the tweets are written in such a way
[26:33.280 --> 26:36.880]  as to suggest that looting under some circumstances is justifiable none of the
[26:36.880 --> 26:39.800]  tweets express any concern at law enforcement or National Guard response
[26:39.800 --> 26:43.760]  they'll probably be joining in with them please the police in some areas looters
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.560]  habitually hijacked actually police in most areas don't engage in that looting
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.080]  habitually hijacks hurricanes and other extreme weather events to carry out
[26:52.080 --> 26:55.440]  their criminal acts during her a day in Katrina the practice became so common
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.760]  place that police officers were ordered not to stop citizens from ransacking
[26:58.760 --> 27:03.920]  stores so then the cops joined in why not police were also caught on camera
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.560]  looting Walmart store and young jewelry stores but got away with it claiming they
[27:07.560 --> 27:10.640]  had received permission from superiors to take necessity for themselves like
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.680]  Xboxes looters also pillaged abandoned houses during her attain Irene despite

[27:30.560 --> 27:33.520]  are already expressing fears that widespread a member in New York they
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.720]  would never stop women being raped in the park by hundreds of men with
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.440]  helicopters filming it just pathetic the New York police for example of what
[27:41.440 --> 27:46.080]  not to be commentators are already expressing fears that widespread looting
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.200]  is almost inevitable when the Frankenstorm hits later tonight it's all
[27:50.200 --> 27:53.880]  anecdotal at this point but the crime reports following her attain Katrina and
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.920]  Irene are any indication the East Coast is in for a crime wave post Sandy writes
[27:58.920 --> 28:02.760]  Business Insider Abby Rogers as reported last week supporters of Barack Obama
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.320]  are also flooding Twitter with threats to riot and stoke racial violence if

[28:47.240 --> 28:52.000]  supposed to go well that's okay plus the last thing I want is for anything to
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.840]  happen to Obama or Mitt Romney to globalist Stooges to globalist puppets to
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.000]  globalist frontmen that would make them angels instead of the little globalist
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.640]  they are but Twitter users who threaten Romney's life remain active weekly
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.520]  standard breaks it down more than a dozen Twitter accounts that were used as a
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.360]  medium to publicly threaten Republican candidate Mitt Romney's life well actually

[33:29.480 --> 33:37.920]  hurricane it'll Diablo Frankenstorm as well here right now and again if you
[33:37.920 --> 33:45.040]  just joined us I am Alex Jones your host and I'm a throwback I like George
[33:45.040 --> 33:48.520]  Washington I like Thomas Jefferson I like the Second Amendment I like private
[33:48.520 --> 33:53.800]  property I like privacy I like due process I like justice I kind of want you
[33:53.800 --> 33:56.760]  know due process and to have some protections instead of living like most
[33:56.760 --> 34:00.280]  other countries with horrible corrupt tyrannies who can just arrest you and
[34:00.280 --> 34:03.720]  disappear you into a black torture dungeon so criminals can have their way
[34:03.720 --> 34:09.640]  with you I tend to like the wealth that freedom produces I tend to like us
[34:09.640 --> 34:13.920]  people being promoted because they are dynamic and have energy and have
[34:13.920 --> 34:17.280]  something to offer to the species instead of a bunch of bullies getting
[34:17.280 --> 34:22.640]  together and forming gangs in government and organizing themselves against
[34:22.640 --> 34:28.040]  the population and attacking virtue see evil always attacks virtue because it's
[34:28.040 --> 34:33.720]  threatened by it because virtue gets in its way and it's ugly to ugliness
[34:33.720 --> 34:39.120]  beauty is ugly to the ugly and reminds it of how ugly it is and I don't mean
[34:39.120 --> 34:44.400]  physical ugliness I mean ugliness of the heart Jesse Ventura governor of the
[34:44.400 --> 34:47.560]  Minnesota former governor will be joining us coming up we'll talk about
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.440]  the hurricane the election a lot more whether his lawsuit is TV show it's
[34:51.440 --> 34:54.800]  gonna be a good interview because usually when we have him on I'm known
[34:54.800 --> 34:57.400]  about seven years now I'm gonna be pretty good friends with him it's when
[34:57.400 --> 35:01.560]  he's doing a media junket though he does it like in you know sets because he's
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.600]  kind of over being in the media kind of over being a celebrity and quite
[35:04.600 --> 35:08.000]  frankly doesn't really like doing it he likes writing books about the New World
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.200]  Order and things because he can really lay it out but when he's the middle of
[35:12.200 --> 35:15.400]  a media junket you know he's he's done probably done 50 interviews he's burned
[35:15.400 --> 35:18.680]  out but the times I've gotten him when he's fresh or when he's coming out to
[35:18.680 --> 35:24.080]  visit me in Austin dynamic stuff so he's always good interview but he he's gonna
[35:24.080 --> 35:31.000]  have a lot to say coming up okay again our top story at info wars.com and
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.200]  prisonplanet.com is gangs plan hurricane looting spree via Twitter New York
[35:37.200 --> 35:41.720]  National Guard to protect against looting and Paul Watson's also added the
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.560]  history of people organized in criminal activities they use Twitter to organize
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.440]  in fact I forgot about that I got a call Watson have him add that the burning
[35:51.440 --> 35:55.920]  and rioting all over England was organized on Twitter I totally forgot
[35:55.920 --> 36:02.160]  that I was talking about this you know the skateboarder yuppie kids doing it
[36:02.160 --> 36:08.240]  just what a week and a half ago and again this is a phenomenon of cost the
[36:08.240 --> 36:14.480]  entire world so I'm calling Watson right now I just got him online hey Watson
[36:14.480 --> 36:19.080]  I'm on air you there okay listen obviously you know we've got the top
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.120]  drudge link on the right hand side gangs plan hurricane looting spree via
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.400]  Twitter and I've got the IT crew in there literally like Scotty in the engine
[36:27.400 --> 36:31.560]  room trying to trying to keep the info wars up right now because drudge is
[36:31.560 --> 36:34.800]  getting particular high levels of traffic right now I think is the hurricane
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.520]  the election it looks like we got about 50,000 people a minute coming into the
[36:38.520 --> 36:41.680]  site so we're gonna try to keep that up and the site goes down and they
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.320]  obviously we've got prisonplanet.com as a backup and prisonplanet.tv but Watson
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.520]  I forgot I want you to add this I know you added some of the other rioting about
[36:50.520 --> 36:54.160]  how they use Twitter to coordinate the burning and rioting for two weeks in
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.040]  England obviously you were in the middle of that because you're in London right
[36:58.040 --> 37:03.160]  now or outside London can you add that to your article please I think that's
[37:03.160 --> 37:08.640]  pertinent don't you yeah because you have a precedent for this I'm really
[37:08.640 --> 37:11.960]  worried about this Watson this is really starting to look like it's all been
[37:11.960 --> 37:17.720]  engineered all right we'll talk to you soon good job thank you no time to do
[37:17.720 --> 37:20.600]  that off air we'll just do it on air ladies and gentlemen total transparency

[37:26.360 --> 37:33.320]  linkedin red at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com but if the sites go down I'm
[37:33.320 --> 37:35.720]  sure everybody else has already grabbed it and put it on their site the site's
[37:35.720 --> 37:42.760]  up right now now continuing I was back in the engine room during the break boy I
[37:42.760 --> 37:48.800]  tell you it's crazy reality is unbelievably energizing but also
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.200]  overwhelming and exhausting all at the same time if you know what I mean
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.760]  reality is well there's no rest for those of us that try to live in it as I
[37:56.760 --> 38:02.360]  once said so gangs plan hurricane looting spree via Twitter and that story
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.040]  going mega viral right now tweeted out to everybody we've sent it out at real
[38:06.040 --> 38:12.680]  Alex Jones on Twitter as as well by the way mystery Labor Department may
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.160]  delay jobs numbers until after the election kind of like you're trying to
[38:16.160 --> 38:18.720]  delay the fact that they got caught lying about what really happened in
[38:18.720 --> 38:26.200]  Benghazi until after the election and let's go ahead and get into what's
[38:26.200 --> 38:33.920]  happening now with the old hurricane US stock markets closed due to hurricane
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.840]  at CNBC US stock index futures fell on Monday with investors continuing to
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.520]  fret about the weak revenue picture developed for corporate America and the
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.080]  US cash equity markets will be closed in a huge hurricane expected to hit the US
[38:48.080 --> 38:53.400]  east coast sometime this morning into Tuesday morning and the real problem
[38:53.400 --> 38:57.960]  will find out by Wednesday will it completely flood everything national
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.600]  weather service Sandy a very dangerous storm hurricane Sandy is a huge storm
[39:02.600 --> 39:13.520]  with a diameter diameter I can't read of 700 miles wide a tropical storm wind
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.840]  feel over 400 miles wide meaning that it will impact a very large number of
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.400]  people for an extended period of time and drop five to ten inches of rain over
[39:23.400 --> 39:27.680]  well hundreds and hundreds of square miles so there's that report CBS news
[39:27.680 --> 39:33.240]  Obama campaign fears impact of Hurricane Sandy yeah I bet the Obama campaign does
[39:33.240 --> 39:38.080]  because now Obama gets to fly around and act presidential and I told you Friday
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.360]  and Sunday he would say I can't campaign I've got to go fly around in a
[39:42.360 --> 39:46.160]  helicopter and the face of the storm me and like a reporter out there blowing
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.360]  around in the wind and in Romney try to act presidential too and this is all
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.240]  part of this grandstanding a top aide to Barack Obama voice fears last night
[39:55.240 --> 39:59.760]  that hurricane Sandy could hurt the president's reelection chances by
[39:59.760 --> 40:03.800]  reducing turnout as the impending storm forced both candidates to cancel
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.400]  campaign stops Republican challenger Mitt Romney received good news and two
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.320]  key swing states folks this is gonna if they postpone the election it's gonna
[40:12.320 --> 40:19.400]  hurt Romney because and then or it could be contested oh my gosh Republican
[40:19.400 --> 40:22.920]  challenger Mitt Romney received good news and two key swing states winning the
[40:22.920 --> 40:26.320]  endorsement of Iowa's main newspaper in Des Moines Register dad he's pulling
[40:26.320 --> 40:33.520]  ahead in most polls in Colorado and in Ohio and so it's kind of interesting
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.440]  just to know what flavor of new poison we may get if Romney actually gets in
[40:37.440 --> 40:40.240]  there it's just kind of interesting oh a new a new globalist puppet a new
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.200]  management team and trying Obama in a newly released poll in all important
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.600]  Ohio so there it goes the latest Franken storm video of 1938 nor Easter that
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.520]  ravaged New England that's in this week.com we'll show some of that later
[40:56.520 --> 40:59.720]  if you're watching on prison planet TV a federal office is closed because of
[40:59.720 --> 41:06.120]  Sandy all over the East Coast the office of personal management says federal
[41:06.120 --> 41:12.040]  offices will be closed to the public Monday so that continues there doesn't
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.920]  even really say exactly how many areas of the East Coast. Sandy a nightmare for
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.360]  flyers his airlines ground 9,000 flights you know we didn't do this on purpose
[41:22.360 --> 41:27.120]  Dan Badandi left what last Thursday one of our great reporters who left behind
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.840]  his wife and one-year-old son in Rhode Island radio talk show host up there
[41:32.840 --> 41:38.240]  that a lot of heart done a lot of great reporting and so we've hired him and
[41:38.240 --> 41:40.720]  he's down here and hopefully the New Year's gonna move his family down here
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.520]  but he went back for a week to visit his family and his one-year-old son that
[41:46.520 --> 41:50.480]  really wants to see daddy and he's there in Rhode Island I mean you talk about
[41:50.480 --> 41:53.960]  the middle of the hurricane when it hits that is smack dab you know out in the
[41:53.960 --> 41:59.960]  ocean that's why it's an island I'm pretty smart aren't I folks anyways the
[41:59.960 --> 42:05.000]  point is I'm like it's an island it's called Rhode Island I always point out
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.880]  the obvious that's how my little brain works but he's gonna be able to report
[42:08.880 --> 42:11.720]  for us maybe we'll get him on the nightly news tonight I think we should get
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.720]  Dan on how people are responding the the preparations the boarding up of things
[42:15.720 --> 42:19.520]  then get him on the show tomorrow for like 30 minutes in case a little bit
[42:19.520 --> 42:25.200]  early case the power goes out I mean who knows what's gonna I think he has a
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.440]  computer at Skype to he's pretty pretty tech savvy so we'll get him on via
[42:28.440 --> 42:32.640]  video Skype and who knows he might not be able to come back for a few weeks and
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.280]  the power goes out the number of flight cancellations resulting from hurricane
[42:38.280 --> 42:44.440]  Sandy is now pushing 9,000 according to flight aware flight tracking service
[42:44.440 --> 42:50.640]  and the number 8,962 as of 9 a.m. this morning appears certain to grow of the
[42:50.640 --> 42:54.160]  next 24 hours the Sandy moves offshore I know what you're talking about power
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.480]  being off the phone lines are usually still up that was was that the point
[42:58.480 --> 43:04.160]  you were making CJ was that okay again went over my head as well
[43:04.160 --> 43:07.720]  continuing most of those are my head in like a minute later and then I get it
[43:07.720 --> 43:13.480]  panic buying grips the East Coast mad rush or supplies ahead of mega storm
[43:13.480 --> 43:17.720]  we're always saying have water filters like the beautiful propure travel that
[43:17.720 --> 43:23.000]  I use right here it's on my right here on my desk I mean I'm always saying be
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.680]  prepared have storeable food have firearms have flashlights if you can if
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.080]  you live in a big city try to move out on the edge of the countryside and
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.080]  commute in show that you got neighbors that are more self-sufficient
[43:33.080 --> 43:37.720]  everybody's got guns and the media calls that fear mongering to
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.440]  strategically relocate you know strategic relocation we have the new
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.120]  film out by the way a plug for that the new Alex Jones film with Joel Scalzen
[43:45.120 --> 43:50.680]  it's three hours of content a two-hour film about an hour of extras but the
[43:50.680 --> 43:55.600]  point is is that this this film isn't about just if there was ever a nuclear
[43:55.600 --> 44:01.200]  war it's every micro region as the book with color maps breaks down the safest
[44:01.200 --> 44:06.200]  areas in every region according to region according to country with economic
[44:06.200 --> 44:14.040]  breakdowns social breakdowns I mean the Joel Scalzen is no slouch he has really
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.840]  broken it down he knew everything about the Hill Country where I lived he knew
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.800]  all the demographics he'd be built a whole bunch of bunkers for you know
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.600]  Richie Richie is out there so I mean he really knows what he's doing and we
[44:26.600 --> 44:30.800]  carry his book discounted with the film strategic relocation that the film
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.600]  breaks down a lot of angles that aren't in the book and it's all available at
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.540]  infowarstore.com also the secure home by Joel and Scalzen that's like the best
[44:40.540 --> 44:44.120]  Scheller and that's what the major architects all use he's been
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.880]  publishing this for decades the third edition architectural design construction
[44:48.880 --> 44:51.880]  remodeling of self-sufficient residencies and high security retreats
[44:51.880 --> 44:57.800]  she he's got stuff for people that have no money basic stuff of how to protect
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.280]  yourself more right up a continuum to like do you want to be underground
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.000]  bulletproof hidden and being able to stand the ground for a year if you have
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.360]  to people say oh I'd rather just die really they folks if there's a nuclear
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.640]  war most the radiation's gone in a month if they air burst the weapons if they
[45:14.640 --> 45:18.480]  hit the ground boy you're in big trouble I don't want to go into the whole
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.320]  reason for that the point is you can look it up yourself that the globalist
[45:22.320 --> 45:26.000]  are building giant bunkers everywhere for multi-year stays underground like
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.600]  they never had before and we break down to the film geopolitically why he thinks
[45:31.600 --> 45:37.440]  that so it's an economic fusion with a historical fusion with a global
[45:37.440 --> 45:41.280]  breakdown of every continent most the major nations the best places to move
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.880]  if you're gonna leave the United States and he's lived in these countries this
[45:44.880 --> 45:48.640]  guy's lived all over the world he was a Marine Corps fighter pilot in the
[45:48.640 --> 45:54.280]  Vietnam War I mean he's had a long life Joel Scalzen very interesting person and
[45:54.280 --> 45:58.000]  I've done a lot of strategic relocation research outside of his book and when I
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  read this a couple years I'm like my how does he know that because he's built
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.240]  I'm not gonna it's it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of retreats all
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.280]  over the United States in every state I mean you know he's I'm not gonna get into
[46:11.280 --> 46:14.840]  the whole thing the point is it's all in the film strategic relocation it means
[46:14.840 --> 46:18.080]  if you do live in a big city what are the emergency escape routes that most
[46:18.080 --> 46:21.560]  people don't know about he's got all that this is something that everyone
[46:21.560 --> 46:26.040]  should have in their glove compartment it's like a road map atlas to you
[46:26.040 --> 46:28.720]  understand that with back roads and everything else you should have the book
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.520]  you should have the film and it supports our broadcast as well as strategic
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.840]  relocation the film available I mean it's a great trailer that raw that Rob
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.120]  Jacobson put together it's excellent I'm gonna make a bigger longer one maybe a
[46:41.120 --> 46:44.520]  10-minute presentation to really break down what's in the film so people
[46:44.520 --> 46:52.600]  understand it is wide spectrum so the secure home third edition strategic
[46:52.600 --> 46:56.840]  relocation third edition strategic relocation the film all available in
[46:56.840 --> 47:03.520]  four store.com or 888-253-3139 and the propure water filters and I don't have a
[47:03.520 --> 47:07.200]  bunch of these propure water filters because I think a hurricane is gonna
[47:07.200 --> 47:10.800]  hit me even though the camera I live I've got it because I don't want to drink
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.440]  poison tap water I've got it because the system doesn't want me to drink filtered
[47:15.440 --> 47:19.560]  water and it's the best gravity-fed filter out there discounted 10% off the
[47:19.560 --> 47:23.320]  already lowest price you're gonna find on the web when you add promo code water
[47:23.320 --> 47:29.760]  at infowarstore.com or infowarshop.com or call 888-253-3139 all right there is
[47:29.760 --> 47:34.640]  the plug for preparedness now more than ever ladies and gentlemen the question
[47:34.640 --> 47:40.600]  is could this be the crisis that the establishment uses to suspend the
[47:40.600 --> 47:46.600]  election I don't know how they couldn't if the hurricane is as bad as they say I
[47:46.600 --> 47:51.080]  hope that is at the case I hope it gets blown out the sea right now and as you
[47:51.080 --> 47:54.320]  been doing I've been doing I've been following the weather reports let's go
[47:54.320 --> 47:57.920]  to some of the hurricane tracks the best place I've found to follow it is
[47:57.920 --> 48:02.080]  dredgerport.com because other media outlets only show their news because
[48:02.080 --> 48:05.240]  you know they're in competition with each other drudge is full spectrum so

[48:52.960 --> 48:58.080]  point is going up into Canada down into the Atlantic Ocean so there you go
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.880]  ladies and gentlemen we've got the satellite track it is not blowing out
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.920]  to sea like my father and I had hoped it is slamming with all its heat and all
[49:05.920 --> 49:10.840]  its moisture and it's 80 to 100 mile an hour winds right into the most populist

[51:07.440 --> 51:11.000]  homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.840]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[51:14.840 --> 51:18.520]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[51:18.520 --> 51:21.680]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of

[51:24.920 --> 51:29.080]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.440]  Africans eat fermented porches Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk
[51:33.440 --> 51:36.760]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for Lion
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.120]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[54:33.840 --> 54:37.960]  cover the election all the news on that the economy world government out in the
[54:37.960 --> 54:43.280]  open man I tell you like five calls here at the office when I was talking
[54:43.280 --> 54:46.360]  about the hurricane and called it Hurricane Katrina I called it Sandy
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.880]  about ten times but I talked about Hurricane Katrina as well as you saw
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.480]  looting there and similar things and I guess we just kind of get the name
[54:55.480 --> 54:59.600]  Katrina is almost synonymous with hurricane now but I gotta watch what I
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.040]  say man because I messed up one thing and people are on it I like when I was
[55:04.040 --> 55:08.960]  talking about GM and Jeep I know Jeep's not GM my point is everything's moving
[55:08.960 --> 55:13.640]  offshore now Mitt Romney is criticizing it saying it shouldn't leave and it was
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.200]  gonna go to China now they're saying we'll go to Italy nothing against the
[55:17.200 --> 55:20.840]  Italians but I mean it's fun to buy your cars that are from Italy can't we
[55:20.840 --> 55:24.640]  make something here can't we do that it's like everything's got to be shut down
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.840]  in this country by design we pay bailouts to ship these jobs overseas I
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.800]  mean what's what's what's Chrysler doing with Jeep national weather service says
[55:35.800 --> 55:42.920]  again Sandy a very dangerous storm and continuing here panic buying grips to
[55:42.920 --> 55:46.320]  East Coast mad rush for supplies ahead of mega storm and we've talked to people
[55:46.320 --> 55:49.440]  that are on the East Coast they say a lot of the stores are empty that's the
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.360]  answer I know Baddandi spending time with his son but let's send Dan over with
[55:54.360 --> 56:00.160]  his video camera to his YouTube channel and we'll play it here his his HD
[56:00.160 --> 56:05.160]  channel we set him up for the site and let's get him to go show what's
[56:05.160 --> 56:08.520]  happening in the stores and do a report I know he's listening right now so I
[56:08.520 --> 56:12.160]  reported him and Donnie's back visiting family in Rhode Island so he'll be able
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.160]  to cover this for us and if you put up on screen for prison planet TV viewers the
[56:16.160 --> 56:22.560]  National Weather Service Doppler radar it shows massive massive precipitation
[56:22.560 --> 56:27.240]  they're talking about days in places like Pennsylvania of hurricane strength
[56:27.240 --> 56:32.920]  winds that they're expecting when that thing makes landfall coming up sometime
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.040]  in the wee hours of Tuesday morning I guess in the next 12 to 14 hours or so
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.320]  can you imagine again I'm hoping it's still hype but it doesn't look like it
[56:41.320 --> 56:48.560]  is you got people promising the loot flooding rescues underway a sandy
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.880]  threatens catastrophe of a lifetime CNN that's that's their headline flooding
[56:53.880 --> 56:58.160]  rescues again underway a sandy threatens catastrophe of a lifetime CNN
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.920]  hurricane Sandy may score a direct hit on spent fuel ponds at nuclear plant this
[57:04.920 --> 57:11.160]  is up at info wars.com Washington blog breaks it all down we noted Friday that
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.960]  more than a dozen nuclear plants are near the hurricane sandy path nuclear
[57:14.960 --> 57:19.360]  expert Arnie Gundersen says there are actually 26 nuclear plants in the path
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.240]  the hurricane and that these spent fuel rods are in plants don't have backup
[57:23.240 --> 57:28.640]  pumps just something to know you'll hear the next two days we've safely shut
[57:28.640 --> 57:34.000]  down the plant but Fukushima taught us that doesn't stop the decay heat you
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.800]  need the diesel to keep the reactors cool 26 plants in the East Coast are in an
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.840]  area where sandy is likely to hit fuel ponds not cooled by diesel no one wanted
[57:43.840 --> 57:47.680]  to buy them that's the thing I let these plants rot folks and storing things
[57:47.680 --> 57:51.200]  improperly and it's not that I'm even against nuclear except these companies
[57:51.200 --> 57:57.080]  are just horrible 90 plus percent the numbers what 92% of the 400 plus
[57:57.080 --> 58:02.120]  reactors worldwide are leaking because the radiation eats stuff and the average
[58:02.120 --> 58:07.200]  reactors over 30 years old in recent refuel hot fuel will throw off more and
[58:07.200 --> 58:10.800]  more moisture from pool reactor buildings not meant to handle high
[58:10.800 --> 58:16.440]  humidity it just goes on and on with the path of it man going right over
[58:16.440 --> 58:20.000]  Pittsburgh right over Baltimore right over Philadelphia right over Buffalo

[01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:00.520]  there but I'm so depressed watching these television ads on the elections you
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:07.280]  know they're just and they're just so I don't know how to describe them if you
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.160]  look at the ads literally you'd think that both guys ought to be locked up and
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.800]  put in jail I mean because both sides portray the other side that they're
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.040]  nothing but criminals and so if you view it that way that the Democrats feel all
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.840]  Republican candidates are criminals and Republicans feel all Democrats are
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.380]  criminals I just them the fuddled and dumbfounded as to why the American
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:37.960]  public continues to vote for them well you're right but I mean it's it's really
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.000]  true that both sides are criminals because they're bought and paid for by
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.240]  the globalist well that's true but I mean they even portrayed as such during
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.840]  the elections I'm just talking about the big campaign ads on TV and you know
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:56.400]  it's interesting about them Alex if if people ever travel they will see the
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.320]  same ads in every state only the names have been changed no you're right and
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.920]  it's and it's so formulaic as well both men are trying to act presidential right
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.320]  now well not just even at the presidential level at all levels see all
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.000]  of it comes out of that the mainstream to big parties and then they just
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.240]  channel it out so you may have like a local congressman running in your state
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.960]  if you travel across the country you'll see the identical same ads about that
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.040]  congressman only they'll change to a different one no I know it's formulaic
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:41.800]  it's incredible because elections are not true today they're not real they're
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.240]  strictly controlled by the two parties and I don't know what's happening in
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.240]  Texas but up here in Minnesota they put on the ballot we get to vote on whether
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.720]  they should be allowed to get married and we get to vote on whether we need
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:05.760]  photo IDs to vote well first let me address the fact that when I was
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.960]  governor I tried to get you to Camero to a vote a one-house legislature which is
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.520]  truly government you know it's something that people should choose what they want
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.000]  their government to be do they want to buy Camero to house system or do they
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.760]  want to do what Nebraska has done for the last 75 or 80 years and at the state
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.920]  level you truly only need one house you don't need to I couldn't even get back
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.400]  to a floor vote on the house floor to allow the people to be able to choose but
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.520]  yet they have no problem this year letting the people choose whether they
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.520]  want to allow gay marriage or whether they want to have picture ID because
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.160]  they see it all as a political diversion exactly it's little football issues
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.880]  first of all on the on the on the G40 stay there gov we'll cover that when we
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:01.160]  get back Governor Jesse Ventura straight ahead sick of the globalist you

[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.600]  gonna cover the waterfront we're gonna get into the election we're gonna get
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.120]  into all these new wars in Syria and Libya the in fact that world
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.400]  governments being announced on the news they say big megabanks have taken over
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.160]  Europe in the US we're gonna get into his TV show coming up his book
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.880]  Democrypts and Republicans and no more gangs and government we're gonna get
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.480]  into his lawsuit we're gonna get into the new 9-11 film with Woody Harrelson
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.440]  and so many other folks Martin Sheen they're gonna be producing pretty much
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.680]  here in the next few months there is so much talk about what Jesse Ventura some
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.080]  stations just joined us we do that first little five-minute segment governor
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.360]  recapping what is it like watching this election because never before have I
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.840]  seen both candidates really bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.360]  who did last year a whole TV show you know episode on Wall Street owning both
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.520]  parties both Bain Capital gives more money to Obama than it does to Romney and
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.640]  he used to run it I mean the rhetoric is different but really they're bought and
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.400]  paid for by the same groups where do you see this going in the even short term is
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.960]  the NSA now admits they spy on us without warrants as TSA run checkpoints on
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.640]  highways I mean the unthinkable is just unfolding how low will we go governor
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.240]  well we'll go as low as the people alive and to go it's that it's truly that
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.240]  simple as long as they get away with it they're gonna push the envelope and as
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.840]  long as they continue to violate our Constitution pay no attention to the
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.360]  Bill of Rights as long as they continue to ignore that and we the people continue
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:22.600]  to allow them to ignore it ultimately it's our fault Alex you know we elect
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.880]  these people elections today are a complete sham because the two gangs
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.080]  pick their candidates and you're made to pick from the two games and that's the
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.640]  essence of your election we haven't heard a third voice in the debate now for
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:44.040]  over 20 years so I guess we're all lumped into the two systems that the two
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.640]  corrals the two staging areas whatever you'd like to call them and that's what
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.240]  we all are I guess well I'm not let me go officially on the record and say
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.280]  Jesse Ventura does not belong to these two particular gangs Jesse Ventura
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.320]  never will belong to the two particular gangs so Jesse Ventura doesn't vote for
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.480]  anyone from the two particular gangs and if you do vote for Democrats and
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.640]  Republicans then you are the problem you're not the solution you might talk
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.360]  a good story you might sit out there and criticize and say you stand up for
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.760]  America but if you walk in that voting booth and you vote for a Democrat or a
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:30.000]  Republican then you're part of the problem and until that changes the problem will
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.560]  continue well if you go back to US history around 200 years ago one of the
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.200]  parties did basically get kicked out and die and a new one was created I mean
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.280]  that should have happened a long time ago we should have dozens of parties in
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.640]  this country but instead the two-party system really two heads on the same
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.720]  monster Gerald Salente's last issue of trans forecaster had a great cover we
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.560]  can find it for TV viewers it's a you know it's a a trans journal cover where
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.400]  it's a man in a suit with two heads and it's Romney and Obama I mean it's really
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.040]  that simple oh it totally and it's that way all the way down the line don't just
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.480]  stop it at the president it goes that way through our entire election system
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.160]  down to your local leaders your state leaders they have to pay ambience to the
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.600]  party the party comes first the gang comes first as I like to refer to them
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.720]  as and it's the same as a street gang which is what I wrote about in my book
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  Alex they're identical the hierarchy of the street gang the gang comes first
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.440]  before the country it's it's always the gang is number one and that's what you
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.960]  have to do you notice that any candidate that bucks from the party
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.320]  position doesn't last very long you know they're usually dropped out pretty
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.800]  quick and they disappear well I wanted to raise this as you go to the gang
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.120]  hierarchy and you know you've been a what a member of the Mongols motorcycle
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.640]  gang so you know a little bit about that a club yes sir we have them see on the
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.960]  back of our of our colors well I don't know much about motorcycle club it's like
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.160]  a political party I understand you're being sarcastic coming to tongue-in-cheek
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.320]  there listen I like Rand Paul a lot of issues I've known him for 14 years back
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.480]  when he's the campaign for his dad I've known Ron Paul 17 Rand Paul 14 and you
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.000]  know we've interviewed him when he's been here in Austin in person I've known
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.640]  him for a long time some of my listeners went up there and formed his core to get
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.040]  him into office I privately you know it got him to run for Senate was one of the
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.080]  people influencing him and Ron Paul still stuck to his guns completely but
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.120]  to see Rand pretty much join with the main line of the party and even have
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.800]  some of his politicos and people saying hey we shouldn't cover Bilderberg now
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.080]  and stuff I mean it's just amazing to see how he just got absorbed into the
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.280]  Republican Party and to see all that real political capital he had as a real
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.400]  maverick you know supporting his dad over the years pretty much burn up well
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.560]  that's the difficulty of it if you want to stay there you have to you have to
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:14.360]  align yourself with them or they will destroy you obviously I don't know any
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.440]  of the background of Rand or what went on so I'm speaking clearly into
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.640]  speculation here but I'm sure he got you know told you either go along or we'll
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.520]  see you gone and obviously he made the choice that he likes being there which
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:36.480]  you know power is something it's a it's a poison you know as you gain power and
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.440]  you gain that it becomes a poison it's like I have to laugh how these two
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.960]  parties have ruined our country and yet who's going to pay for it we are they're
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.720]  not going to accept responsibility for ruining social security they're not
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.480]  going to accept responsibility for ruining Medicare it's all our fault and
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.840]  so therefore we will have those things cut those programs that they have been
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.600]  around for all these years and have helped people for whatever purpose when
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.720]  they were put into place we are the ones that pay the price you notice that the
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.560]  parties and the candidates don't don't pay any price whatsoever they don't even
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:20.920]  accept responsibility ultimately they blame it back on us let me throw this
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.240]  at you again governor Jesse Ventura joins us from his home in Minnesota we're
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.320]  going to cover the waterfront the time we have with him today have you just
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:33.880]  tuned in looking at this I've never been what you'd call an ego maniac but when I
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.200]  was younger and first on the air 17 years ago and even five years ago I was
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.040]  still more ego driven where I would just do things and not even be in control of
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.800]  myself now as I've gained more power it's it's been the opposite of a poison I've
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.920]  realized it's a responsibility I noticed my mistakes more I realize I have to you
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.720]  know try to do a good job because people are counting on me but but then I see
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.400]  most people they start getting a little power whether they're a manager at
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.560]  McDonald's or you name it and they start getting crazier and crazier and more
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.920]  arrogant watching and studying you and you know liking useless I was a little
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:16.280]  kid I mean I've or just knowing you now seven years I've seen you even mature
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.480]  more and get less ego until you pretty much have no ego and don't even want to
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.920]  be involved in anything other than getting you know some good done how did
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:30.760]  you not have the poison ruin you of being a movie star top wrestler you know a
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.120]  governor I mean we see Hulk Hogan and all the things that if you haven't
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.040]  responded to Hulk Hogan and that whole thing
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:56.720]  what happened to Hogan the sex takes release oh yeah I think my wife mentioned something to me about that well you know it all goes back I guess to your basic behavior you know people that people that will behave badly
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.960]  pretend to come powerful and that doesn't change who they are they will still behave
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.240]  badly in certain situations you know that's just the way it works out I guess in
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.680]  my particular case I try not to behave badly and you know one of the things
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.680]  that one of the safeguards that I always did just to show you Alex how to
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.000]  protect yourself when I was governor of Minnesota I would never have a meeting
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.560]  where any female was in my office without a staff member no I and that's
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.800]  that's purely for protection no I'm to protect myself because I know I won't do
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.520]  anything but it's that's the way you have to live today you're under scrutiny
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.400]  all the time you're in position where you can be set up these people know no
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.440]  bounds in which to try to destroy you the Democrats and Republicans they will
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.040]  go to any measure to get rid of the competition and so it's just a matter of
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:58.280]  self-preservation and and just simply thinking things through and not making
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:04.680]  irrational dumb decisions or sporadic decisions without thinking well you're
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:09.200]  right I mean I have never told anybody this on air but I basically have the
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:17.480]  same rule I will not be alone or I try my best to not be alone with you know
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.600]  any female other than my wife I mean sometimes you've got to be that's what
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:28.320]  we've alive to today we're honest people like you and I have to take those
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.920]  protective steps in which to keep our integrity well I remember being at
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.800]  Willie Nelson concert with you backstage and out watching it and there were all
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.320]  these beautiful women throwing themselves at you and you and you told me
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.800]  that story then you said you know you said about being faithful to your wife
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.160]  everything that you added hey Alex I don't even go in a room alone with a
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.400]  woman and I guess that's just really a rule to live by well it's just
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.960]  something I don't know if it's for everyone but it certainly works for me
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:03.160]  that way and that's part of just simply the old thing Alex if you come if you're
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.680]  walking down the road at night and you come to a fork in the road and one side
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.520]  is dark and you can't see a thing and the others well lit and you can see
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.400]  everything which road should you take the well-lit path exactly and so many of
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.000]  things of that nature can be can be solved simply by thinking and planning
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.880]  ahead a little bit and don't put yourself in a situation like when I was in the
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.440]  world of wrestling I didn't go to the bars at night when I finished
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.960]  wrestling I went up to my room and I ordered room service and I watched a lot
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:42.200]  of television and read a lot but by doing that it keeps you from putting
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.680]  yourself in a position where trouble can happen the worst thing you can do is go
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:57.000]  to a bar oh I think I agree I mean you know it's the old saying how does it say
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.080]  nothing good ever happens after two in the morning well I do what you do when
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.760]  I'm out on a shoot now I go walk around the town and smoke a cigar or something
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.280]  like we did in New Orleans and then just stay out of trouble that way I don't
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.160]  even go in bars now I've pretty much cut back drinking almost a nothing and lost
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.760]  a lot of weight thanks to it but no I mean I mean you are certainly I'm not
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.880]  you know here kissing your butt it's true you really are an honorable guy who
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.760]  stayed focused and who's been successful when so many other people destroyed
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.200]  their lives and you're an example to live by and I've certainly tried to try
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.000]  to you know learn a few things from you because it's true so and even more
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.840]  nowadays it seems like people out there are out to get anybody who's successful
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.240]  oh well that's the media you know you got to understand the media loves to
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.200]  build people up so that they can later take them down there's nothing the
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:53.120]  mainstream media like a relish is more than to see a quote-unquote star misbehaved
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:58.080]  or do something out of the ordinary or for a mechanism in which to tear them
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.760]  and break them down and destroy them you know the media likes it has a huge ego
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.560]  too they like to believe they created you and so therefore they have the right
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:12.000]  to likewise destroy you and it's a constant battle to defeat them I mean I
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.480]  can't tell you how many times the media has accused me of things that I just it
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.160]  was startling I I didn't even know what they were talking about I mean I remember
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.520]  when I was running for governor and they came out and said that some bar in
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.360]  Montana that I had jumped up on the stage and had to be restrained and the
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.520]  police had to drag me out of the topless bar and I looked at my wife and I
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.280]  started laughing and I said my god the only time I've been to Montana is when
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:47.240]  you and I drove through it coming back from Oregon back in 1978 when we left
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:53.920]  Oregon wrestling well that's a good place to get into the lawsuit here I know
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.360]  taking notes on what you told me it's certainly some good news in the lawsuit
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.840]  you had a chance in that these are the things that we can bring up that you
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:08.720]  were able to look him in the eye so break that down and it is the lawsuit
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.800]  is going forward against the Navy SEAL sniper who wrote in his book that he
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.080]  knocked you out at a SEAL bar and there's a few other things in my notes you
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.160]  said you could talk about but obviously you like it to be decided in court you
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:29.120]  also made the point we'll go over all this that your deposition stuff and
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:35.080]  witnesses is public no media picked it up and then his witnesses who were here
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.960]  saying weren't even there that was picked up by the news is proof so I
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.120]  know you won't defend yourself but you made the point governor that if they
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.920]  throw your case out it'll it'll be covered massively if you went and it
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.320]  won't be covered because the system wants to destroy you I believe so you
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.680]  know I really truly do believe that I believe that if I prevail in this lawsuit
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.240]  which I should because I have the truth on my side the event never occurred
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.880]  it's completely made up and if someone can make something up and prevail in our
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.520]  court system today then you know I'll lose all respect for the court system and
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.760]  I'll lose respect for the government that we have of this country when a lie
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.600]  can become the truth and when the truth is meaningless but that aside you know I
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.000]  don't like to you know we're moving forward on the case I'll let the case
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.840]  do the talking but I do agree if I prevail in this case I bet you won't see
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.080]  much media coverage but if the chances which I certainly you were slim and
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.800]  none that I don't prevail then you'll see headlines across the marathon that
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:48.120]  you know if you know that's just how it works and the way they work well and
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.200]  again the reason I'm not putting words your mouth I wrote notes on what you
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.960]  told me and what I could talk about and what I couldn't but I wanted to wait till
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.880]  you got on air to make sure I didn't cover any of the other stuff this is
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.040]  pretty dynamite stuff that's all I'm gonna say I mean you've got this guy
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:07.560]  and plus you never say you got anyone Alex I mean or Jay got acquitted well
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:13.520]  but you can't take anything for granted in a courtroom with jury because it's
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:19.120]  however the jury is swayed by the evidence presented in court and hopefully
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.800]  your lawyers are better than theirs and you know a lot of things go into that so
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.360]  I don't go into its feeling that I have this case in the bag by any stretcher I
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:34.160]  do go into it knowing I have truth on my side whether truth in America today can
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.840]  prevail maybe that's what we ought to look at in this court case are we to the
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.880]  point in our country today where truth doesn't prevail and then a lie can now
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.960]  now you did say you you would tell the story about being able to facing I mean
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.440]  you just just relate part of that we just had a preliminary hearing in June to
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.760]  try to settle this because let's face everything our courts don't want you to
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.040]  go to court they do everything they possibly can to get you to settle out
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.920]  of court so that you don't take up trial time and cost money and everything that
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:13.280]  goes along with court so they very much try to push you to settle we simply had
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.760]  a court hearing in June hopefully to get a preliminary settlement where you know
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.600]  he would come out and admit that you did this event didn't happen I never said
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.040]  anything of that nature he never hit me and the whole thing didn't occur and he
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  wouldn't do it so therefore the you know they didn't last very long you know
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.000]  this this hearing but because that's the essence of the whole case but I will tell
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.960]  you this it's the first time to my knowledge I ever laid eyes on it well
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.880]  once if you to rock him up to me two days before this hearing and asked me to
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.120]  identify am I good what about what your lawyer said who read the book cover to
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.600]  cover can we talk about that people can read the book cover to cover and judge
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.600]  for themselves in his book he admits to lying multiple times see this is book he
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:11.760]  admits to it this is what makes me mad you were in Mexico and then you'd come
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.680]  back to Minnesota and you you hadn't flown for like a year at the time now
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.320]  it's over two years or whatever it is and it was on the news that you had been
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.640]  recklessly driving going to the airport and and you called me the day it broke
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.880]  and you said I want to come on and I'm going on other news I'm here in Minnesota
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.200]  and I and I and I saw your number on the idea of a yes governor my cell phone I
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.640]  mean it's crazy because again I know Jesse Ventura pretty good now folks and
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.440]  he's all about being in control he's all about being in control of his emotions
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  he's all about you know being you know being successful being I'm not I mean
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:55.040]  you're an upright guy and so to sit here and to see them then say that you're
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.080]  this guy and I had some neighbor when I lived in Westlake who came over one day
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.600]  and he was laughing at me and he said your buddy is on the news with his son
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.400]  flipping a car in a wreck and his his wife looks like his daughter blah blah
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.560]  blah that Jesse Ventura and I said you mean the one with blonde hair I go
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.960]  that's Hulk Hogan and my neighbor sat there that's why I bring up Hulk Hogan
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.600]  you get confused with Hulk Hogan and he with you a lot I saw idiot emails going
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.440]  hey you know your buddies in a sex tape that's how dumb they are that's why I
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  wanted you to comment on the Hulk Hogan thing I mean I'm sure you know people
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.480]  conflate the two right oh yeah you know I'm sure that and I'm sure Hogan loves
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:37.080]  to have when he does something bad they have to credit it to me you know I'm
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.760]  certain that's probably true too but no we're completely different people but
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.720]  we did both have the receiving hairline we're both former pro wrestlers were
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.600]  both large and you know with the blonde hair generally all their minds gray now
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.960]  I don't bother with mine anymore it's pretty much all gray now but I get
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.000]  confused for him all the time and I think that I get accredited for a lot of
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.400]  the things that he does and I'm certain that he doesn't get credited for things
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:10.240]  I do because most of the things I do aren't would never reach the level of
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.160]  being publicized but I mean my neighbor was is a very successful you know
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.080]  business owner a smart guy and I had an argument with him and I said that's
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.600]  Hulk Hogan and the neighbor laughed at me and wouldn't believe me I guess because
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.360]  he was jealous or something that he heard you on my show or something and
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.960]  that was his way to one up people love seeing somebody fall I mean what is your
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.240]  take I know you haven't followed it but let me just give you the news a few
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.000]  weeks ago his friend Bubba the love sponge he's suing him over at the point
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.680]  as a video they clandestinely shot years ago of Bubba's wife and Hulk Hogan in
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.160]  bed together and it's it's graphic I've watched a little bit of it what was on
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:55.200]  the news they blurted out and I mean my point is is that that's an example of
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  of being out of control is all the things that keep happening to Hulk Hogan
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.440]  what's your what's your take on why he attacks you every time he's on the radio
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:09.920]  I have no idea you know you'd have to ask him I have no idea you know jealousy I
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.480]  don't know what it would be I mean I haven't seen the guy now and I don't
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:19.200]  know how many years I mean it's been well put it this way I haven't seen him
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.000]  personally face-to-face I would tell you probably since the early 1990s what
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.640]  would you say to him if you saw him right now probably nothing because I have
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.960]  nothing to say to him you know to me he's irrelevant in my life he doesn't
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.760]  make any difference to me I remember one time I'm sorry I want to hear this
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.520]  we're gonna come back then get into the hurricane your book the TV show so much
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:50.200]  more Jesse Ventura he's our guest I'm Alex Jones stay with us we're on the
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:30:00.560]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the worst
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.400]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.600]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.880]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all

[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.040]  homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.920]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.360]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food

[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.640]  finish up with Hulk Hogan you were starting to tell a story about him and
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.000]  all the real radio happens when we're talking during the breaks finish your
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:33.480]  point about Hulk Hogan I remember when I was governor of Minnesota I did a call
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.960]  from Vince McMahon and apparently Hogan had written a book or something and he
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.120]  was going on a book tour and they had him coming to Minnesota but he went to
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:49.760]  Vince scared that if he came to Minnesota I would have him arrested I was
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.320]  a governor at the time I started laughing and I said to Vince I said Vince I said I
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.160]  have far more important things to worry about in my life than what Hulk Hogan is
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.720]  doing I said I could care less if he comes to Minnesota you know what
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.040]  nonsense is this I mean the ego on the guy is unbelievable to actually believe
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.760]  a governor would be worried about him entering their state and like you're
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.440]  following what he's doing instead of dealing with state matters or stuff I
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.160]  mean I have this whole sex tape stuff I didn't even find out about it until
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.360]  about a week ago I think my wife mentioned it to me on the internet I
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:27.440]  haven't seen any of it then don't care to I mean there's nothing there that
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.560]  interests me really you know what I find interesting there is this here's an
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:37.200]  icon who is portrayed to be American public much like politicians I guess
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.040]  here's this icon that told our little kids to say their prayers and eat their
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.640]  vitamins and live a clean life and apparently he doesn't practice much of
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.520]  what he preaches and yet then you see Jesse Ventura who is a villain who the
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.440]  parents were supposed to tell their kids don't grow up like Jesse Ventura he's a
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:01.240]  dirty rat and a villain so it shows you I guess more than ever when I taught the
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:06.600]  class at Harvard how pro wrestling prepares you for politics because it's
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.000]  perfect where the people you assume you're elected officials that tell you
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.120]  that they're these heroes and to take your vitamins and say your prayers and
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.560]  all that stuff the reality is they're the bastardly villains that they always
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:24.320]  were in real life they just portrayed a different way to you the public I saw an
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.360]  article in the Daily Mail two weeks ago where an actor playing the part of a
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.840]  right-wing terrorist on a TV show has people start fights with him and try to
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:39.240]  assault him thinking he's really a terrorist I mean it's so amazing that
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.880]  people think you're a villain because you played a villain I have adults that
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:49.440]  come up to me and say pro wrestling is real governor is pro wrestling real
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.760]  absolutely it is no if I take offense when people say it's not because
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.600]  pro wrestling entertainment but when I get body slammed you get body slammed
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.920]  and I like to refer to it as ballet with violence so it's both you're right
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.920]  tremendous athletic performers it's irrelevant and to use the term real is
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.680]  not a correct term to use okay well then break it down for us then I mean
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.280]  obviously incredibly dangerous people have to get their hips replaced as you
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  have had all sorts of stuff goes on so your point is yeah you know you're just
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.440]  like it's live theater it's no different than going to the theater and seeing
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.920]  West Side Story production at Broadway only this is a physical production no
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:38.800]  I understand that when I say real arena sure when I say real there are people
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.880]  that think that people are really you know punching each other in the throat
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.220]  over and over again and I understand it's incredibly dangerous people get
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:49.960]  hurt I'm just saying you're not really trying to kill somebody though no not at
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:54.040]  all because you're responsible for that person the first thing you're taught the
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:59.120]  first thing I was taught by Eddie Shark you trained me to wrestle he said the
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.960]  first golden rule I was taught was treat your opponent's body as if it's
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.560]  yours because if you hurt that guy and he can't earn a living then you've
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.520]  deprived his family of an incumbent at your fault and that's quite a cross to
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:17.960]  bear that's a lot of pressure to go out when you go out there to perform that
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.120]  you know I don't truly want to hurt this guy because if I hurt this guy he
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.760]  can't work he can't get a paycheck and he can't feed his family and that's a
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.600]  hell of a responsibility to have every time you act in a ring you know that
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.800]  time I sat there for like two hours and taped you and I and Willie Nelson having
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.320]  a conversation there in his house playing chess we never even released all
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.040]  that because it was non-political but it is so interesting just how it fits into
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.840]  life but wow some amazing stories there I think I'm gonna dig those tapes up and
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:54.680]  actually you know put just the general talk out about wrestling because I mean
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.040]  you know the inside story you want to write a book on wrestling governor
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.920]  because it's so interesting
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.960]  no I know I've been around you quite a few times when the bellhopper something
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.800]  goes oh I love it when you you're a wrestler it's so great you go I'm
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:26.440]  trying to forget about it you know I've been out of the ring now for over 22
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.320]  years and you know that happened back when I was actually under at 30 years
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:37.080]  old and I've long since the past 40 years old a long time ago what do you
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.840]  think about macho man dying broke my heart he was a great wrestler tremendous
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.760]  performer in fact I've always said publicly the greatest match that I
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.000]  ever saw participated in or anything was WrestleMania 3 Randy Macho man savage
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.920]  against Ricky steamboat it's the greatest match I've ever witnessed in my life
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.720]  and I think it will remain so because I I'm a bit biased because I was there in
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.920]  front of the largest crowd in history but it was the greatest match I'd ever
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.040]  seen you and Rowdy Piper have been friends too yeah Roddy and I go back a
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.960]  number of years and you know but I don't see these people on a regular basis the
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:19.480]  last time I saw Roddy I was out in LA I think doing the Tonight Show or something
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.520]  and Roddy happened to be out there and we ran into each other and talked for a
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.360]  couple hours but no I really don't see the wrestlers anymore the last time I
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.720]  saw them was 2004 when I was inducted into the Hall of Fame sure well a couple
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.600]  of them came here a couple of them came to your birthday party now now getting
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.520]  off that it's just fascinating just because it is performance and people
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.800]  are hearing about you know I mean this is very serious performance people get
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.760]  killed sometimes shifting gears in a geopolitical your take on the fact that
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.720]  they now admit Al Qaeda is the main force being used against Libya and Syria
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:55.120]  to overthrow those governments NATO and our government are now arming Al Qaeda
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.640]  while simultaneously saying we've got to give our rights up governor and have TSA
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.320]  like ping-pong in our pants and our wife's braziers
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:11.360]  I thought we were fighting Al Qaeda yeah but no we're supposedly I mean what's
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.600]  your take on Iran all of this well my take is it's all orchestrated I'm a
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:21.040]  great believer in the works of Al Fletcher Prowdy Colonel Prowdy who made
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.680]  the statement that nothing just happens everything is planned and Prowdy also
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.760]  stated how the CIA's job 90% of their job is to go out create wars throughout
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:37.000]  the world so that the military industrial complex can continue to make
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.480]  money and continue to shovel you know all the resources to war I urge people to
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:49.200]  watch the scene in JFK where Kevin Costner meets Donald Sutherland Donald
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.680]  Sutherland is Al Fletcher Prowdy and you need to listen to what he says to
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:59.120]  Kevin Costner because it's exactly true and that's what we should be terrified
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.840]  of today all of these wars are orchestrated there you know you go back
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.400]  and you read Colonel Smedley Butler two-time congressional medal of honor
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.880]  winner writes a renowned book called war is a racket I can't tell people how
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.880]  important it is to read these books read these books from these guys that fought
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:24.160]  the wars and when they tell you war is a racket believe them absolutely we'll
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.560]  find that and play it it's mr. X from JFK movie we'll pull it up guys with a
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.240]  search it's the top video mr. X JFK movie is the search and I've actually
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.680]  found it right here so but you know and then again go to Smedley Butler the
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.520]  two-time congressional medal of honor winner who made the statement I didn't
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:47.320]  fight for the American people and Smedley died in early 40s we're talking the turn
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.600]  of the last century it's been going on for 150 years now over a hundred years
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.760]  now Smedley talks about how he didn't fight for the American people he fought
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.480]  for the United Food Corporation when they wouldn't get cooperation they'd send
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:09.520]  them the Marines to get it and going to war in a rap to me that's equivalent now
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.760]  if we decided Hugo Chavez just got elected again in Venezuela well maybe we
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.320]  should invade in Venezuela invade Venezuela overthrow Hugo and put in a
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.920]  new government because we don't like him
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:28.200]  governor expanding on that specifically on false flag you were on Pierce Morgan
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.800]  like a month ago before you stopped doing interviews for a while I mean repeat
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.400]  what you said there and expand on that because he was trying to interrupt you
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:38.920]  when you were talking about false flags to get us into war Syria if you look at
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:43.840]  all wars all wars are always started with these flag operations something
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.640]  happens to a particular country which gets all their people up in arms and
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.540]  demand revenge and retaliation and you know patriotism and it's on the rook
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:44:00.600]  stock fire in Germany to the attacks in China that Japan did and it goes on and
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.920]  on and on to the Gulf of Tonkin incident and I believe that part of the
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.040]  takeover of locking us down here I think that there'll be something that's
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.800]  going to happen in a train depot or a bus depot so that the TSA can then get in
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.880]  there and the only way the American people will accept it is if something
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.960]  happens and then the American people will throw their hands up in the air and
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.600]  they'll all say oh government please protect us protect us and then the
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.400]  government will swoop in then and you'll be going through the same things at bus
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.560]  stations that you're now going through in airports which I don't go I may give
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:47.120]  up my Minnesota link season tickets because the last game I went to I was
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:53.560]  pissed oh no they are converting now where the TSA at proms in New Mexico and
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:45:01.840]  Texas at malls the TSA comes what I'm seeing I'm the governor the former
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:08.440]  governor and I was pissed oh they're getting late in the year and I wore a jacket they
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.680]  patted me down they now grab the genitals of people at NFL games they now go
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:20.520]  the TSA is now the certifier I think people can do what I do Alex and here's
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:25.960]  what I do I do not go anywhere that requires me to be searched I agree I
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:32.000]  will not attend anything where they require to search me or will I go and
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.400]  use anything where it's a prerequisite that I be searched before I go in and
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.600]  again they sell this idea of safety I love your breakdown of that or you'd
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.800]  rather face the danger but the danger is a government that demands to search and
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.840]  look and peer why do we even have a fourth amendment in our persons papers
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:56.280]  and effects stop groping our children exactly we are accepting this we're
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.760]  accepting and granting our government the ability to search us anytime they
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.960]  feel like it because we all want to be safe from these terrorists I got news
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.560]  for you if that was a scam they're not our terrorists going to invade our
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:18.520]  country like Normandy no no all that's happened is is is the military industrial
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:23.200]  complex is staging these events and provocaturing them and using it to take
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.400]  over our lives it's very simple yeah it's that simple it's very you're
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:32.040]  completely correct I agree with your assumption you're an allergy there you
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:37.160]  know that's all it's being done to maintain the power and again watch
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.320]  Donald Sutherland where he talks about in civilized society everything is
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:47.360]  about their war powers that's the that's what they believe it takes to keep us
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:56.560]  all civilized I believe we've we should have gone past that by now is there
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:00.840]  any way to turn this around because the United States has now become the engine
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.960]  of tyranny worldwide we've been captured by foreign banks it's now all over the
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.480]  news I could play at the clips where they say foreign banks now have captured
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:15.160]  us we're under world government you know CNBC CNN world leaders announcing it
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.840]  but simultaneously you and I are conspiracy theorists to talk about it
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.640]  well you know it was interesting because I was asked the other day on
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.880]  something if I believe that 9-11 was a conspiracy and my response was well the
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:37.960]  government told me it was because the government's whole answer to 9-11 Alex
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.360]  is a conspiracy the government told us that 19 Islamic radicals armed with box
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.760]  cutters defeated our multi-billion dollar air defense system all well
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.160]  conspiring with a bearded guy in a cave in Afghanistan
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.800]  that's why do we get labeled conspiracy theorists when our government
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.160]  promotes a conspiracy theory well also then they hold people for a decade
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.400]  torture Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's family including his child threatening to kill
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.880]  him that they admitted that and then he confessed to bombing buildings that
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.360]  weren't built until four years after he was in secret custody so you're in a CIA
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.360]  torture camp for a decade now and they've got the blind sheet doesn't know
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.840]  what planet he's on up there taking credit for it when he can't even walk
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:32.160]  down the street well you know it's the old cliche as they call it enhanced
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:37.880]  interrogation it's waterboarding I've been waterboarded and I can assure you if
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.000]  they waterboarded anybody three or four or five times you're gonna confess to
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.320]  anything well they couldn't get Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to do it for years but
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:55.000]  before they well they brought his kid in yeah no exactly but they were saying
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.240]  that isn't what finally did it though they're getting to testify they had to
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.880]  threaten his son well I don't know nothing about that I know about the
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:08.240]  waterboarding and you know again it goes back to the same old thing we're
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.880]  willing to accept this but for some reason everybody in our country thinks
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.680]  these terrorists are going to overthrow and threaten our freedom but how
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.880]  ridiculous is it how is Iraq or Afghanistan or Iran or any of these
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:27.840]  places of any effect on our freedom well that's it governor the danger is a
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.280]  government that says we'll secretly grab citizens with the NDAA that Obama
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.520]  promised not to sign but did disappear you torture you kill you if we want and
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.480]  then you and then you use some other tortured person's testimony I mean
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.000]  that's the old thing of putting people on the rack in the Inquisition I mean
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.600]  it's so incredibly obvious you can't believe testimony taken from torture
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.200]  and then whoever's doing the torture that's the bad guy that's the Joseph
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:59.760]  Mingala well the thing is it's you know we we also if you look at the Iraq war
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.680]  Iraq didn't do anything to us we invaded their country we overthrew their
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:11.200]  government and we've now occupied them for going on ten years what had Iraq
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:17.640]  done to justify us invading them nothing that's what the communists did
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:28.240]  that's what the Nazis did and now we've done it how is ours different this is
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.680]  classical tyranny that's happening and the people here seem to accept you
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  know again I'll go back to what I said to you before Alex I'm 60 years old now
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:43.560]  and if you count the war on drugs which we should count it because thousands of
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:48.400]  Mexicans are getting killed every year as a result of it so it is indeed a war
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:54.720]  it's real if you count the war on drugs the Cold War and all the other wars we've
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:59.200]  been at war my entire life yes sir we're gonna come back with Jesse Ventura stay

[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:15.280]  canceled the Jay Leno show a few weeks ago because he wouldn't fly he was going
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:19.440]  to take the train all the way out to California and of course as you heard
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:23.920]  they're now showing up groping at trains so we're getting him here he had an
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:27.080]  interview in about a month and he's with us this segment one more we're gonna
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.240]  get into a bunch of news and break down some medical news as well and look at
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.560]  this big hurricane but governor you got interrupted again by the break do we
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.720]  remember what you were talking about we've talked so much during the break
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:43.880]  we've we've moved on from there you're gonna come on the day after the
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:49.760]  election Lord willing November 7th to break down the TV show but give us a
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.000]  little hors d'oeuvre now of what you think one of the most powerful episodes
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.440]  is going to be well I think they're all good you know we do some this year where I believe we expose a
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:05.800]  conspiracy for being a fraud to you know we play both sides of the street on the
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.760]  show this year I'm real pleased with my that I have Sean Stone with me this year
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.640]  Oliver Stone's son as well as my own son Tyrell you know along with June
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.960]  Sarpong and they all do a great job and we worked real hard we as I said we
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.040]  finished the shows a year ago and for some reason they're not going to air
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:28.640]  till November 7th which is the day after the election but at least they're gonna
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.840]  air that I I had my doubts they would get on the air at all but they're they're
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:37.840]  going to get there that sounds very very political that they shot on them for
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:41.600]  almost a year and I know I'm not supposed to talk about the back story
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.680]  stuff because I was part of the show as a consultant some and appeared in all
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:50.240]  three seasons in some of the shows but I mean I'm telling you they really do
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.440]  not want you out there during the election because they know you're
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:59.080]  criticizing the two gangs well you know maybe so I don't know I have no proof
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:04.000]  that says anything contrary to it but do you know judge as you may I just found
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.120]  it kind of larry is that we go on the day after the elections over not that
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.080]  any of the shows deal with elections because they don't but they're gonna be
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:19.040]  good this year they'll be fascinating no to make people think a lot and a couple
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.520]  of my way out there you know we we decided the third season that we would
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:30.200]  take the plunge in in real controversial and I think we did you
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.480]  certainly did but I mean you had Homeland Security go completely open a
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:38.840]  congressman did to not air and a rear your Homeland Security FEMA camp
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.600]  special yeah we did eight of them but they're only gonna air seven they
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:49.920]  won't do the one we did on the TSA oh that one apparently ain't gonna make
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.520]  show time they're only gonna air seven of the eight that we did so now so now
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.640]  it won't just air once TS that's in breaking news TSA kills Ventura show
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:07.360]  well I can't say the TSA did it I'm just stating that they won't air the show we
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.960]  did on TSA I don't know who killed it I can only say true TV killed it I have
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.240]  nothing that indicates it goes beyond them you'd have to ask you'd have to
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:21.920]  ask them I know a little bit about it decide not to air the eight show a show
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.400]  that exploits the TSA and what they got in store for you coming up in the
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.400]  future yeah the highway checkpoints and you guys went I know and well tell
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.360]  folks what they won't be saying then you went and confronted with the the body
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.160]  scanner makers and shirt off if you notice that we could go they started
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.280]  pulling those big radiation things out of the airports that they're still not
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.800]  admitting that they're not safe well then why are they replacing them well
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.880]  they're putting them in smaller airports now give them a baking but yeah
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:58.000]  whatever but we expose we expose that these things are not safe we expose that

[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.560]  that TSA employees aren't allowed to wear radiation badges for their own
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:12.720]  protection so you can clearly see the government doesn't want any lawsuits
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.040]  coming from anywhere so they don't put anything in place for safety and that
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.640]  way they always have plausible denial that's state-run media well that's big

[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:23.160]  Alex Jones
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:29.920]  well we've got him Jay Leno can't get him but we got him because he won't I
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:33.520]  guess put up the TSA trying to grope him that they want to isolate us though
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.360]  they're shutting us down and they have cancer clusters that came out at Boston
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:40.320]  Logan and for their airports where they first put the scanners in nine years ago
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.040]  now they're removing the big bakers I already had it from internal sources
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:47.560]  governor that the TSA people found out they were being lied to that those were
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.040]  killing them so now they put this millimeter system in but we've got top
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.760]  scientists saying those are just as bad they actually rattle your DNA but think
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:00.560]  about the elite that they would put these body scanners in there save your
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.720]  naked images get caught lying about it and now I get calls every day when we
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:08.760]  open the phones up of truck drivers and people running into TSA checkpoint
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:12.600]  citizens running into them where they'll even get mad at them for Patriot
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.720]  bumper stickers governor well I don't know about anything like that but all I
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.080]  know is that they you know there's far too much search and seizure going on in
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:26.200]  this country there's far too much observation of us I mean when George
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:32.520]  Orwell wrote those books who knew that they would become true by the year 2012
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:40.240]  and absolutely and then son I do want to state the rocks it well I did not not do
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.480]  Jay Leno because I wouldn't fly it was some health issues here at home why I
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:47.960]  had to cancel Leno well I know you don't want to insult Leno but well you also
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:52.000]  told me though that you were saying the trains and stuff like that not being a
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.400]  lot of required me I don't fly anymore because I won't do anything where I'm
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:01.600]  treated like a criminal and so that means I can't fly anymore and so to go to
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:06.560]  LA would now take me over a week to do so and I couldn't do that because of a
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.200]  particular medical problem here at home I could not leave for a week it was
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.720]  sure sure I'm just saying nobody's had you for a month it's we just really
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.120]  appreciate you being here with us in closing presidential run in four years
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:25.600]  well like I said you know Rick I won't do it with a political party and it'll
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:30.280]  require the people to rise up and waiting for that to happen will be I don't
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:35.400]  think I have anything to worry about running in four years really you just
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.160]  thinking that the country's that shot well I just don't I think the people are
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.920]  that apathetic they continue to vote for these Democrats and Republicans the
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:50.240]  people that are wrecking our country and yet they still vote for them I didn't
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.760]  watch one debate Alex I didn't need to because six months ago I determined I
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.280]  was voting for Gary Johnson the governor of New Mexico running under the
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.840]  Libertarian Party so therefore I didn't need to watch debates and get told a
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:09.920]  bunch of hogwash and lies all they do is lie to you you're right governor Jesse
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.720]  Ventura we got two minutes left you're gonna be back with us on November 7th
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.200]  after the election comments on this hurricane they're saying it may postpone
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:21.680]  the election we know they've got weather weapons
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:29.040]  well I did the thing I'm not up in Alaska Harp but I don't think it's gonna
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:33.000]  postpone the elections it's supposed to hit today or tomorrow and the elections
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  are a week away I think we're well prepared for it if the maybe it'll be
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.960]  big enough but right now it's only a level one and I think with the
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:49.160]  preparation that's gone in ahead of time now the damage may be minimal I
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:53.880]  could be wrong I'm not a weatherman and I'm not hip to everything going on out
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:58.200]  there I wish all those people well and hope it's the least possible damage that
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.600]  could happen well I think it's a lot of hype as well but they're you know
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:06.480]  canceling the early voting in several states now we covered that article
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.360]  earlier so maybe government will try to use it as some type of diversion who
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:14.440]  knows you know government really doesn't want you to vote that's obvious you
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:18.000]  know they've got out there doing it Minnesota now with these picture IDs and
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.200]  stuff so they do want to make it more difficult to vote because they want to
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:25.760]  cut down the number of people who are allowed to make a decision on what they
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:30.080]  do and they're trying to check made us with election fraud as well well I
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  hope to hear in the news from governor Ventura from Jesse here on other media
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.160]  but we've been honored to have you in the new book thanks Alex thank you sir as

[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:15.200]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with

[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.640]  Alex Jones your host we just had former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura on
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:40.760]  in in a newsmaking interview I have not been talking a lot to the true TV
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:45.720]  crew the production house I have some friends there ever three seasons Michael
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:51.800]  Braverman and others I did not know that they had killed the TSA which was one
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:57.040]  of the most powerful episodes and I know what's in it the cancer studies on the
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.800]  body scanners the factories the money deals churn off making money all double
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:07.200]  triple checked and they killed it time Warner killed it you just heard
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:13.320]  governor Ventura if you just tuned in that is big news you know I've been
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.960]  told not to tell people what I was told in confidence about the last season with
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.920]  the episode that I mean I was the consultant on I'd say 80% of it the
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.320]  FEMA camps the proof the civilian inmate labor camp programs the model
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.440]  state's health emergency powers act the emergency centers establishment act I
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:35.080]  mean I gave him all the documents and they the stuff I gave Glenn back three
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.880]  years ago that he said he was going to cover and then you know came out and
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.200]  said was a hoax and didn't exist and then went and showed what we predicted
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:44.840]  hoax FEMA camps and not the real ones we have the bills we have the
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.640]  legislation we have the executive orders we went and show the fusion centers we
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.560]  went and showed the Homeland Security reports they went and talked to Mr.
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:57.480]  German forget his first name and he works for the ACLU well-known retired FBI
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.680]  agent well he got out of the FBI because of the stuff he saw and we proved I mean
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.520]  it was hardcore real journalism you know some of the stuff on the shows kind of
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:10.600]  a little nebulous fun stuff you know reptoid stuff like that but this was
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.440]  hardcore and they went a bit supposed to air like 50 times cost closer to a
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.800]  million dollars to make an episode if you must know and so they air them over
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:23.640]  and over again you know like any of those true TV shows it got record ratings
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:29.960]  record ratings and they killed it and Homeland Security gave him a little
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.800]  visit bunch of the stuff happened the other things I can't talk about threats
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:38.800]  you name it and because the head of true TV and said look I'm allowed to do
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:41.840]  whatever I want governor Ventura this is three years ago in the first season
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:49.400]  you are going to be able to do whatever you want as long as it's vetted and it
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:53.920]  came down to a big fight at true TV basically I'll just leave it at that and
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:58.960]  countermanding and direct orders from on top with Homeland Security going to
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:07.120]  Time Warner and of course we had under Time Warner CNN the the reporter on
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.920]  Amber Lyon who was one of the I mean she's a Emmy award-winning with three of
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.560]  them for news you know also war zones you name it they were covering up al-Qaeda
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:20.440]  working for our government basically murdering people all over and different
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:23.600]  governments murdering peaceful protesters and lying about it and they
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.760]  told her shut up and it turned out the government of Qatar and others were
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.560]  funding CNN funding each program Bill and Melinda Gates on record fund ABC news
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.600]  all of it that's why they have newscast saying Bill Gates is a superhero
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:44.200]  showing him flying like Superman that's how dumb they think you are do we do we
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.600]  have him yet just give me a status report occasionally when we're looking

[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:01.440]  you the issue here ladies and gentlemen is during the break I was thinking to
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:04.680]  myself for I came back I want to make this point I was thinking about cancer
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.600]  rates on average you can look at the different numbers yourself are up two
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.600]  to and a half to 3,000 percent what they were in the 50s now the media spends
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:20.760]  it that survivability is up by the 30s they knew cancer was virally
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:28.320]  transmitted most of it injecting rats they've had weaponized cancer viruses
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.640]  on record since the 50s I mean there's congressional reports on this folks they
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:38.680]  put weaponized cancer viruses so designer that they're set to trigger once
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:41.520]  your hormone levels lower they're meant to kill you once you get ready for a
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.960]  retirement age and they've set it up to suck the money out of you as they kill
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.880]  you and this is a government caught not hundreds but thousands of times in
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.720]  secret test killing people he just came out in st. Louis they were spraying and
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.320]  killing people with nerve gas this is what they do okay it is not the
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.360]  government it's a eugenics mad scientist technocracy that's what they call
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:10.000]  themselves as technocrats and you need to take it personal that the GMO is
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.520]  designed to sterilize you and give you cancer in every major rodent study
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.920]  they test rodents because they have the same closest physiology to us is rodents
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:25.720]  pigs and monkeys and apes and monkeys and apes are expensive pigs are expensive
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.400]  because you got to contain them they use rats rats are their physical their
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:33.720]  metabolic systems according to all the scientists I've talked to are the closest
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:40.320]  rats Guinea pigs other rodents okay now you're being murdered you're being
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.280]  vandalized your body at us at a molecular level is being attacked you're
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:48.000]  being stabbed and you know what even a wimp if somebody walks up to him in a
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.360]  parking lot and pulls out a knife says I'm in a stab you all and most wimps will
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.920]  even fight back they'll find enough courage to fight for their lives will
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:59.080]  you fight for your lives now ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:05.480]  almost everybody I know has family with cancer right now and I am sick of it and
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.120]  I take it personal I take it real personal I take it real personal that
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:17.320]  the women I love young and old are constantly battling breast cancer that
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:20.320]  everybody I know has been touched by that and it's just growing it's sky
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:25.760]  rocketing and there's no media coverage of why is it exploding why is it
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:30.160]  exploding why is testicular cancer exploding why is pancreatic cancer
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.680]  exploding why is cancer the liver cancer of the lungs cancer of the esophagus
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:39.840]  cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer I'm sick of it I'm sick of it these globalists
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:48.000]  know how to kill us quietly kill us slowly and then they soft kill us and we
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.240]  wander off and wonder why we died 10 years later they know it's a death sentence
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:55.720]  they've had DU since the 40s they've had DU weapons but never would deploy them
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.680]  because they said well it blows back it ignites in the in the rifle
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:06.520]  barreling and it will it will shoot people it will not just shoot who you're
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:11.040]  shooting it will shoot you you will you will get it and it's toxic and it's
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:16.960]  radioactive that's what the old manual said until 1991 I've interviewed the
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:25.400]  head of the DU program for the Defense Department but Colonel Doug Rocky and
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:29.480]  you know physicists scientists biologists I mean he most his friends
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:33.560]  have died from it he's had 50 something surgeries every time we try to get him
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:37.520]  on he's at the hospital the guy's tougher nails like Darth Vader but you
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:43.320]  know he's sick they went out there to just survey the DU from the highway of
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:49.040]  death post Gulf War one Desert Storm on that Kuwaiti highway into Iraq and
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:54.840]  folks they were in breathing masks they were in gear and they all got rashes
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.960]  and started having kidney failure and nosebleeds and deformed children and
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:02.600]  just instantly you know they went home and had kids and they were deformed they
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:08.160]  were having kidney failure and some of the guys that week okay you know why
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.320]  the troops are dying you know why they're so sick you know why they're
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:15.480]  committing suicide folks they're dying nerve gas was released Saddam probably
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.320]  used nerve gas they also blew up a bunch of bunkers to get rid of it was marked
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  us and NATO and the detectors all went off the news said false alarm our troops
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:29.000]  shut there and breathe sarin and vx mixtures at low levels it deposited in
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.640]  the in the brainstem and I watched the congressional hearings where they
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:34.480]  admitted it two years later and it showed this Marine Corps captain they
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:37.960]  were showing photos of him all handsome and strong he was begging saying all I
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:42.240]  want is medical help for my friends who are dying he died like a week after that
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:48.240]  he was on C-span it made me cry these people are murderers ladies and gentlemen
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:55.080]  the globalists are pure death they make Joseph Mingala the angel of death the
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:03.000]  Nazi torture scientist look like a schoolboy he is a he is an apprentice to
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.320]  these people Hitler got everything from the US in England it's called eugenics
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.680]  it's called the New World Order that's why Ted Turner said last week he's glad
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:14.160]  troops are committing suicide they believe it's good for the earth for us to
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.920]  die well I got news for you I'm gonna identify you and as you keep killing
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:21.760]  enough people people are gonna break out of their trance and we're gonna bring
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:25.640]  all of you to justice come hell or high water that's why I'm not worried about
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:32.320]  myself folks because there's no future anyways we either beat these people we
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:38.560]  either defeat these people or there's no future you don't just go I'll go party
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.000]  and watch a ball game and go get drunk and whatever happens and your kids get
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.480]  cancer at age 22 or whatever I am not gonna settle for that I am not when I
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:55.400]  when I see people drinking diet coke it assaults me it assaults me to know that
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:59.120]  it's in tens of thousands of products all the major sugar gums most candies
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:05.360]  now added on top of the sugar it's an excitotoxin highly addictive is it
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:08.640]  makes you hungry because it's an excitotoxin and makes you obese there's
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:12.720]  literally dozens and dozens and dozens of studies on this there's new ones out
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:19.200]  today new ones out this week and I never hardly see Glenn Beck I was looking
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.640]  around for like FEMA camp news and I saw something about economic collapse and
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.000]  it was him on his radio show and you know he's not copying us the TVs behind
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.480]  him stuff which is great I mean it's it's a serious form of flattery but the
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:34.640]  point is he was sitting there with a diet coke and I remember when the Drudge
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.320]  report when he said he was going blind which that Mackler's degeneration on
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:45.240]  record is linked to aspartame neutrosweet equal and the Drudge report
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:50.080]  linked to our article saying hey it could be aspartame that's making you go
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:53.760]  blind Glenn as like a message to try to help him he went on the radio the next
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:57.440]  day and made fun of me and basically made fun of the Drudge report for that
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:04.880]  article I mean he's going blind and he can't stop drinking it I just these
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:09.280]  people I don't know what to do I mean I genuinely want to help people I want him
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.800]  to stop drinking it stop losing his eyesight it can even be reversed and
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.280]  then come out against it but he won't because these people love it man I've
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:21.000]  seen Bill Clinton drinking diet cokes even most of these puppet people out
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.320]  there who think they're powerful their ego maniacs they don't even that they
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.920]  couldn't be true that diet coke makes you go blind it could I remember two years
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.440]  ago it couldn't be true that PepsiCo does have fetal tissue flavoring and
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:36.040]  their drinks I didn't believe that till it came out in court so maybe I shouldn't
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:40.240]  blame them I mean who can admit this here it is this is out of the National
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.960]  Institutes of Health new national study Chakra and aspartame compared with
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:48.760]  sucralose induced greater weight gain in adult weister rats at similar total
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:53.440]  caloric intake levels now I already know this Dr. Blalock MD has said this
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:58.760]  aspartame eats your brain makes you fat and gives you pancreatic cancer and
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:03.280]  makes your eyeballs rot Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for

[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.320]  large ranches well for Jess Adkins in East Texas an industrial level and I
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.800]  know they have to know what really is causing the problem they're there to get
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:26.600]  the animals well and sold or taken care of they're not there to suck more money
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.680]  out of you because farmers aren't going to put up with it big agris and they
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:33.440]  always knew it was vitamins and minerals I know he's been talking about this for
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:36.840]  30-plus years and did big national studies for the federal government 25
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:40.120]  million dollars in research but I wanted to get him on when I saw this in
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:42.440]  other studies because I know he's talked about this forever
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.080]  Chakra and aspartame compared with sucralose induced greater weight gain
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:50.480]  in adult Worcester rats this is the National Health Institute's National
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:56.480]  Institute of Health big university study put out here doc I mean you've talked
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:01.640]  about that Dr. Blalock MD brain surgeons talk they know all this they know
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:05.520]  what aspartame does they know what MSG does they know what vaccines do they
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:11.800]  know why is cancer rates exploding sir what is going on here you know what is
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:15.040]  your take on the points I make is we're gonna talk about let's play doctor your
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:24.000]  book with Dr. Wallach and also a MD that you wrote it with let's play doctor
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.720]  you've got immortality a book breaking that down hell's kitchen obesity
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:34.960]  diabetes and metabolic syndrome excellent book dead doctors don't lie of
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:37.920]  course your international bestseller all those are available by the way at
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:43.320]  infowarsstore.com a bunch of your books there that ties all in with infowars
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:48.160]  team.com or infowarshealth.com and it's just just the off-the-chart products
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.200]  that you've developed I was just talking to one of the female crew members here
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:56.360]  she said she's lost 15 pounds on this in just a month the Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.080]  the Polymers plus the essential fatty acid proprietary blend but I'm not gonna
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.720]  get into a pitch for that I'm already ranting because I'd love to sell what
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.360]  works when I believe in. Dr. Wallach this is a short segment here but long
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.760]  segment coming up what is going on how many studies do we have to have on what
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:14.960]  aspartame does to the body why is it so bad why is it linked to macular
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:21.640]  degeneration in the eyes pancreatic cancer why is it so addictive Dr. Wallach well
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:26.160]  there's a basic reason why it's addictive the human beings have a craving for
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:32.360]  things when they're minerally deficient and they get stuck on sugar and so if
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:35.760]  you don't even if you don't have sugar you have something sweet like aspartame
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.440]  it has two things number one the chemical itself has been shown to cause
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.400]  tumors okay we know that but also because it's sweet is very seductive but a
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:48.920]  person is minerally deficient you have these cravings I have to have a candy
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:53.400]  bar I have to have a diet coke I have to have a diet Pepsi and I run into people
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:28:01.280]  all the time Alex that are addicted to you know six liters of diet Pepsi or
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:06.200]  Diet Coca-Cola or Diet Dr. Pepper every day now there's no sugar in it but they
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.880]  will gain an enormous amount of weight because there's a basic fallacy that
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:14.960]  that when you're drinking that coke you're gonna eat well you're not gonna
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.680]  eat well I'm not trying to be mean but when you go to the mall and see a 500
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:22.400]  pound person they've always got a diet drink in their hand and you try to warn
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:27.200]  them and they just don't want to listen to you because it's so addictive you're
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.920]  exactly right and of course the medical system in the government both I don't
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.240]  know if they're just ignorant I'll give them the benefit down to soon they're
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:38.600]  ignorant because if they know what they're doing as you're pointing out is
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  definitely criminal because it's hard to buy anything fat everything is fat free
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:46.680]  low fat no fat and yet we're the number one obese nation in the world
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:52.040]  following their system and so they are they that stupid it may be but
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:55.720]  basically what happens here is when you have a basic mineral deficiency you
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.640]  crave sweets people said man I'm a sugar holic I just are a Coca-Cola or a
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:03.360]  Diet Coca-Cola or a Chocoholic and that's because they're merely deficient and
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.760]  they get on this aspartame and it has the negative in that you're always
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:11.400]  going to be unsatiated you're always going to be hungry because you think
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:15.880]  you're doing yourself a service by having this no calorie drink which tastes
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.520]  sweet but then you're still going to eat more when you eat you're still going to
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:21.940]  eat more when you eat and this is why people gain weight when they're
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.600]  drinking all this diet stuff but it does there are studies that show that
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.360]  aspartame does cause cancer there's no doubt about that well they knew that and
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.440]  they couldn't get it approved as you know doc in the 70s three times yep stay
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:35.960]  there we're gonna come back and continue to talk about how they kill us and
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:39.280]  again I've done the research they're doing it on purpose it's very funny to
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:43.040]  them now the average idiot doctor they don't know they're all brainwashed let's
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.000]  talk about how they brainwash MDs when we come back and get into a bunch of
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.440]  other important points dr. Wallach wants to cover we're on the march the
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:58.560]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:08.000]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.320]  cheeses but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:15.160]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:18.880]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:22.120]  are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:25.360]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:29.520]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:34.080]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:37.760]  a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:41.160]  can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally
[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.600]  and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as

[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:31.920]  I'm not gonna get into a long plug here but I've done my research and my dad's
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:35.720]  a physician and I've interviewed countless MDs I've interviewed countless
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:42.160]  veterinarians I've worked with sheep and cattle and horses and it was always
[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:46.280]  about the minerals I remember I remember Jess Adkins large animal that I worked
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:50.520]  for out in East Texas and boy that guy worked hard he worked like 16 hours a
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.080]  day and then he was like 60 something years old when I worked for him and he
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:58.160]  worked me into the ground when I was like 17 years old I worked for him off and
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:03.360]  on several years but the point is is that he would always be mineral this
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:07.960]  mineral that mineral mix this so Dr. Wallett growing up on a farm being around
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:12.000]  all this he became a prestigious worldwide veterinarian working for the
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.800]  federal government doing autopsy and discovered that so many things that yes
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.720]  you have a genetic predisposition but that triggers when you're not getting
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:24.960]  trace elements vitamins and minerals so they're selling it's all genetic well
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:28.640]  what happened to our genetics because why are all these diseases the United
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:32.640]  States leads the entire world in every horrible disease look it up just don't
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:37.600]  believe me Alzheimer's cancer diabetes I mean you know that you see it on the
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:41.720]  news they're killing us and whether it's on purpose or by design I know it's by
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:44.520]  design I've read them brag about it while it's being friendly and saying
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:47.800]  well whatever the point is let's just cut by that debate they're doing it and
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:53.920]  I'm telling you number one get off all this stuff people that go off aspartame
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.080]  they say it is like a battle I had a family member went off of it and they
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:00.520]  were in bed for about a week and they were smiling they didn't use drugs alcohol
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:03.400]  nothing well it's wood alcohol basically what it breaks down into and
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:07.600]  formaldehyde tightly addictive it's why your dog you know likes poison it's of
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.080]  separate poison and will drink antifreeze just because it's sweet doesn't mean
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:14.760]  it's good it's cheap they can use a tiny bit of it what it's six times sweeter
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:19.960]  than sugar by volume they had a chemical warfare test they were doing with
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:24.000]  bacteria in the 60s the Defense Department discovered it Searle was
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.760]  given the patent on it then it was passed him on Santo I know the whole
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:32.800]  history look up manufacturing process and people go well beers made out of
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:37.520]  bacteria yogurt yeah good ones they feed toxic waste to a genetically
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:42.440]  engineered E. Coli that ain't a good bacteria folks and then they crap out
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:48.000]  aspartame I hate to go into detail here and I'm just picking one thing my point
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.240]  is we get a document cam shot here for viewers radio listeners can just go to

[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:07.680]  Alex and it is a hundred percent cholesterol if you go to cholesterol
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:11.480]  restricted diet and then you take cholesterol lowering drugs and you get
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.360]  Alzheimer's disease why do I get high off a good piece of fish or a good clean
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.280]  range-fed organic beef I mean I literally it's a drug for me to eat a big
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:24.240]  piece of rare steak I get high off of it you know I had four poached eggs and they
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:31.360]  have pound breakfast steak this morning and my supplements there's nothing wrong
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:35.760]  with eggs and steak at red meat and and so forth so nobody can find a third
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:41.160]  generation flourishing colony of vegans with 300 rosy cheek kids run around
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:46.960]  giggling they don't exist and so it all comes down again to basically the
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:49.760]  medical system has overreached when they're talking about everything is
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:55.600]  caused by genetics they want you to eat more whole grains I mean they could serve
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:59.380]  up most Americans and Ruth Chris's steakhouse is prime beef that's the
[02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:03.320]  gist of the book Hell's Kitchen and I have to stop here a minute just tell
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.640]  everybody what a hero you are for me because you're one of the few guys out
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:11.200]  there that tells the truth and so I'm so proud to be associated with you because
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:16.120]  of that same here buddy birds of a feather fly together okay but the book
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:20.320]  Hell's Kitchen covers this obesity and type 2 diabetes thing both of these are
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:25.400]  physician-caused diseases and I can make people an X diabetic not not measure
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:29.600]  disease but make them an X diabetic in two to 14 days actually had a challenge
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:35.920]  from a guy who owns one of the largest medical laboratories in America and he
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:40.760]  actually had terrible diabetes getting worse and worse and worse had to use
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:44.760]  insulin I mean this guy was out of control had access to the best endocrinologist
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:49.560]  he services 7,000 households a day and hundreds of thousands of doctors every
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:54.920]  day and we met in a little restaurant in a funny little town in Missouri and we
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:58.520]  were probably the only population there and he made a bet with me he says well
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.120]  like I'll be your best friend if you can do as everybody says you can't get rid
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:04.840]  of my diabetes in 90 days so we can probably do it faster than that he said
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:09.040]  I'll give you 90 days but if you can't do it in 90 days you'll be I'll be your
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:12.200]  worst enemy I said well that's fair I shook his hand it's kind of shocked and
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:19.600]  in two months time his diabetes went from his blood sugar went from like a
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.960]  hundred and seventy eight with drugs down to sixty eight without medication and
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.480]  his A1C hemoglobin which tracks how well you're maintaining your blood sugar
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:35.000]  from 8.3 down to 4.3 and at two months time and he's diabetes free now we get
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.920]  people off the foot and leg amputation list but we get people off the heart
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.240]  transplant list the quickest I've ever done it is five days are on 27
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:46.240]  prescription drugs at three heart diseases all by supplementation with
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:50.400]  nutrients that are required for the heart and the liver and the and the
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:56.560]  kidneys to rebuild themselves you cannot just use drugs to do these things
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:01.680]  there's not a single drug with the exception of antibiotics Alex that cure
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.760]  disease okay everything else just manages symptoms so we talk about let's jump
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:10.880]  over here to this meningitis thing is the contaminate by aspergillus that's
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.880]  that's tiny 23 people were killed 300 infected 800 exposed that's nothing
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:20.360]  each year in America according to the Center for Disease Control Alex two
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:25.280]  million people are infected in medical hospitals in America alone because
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:29.680]  medical doctors don't wash their hands after they go potty 90,000 of these
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:34.640]  people die every year Alex and let me tell you in a thousand years the mafia
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:37.960]  has never killed that many people in a thousand by the way you know sir that's a
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:42.880]  very conservative number you get there now saying all combined hospitals drug
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:46.720]  interactions and things is now the number one cause of death it's over a
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:51.280]  million people now a year oh absolutely right well how many people Alex would
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.320]  take public transportation if they knew that public transportation killed 15
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:59.920]  million people every year in America I mean killed injured infected 15 million
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:03.920]  people nobody would fly nobody to take buses or trains yet they continue to go
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:09.160]  like zombies into the doctor's office and that's why I love you because you
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:13.440]  are putting forth a way that people can care for themselves it's not only going
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.080]  to be food it's not only going to be self-protection but it's also going to
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:23.000]  be how to care for yourself because why would you escape death at the hands of
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.480]  an enemy partner domestic and have a doctor kill you I mean this is what
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.120]  happens in the VA hospital I've always said that you have two opportunities to
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:32.960]  give your life your country once is on the field of battle and the others in
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.160]  the VA hospital because VA doctors according to their own records kill
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.080]  700 veterans each year they kill them these are people who have escaped death
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.840]  at the hands of the enemy and they go to the VA hospital or help in the VA
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.400]  hospital kill 700 a year and so we have to take care of ourselves and keeping our
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:54.880]  weight down staying away from these artificial sweeteners sugar substitutes
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:43:00.960]  is imperative you're right on track and the only way to do this is to learn how
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:04.080]  to take care of ourselves if you do it if you give your body the raw materials
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:08.480]  the basic 90 60 minerals two-thirds of the 90th sense of nutrients are minerals
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.440]  and you cannot tell by looking at a tomato if it has three minerals or 12 or
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:17.040]  25 and in the animal industry which you keep going to which I appreciate you
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:21.880]  can eliminate 900 different diseases which still plague humans by
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:25.520]  supplementing them with minerals including one of my great stories is
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:30.320]  mustardistry we eliminated mustardistry since 1957 in the animal industry and I
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.480]  began doing it in the United States about five years ago with human beings
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:40.760]  eliminating mustardistry we sent this information to Jerry Lewis by email and
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.680]  hard copy he took this information to the medical committee of the mustardistry
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:49.680]  foundation and they fired him and that's why he has not been on the telethon the
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.960]  last two years and they fired everyone of his supporters in the mustardistry
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:58.720]  foundation I've talked to his personal assistant like 15 times over the last
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:03.080]  two years and she was passing on the message we didn't want any money from
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.840]  him we just wanted to let him be the guy to announce that we found the cure for
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:10.680]  mustardistry and we brought that to the medical committee they fired Jerry Lewis
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:15.280]  in the mustardistry foundation he needs to go public I know he he's a nice guy
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:18.680]  and everything but he needs to go public with that right now because I don't
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:23.280]  know if he they have a gag order on him or what but that's the problem when you
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.720]  go work in something like that they have you sign contracts you can really break
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:31.200]  them if the people are engaged in fraud but you know like when I go work on a
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:34.720]  TV show it's always oh by the way sign this you can't talk about whatever
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:38.640]  happened here and a lot of times I just don't even I tell national TV well I'm
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:41.800]  not I'm not going anywhere with you and I'm not going around you because I'm not
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:46.840]  going to waive all my rights and stuff I mean yeah I mean I had to get a
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:50.400]  proviso they wanted me to sneak back into Bohemian Grove I said but I couldn't
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:55.000]  talk about it until it well I could never talk about it and I said well I
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.960]  can't sign this contracts they had to change it then we went out there and
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:02.480]  they got arrested and I got away two years ago but the point is yeah I went
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:05.320]  and like jumped in the river and swam away literally hiding in the bushes from
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:08.720]  the but the point is I'm not going to jail just that you know people are
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:12.040]  chasing me to the woods anyways I just go on there to cover something I didn't
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:14.720]  even really got on the property yet when they were already chasing them but the
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:21.040]  point is is that to side issue but yes I'm sure that's what's going on but
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:23.640]  that's big news that you've talked to his main assistant and that's what they're
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:28.120]  saying look look here's the deal but breast cancer is on average 3000% up the
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:32.480]  US leads it what's going on with breast cancer and why do we never hear I got
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:36.720]  info to Lance Armstrong I don't know five six years ago through two different
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:40.960]  people one a big stockbroker that was on a board with him a big you know hundred
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:44.840]  million-air type guy that was on it in some of his charities I'll just leave it
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:49.600]  at that and he's like hey I'm gonna get this you know this info on 9-11 but
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.280]  also you know this info on health and stuff about cancer you know you know
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.000]  being spread through vaccines and other things I'm gonna get to Lance so I got
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.360]  some info together for Lance Armstrong got it through him and there's somebody
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:06.880]  else and guess what Lance Armstrong wanted me to get the message about Dr.
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:11.720]  Wallet guess what he said what do you say he just said you're a coot you know
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:16.400]  crazy conspiracy theorist oh yeah yeah I mean I don't well I don't want to talk
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.680]  to that coot conspiracy theorist and I don't want that stuff so I mean they
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:24.440]  just don't want to know so so why won't anybody ask Dr. Wallach why is it all
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.920]  exploding why is it increasing well there's very simple reasons first of all
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:33.920]  there's one simple mineral called selenium which is one of these 60
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:39.240]  essential minerals we need there was a wonderful study done by Dr. Gerhard
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:43.360]  Trouser the guy who discovered at the University of Wisconsin in Madison 1957
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.520]  that selenium is an essential nutrient and he found and published it 1982 that
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:54.000]  you can reduce your risk of breast cancer by more than 80% simply by taking
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.960]  200 micrograms one-fifth of a milligram of selenium then in 1998 the guy in the
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:02.760]  name of Larry Clark from the University of Arizona did a big double blind study
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:07.880]  gold standard 1300 people seven years found that he could reduce the risk of
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:14.760]  prostate cancer by 69% colorectal cancer by 64% by 200 micrograms of selenium and
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:19.240]  here it comes I can show you and this is a great show to release this on how to
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:24.240]  reduce the risk of breast cancer by 462% there's a big study it was kind of a
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:28.280]  relook of a meta study if you would by the University of South Carolina came
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:32.560]  out in 1998 and he looked at the Harvard nurses health study which is a 20 year
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.200]  study on these 90,000 nurses and he did something nobody else did he looked at
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.960]  how they cook their food and he found out women who ate their meat cooked very
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:45.320]  well done like doctors suggest so or demand so you don't get salmonella
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:49.920]  and E. Coli if they cook their meat the way the doctors say over women who cook
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:53.400]  their meat medium or medium rare increased the risk of breast cancer by
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:57.280]  462% that's the number they give well there's actually a bunch of studies yeah
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.160]  generally cancer you shouldn't burn the meat but but you know why the doctors
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:03.560]  for 20 years have said that doctor I know you know why they're now
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:07.760]  irradiating even good cuts of meat they want to be able to not have proper
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:12.840]  protocol at slaughterhouses so they spray a live virus a vaccine on it that
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:16.520]  eats the bacteria so so but there's a bunch of other stuff they found that
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.560]  gets me guys type in viral sprays for me it'll be ABC news five years ago but
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:23.800]  it's now system-wide that's causing a lot of gut disorders actually a live
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:28.080]  vaccine they spray that on the meat and they want to be able to feed you rotten
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.400]  meat so they tell you burn it that that's why and the doctors just repeat
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.840]  whatever the industries pay the AMA to say go ahead I'm sorry well that's fine
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:41.160]  just for those little which I say pieces that fill in the cracks it's very
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:45.440]  important that I learned something from you there and basically if everybody
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.480]  were to cook their meat medium or medium rare we would drop breast cancer by
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:56.000]  462% then you throw in 200 micrograms of selenium you stay away from salad
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.200]  dressings which have the trans fatty acids the oils and the odds of getting
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:04.920]  breast cancer prostate cancer colon cancer would be zero now diabetes is
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:10.520]  another subject it's a deficiency of a single mineral which what we do is we
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:15.720]  like to add that secret mineral to the Alex pack which is the basic 90 60
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.240]  mineral 16 vitamins 12-centimeter asses the Alex pack and then you throw in what
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:24.040]  we call sweeties to it has a that without the secret sauce my kids love
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:27.520]  those it's candy but it's really concentrated minerals and vitamins they
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:32.080]  love the beyond Tangy tangerine they drink it at half strength they love all
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:34.840]  of it I love the rebound instead of drinking coffee in the afternoon in
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:39.400]  fact I'm about to have my rebound and my a pollen burst plus is what I well
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:43.080]  as soon as I work out of the rebound but I mainly do pollen burst plus every day
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:46.120]  since they're staring at the rebound but I'm about to do go to a pollen burst
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:50.720]  plus right now all of that it's called the Alex pack info worse health com try
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:56.000]  it folks and I'll be shocked everyone I know that's tried it in fact I've got us
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.240]  we're getting testimonials of listeners on here and and and because it is
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:03.840]  unbelievable Dr. Wallach that's why I hyperventilate when I talk about this it
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:10.200]  is unbelievable what these different proprietary mixes you and your other
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:13.400]  scientists have developed at young Jevity and it's all an info worse
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:18.360]  health com discounted folks well one of the things that people always ask me
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:21.960]  Alex he says they'll say you're making some pretty bold claims that you know
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:25.440]  you can make somebody an x diabetic in two to 14 days you can reverse
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:29.520]  dementias in as quickly as two weeks after they've been diagnosed with
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:34.280]  Alzheimer's disease for eight years how can you do that well guess what some of
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:37.740]  this information goes back to the year 1712 was discovered by a Japanese
[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:41.240]  naval surgeon we're gonna we're gonna do two more segments with you and update

[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:12.560]  think you probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:17.000]  been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story of 2012
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:22.080]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:27.320]  much as 400% in coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be just a
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:31.640]  matter of time before the lights start going out across America but here's some
[02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:37.160]  good news there's an underground video at exposed 123.com that thousands of

[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:46.480]  monopoly the video at exposed 123.com has already been banned by Google and the
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:50.320]  liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in

[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:39.000]  in to come to the archetype of what they're becoming so this is a great
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:44.680]  way to wake somebody up and it's a 60 page long magazine glossy now it's now

[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:49.400]  our and we're not sure but in closing before we go to break real fast your
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:55.400]  take on the meningitis news. Of course this is just typical of the medical
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:58:01.360]  pharmaceutical production areas of 30,000 people in America die each year in
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:04.360]  households because doctors don't wash their hands I'm sure the same thing was
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:09.800]  going on this aphorjillus that contaminated this vaccine or this
[02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:16.240]  steroid that they're injecting people for back pain is bread mold aphorjillus
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:19.280]  bread mold okay and so somebody got their sandwich in there when they
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:24.600]  shouldn't have in their shirt pocket or something and then basically nobody
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.160]  should be taking these back of these drugs anyway somebody has back pain
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:33.200]  even Harvard Medical School said don't do that come to the Alex pack throw in

[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:51.520]  We'll put infowarshealth.com in a moment and I'll give that out. Moving quick Dr.
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:56.120]  Wallach, you know I love how when big agra poisons food then they want to take
[03:00:56.120 --> 03:01:01.160]  over the small farmers. Anything else on the meningitis news versus vaccine
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:10.600]  dangers and your quick comments on GMO. Dr. Wallach. Yeah because I told him it
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:13.480]  was overdrive and we were gonna hold him and he probably thought the show was
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:18.440]  over but that's okay. Anyways ladies and gentlemen so much going on so much
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:25.920]  happening here in this operation. Now we are gonna have Dan Baddondi able to
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:35.920]  report with us. He's normally down here as one of our reporters but instead he
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:41.640]  is up visiting with his family in Rhode Island so we'll have news for you on
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:49.720]  that front. I hope this is all completely overhyped and that there is
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:02:00.400]  not a big issue and I certainly hope that people don't try to take advantage of
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:08.200]  any of these crises that are happening to engage in any type of power grab but
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:12.400]  we know what the White House Chief of Staff, former White House Chief of Staff
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:17.280]  now Chicago boss Rahm Emanuel said. We know what he had to say about all of
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:25.160]  that. Don't ever let a good crisis go to waste and I'm telling you folks focus is
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:31.040]  the real human attribute. Being awake, being aware, being alive, not being
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:36.320]  lackadaisical, not being in a dreamland like your friends and family are, getting
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:38.800]  people out of that. It's one thing when you're lying on the couch to be in
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.880]  dreamland that people are always lying on the couch now mentally even when
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:44.880]  they're out driving their cars and they're living. Everything is a dreamland.
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:49.120]  There's no awareness of anything that's going around. No awareness of things
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:53.320]  happening. This is the collapse of society we see that we are accelerating
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:57.120]  towards and I got to tell you out of the first issue and the second issue I am
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:01.920]  blown away by this third issue of Info Wars magazine that deals with
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:06.600]  consciousness. American government forces restart of Japanese nuclear
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:11.960]  reactors, kill, kill, kills, another article from food to foe, QE infinity,
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:15.600]  printable gun revolution, TSA reinstates approval to film policy after
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:21.640]  backlash, rip USA, rest in peace, how the new order hijacked save the planet and
[03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:28.800]  so much more and then it's got all of the big zombie articles in it. It's got
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:35.440]  all of the big zombie page 10 and 11 sheeple in the zombie apocalypse pages
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:40.320]  12 to 13 breaking the zombie programming we can become conscious, secret
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:46.200]  life of zombies, idiot bucks. Those are the four stories on consciousness with
[03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:49.840]  all the government documents, all the admissions, how they're putting you into
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:55.720]  a trance state and literally how children have just been turned over to
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:59.360]  television by all of this. I wanted to get Dr. Wallach on. I got him on like 20
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:01.800]  minutes late because I had Ventura a little bit extra and the Skype wouldn't
[03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:05.760]  weren't and then we had like three segments with him. I wanted to get into
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:09.760]  GMO and get his take on that but you know what folks when I talk about
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:13.720]  the fact that getting off all the globalist garbage is important or
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:18.880]  reducing it as much as you can and at the same time getting the proper vitamins
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:24.360]  and minerals it is so important so that's my plug on that front as well.
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:30.360]  Coming up we're gonna get into people promising that they're going to riot. If
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:34.640]  Obama loses the promises to kill Romney, there's two developments there, the
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:45.080]  promises to riot and to loot during the hurricane. Who knows what's
[03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:48.160]  gonna happen with Hurricane Sandy. I hope it's on a repeat of what we saw in
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:54.280]  Katrina but a much larger scale and all the news is at info wars.com. We'll be
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:05:05.000]  back tonight at 7 o'clock Central with PrisonPlanet.tv with a nightly news.
