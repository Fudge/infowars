[00:00.000 --> 00:10.880]  From the front lines of the information war it's Owen Troyer you're listening to the
[00:10.880 --> 00:40.420]  Alex Jones show Google's
[00:40.420 --> 00:46.420]  fake CEO Sundar Pichai is testing my test of my giving a testimony right now
[00:46.420 --> 00:53.800]  excuse me a Google hearing Alex Jones is live right now on the hill with Roger
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.200]  Stone let's go live
[00:57.200 --> 01:06.860]  this whole rules about the EU how over passing laws about regulations all
[01:06.860 --> 01:12.020]  this stuff that just says that you opt in instead of out but still all the
[01:12.020 --> 01:16.140]  companies are allowed to spot you and control you the EU only came in and put
[01:16.140 --> 01:20.620]  pressure on Google and others so that they would be even bigger in sensors
[01:20.620 --> 01:25.180]  this is all they caught on tape with Google executives and Zuckerberg and
[01:25.180 --> 01:28.220]  others on tape from Facebook with Merkel when she says you've got to stop the
[01:28.220 --> 01:31.780]  nationalist talking about our open borders he says next year the algorithm
[01:31.780 --> 01:35.440]  goes in we're gonna stop them all cold and you know what next year was this
[01:35.440 --> 01:38.680]  year and the algorithm went in six months ago they were having congressional
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.500]  hearings in there and that committee and they were saying at lunch we saw
[01:42.500 --> 01:46.940]  info awards was the top of where this cannot be allowed and they said we saw
[01:46.940 --> 01:50.780]  that too and we fixed it by hand they said well that's not quick enough and
[01:50.780 --> 01:55.020]  they said it's it's okay the algorithm goes in in two months two months later
[01:55.020 --> 01:58.700]  the algorithm went in and everybody's really getting banned they program the
[01:58.700 --> 02:03.520]  algorithm oh don't worry a super computer decides what's hate speech all
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.980]  of them stuff didn't they misrepresent what I've said what I've done they tell
[02:07.980 --> 02:11.780]  lies about what I see it for and then I can't even respond back this is part of
[02:11.780 --> 02:15.340]  a larger plan so they want to rock or stone it's demonizing these hearings
[02:15.340 --> 02:20.940]  I think you're interested we ever decoded the serens no in the bottom line it's
[02:20.940 --> 02:25.960]  really simple Apple Google Facebook Twitter and there you have engaged in
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.580]  racketeering and anti-trust activities of violation of US law in a blatant attempt
[02:31.580 --> 02:35.540]  to strangle our first amendment rights and remove us from the so-called town
[02:35.540 --> 02:40.140]  square we're opposed to censorship left right or center doesn't matter who you
[02:40.140 --> 02:44.380]  are you should have free unfettered access to the Internet and Google also ranks as a
[02:44.380 --> 02:47.500]  utility explain that to them they operate as utility under law that's how
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.540]  they could liability protection that's how they can they can have all these
[02:50.540 --> 02:53.580]  people posting on their platforms they have a lot of really protection so should
[02:53.580 --> 02:57.460]  they be regulated like utilities they're already happy yes they're already
[02:57.460 --> 03:03.140]  happy yes and how do you think that that would work well number one Sundar
[03:03.140 --> 03:08.540]  should be charged with perjury before Congress I mean they're charging other
[03:08.540 --> 03:14.420]  people you know supposedly from the front of Congress but it's not clear 100% he
[03:14.420 --> 03:18.460]  got up there in line about his communications with people at Google
[03:18.460 --> 03:22.660]  to basically have people will vote for Democrats it's all there he says I
[03:22.660 --> 03:26.420]  know nothing about it yes it's a real email but that's not my interpretation
[03:26.420 --> 03:30.100]  of what you're saying okay he gets up there he knows damn well you turn off all
[03:30.100 --> 03:34.740]  those folks then they just don't let you have the features that most folks get
[03:34.740 --> 03:38.620]  you but you're still trapped but you're still trapped when you hopped out you
[03:38.620 --> 03:42.380]  just hopped out to be able to use and then they lie to a Google
[03:42.380 --> 03:47.340]  specifically how how do you regulate the same way the telephone companies
[03:47.340 --> 03:53.180]  regulated you can't deny somebody telephone they already passed in the 90s
[03:53.180 --> 03:57.140]  and then again in 2000 the Digital Millennium Copyright Act saved Harvard
[03:57.140 --> 04:03.980]  laws and under section 230 they are a utility and they have no liability to
[04:03.980 --> 04:13.140]  take stuff off unless it's been found to be illegal law enforcement has
[04:13.140 --> 04:18.420]  contacted them or things like that that's the way these work I'm under that
[04:18.420 --> 04:23.820]  to buy a message boards on infowords.com okay and I'm not liable when
[04:23.820 --> 04:27.180]  somebody goes on there and says I'm gonna go kill somebody now when I get
[04:27.180 --> 04:32.940]  subpoenaed for the IP address it's that many times I give law enforcement the
[04:32.940 --> 04:36.860]  subpoena that they've actually arrested. Alex Jones is 100% correct ladies and
[04:36.860 --> 04:41.980]  gentlemen. Sundar Pichai under oath said we have no plans to launch anything in
[04:41.980 --> 04:46.020]  China there is no such thing as Project Dragonfly even though it's been widely
[04:46.020 --> 04:51.820]  reported even in the Washington Post that's perjury who is Sundar Pichai who
[04:51.820 --> 05:00.580]  is the real CEO of Google will the real CEO of Google please stand up. In the last
[05:00.580 --> 05:05.020]  few months info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of
[05:05.020 --> 05:08.340]  many of our best-selling items and then I came up with the idea last week let's
[05:08.340 --> 05:11.820]  not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide 50 to 75% off
[05:11.820 --> 05:18.580]  double-patriot points let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every
[05:18.580 --> 05:22.380]  order even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal silver iodine 4 to 5
[05:22.380 --> 05:27.660]  super blue you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies
[05:27.660 --> 05:30.940]  last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are
[05:30.940 --> 05:34.740]  gonna be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of
[05:34.740 --> 05:38.340]  the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes
[05:38.340 --> 05:42.260]  up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have
[05:42.260 --> 05:47.140]  beyond any other sale we've ever had so this is a loss leader we are losing
[05:47.140 --> 05:50.540]  money on this this is our biggest sell ever get your free gift your free
[05:50.540 --> 05:54.380]  shipping everything and don't fight the crowds info or store.com info
[05:54.380 --> 05:58.580]  warslife.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine God bless you
[05:58.580 --> 06:01.620]  and thank you for your support
[06:05.620 --> 06:11.940]  you are listening to an info wars.com frontline report
[06:11.940 --> 06:22.940]  and now your host Owen shroyer
[06:42.900 --> 06:49.300]  gentlemen chanting at the fake CEO Sundar Pachai of Google who has lied under
[06:49.300 --> 06:54.100]  oath today and is in the middle of a hearing but Alex Jones is live right
[06:54.100 --> 06:56.980]  now talking to some people who are avoiding and they're scared of him
[06:56.980 --> 06:59.940]  let's go live to Alex Jones
[06:59.940 --> 07:11.820]  okay we're gonna pull away from that Alex is well he's not FEC friendly right
[07:11.820 --> 07:17.620]  now so do we dump that we'll go ahead and dump that and we're gonna we're
[07:17.620 --> 07:22.460]  gonna let Alex do his thing let me just tell you something folks this is
[07:22.460 --> 07:26.100]  absolutely crazy is Sundar Pachai still live right now guys or did they take a
[07:26.100 --> 07:36.220]  recess okay let's go back to Alex live right now Sundar Pachai is still live
[07:36.220 --> 07:39.780]  in the Google hearings he's lied under oath it's the most unbelievable thing
[07:39.780 --> 07:42.660]  we've got the clips we're gonna go back Alex Jones and Roger Stoner they're on
[07:42.660 --> 07:58.740]  the hill right now let's go back live to Alex Jones and Roger Stoner
[08:12.660 --> 08:16.460]  there are the fact checkers that actually tell Google what to do this is
[08:16.460 --> 08:21.740]  outrageous people like Jack Borsig over at CNN of the new plot books
[08:21.740 --> 08:28.780]  Roger you want to tell folks something about the most outrageous aspect
[08:28.780 --> 08:34.260]  Twitter says that you are falsely accused in the mainstream media and then when you
[08:34.260 --> 08:37.540]  issue your defense it doesn't get covered by the watcher
[08:37.540 --> 08:44.420]  so you would think well I can take the social media to defend myself except for
[08:44.420 --> 08:48.980]  your band social media or your censor and social media so it affords you no
[08:48.980 --> 08:53.100]  avenue no platform to defend yourself it's unamerica and you don't get to a
[08:53.100 --> 09:12.980]  traditional game utility yes we had it right under session yes they're not following the regulations the internet and these tech giants and everybody from a website with a message board to Facebook operates under the fact that you're not a publisher you have your site
[09:12.980 --> 09:25.220]  publish articles under your name but we need to allow comments or people have message boards or high tech things on Facebook social media they're not liable for what somebody says there unless it's criminal
[09:25.220 --> 09:36.220]  ladies and gentlemen we're live from info wars world headquarters here in Austin Texas it's Tuesday December 11 2018 absolutely crazy day here at info wars dot com Alex Jones and Roger Stoner live right now
[09:36.220 --> 09:48.980]  Sundar Pichai the fake CEO of Google is in the middle of a hearing right now with the most pathetic inept Congress I think I've ever seen and it seems like nobody knows what's going on except maybe Jim Jordan but let's go live right now to Alex Jones and Roger
[09:48.980 --> 10:12.460]  Stoner now the center of attention outside of the Google hearing yes yes the internet was designed in the United States of England and the real inventor of the internet who's the one who lives in Boston MIT helped design this man and he said we should go back to that where he has a new plan that will ask a certain bit now on Google and Facebook and others who have a basic complete monopoly and so the true inventors of the internet got together and
[10:12.460 --> 10:28.460]  said that we have a authoritarian centralized tech giants who have merged with China and that the planet is in great danger and these guys are real quote these are the real inventors of the internet and you go right down the line and they're all sounding the
[10:28.460 --> 10:54.460]  fact that they like to play that they're a neutral public forum under section 230 of the communications decency act so that they can remove from liability in lawsuits when they allow liberal publications to slander Alex Jones immediately on their platform yet they remove him and act in their own form of bias so therefore they cannot no longer play with their neutral public forum
[10:54.460 --> 11:13.460]  they call me a Nazi and then not show any proof or anything a literal Nazi and then I can't even go on Facebook if Facebook had it because I'm mostly posted I can't even respond on it I mean they don't let it just swoop in especially Twitter YouTube anytime we actually write down what's happening here's
[11:13.460 --> 11:25.460]  here's the example I was here a few months ago and the only reason I was still allowed to do on Twitter and Jack was here and he got up and I'm from Congress of course they're looking at the dining room for that and they discussed it it was a totally lie
[11:25.460 --> 11:46.460]  and I put camera up to him and I say how dare you go around and lie about me and try to get me taken off the internet and then brag about it and I say man that's really evil what you're doing he's a grown adult doing his job in a public space
[11:46.460 --> 12:04.460]  Congress in the hall and there are people at the same time with the velocity forward deal chaining themselves and yelling and screaming and the meeting is oh that's wonderful that's American democracy I just talked to him like this and say how dare you lie about me how dare you go to publishers and then get people to work their fire
[12:04.460 --> 12:24.460]  how dare you destroy all of my sponsors how dare you have these night after night lies on CNN when you're so called media organization saying I should be taken off the air but CNN is known for fake news on purpose and they said that I bullied him and Twitter took me down so I bullied a reporter who was saying he was starting to destroy my life and that's bully standing up
[12:24.460 --> 12:49.460]  so Alex is in DC right now with Roger Stone we have a crew there Millie Weaver other reporters cameraman getting all the scenes for you we're we're bringing to you live right now we're going to be here all day ladies and gentlemen and we'll give you the updates now we've got the clips from Google's fake CEO
[12:49.460 --> 12:57.460]  Arpachai which I just decided I'm going with that now soon Arpachai is the fake CEO of Google let's go live now to the police officer Tom Alex
[12:57.460 --> 13:20.460]  so the officer is just telling Alex how he can avoid getting in trouble you know just kind of obey these guidelines
[13:20.460 --> 13:49.460]  and let's not forget the project Veritas undercover videos where they get the Google employees they get the YouTube employees and they mentioned him for was an Alex Jones by name and then soon Arpachai says under oath
[13:49.460 --> 14:08.460]  there's no bias I know it's been something so as you can see there's obviously a media gaggle around Alex now as he's walking through the halls of Congress
[14:08.460 --> 14:20.460]  there have been other protests outside of the Google hearing today there was a sign that said stop Google censorship there was another man that had a Google logo on the Chinese flag
[14:20.460 --> 14:35.460]  now there's the iconic shot right there that's going to be published Alex Jones and Roger Stone walking through the halls of Congress and it looks like they're going to maybe get ready for a little press conference or something here
[14:35.460 --> 14:41.460]  by the way the monopoly man was trolling soon Darpachai today sitting behind him in the gallery
[14:41.460 --> 15:07.460]  he's all over there all he said on his long haul list you guys will do it over here, come on Roger, right here
[15:07.460 --> 15:13.780]  features but they still protract your movements. The denial that there is any evidence of the
[15:13.780 --> 15:19.860]  systematic censorship of conservatives, or libertarians, or public intelligence on the internet is
[15:19.860 --> 15:26.420]  laughable and false. I have to wonder whether Congressmen are divers to lose you or whether it is
[15:26.420 --> 15:33.620]  purposeful. Here's the bottom line. Google is on record. CNET News reports that when you think
[15:33.620 --> 15:38.100]  you turn the features off, like location tracking, you just lose your features. They're still tracking
[15:38.100 --> 15:42.740]  everything. You know, it's clear to me, folks. This is the answer. We have to go to DC and go to
[15:42.740 --> 15:47.460]  these events and make a big fuss. Because these congressmen, they're so inept. They think America
[15:47.460 --> 15:50.980]  is dead. We're not dead yet. We're going to be right back. Rob Dew's Twitter account, Millie
[15:50.980 --> 15:54.100]  Weaver's Twitter account, Lee Schranhan's going live. We got live coverage in the break, but we'll
[15:54.100 --> 15:57.140]  be right back with Alec Jones and Roger Stone live from Congress during the Google hearings.

[19:59.220 --> 20:17.540]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:17.540 --> 20:19.540]  I remember when Alex Jones went to Congress
[20:21.860 --> 20:25.460]  and was one of the few real men that was willing to stand up to tyranny.
[20:25.460 --> 20:29.780]  Let's go live to Roger Stone and Alex Jones taking questions from the press right now.
[20:56.420 --> 21:00.100]  The president told him to take somebody off and push them through the campaign.
[21:00.100 --> 21:02.260]  They'd be totally legal for the president to do it another way.
[21:02.260 --> 21:05.780]  Why would the president give you something that's illegal to do it for his lawyer?
[21:11.300 --> 21:15.460]  One thing I do know is that as Dr. C.M.A. made his own decision,
[21:15.460 --> 21:18.980]  if there were any other decisions that I'd like to make here, I'd perform at the D.P.
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.100]  What about D.Bossy?
[21:20.100 --> 21:26.820]  If D.Bossy is acting at the right point, what are you going to call it?
[21:26.820 --> 21:28.020]  Let's expand on this, though.
[21:28.020 --> 21:30.660]  Guys, Google is lying to Congress.
[21:30.660 --> 21:33.860]  They censor conservatives and nationals all over the world.
[21:33.860 --> 21:37.460]  We've got the memos, we've got the videos with their head people talking about this,
[21:37.460 --> 21:41.700]  and the mainstream media plays along with this whole thing because mainstream media thinks
[21:41.700 --> 21:46.500]  their competition is talkshelves and people on Facebook or Twitter.
[21:46.500 --> 21:50.820]  No, your competition is Google and Facebook themselves who decide who the traffic goes.
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.900]  I mean, they're never going to give you traffic.
[21:52.900 --> 21:56.740]  They want to basically extinct all competition and consolidate power and control.
[21:56.740 --> 22:00.500]  This is a monopoly issue, and Congress needs to break up Google.
[22:00.500 --> 22:04.500]  They need to break up things like Facebook because they become criminal organizations,
[22:04.500 --> 22:08.900]  and now we have the political parties fighting over the control of them because they become censors.
[22:08.900 --> 22:11.220]  Instead of saying, hey, we shouldn't use the ring of Mordor,
[22:11.220 --> 22:14.820]  we shouldn't put on the ring of censorship, destroy everybody that uses it,
[22:14.820 --> 22:17.940]  no, we're just going to fight over who gets control of the censorship.
[22:17.940 --> 22:22.100]  See, these are giant criminal censorship machines that are totally arrogant,
[22:22.100 --> 22:25.380]  that are mind-wild, that are engaged in all sorts of criminal activity,
[22:25.380 --> 22:27.460]  and they cite them as democratic parties.
[22:27.460 --> 22:31.140]  They cite them as socialists all over the world, and that's their business model.
[22:35.700 --> 22:36.660]  Well, they told us they were.
[22:36.660 --> 22:39.700]  According to the New York Times on January 20, 2017,
[22:39.700 --> 22:45.300]  I was in surveillance during the presidential campaign, but we didn't have a political cause.
[22:59.460 --> 23:04.260]  Let's expand on it. CNN and the New York Times reported
[23:04.260 --> 23:07.540]  that UniformWords.com was the source of the false news.
[23:07.540 --> 23:11.940]  In January of 2017, that Trump and Rochester and others were being surveilled.
[23:11.940 --> 23:16.500]  It was all later confirmed. It was all later confirmed because I wasn't the source.
[23:16.500 --> 23:19.300]  The Democrats, when he was president-elect, when Trump was president-elect,
[23:19.300 --> 23:22.740]  were still being vitriol. They were trying to stop the president from being seated,
[23:23.540 --> 23:28.100]  coming up on the 20th of January. They suddenly repealed the electoral college.
[23:28.660 --> 23:32.420]  And they were saying on the news, when he surveilled them, they know they're Russians.
[23:32.420 --> 23:37.140]  And Obama said, I'm giving all the media and the data I have proving Trumps are Russians.
[23:37.140 --> 23:40.180]  That was his bluff, to try to stop Trump from being seated.
[23:40.180 --> 23:42.820]  And to launch this whole fake brush of his case, it was already going on.
[23:42.820 --> 23:47.220]  So really, surveillance, out-Trump with campaign, then when Trump out-elected,
[23:47.220 --> 23:50.820]  the Pete State got scared and said, let's change it to a Washington investigation.
[23:50.820 --> 23:54.340]  And then they bragged to the media, oh, we've got the proof you were surveilling Trump.
[23:54.340 --> 23:57.540]  It was all over the Washington Post, 100 times ABC and CBS News.
[23:57.540 --> 23:59.940]  I was showing people clips of what it is, and they were saying,
[23:59.940 --> 24:03.460]  Jones is crazy. That's fake. It was never on the cover of the New York Times.
[24:03.460 --> 24:07.620]  Because they got caught. They thought, Lord, it's going to win. They're really going to shine.
[24:08.340 --> 24:12.580]  Way worse than Nixon ever did. And so they had to cover it up with a Russia investigation.
[24:12.580 --> 24:16.740]  It's an abuse of power, far more crazy than they have to know what it is.
[24:16.740 --> 24:34.740]  It is the use of the state's development to surveil unconstitutional, illegal, and vice-versa.
[24:39.700 --> 24:42.100]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we don't have the best audio right now
[24:42.100 --> 24:45.460]  from Alex and Roger. So I want to just switch over real quick
[24:45.460 --> 24:49.780]  to Sundar Pachai getting questioned by one of the worst in Congress, Eric Swalwell.
[24:49.780 --> 24:55.540]  In response to claims that Google has put its own results ahead of its competitors when its page
[24:55.540 --> 25:00.820]  rank algorithm believes the competitors should be ranked higher, Google has told certain
[25:00.820 --> 25:05.060]  international enforcers that local search results come from a specialized index,
[25:05.060 --> 25:08.180]  which is distinct from its organic data. This is the type of crap that people are sick of.
[25:08.180 --> 25:13.540]  Hey, Swalwell, get off your stupid little talking points and actually ask a real question,
[25:13.540 --> 25:19.540]  you bum! It's against that of content collected by third-party services using a page rank like
[25:19.540 --> 25:27.060]  quality score. We employ a wide variety of signals. We are interested in providing users. We respond
[25:27.060 --> 25:33.380]  to user feedback. All right, I'm already done with this. Go back to Jones. Boo! Fake CEO, fake
[25:33.380 --> 25:44.820]  congressman, get him out of here!
[26:03.380 --> 26:25.780]  Now, see, most of these people listening to Alex saying this think he's nuts or like,
[26:25.780 --> 26:31.860]  what? Like, oh yeah, no, that really happened. These people aren't even, see, most of the media,
[26:31.860 --> 26:38.020]  it doesn't even realize we're not in cans anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:38.020 --> 26:43.780]  Oh yeah, Jones, I'm sure you have Mueller trying to set you up. We got the documents,
[26:43.780 --> 27:12.900]  they were spying on us during the campaign.
[27:12.900 --> 27:40.020]  Cause like, what the hell is up with that stupid little guy?
[27:40.020 --> 28:09.020]  I know because I've had them target me. I know because I've had them try to support me. I know because they put, you know, financial crime, forced labor, you know, I have perfect credit, perfect maintenance credit, merchant credit, they put, six months ago, a designation in America. It's classified under information.
[28:09.020 --> 28:24.020]  You the bank document said I'm basically a terrorist. I mean, I have been designated like a drug cartel or a mass murderer who's most wanted, but I have no criminal record, and I have perfect credit, and now they have already, like, China has the social score.
[28:24.020 --> 28:41.020]  And look at all the digging that they've done into Trump and his associates, and what do they have? Nothing. They have nothing. So we're about to go to another break here. Ladies and gentlemen, if you like us sending a crew to D.C. with Alex Jones and him trolling these people and making a scene, go to infowarstore.com.
[28:41.020 --> 28:53.020]  Do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com so that we can send Alex over there with a crew more often. We can send other reporters there because you know what's sad when you watch these hearings? You see how pathetic our Congress is.
[28:53.020 --> 29:11.020]  So that means we have to go there and be real men and women and raise these real issues. infowarstore.com. We'll be right back.
[29:23.020 --> 29:29.020]  And save $10 on the Bug Beam Laser Combo, only at bugasalt.com.
[29:54.020 --> 30:12.020]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children. They want to abort children. They want to disease children.
[30:12.020 --> 30:22.020]  They want to abuse children. They want to confuse children. They want their essence. They want their soul. They want their spirit. They want their power because they are our future.
[30:22.020 --> 30:32.020]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, that holds for sacrifice. It is about the West. It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[30:32.020 --> 30:45.020]  So I just want to thank you all for your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for Info Wars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[30:45.020 --> 31:00.020]  You have the power to override the sensors. You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks. I know you've been taking action and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[31:00.020 --> 31:19.020]  Info Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing. We've been proven dead on. You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you.
[31:19.020 --> 31:33.020]  All words are not enough. Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance, and open free society against the globalists and the dominant world force.
[31:33.020 --> 31:44.020]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase, human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[31:44.020 --> 32:00.020]  So that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that Info Wars really is your baby. I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to infowarsport.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding Info War, a true 360 win.

[33:37.020 --> 33:59.020]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone and the Monopoly Man are live from Congress as the fake CEO of Google, Sundar Pachai, who clearly knows nothing. I know nothing! Sergeant Schultz, I know nothing, I see nothing!
[33:59.020 --> 34:03.020]  Oh, it's Swalwell and Alex Jones. Let's go live!
[34:03.020 --> 34:08.020]  It's Swalwell as well. That's really a big layup.
[34:08.020 --> 34:13.020]  Why do you have a wall on the set of this? We got one inside the living room.
[34:13.020 --> 34:17.020]  There's the Swalwell as well!
[34:17.020 --> 34:44.020]  Swalwell has just broken a new 40-yard dash record running from Alex Jones. Unbelievable. The guy needs to go to the InfoTon line.
[34:44.020 --> 34:48.020]  I'll tell you what, I think Eric Swal... Excuse me, I was going to say something else.
[34:48.020 --> 34:51.020]  Swalwell as well? What's his name? Swalwell as well?
[34:51.020 --> 35:03.020]  He took off running so quick from Alex Jones. What's that? I'm getting from our sideline reporter. He may have pulled a hamstring. He ran so fast when he saw Alex Jones.
[35:03.020 --> 35:12.020]  Unbelievable. He broke a land speed record for any mammal. Eric Swalwell today running from Alex Jones.
[35:12.020 --> 35:17.020]  It was like a blur. You really couldn't even tell it was Swalwell. He was running so fast.
[35:17.020 --> 35:24.020]  Let's see if we can hear Alex and Roger Stone talking.
[35:24.020 --> 35:33.020]  Alright, we've got bad audio there, so let's pull out of that. Is Sundar Pichai, the fake CEO of Google, still giving testimony right now?
[35:33.020 --> 35:40.020]  Alright, let's go to the horrible, awful Democrat from California, Ted Liu, questioning the fake CEO of Google.
[35:40.020 --> 35:46.020]  And bad search results. Don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter. Consider blaming yourself.
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.020]  Oh, it's my fault.
[35:48.020 --> 35:59.020]  Jones time has expired. They don't recognize the young man. Teddy Boy, good old Ted Liu. Out there in California for over a decade, and your streets are riddled with feces and drugs.
[35:59.020 --> 36:10.020]  With one point made by the last... You see, Ted Liu needs Google to censor the search results when you search what's going on in Ted Liu's district.
[36:10.020 --> 36:14.020]  So the Democrats need Google to censor the truth about their own policies.
[36:14.020 --> 36:19.020]  There's very few constraints on the First Amendment, although there are lots of constraints ultimately when we start looking at it.
[36:19.020 --> 36:25.020]  Everything from libel to slander, to threatening, intimidating, to yelling fire in the crowd.
[36:25.020 --> 36:35.020]  We have constraints on First Amendment speech, but you've seemed, as we've gone through here today, to say that Google doesn't have bias.
[36:35.020 --> 36:44.020]  You yourself have said you personally don't have bias or animus, and you've also tried to implement policies to prevent bias.
[36:44.020 --> 36:54.020]  So Google has denied any bias. Sundar Pichai has lied under oath multiple times today. Let's go back live to Alec Jones and Roger Stone in Congress, outside of these hearings.
[36:54.020 --> 37:04.020]  Here's what I want to do. I want to go outside the location, and I want to go live on the show, so I'm going to go with Skype, so I can get a earpiece.
[37:04.020 --> 37:10.020]  So let's just get set up and then do that and then leave.
[37:10.020 --> 37:16.020]  You got it, boss. So that's the key. All right. So Alex is going to get set up, guys.
[37:16.020 --> 37:23.020]  The crew is going to get in touch with Alex, and him and Roger are going to get connected with us, and we're going to go live.
[37:23.020 --> 37:30.020]  All right. So you guys monitor that. Let's go back here live. We're going to get Alex Jones, I imagine, live next segment.
[37:30.020 --> 37:38.020]  It looks like he's kind of shaking hands and doing something right now. Let me get Alex's audio one more time real quick.
[37:38.020 --> 37:40.020]  I think it's been a pretty successful mission.
[37:40.020 --> 37:44.020]  It's been pretty good. You got to yell at Sundar. That was good.
[37:44.020 --> 37:47.020]  We got to hear him lie to Congress a couple of times, so that was fun.
[37:47.020 --> 37:54.020]  You know, Sundar helping run death camps in China's other guild.
[37:54.020 --> 37:57.020]  We need to confront Nadler on the fact that one of his largest contributors is Alphabet, which is a Google fair company.
[37:57.020 --> 37:58.020]  That's a good idea.
[37:58.020 --> 38:00.020]  That's why he was so biased during the hearing.
[38:00.020 --> 38:02.020]  Same with Beto. Beto's...
[38:02.020 --> 38:05.020]  That's a good point. Nadler's in the pocket of Google.
[38:05.020 --> 38:13.020]  Yeah, Nadler's opening testimony today was so pathetic. The guy is such a piece of trash, man. I'm sorry. It's just...
[38:13.020 --> 38:16.020]  Just a known con man, just a known liar.
[38:16.020 --> 38:19.020]  So that's our own Millie. We were doing commentary.
[38:19.020 --> 38:28.020]  All right, guys, let's go out of this. Let's get connected with Alex. Now, let's go back live to the Google hearing.
[38:28.020 --> 38:32.020]  Oh, there's that attempt to manipulate your system.
[38:32.020 --> 38:37.020]  There may be attempts to use our products and services.
[38:37.020 --> 38:45.020]  So, for example, because we provide advertising products, somebody, and what we saw in the 2016 election was limited activity, but it's improper.
[38:45.020 --> 38:50.020]  Okay, the monopoly man now has wads of cash out. Who is this guy?
[38:50.020 --> 38:52.020]  That total is 4,700 bucks, I think you said.
[38:52.020 --> 38:59.020]  Yeah, so that's an example of the kind of threat we see and something we are working hard to mitigate and avoid.
[38:59.020 --> 39:07.020]  Okay, and so I guess I would say that it looks like you guys have a policy of do no evil, right? Is that fair to say?
[39:07.020 --> 39:08.020]  Google is evil.
[39:08.020 --> 39:10.020]  It's not our official policy, but it's a statement.
[39:10.020 --> 39:13.020]  It's not our official policy because our official policy is evil.
[39:13.020 --> 39:17.020]  And people have brought up the...
[39:17.020 --> 39:19.020]  We spy on you, sell your data, you know, it's all good.
[39:19.020 --> 39:30.020]  China, and I want a clarification of that. Are you looking to expand in China and cooperate with the Chinese government on a platform release in China?
[39:30.020 --> 39:35.020]  To the question, it's about search. Right now, we have no plans to launch a search in China.
[39:35.020 --> 39:36.020]  Boom! Committing perjury again.
[39:36.020 --> 39:40.020]  We have always wanted to explore how best we can continue to serve users in China, but that's what we do.
[39:40.020 --> 39:41.020]  Cheers to the fake CEO Google.
[39:41.020 --> 39:43.020]  Fake CEO Google for committing perjury again.
[39:43.020 --> 39:45.020]  Are you doing anything with Chinese government?
[39:45.020 --> 39:53.020]  Today, we don't operate our services which involve user data like Google search or Gmail in China.
[39:53.020 --> 39:56.020]  So you're telling me nothing at all in China?
[39:56.020 --> 40:00.020]  We do provide, for example, Android, which is an operating system.
[40:00.020 --> 40:06.020]  We work with partners around the world, and there are OEM manufacturers around the world, including in China.
[40:06.020 --> 40:11.020]  So manufacturers, but beyond manufacturers, any other platform use?
[40:11.020 --> 40:15.020]  We don't have any special agreements on user data.
[40:15.020 --> 40:16.020]  To the Chinese government.
[40:16.020 --> 40:19.020]  Mr. Pichai, do you like to dance?
[40:19.020 --> 40:24.020]  Do you share the data that you collect on civilians with the United States federal government?
[40:24.020 --> 40:31.020]  We comply with valid law enforcement request and, you know, we do process.
[40:31.020 --> 40:35.020]  Google has all of these secret contracts.
[40:35.020 --> 40:36.020]  This is ridiculous.
[40:36.020 --> 40:39.020]  Google is the NSA.
[40:39.020 --> 40:42.020]  This guy has no clue what's going on.
[40:42.020 --> 40:45.020]  Sunar Pichai is a straw man CEO.
[40:45.020 --> 40:54.020]  In May 2016, Google banned all ads by payday lenders, even though it invested in Linddup, which is effectively a payday lender.
[40:54.020 --> 40:59.020]  And it banned ads by competitors.
[40:59.020 --> 41:03.020]  Is that a normal practice?
[41:03.020 --> 41:13.020]  Congressman, we undertook ad policies in that particular area because we saw evidence of misuse, and we had gotten a lot of feedback, and that's what we reacted to.
[41:13.020 --> 41:18.020]  Did you ban your own Linddup app?
[41:18.020 --> 41:20.020]  I don't think Google is involved.
[41:20.020 --> 41:26.020]  I think one of our sister companies has an investment in Linddup.
[41:26.020 --> 41:28.020]  I think that's my understanding.
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.020]  Is it banned?
[41:29.020 --> 41:33.020]  I can follow up. I'm not aware of the specifics. I'm happy to follow up.
[41:33.020 --> 41:38.020]  So look, these congressmen, you know, I don't know what some of their deals is.
[41:38.020 --> 41:52.020]  Obviously, somebody like Hank Johnson and a Nadler are just, well, Hank Johnson's very low IQ, and it was actually stunned when the Texas Representative Smith brought up an email from Google and Hank Johnson was actually like, whoa, is that true?
[41:52.020 --> 41:55.020]  So maybe Hank Johnson is a genuine guy, just kind of low IQ.
[41:55.020 --> 42:13.020]  But regardless, the fake CEO of Google at the hearing right now has said they have no involvement in China, and he said there's no bias going on at any Google companies, even though Project Veritas has caught them on film doing this exact thing, bragging about it.
[42:13.020 --> 42:17.020]  But no one at this hearing has brought that up.
[42:17.020 --> 42:19.020]  That's pathetic.
[42:19.020 --> 42:22.020]  Not even Jim Jordan, who did the best job so far.
[42:22.020 --> 42:25.020]  Lee Smith from Texas did a great job.
[42:25.020 --> 42:27.020]  But it's not good enough, folks.
[42:27.020 --> 42:32.020]  I mean, people need to call this guy out for whatever the heck is going on at Google, okay?
[42:32.020 --> 42:38.020]  When we get back, I mean, I've got stories. This is just crazy. This guy's lying all through his teeth today.
[42:38.020 --> 42:39.020]  The fake CEO.
[42:39.020 --> 42:41.020]  All right. I didn't even plug.
[42:41.020 --> 42:44.020]  We got Alex Jones coming up in the next segment, hopefully live from DC.
[42:44.020 --> 42:46.020]  Folks, huge specials at infowarstore.com right now.
[42:46.020 --> 42:52.020]  That's how we're able to do everything. We want to expand. They're trying to contract us with the censorship and all the attacks on us.

[43:24.020 --> 43:27.020]  Best selling t-shirt while supplies last.

[43:31.020 --> 43:36.020]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[43:36.020 --> 43:39.020]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[43:39.020 --> 43:44.020]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.

[46:57.020 --> 47:21.020]  Again, you are the resistance.
[47:21.020 --> 47:31.020]  Thank you all for being with us today.
[47:31.020 --> 47:41.020]  Let's go back live to either the most inept incompetent CEO ever or a totally fake frontman CEO of Google.
[47:41.020 --> 47:51.020]  Thank you all for being with us today.
[47:51.020 --> 48:13.020]  And speaking of privacy and transparency, I'm trying to understand the difference between a paying customer for the Google sweets versus the free Gmail.
[48:13.020 --> 48:27.020]  Nobody cares. This guy's company is worldwide, one of the most powerful companies in the history of the world, censoring free speech, has an agenda, funding political movements, lying to you under oath, and you're going to ask about an email service.
[48:27.020 --> 48:37.020]  For example, to investigate security or abuse related to an account. On G Suite, we provide G Suite across many instances. We have clear policies against that.
[48:37.020 --> 48:39.020]  No one cares about G Suite.
[48:39.020 --> 48:51.020]  We don't distinguish between, so for example, today we provide G Suite for free to many educational institutions. We don't use that data for it from within G Suite for advertising.
[48:51.020 --> 48:53.020]  You collect it.
[48:53.020 --> 48:59.020]  Just tell me about all your services that I can render so that you can spy on me and collect my data.
[48:59.020 --> 49:03.020]  Tell me all the new services you offer that you don't censor.
[49:03.020 --> 49:09.020]  It has access to it, where they do have access.
[49:09.020 --> 49:15.020]  We have policies that they cannot access it unless they have specific consent from the user for a specific situation.
[49:15.020 --> 49:19.020]  Yeah, when you sign the terms and conditions, 500 pages long that you never read.
[49:19.020 --> 49:29.020]  You may want to investigate fraudulent activity related to your account and we may ask for your permission to do that. There may be a valid law enforcement requirement which we have to comply with.
[49:29.020 --> 49:35.020]  Let me explain something, though, because this is like the next level of propaganda that we have to deal with.
[49:35.020 --> 49:39.020]  Why? And see people say, oh my gosh, you can't say that. That's racist.
[49:39.020 --> 49:47.020]  No, no, no, no, no. Google is one of the biggest companies in the history of the world, came out of America. Why do we have this Indian running the company?
[49:47.020 --> 49:55.020]  You can't say that that's racist. No, that's not racist. This guy is clearly clueless. He's been here, I believe, for 15 years.
[49:55.020 --> 50:01.020]  And why is it we don't have an American running the company who's not totally clueless? I'll tell you why.
[50:01.020 --> 50:11.020]  Because they put this guy in charge of the company some panty-waste nanny from India with an accent so that you won't say anything.
[50:11.020 --> 50:19.020]  So that you won't question Google because you don't want to be thought of as racist. You say, oh, I don't want to question the brown man with the accent.
[50:19.020 --> 50:27.020]  I don't want to be a racist. So they put, they give you this, this straw man, fake CEO of Google to come out here and go up the talking points.
[50:27.020 --> 50:32.020]  Clearly has no clue what's going on. Whoever really runs Google is laughing their ass off behind the scenes right now.
[50:32.020 --> 50:38.020]  And then here's Sundar Pachai lying under oath. But see, but that's what they do. This is what globalism is all about.
[50:38.020 --> 50:52.020]  It's about replacing, it's about replacing something that wasn't broken and then using some sort of status like a minority status to keep you from even approaching it as a topic of discussion.
[50:52.020 --> 51:02.020]  So I'm not even allowed to discuss Sundar Pachai being the CEO of Google, being somebody from India. You can be from India, you can be anywhere.
[51:02.020 --> 51:09.020]  If you're good at your job, he's not good at his job. I've got stacks of news how Google's been fined, investigated, employee issues.
[51:09.020 --> 51:15.020]  I mean, literally stacks of news. And this is a CEO from India who has no clue what's going on.
[51:15.020 --> 51:23.020]  But I'm not allowed to question the brown man with the accent. That's what it's all about. That's the games they play. That's the propaganda.
[51:23.020 --> 51:30.020]  So now you have this whole country that's so scared of their own image in the mirror or saying something that might be politically incorrect.
[51:30.020 --> 51:37.020]  They won't even think about questioning Sundar Pachai because he's a brown man with an accent. That's how brainwashed people are in this country.
[51:37.020 --> 51:50.020]  That's how pathetic this is. And you even have members of Congress that are so afraid of their own image and someone from the Washington Post printing a story saying you're racist because you went after Pachai.
[51:50.020 --> 51:54.020]  That's how this whole thing runs. Let's go back to the fake CEO.
[51:54.020 --> 52:01.020]  We highlight, we give people information about where to register. We do these things representatively across for all our users across the U.S.
[52:01.020 --> 52:11.020]  And all indications are that the participation is uniformly high across our user base. So we do this with the express goal of...
[52:11.020 --> 52:18.020]  But how did you do it? Did you send out links? Did you send out voter registration forms to people?
[52:18.020 --> 52:26.020]  The general ladies' time is far, but you can ask the question. Thank you. For example, on the Google homepage, we may say check where you're polling places.
[52:26.020 --> 52:33.020]  And as a user, you can click on it and we give you the location of your closest polling locations and the opening times available to you.
[52:33.020 --> 52:36.020]  I'll be following up on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield.
[52:36.020 --> 52:42.020]  The chair and Eric is the general lady from Washington State, Ms. Joplin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Pachai, for coming to testify.
[52:42.020 --> 52:48.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the fake CEO of Google is lying through his teeth. He's been caught perjuring himself saying they have no involvement in China.
[52:48.020 --> 52:52.020]  There's no bias, even though we have it literally on film from Project Veritas.
[52:52.020 --> 52:58.020]  And I've got dozens of stories that the crew printed out here with Google involved in China with Dragonfly. Alex Jones and Roger Stoner are there.
[52:58.020 --> 53:04.020]  They've been centered by Google. They've been mentioned by Google employees. Alex, Roger, great work today. You got a lot of attention.
[53:04.020 --> 53:11.020]  Total victory. Sundar Pachai laughed at your right to free speech. How did it go? How do you feel?
[53:11.020 --> 53:17.020]  Well, this is a guy that makes $100 million a year. Some of the owners of this company have more than $50 billion in their pocket.
[53:17.020 --> 53:26.020]  And Google's always been a criminal organization, but it's now very clear that Google is evil, personified, and the level of lying, it's been all over, seen at news.
[53:26.020 --> 53:37.020]  It's been even in the New York Times that you can turn off the functions in your phone, like location, and then you lose the functions, but you're being tracked the entire time.
[53:37.020 --> 53:46.020]  Perjury after perjury. All of it felony crimes, felony perjury in front of the Judiciary Committee that should take that the most seriously.
[53:46.020 --> 53:55.020]  This is unbelievable. And Dragonfly has been operational for two years at least. They got caught trying to build it in 2010.
[53:55.020 --> 54:06.020]  They lied to Congress and said they stopped. Now we know that they're about to go operational nationwide and then worldwide with Dragonfly being the key in a larger program with AI tied into something called Skynet, a company in China.
[54:06.020 --> 54:11.020]  I'm not joking, not from Terminator. And then it will track everything you do with the global social score, which is all admitted.
[54:11.020 --> 54:27.020]  So the fact that they're talking about Facebook, share data, that's like asking is water wet, but they only cover little bitty tiny edges and issues with things that are going on instead of the big, giant, massive censorship.
[54:27.020 --> 54:33.020]  And so, again, Alex Jones here with Roger Stone, the media keeps asking us, why are we here?
[54:33.020 --> 54:39.020]  Well, this very Judiciary Committee just six months ago with Congress from Deutsche and others said that we're Russian agents.
[54:39.020 --> 54:43.020]  He said that I said nobody died at Parkland. Total lie. That I should be de-platformed. And then I was.
[54:43.020 --> 54:48.020]  And so we're here at these hearings to focus on big tech censorship and treason.
[54:48.020 --> 54:56.020]  And the fact that China has made a deal with these tech companies to pay 0% tax if they move to those nations.
[54:56.020 --> 55:04.020]  So Google is not an American company. Google is a globalist company. Google is working against this nation.
[55:04.020 --> 55:11.020]  Google has decided that it will be the Chinese century, not the American or the free human century.
[55:11.020 --> 55:16.020]  And it's very, very dangerous. Humanity is making its decision right now about what's going to happen.
[55:16.020 --> 55:23.020]  You had Congress would swallow as well as well that we ran into. The guy that said two weeks ago, we'll use nuclear weapons on gun owners for gun confiscation.
[55:23.020 --> 55:28.020]  He wouldn't talk to me and ran down the hall. These people are absolutely incredible. So we're here to face our users.
[55:28.020 --> 55:29.020]  Roger Stone.
[55:29.020 --> 55:35.020]  Yeah, Alex, I could not agree more. But the most outrageous thing here was hearing Congressman Jerry Nadler,
[55:35.020 --> 55:42.020]  the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, say that there's no evidence whatsoever of internet censorship of conservatives
[55:42.020 --> 55:49.020]  or libertarians or Republicans or Trump supporters when that is simply not true, leading you to ask this question.
[55:49.020 --> 55:55.020]  Is he delusional? Is he mentally ill or is he just a stone cold liar?
[55:55.020 --> 56:03.020]  The worst part about this is Alex Jones and I have both been falsely accused of treason, falsely accused of being traitors to our country,
[56:03.020 --> 56:10.020]  falsely accused of collaborating with the Russians, yet we're denied the ability to defend ourselves.
[56:10.020 --> 56:14.020]  We certainly can't do so in the mainstream media. They simply don't carry our defense.
[56:14.020 --> 56:19.020]  And now we don't even have the social media platforms on which to defend ourselves.
[56:19.020 --> 56:24.020]  We're going to come back to the next hour and you're going to elaborate, but let me just say one thing really quick that I should have set up front.
[56:24.020 --> 56:33.020]  They've really jumped the shark here in all these hearings lying. They're talking about criminal charges in Jack Dorsey Congresses for lying to them when they're on record.
[56:33.020 --> 56:48.020]  We have the head CEO and others of Hillary Laws in internal video conferences to thousands of people, basically publicly saying we're going to censor these words now.
[56:48.020 --> 56:52.020]  They're saying we're going to do it and Congress is slow to figure this out, but watch these guys.
[56:52.020 --> 56:56.020]  I mean, the Democrats are just a bunch of corrupt people in Google's pocket. Some of the Republicans are in a pocket as well.
[56:56.020 --> 56:59.020]  Nadler is on the payroll of Alphabet that owns Google.
[56:59.020 --> 57:04.020]  But the fact that they've jumped the shark lying and saying they're not censoring in China, they don't, nothing about China.
[57:04.020 --> 57:07.020]  That's like saying the sky's not blue or the capitol's not right behind me.
[57:07.020 --> 57:10.020]  The fact that they're doing all this is outrageous.
[57:10.020 --> 57:15.020]  Major crimes were committed and Sundar had that arrogant, you know what, eating grin on his face.
[57:15.020 --> 57:18.020]  But let me tell you, he was running from us, didn't know where he was going.
[57:18.020 --> 57:23.020]  It's pathetic, the wicked flea when none pursue, but they want to silence us on the Internet.
[57:23.020 --> 57:25.020]  No, they're not going to do it. That's why we're here.
[57:25.020 --> 57:29.020]  That's why the Info Wars operation is so precious when I want to salute the listeners of yours.
[57:29.020 --> 57:31.020]  Because without you, these people would have won.
[57:31.020 --> 57:34.020]  You've got my commitment. We're going to go 110% against these people.
[57:34.020 --> 57:37.020]  When we come back on the other side, Roger Stone's going to have the floor for about 10 minutes.
[57:37.020 --> 57:41.020]  I'm going to have some final comments in the back to Owen Schreuer and the ATX. Stay with us.
[57:41.020 --> 57:44.020]  Release the Kraken!
[57:44.020 --> 57:53.020]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018.
[57:53.020 --> 57:57.020]  Info Wars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas.
[57:57.020 --> 58:03.020]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory
[58:03.020 --> 58:06.020]  to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[58:06.020 --> 58:11.020]  So get great products and help fund the Info War right now with the 12 days of Christmas
[58:11.020 --> 58:14.020]  that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[58:14.020 --> 58:20.020]  Now more than ever, Info Wars needs your support to continue to promote the spirit of Liberty and Americana.

[58:26.020 --> 58:29.020]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.

[58:36.020 --> 58:41.020]  Believe me, you want to try this. It's 60% off. 2018 has been an incredible year.
[58:41.020 --> 58:46.020]  And as we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire Info War possible.
[58:46.020 --> 58:49.020]  Again, you are the resistance.
[58:51.020 --> 58:57.020]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important Info Wars is in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[58:57.020 --> 58:59.020]  So let's say it's short and sweet.
[58:59.020 --> 59:01.020]  We are your support now more than ever.
[59:01.020 --> 59:04.020]  You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you.
[59:04.020 --> 59:07.020]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[59:07.020 --> 59:10.020]  The attacks on InfoWars have become absolutely exponential.
[59:10.020 --> 59:13.020]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[59:13.020 --> 59:19.020]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible
[59:19.020 --> 59:26.020]  and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[59:26.020 --> 59:29.020]  But I want to be strong in this fight. I need to be provisioned.
[59:29.020 --> 59:33.020]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers.
[59:33.020 --> 59:36.020]  But I need your prayers. I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[59:36.020 --> 59:38.020]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[59:38.020 --> 59:39.020]  We make it easy.
[59:39.020 --> 59:44.020]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon.
[59:44.020 --> 59:46.020]  And you'll help provision us.
[59:46.020 --> 59:48.020]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at InfoWars.com.
[59:48.020 --> 01:00:10.020]  So please take action right now.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:22.020]  We're going back live to the Google hearing, the fake CEO, Sundar Pachai.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:32.020]  Congressman, we communicated clearly to the company that we need to welcome viewpoints from across all sides.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.020]  As a company, you're right. We are definitely based in Northern California.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.020]  And your employees are on film saying they censor InfoWars.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.020]  Last year was the first year we grew faster outside of California than within California.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.020]  Oh, you mean when you expanded to China?
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.020]  And I do see a wide variety of opinions.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:57.020]  When Mr. Johnson asked a question about the trusted flagger program, you said, for us to review, who's the us?
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.020]  Who's doing that review?
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:06.020]  We review things both with a combination of our automated systems as well as manual reviewers.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.020]  The algorithms.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.020]  These are people who are part of...
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.020]  And how many people is that?
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.020]  You make.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.020]  Is it a committee? Is it...
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:19.020]  It's like if I build a robot that I program to destroy the earth, and then it starts destroying the earth, come on.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020]  The robot?
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.020]  Well, I didn't know they knew this.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:28.020]  So there's thousands of people working 24-7 globally across looking at content based on our policies?
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:34.020]  Um, Google has described its ethic with these pithy, great statements.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.020]  Don't be evil. Do the right thing.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:42.020]  I'd like to discuss these ideals in relation to reports at Google that we've been talking about with China.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.020]  The strict authoritarianism that Chinese government rules its people has caused concern around the globe for generations.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.020]  I vividly recall their early days of June 1989.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.020]  Can I not get, like, conservative light here?
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.020]  Can I get, like, the real deal, please?
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:00.020]  There are recent reports about crackdowns on Muslims, on Christians, on Falun Gong.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.020]  Mass incarceration of human rights.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:06.020]  What is this guy doing? Republican Representative Keith Rothfuss here.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.020]  Bro, take the gloves off, man!
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:14.020]  Did Google design a prototype for a search engine that could be used in China to censor?
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.020]  What do you mean, did they? This is national news!
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.020]  Congressman, we have undertaken an internal effort.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:30.020]  Did you create a prototype, though? There was a report in the Intercept that says a prototype for the censored search engine was designed.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:40.020]  We have developed and explored what search could look like if it were to be launched in a country like China, and that's what we explored.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.020]  How many months was that project ongoing?
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:50.020]  We've had the project underway for a while, and there have been other projects which we've undertaken for a while, and we've never launched them, too.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.020]  So it could be a constant story.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.020]  So Pichai just admitted, he just admitted he committed perjury. This is unbelievable.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:02.020]  Because there's no one with a spine in Congress, Alex Jones and Roger Stone had to go down there and be men.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:08.020]  Alex and Roger, this is unbelievable. Sundar Pichai just lying under oath the whole time.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:16.020]  And he's on a total and complete power trip because all these executives have been caught bragging, and even their minions, if they look at your family's photos,
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:22.020]  they know your sexual habits, they can even predict what you're going to do in the future with these systems, these AI systems.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:32.020]  That's why info wars had to be taken off the air was they could see the line of us nationalism worldwide that they had to get us off the air,
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020]  or they could project that they were going to be defeated.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:40.020]  But they're still going to be defeated because people are going to go out in the third dimension in reality and take over these press conferences, take over these events,
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.020]  but also go to Congress and educate them.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:48.020]  Most of Congress doesn't even know that they're way past tracking us. They're way past all that.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:55.020]  They're hooking it in to everything you do and getting the data and sharing with all the other companies to then have a 3D model of your entire life
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.020]  and know more about you than anybody but God.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:03.020]  And that's the real danger here. And these are lying criminals that have joined with Communist China.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:09.020]  And we're about to go to break. Roger's got statements we're going to make, and then I'm going to finish up and let you take over here, Owen.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:15.020]  We've got to go back to these hearings too in the next few days and just get all these clips because people are probably, Google, Google, Google, we're sick of it.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:26.020]  Google is the whole world. Google was built to be an AI system where humans with tech and then give it all of our data so it can basically learn how to manipulate and control us.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:32.020]  This is a merger with Silicon. This is the takeover. This is the reality. And that's why they want us banned.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:39.020]  So we're going to come right back with Owen Schroder and the ATX, Roger Stone and more with another successful mission here in the third dimension exposing these creatures.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, epic time to be alive.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:51.020]  What are you going to tell your grandchildren when they ask what role did you play in the Second American Revolution?
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:58.020]  What did you do to stop global tyranny? What did you do?
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:04.020]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents knew that they can't food. During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:14.020]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com. With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots' supply on the top, most respected companies out there.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:22.020]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:27.020]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have durable food so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:33.020]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com on M4 Select, storeable foods.
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:38.020]  They've got special diet foods. They've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:42.020]  They've got so many great products there. Maybe you got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:46.020]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block. It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:52.020]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:58.020]  M4sTour.com and M4 Select, high-quality, storeable foods, powered by my patriots' supply.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:39.020]  All right. Well, I'm not getting a feed from you guys or from Owen, but that's cool. It's not a big deal.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:44.020]  That's the fun part about being guerrilla media and being out here on the street.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:50.020]  So long as I get a thumbs up, Dari, I can hear you. I can't hear any fees or anything, but that's no big deal.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.020]  So I guess we'll just do this segment and then bow out here and let Owen take over.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:07:05.020]  Again, I'm here at Congress. If you just joined us, Sundar Pachai, the head of Google, the CEO, had refused to testify to Congress.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.020]  He just refused arrogantly. So that got Congress angry.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:13.020]  Google's also refused to work with the U.S. government and the Pentagon, but they work with the Communist Chinese military.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:20.020]  This is outrageous. They're helping round up political dissidents in Communist China at an absolutely massive scale.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:25.020]  That's all confirmed. They're building a total censorship grid that's already in place that's going to expand worldwide.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.020]  He lied to Congress about that. And then earlier, he was just admitting that he lied.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:33.020]  So somebody must have during the break got to him and said, man, you are really screwing the poach here.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:39.020]  But just think about how Google and Apple and others have made the decision to go with Communist China.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:45.020]  These people are spying on everything we do. They're building all this AI system that ties in with your travel records,
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.020]  what you buy, where you go, what you read, what you eat, who you know.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:52.020]  And they're using all this data to game you and control you.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:08:00.020]  And now they're taking advantage, like we knew they would do, with this godlike omnipresent technology and this whole internet of things.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:07.020]  And they are absolutely the number one threat is big tech. This is the technocracy. This is the mark of the beast.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:12.020]  And this lady right over here, they've taken two million of the Muslims.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:16.020]  And these are non radical Muslims. Most of them there in Mongolia.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.020]  And they've also arresting the Christians. And they're also rounding up the Buddhist.
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:26.020]  I mean, I know about the two million in the camps. It's admitted. It's all over the news.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.020]  Yes, ma'am, we know who you are. That's why I called you over.
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.020]  And so we're here facing this situation.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:41.020]  This is just an example where they're now putting a Chinese individual from southern China in the home of every family in Mongolia.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:47.020]  And they're also, again, going to give them smartphones after they leave the reeducation camps, those that aren't killed.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:51.020]  And those then track everything you do and listen to you in live time.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:58.020]  And Google Android is competing with Apple to have the contract for China and then it will expand worldwide.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.020]  Ma'am, we talked to you earlier, but tell us about what you guys are doing.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.020]  We are Uyghur people live in northwest part of China.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020]  Our land is being occupied called East Turkistan. Now it's part of China.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  The Chinese government is trying to eliminate the culture and the religion by putting over two million people in concentration camps.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:32.020]  And also, even people living at large, they are living in very heavy surveillance, like GPS trackings and QR codes on people's homes.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:42.020]  And also, they are putting 1.1 billion Chinese cadres, Chinese officials into Uyghur people's homes to monitor them.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:52.020]  So this is a very horrendous atrocity unprecedented, have not seen anywhere in the world that's happening today on our watch.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:58.020]  Well, ma'am, we have seen it. China has killed 115 million of their own people since 1949.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:04.020]  They admit that. They're very proud of it. They've killed 115 million Chinese. They've killed millions of Tibetans.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:08.020]  So, I mean, it's just being done to you guys and this is what Google's helping them do.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:12.020]  And so you kill five times what Hitler did. You're wonderful. Google loves you.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:17.020]  And it's all leftist and cute. As long as Sundar is Indian, it's like, oh, it's cool.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.020]  You know, he's not white, so it's okay if he helps China kill everybody.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:26.020]  And then even the Washington Post heard Owen earlier talking about it, saying I'm racist because Sundar is Indian.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.020]  So he can help run death camps and help round everybody up and help spot everybody because he's Indian.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.020]  And as long as, you know, the Chinese, they can kill 115 million because they're killing their own people.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:40.020]  And it's kind of cool and have one child policies and kill 50 million little girls because they're Chinese. It's okay.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.020]  Roger Stone.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:50.020]  The most amazing thing today was watching the head of Google, watching Congressman Ted Deutsch, Congressman Eric Swalwell,
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:57.020]  run from Alex Jones and I like cockroaches in the light of day, run because they fear the truth.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:04.020]  Info orders would be imminently proud of Alex Jones for leading this assault for the truth.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:10.020]  We were the proverbial turd in the establishment's punch bowl today.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.020]  But we're never going to stop. We're never going to quit.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:22.020]  We're never going to stop fighting for a free, open and accessible internet because it is the key, not only to the success of Donald Trump's reform agenda,
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:29.020]  his prospects for reelection, his legacy for the future, but more importantly, the future of Western civilization,
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:35.020]  the future of all of our values and the protection of the U.S. Constitution.
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:41.020]  We really struck a blow for freedom today and the cockroaches were in full retreat.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:48.020]  And then there was the biggest cockroach of them all, Congressman Jerry Nadler, who actually sat there with a straight face
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:57.020]  and denied that there's any evidence whatsoever of the internet-based censorship of conservatives or libertarians or Republicans or Trump supporters.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:05.020]  So my question again, is the Congressman delusional? Is he mentally ill or is he just a stone cold liar? Alex?
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:13.020]  Absolutely. And again, I don't have an audio feed from the network. I assume we're on air, but we'll test at the break and see how we want to break here in just a few minutes.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.020]  But again, we're on the ground ragtag, but we're all over the newspapers, all over the media right now.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:22.020]  These stories are getting out there about how he's perjured himself, about how they're lying about the search functions,
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:28.020]  about how they're lying about the surveillance grid, how they're helping China build this global social score that's already rolling out in the U.S.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:37.020]  This is true authoritarianism. There's this wonderful lady and her husband and others were in there earlier talking about how the Buddhists and the Muslims and the Christians
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:44.020]  and the Tibetan Buddhists, but also just follow-on gong, are rounded up, put in slave factories, killed in many cases, organs sold.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:53.020]  And our evil corrupt media is defending this and now saying we're racist for being mean to Sundar because he's Indian and you cannot.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:13:00.020]  If somebody's Indian and speaks in foreign accent, you've got to just bow down to them. I mean, it doesn't matter. This is leftist ideology.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.020]  This is how this craziness, how they inject racism through what color you are into everything and has nothing to do with anything.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:10.020]  These are human beings being killed in China, whether they be Buddhists or Christians or Muslims.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:15.020]  And our government built Google with NSA money and that's a fact.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:21.020]  And now because the rogue states fighting against Trump, it's fully broken away and it's made a deal with China.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:26.020]  The EU is against America. Hollywood's against America. Communist China is against America.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:31.020]  And they all think we're Trumps because we've lived in freedom so long, we don't know what it's like when tyranny starts hitting us.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:35.020]  We're like dodo birds. When the sailors showed up on the island, they ate them all in about a year.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.020]  There's a dodo birds. You'd see one dodo bird but you'd see another one getting killed and it wouldn't even run.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:44.020]  I mean, we have got absolute evil but because Sundar has skinny pants.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:50.020]  How do you do? Hey, friendly. I'm Sundar. I am liberal. Sundar, not a liberal.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.020]  No, he's like Hitler. He's like Hitler.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:14:00.020]  What you saw today was the Democrats running circles around the Republicans.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:07.020]  The Republicans, I think their hearts are in the right place but they don't understand what's fundamentally technologically going on here.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:16.020]  Other than Jim Jordan, whose questioning was exceptional, the Republicans are late to the party and the Democrats just spouting lies after lies.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:24.020]  In most cases, I think we can assume that the questions being asked by Democratic members were submitted by the Google lobbyists in advance.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.020]  I lived here. I worked here. That's how it worked.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:32.020]  What you saw today was like a show trial where we learned absolutely nothing but we do know this.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:37.020]  The chairman of Google perjured himself under oath again and again and again.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.020]  We're going to come back and do one more segment. This is so critical because you made the key point. You've now read it.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:50.020]  This new NAFTA deal that they lied to Trump about is literally the law of the C-Treaty, UN control of borders, not just internet censorship,
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:58.020]  and expanding 230, not just give them liability protection, but let them act as publishers and have liability protection, something all other media won't have.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:04.020]  They are enthroning the tech giants now as the official global government. We're covering it all here live.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:10.020]  Owen Schreuer is in the ATX. I'm with Roger Stone. We're going to come back and hit the final key point that is the emergency transmission.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.020]  The reason they're censoring us, the reason they're shutting us down is we do our homework. We do our research.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:22.020]  And, you know, I know Sundar's a gangster. I know he's hellishly evil. I know he was put in there because he'll execute this evil.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:27.020]  But it doesn't matter. We're going to stand up against them and get in their face because the only thing we can do is fight back.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:35.020]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, live on the ground of Washington, D.C. This is the answer to tyranny.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:49.020]  This is the answer to 1984. You have to take action now. Imagine if every Google Headquarter and every major U.S. city had a protester outside tomorrow with a bullhorn.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:16:15.020]  Just imagine. Not do it.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:27.020]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:37.020]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:26.020]  You want to know what censorship is all about, ladies and gentlemen? It's all about stopping the truth. It's all about control of information.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:36.020]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone are live in Washington DC right now, but here's the key. Because they have removed Alex Jones and Roger Stone from social media, their videos can't go viral.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:42.020]  Their videos can't have an impact. Their videos can't have an influence, even though that's exactly what would happen if they weren't censored.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:50.020]  That's why the censorship is here, straight out of communist China. Roger Stone and Alex Jones are still live from DC, breaking it all down.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:59.020]  Shocking perjury from Sundar Pachai today, and Alex Jones and Roger Stone ground zero for censorship on social media, live with us here on the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:12.020]  I want to be clear, this is the new world war. It's global corporations, ally of the authoritarian, and access to evil, censoring, destroying western civilization, shutting down all of our speech, suppressing and arresting and killing people.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:19.020]  Google and Apple help arrest and kill people. They're helping set up a giant total spy grid to come in and suppress the United States.
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:31.020]  They're trying to demoralize the United States. They're trying to set the precedent to take our free speech, and they have these modern leftists who are really authoritarians, who are just, their religion is America hating mental illness.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:39.020]  And it is a perfect storm with all the swarmy, snarky, know-it-all lobbyists here in DC who sold their country out.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:51.020]  Not even understanding that Google and Facebook have such, and Apple have such disrespect for America and the West, that they've allied with the Chai cons and wanting to work with our Pentagon now.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:22:06.020]  So basically we're losing world war four right now. But the big news is humanity is awakening. When you come see these slime balls, they're just little traders that would build something like this and deceive people and say, don't be evil, we're Google.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:13.020]  Get your trust, spy on everything, and then merge this huge evil system with these authoritarian states. It is unprecedented.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:21.020]  And, Roger, you hit the key. Let's get into this new so-called napkin gap that Trump promised to renegotiate, and he's had some good ideas.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:29.020]  But boy, they lied to him. We've now looked at it. Law of the Sea Treaty, UN open borders. Obviously this goes against everything Trump wants.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:38.020]  It's now got to get ratified. This is all got to get torn out in Congress. But who the hell is writing this? Well, we know Alphabet, the parent company, is heavily involved.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:44.020]  You're an expert on this. We're just talking about Nadler being in the pocket of Alphabet that owns Google. This is the top of the technocracy pyramid.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:23:01.020]  And Millie was just pulling it up that it's his biggest contributor. He is literally reading talking points to Pachar Sundar, who is then engaging in absolutely massive perjury.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:07.020]  So this is a loop of perjury by Nadler and by Sundar in committed evil fraud.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:14.020]  I think it's important that people understand what you see here today is like a kabuki dance. In other words, I worked in the U.S. Senate for Senator Bob Dole.
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:24.020]  I worked over here on the House side for Congressman Robert Steele of Connecticut. All of those questions asked by the Democrats today were submitted to advance by the Google lobbyists.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:34.020]  They're all friendly questions. It's all an act for the American people. And the Republican members, to their credit, while they tried to shed light on what's really going on,
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:42.020]  they don't understand the technological and legal issues here. So what Alex said is absolutely true. This new treaty with Mexico and Canada,
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:48.020]  it's a very good deal for America when it comes to jobs and economic growth. And that's what the president is focused on.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:24:04.020]  But what happens in the meantime is the lobbyists then surreptitiously insert in the small print the law of the C treaty protection of the tech giant so they can continue to censor the Internet as they have been.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:20.020]  And in some cases, even worse. So it is essential that the president understand that the small print which denies us a free, unfettered and open Internet has to be stripped out of this treaty before it is ratified,
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.020]  or frankly, it is over for this country.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:35.020]  Today we ran essentially a gorilla aid raid where you actually saw members of Congress, Eric Swallow as well, Ted Douche, a Deutsche from Florida,
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:48.020]  and even the chairman of Google himself running from Alex Jones and I like cockroaches in the sunlight, running, unwilling to answer questions, unwilling to engage in any kind of civil debate.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:58.020]  It would have done your heart good to see what we did today. This is real civic action. And it proves what one individual can do.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:06.020]  Absolutely. And it's the info wars folks out there supporting us that let this all happen. Hey, Jack Mesovic was just walking by of one American news talking about kicking ass.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:15.020]  It's so weird. He's walking down the street here, Washington, D.C. I heard there's some censorship stuff going on panel and I just heard this loud booming voice on the side of the road.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:22.020]  And, you know, at first I thought it was Maxine Waters, but no, no, it wasn't Maxine Waters, actually Alex Jones. You guys are very similar boys.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:28.020]  They never tell you that. Very similar. So I'm Maxine Waters. It's very, it's fantastic though. I want you to go to the petrol stations.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:36.020]  I want you to go to the shopping malls. You don't let them ever have a minute of rest. It's fantastic because Republicans are violent.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:48.020]  It's fantastic to see, though, that these I what I want to do and maybe, you know, maybe we can do this at one American news. Maybe you guys can do this at info wars that whenever one of these representatives starts talking to Sundar Pinchai,
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:56.020]  the Google CEO, I want the dollar amount of how much money Google has given them to appear on the screen. The price tag. The price tag.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.020]  Exactly. Darren McBreen, I know you're watching. We want this right now.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:06.020]  I mean, think about this in like a kaching little little sound effect. You know, come up. So Jerry Nadler, I'm Googling this. I actually put up on Google, right?
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.020]  26,000.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:17.020]  Duck Duck Go. So 26,000. That's how much it costs to buy off one of you, one of our U.S. government officials. 26,000.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.020]  Not paying.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:25.020]  There is a Dutch faced enemy of the people. And he's on the take. I mean, he's bought and paid for.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.020]  Number one.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:32.020]  Fish faced enemy. I love him. He's a fish faced enemy of the people. There's no question. The man is a disgrace. He's a meese kite, as we would say.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:41.020]  And why is everyone so scared of everybody's like, we can't believe you talked to Sundar. The guy's helping round up the Chinese and others and Christians and others.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:48.020]  And then he's lying about dragonfly. He's lying about we don't track anybody when you turn the function off. It's just all pure lies.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:57.020]  Yeah. I mean, the way he's getting around it is he's saying that we're not developing a search engine for China, right? Because you're helping China develop a search engine for China.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.020]  Johnson with the Dragonfly Joint Venture Project is that we're working with.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:05.020]  We're not. We're not. We're not building an atom bomb for Hitler. We're just helping him.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:11.020]  Right. We're building an atom bomb for Germany. We're putting an atom bomb for, you know, for the German people. We're not building it for Hitler.
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:18.020]  So it's it's these ways, these legal means that he's using to get around answering real questions. And you're going to see a lot of Kabuki theater today.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:24.020]  You're going to see him dancing around questions. You're not going to see any real answers. It's going to be the same time the last time we were here together when Jack Dorsey came in.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:32.020]  Shull Sandberg from Facebook came around. Lots of empty questions from people who, number one, don't know the technology or number two, know exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.020]  They're playing dumb.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:47.020]  Roger, I viewed his empty questions from people who are essentially empty suits. But what's it? Well, today was a fraud. We learned absolutely nothing other than that the chief executive Google can lie with a straight face.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:54.020]  He's a very skillful liar. But he sat there denying that there's any censorship of conservatives or libertarians or Republicans.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:28:01.020]  He denies that he's working hand in glove with the Chinese communists to suppress democracy and dissent or even human rights in China.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:06.020]  It needs to be charged. I mean, Jack, we're about to go to break through a few more minutes with us. What do we need to do as Americans?
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:10.020]  I'm just down here as an American that's been black hole by these people saying, hey, I still exist.
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:19.020]  We're seeing Robert Mueller push forward charges on Michael Cohen for lying before Congress. This is one of the few times that that charge has ever actually been done.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:24.020]  They never brought it up for James Clapper. They never brought it up for John Brennan, but they'll bring it up for Michael Cohen.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:33.020]  If we are seeing Sundar Pichai, we should go through the transcript and look up every single time that he makes a false statement or misleads Congress.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:38.020]  And we should bring that up and we should walk it over to Robert Mueller's offices where we know he's looking for you anyway.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:43.020]  So you can hand this off. And while he's talking to you, we can show him all of these charges as well.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:51.020]  Well, I suspect he knows how to find me. Look, the truth is, I told the truth before the American Congress, the chairman of Google just lied his ass off.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:54.020]  Hold on. We're going to break. We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:27.020]  7-0-3-9 or D-R-M-I-L-L-E-R-S clinic dot com.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:57.020]  2-9-5-5-3-0-5. H-B-X-T-R-A-C dot com. Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:29.020]  Now more than ever, InfoWars, it needs your support to continue to promote the spirit of liberty and Americana.

[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:56.020]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWars possible.
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:58.020]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:07.020]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:13.020]  They want to abort children. They want to disease children. They want to abuse children. They want to confuse children.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:20.020]  They want their essence. They want their soul. They want their spirit. They want their power because they are our future.
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:24.020]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:30.020]  It is about the West. It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:38.020]  I just want to thank you all for your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump,
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:45.020]  to pray for InfoWars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world. You have the power to override the sensors.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:49.020]  You have the power to stop the globalist dead in their tracks.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:58.020]  I know you've been taking action. I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:07.020]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:12.020]  We've been proven dead on. You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:19.020]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:25.020]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:31.020]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:37.020]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:41.020]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:47.020]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:52.020]  I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack, and we just need you to go to infowarsport.com
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:33:01.020]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:09.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:30.020]  Music
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:33.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live from Washington, D.C.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:38.020]  Owen Schreuer is in the ATX to show you some of the crazy architecture that's festuting these buildings.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:43.020]  All over the place, there's some type of weird mythical creature from Greek mythology.
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:49.020]  And we've got from legendary political mythology, Roger Stone, Israel in the flesh and Jack Pesovic.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:52.020]  Both great patriots, Jack Pesovic with One American News.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.020]  We've seen some incredible things today.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:34:00.020]  And your idea of a price tag popping up on these politicians when Google and people come in here and lie, it's incredible.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:05.020]  We were going to break. They're talking about arresting Roger Stone, relying to Congress with no proof.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.020]  But now Sundar and all these other guys can just crap all over us and lie, lie, lie.
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:14.020]  Jack Pesovic, other just closing points here about what we witnessed today and the real fight this nation's facing.
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:20.020]  Yeah, Alex, well, the real fight is, see, they want to talk about bias because bias is hard to prove.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:25.020]  And we should concede that fact that it's hard to understand exactly what someone is doing.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:30.020]  Now, on the flip side of that, I would say that if you go to YouTube, which is owned by Google,
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:38.020]  people don't remember this, it's owned by Alphabet, their parent company, that YouTube routinely suspends, gives strikes to, and it's conservatives.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.020]  It's by and large conservatives.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.020]  So they say, well, our algorithm doesn't do this and that.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:46.020]  But when you look at it, Roger, which side is it that's actually banned from YouTube?
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.020]  Is the right or the left?
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.020]  It's clearly the right.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:55.020]  What disturbs me is the fact that Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.020]  is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alphabet Company.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:02.020]  And he said it doesn't exist. Conservatives are not censored when we have them all in video.
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:05.020]  Congressman, you're owned, resigned, you're corrupt, resigned.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:09.020]  Nothing you say can be taken seriously because your testimony is paid for.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:10.020]  Your words are paid for.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:17.020]  Every single word expressed by Congressman Jerry Nadler today was written by a lobbyist for Google.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.020]  He must resign.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:22.020]  He is epically corrupt and compromised.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:28.020]  But there were some other congressmen that were able to ask serious questions that were able to actually question Pitch Eye
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:32.020]  on some of these really, really questionable practices and put them under some scrutiny.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.020]  Nadler, for only 26 grand.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.020]  I mean, what a cheap date, really.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:40.020]  When you look at some of it, Google paid over a quarter million, just this last cycle,
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.020]  a quarter million to who?
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.020]  Beto or Rourke.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.020]  That's who they were funding.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.020]  They were going to put him in.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:47.020]  He was going to be another senator in the pocket of Google with Beto.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:48.020]  They didn't win.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.020]  But of course, we know that the program for promoting Beto is still going to be continuing.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.020]  Google is taking the planet over.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.020]  It's a bigger threat than the shy comes.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.020]  Yeah.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:58.020]  And so Google, when they talk about Russia meddling elections and Russia throwing elections,
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:02.020]  Google has the ability to control what we think, control what we see, control what we believe.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:08.020]  Google has the ability to interfere in our elections far more than Vladimir Putin or any of the Ayatollahs
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:12.020]  or anybody else over the Facebook meme page could ever do.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.020]  Well, and the truth is, I want to report this to the infowars.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:21.020]  Alex Jones attempted to question Congressman Hank Johnson about whether islands could really flow.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:27.020]  But unfortunately, just like Congressman Swallowwell, just like Congressman Deutsch,
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:34.020]  just like Jerry Nadler, just like the chairman of Google, they fled like cockroaches when they're subjected to sunlight.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:37.020]  They ran from Alex Jones and I like children.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.020]  It was pathetic.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:39.020]  I want to make this point and then closing.
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.020]  I want to take back over to a great job.
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.020]  This is the real 21st century threat.
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.020]  We think about uniforms and militaries.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.020]  That's how the old wars were fought.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:51.020]  We're fighting big multinational corporations who had a technological jump.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.020]  They got what was built in the West.
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:57.020]  And now they're usually to destroy the values of the West of free speech and open free societies
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:02.020]  and are aligning themselves with authoritarian regimes like the EU who claims they're fighting tech giants.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.020]  It's pure bull and the chai comms.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.020]  They're making their move.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:10.020]  They've chosen their axis of evil because China literally has no bottom.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.020]  There's nothing that chai comms won't do.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.020]  Human cloning, gene editing, human animal hybrids.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.020]  It's all confirmed.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:19.020]  Jack used to live for the Navy and Naval Intelligence in China.
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:20.020]  You can talk about people.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.020]  I know that go there, but all they'll just be dying on the street.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.020]  Nobody helps them.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:28.020]  I mean, it is a hellish place in most areas and Google is helping round people up.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:34.020]  That tells you they'll do that here and they're bringing a total grid to track everything you do that makes the Stasi look like
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.020]  sweetie pies.
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.020]  So this isn't about Alex Jones being censored.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:38.020]  People say, are you worried about you?
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.020]  How are you doing?
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:42.020]  I'm worried about the whole country and the whole damn world, my kids.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:48.020]  I'm not worried about me or Info Wars, except Info Wars is a weapon to tell the truth because everybody else pisses themselves
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:52.020]  and tries to climb some social ladder instead of standing up against this.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.020]  And then we have no damn future to spend the money.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020]  It's freedom that produced the wealth.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.020]  Not authoritarianism.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:58.020]  Sundar.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.020]  It's why you came to America.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.020]  You jackass.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.020]  You goddamn piece of filth.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.020]  Why don't you become a real American instead of a blood sucker?
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.020]  Excuse me.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.020]  I'm getting angry.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.020]  Close the comments for both of you guys.
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:12.020]  Yeah, Alex, I think what everybody can agree with on both the right and the left is that
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:19.020]  these corporations have completely unchecked power and it is an extreme level of influence
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:22.020]  that we've not seen before in the US, right?
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.020]  More powerful than the United States.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:27.020]  When we talk about threats to liberty, when we talk about threats to freedom, we typically,
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.020]  as Republicans or people on the right, we should say, and not all Republican, but we
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.020]  focus on the government because government usually stands as a large threat to freedom.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:40.020]  But now we're getting to a point where Silicon Valley is actually, or even potentially, a
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.020]  greater threat.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.020]  And therein lies the rub.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.020]  The government has to move in now.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.020]  That's the key point.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.020]  If it's a vacuum, they're making Google the government.
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:48.020]  That's the key point.
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:53.020]  The president must direct his Justice Department to bring immediate antitrust action and break
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:58.020]  up the racketeering of Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and their ilk.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:05.020]  Now, this is the only salvation without access to a free, robust, vibrant, and unfettered
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]  internet.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:10.020]  There is no future whatsoever for Western civilization or for freedom.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:14.020]  Roger Stone, Jack Purcell, Alex Jones, in fours.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.020]  That's it.
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.020]  We're in an AI war.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:20.620]  And instead of being our nations against other nations, the authoritarian, it's globalist
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.620]  screwing everybody.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:25.020]  And they found the perfect love mate in all this, the chikoms.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:29.320]  All right, guys, we're going to cut off this live feed, and we're going to have more live
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.320]  feeds coming up.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.020]  We're going to go back to Owen Schreuer right now, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.020]  news today.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:37.260]  Please support us.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.700]  And we are going to continue to fight as hard as we can.
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.500]  And I just appreciate you all for your prayers, everything else you're doing.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:49.180]  But infowars.com, 12 days of Christmas, free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off, double
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:53.500]  Patriot points, and a free t-shirt with every order, ladies and gentlemen, we're losing money
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.940]  on a lot of these, but we're clearing our entire warehouse, because as you know, they're
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:00.060]  trying to completely shut down our merchant accounts and other operations.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:04.060]  So whether they're successful or not, I'm now going to another alternate backup plan
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.060]  we already had.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:10.620]  But we need your prayers of financial support right now, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620]  news today.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:15.260]  And you'll be able to watch Jack Pesovic with his great reports at the One American News
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.780]  that I already think is doing a better job than Fox.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:20.860]  And I'm really glad that they're there and they're available on Cloud TV and so many
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:26.420]  other systems that infowars is available on as well, and you're at StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.420]  So again, thank you all.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:29.060]  Back to Owen Schreuer and the ATX.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:35.500]  Well, incredible stuff and exercise in going through the motions today for Congress with
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:41.620]  the fake CEO of Google Sundar Pichai up there, seemingly have no eye, you know, oh, China,
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:46.380]  I don't know anything about China, no, no involvement in China, censorship of conservatives
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:50.060]  and bias, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:51.900]  He was under oath.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.100]  That's perjury.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:59.300]  And the fact that you have, first of all, it shouldn't even be split on party lines,
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:05.100]  but obviously in the current Overton window, the Democrats are totally sold out scumbag.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:09.300]  Okay, I mean, just look at Jerry Nadler and the lies that come out of his mouth.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.300]  The crew gave me the story.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:17.420]  Stephen Cohen, another Democrat from Tennessee, he's trying to claim that Google favors conservatives
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.420]  in their search results.
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:21.420]  What?
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.700]  Again, this is a total con man.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:30.220]  Steve Cohen is a lying scumbag.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:39.500]  But this is why people like Alex Jones have to go to Congress and raise these issues because
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.740]  we don't have any congressmen that are willing to do it.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:49.380]  No congressman has a spine enough to call out Sundar Pichai on his lying under oath.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.220]  The only person that I tip my hat to today, and there were a couple of Republicans that
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:57.540]  did well, but the only one that really actually hit a home run, the only one that actually
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:01.020]  scored a victory is Jim Jordan.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:08.140]  Lee Smith from Texas, not bad, but these are not questions.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.100]  Is Google involved in China?
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.260]  That's not a question.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.940]  It's mainstream admitted news.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:16.100]  We have the documents.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:21.140]  Does Google censor conservatives as a parent company of YouTube?
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.740]  Absolutely 110%.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:26.740]  We've got the project Veritas video to prove it.
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:32.860]  So there shouldn't be any questions too soon to our Pichai, the fake CEO of Google.
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.060]  Are you censoring?
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.460]  Are you involved in China?
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.460]  That's not a question.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:39.060]  Those are statement of facts.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:45.420]  When you have Democrats sold out on the Google payroll like Nadler and probably this Cohen
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:51.980]  from Tennessee, they'll say anything to protect their own status with their pockets being
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:43:21.820]  lined by the anti-American Google.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:44:01.860]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.420]  of many of our best selling items.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.700]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:09.980]  store wide 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:16.140]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:20.220]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver iodine, four to five super blue, you'll
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.940]  get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:28.180]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.180]  out.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.100]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.100]  sells out.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.420]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.740]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.260]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.900]  We are losing money on this.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.340]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:49.580]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything and don't fight the crowds.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:54.740]  M4store.com, M4slife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.260]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.300]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:07.540]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:10.460]  It literally dumps the population down.
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.580]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.340]  gone through two permutations.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:21.460]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.420]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:28.260]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.260]  That's been incredible.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:34.620]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.900]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:41.380]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:47.300]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.740]  it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:53.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:54.980]  discovery.

[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:21.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:28.860]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:35.860]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:48:02.860]  You're in a hallway, in a public hallway, you're going to be arrested, that's enough,
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:09.860]  you're going to be arrested.
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:17.420]  Good roll yours, don't be a red-blooded male and stand up to evil and tyranny.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.420]  They're going to talk about me in this committee.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.420]  I will be talked about.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.420]  So what am I going to do?
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:21.420]  I don't get a day in court.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.420]  They lie about me, Google only puts lies up, all the top searches are lies about me and
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:23.420]  my family.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.420]  And that guy helps ground up political dissidents, and his people come to lie to Congress over
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:28.240]  and over and over again, and we don't get to respond to them.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.600]  So Google is helping build censorship systems in China
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.960]  for a global social score they tested there
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.920]  to totally control every aspect of our lives.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.440]  Apple, and Tim Cook has said he wants censorship worldwide.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.760]  They're working with the Communist Chinese
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.840]  that have killed five times.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.200]  All right folks, this is a long time away from now.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.960]  We need to get some support from the Corp.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.400]  The United States Congress.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.200]  Google is left or to the right.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.520]  Okay, Google is evil.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.360]  They're down a little bit.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.200]  And they're censoring a lot of things.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.040]  They're out of show.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:55.880]  They're out of show.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.720]  They're not blocked.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.320]  Google here and today, you had all the news covering it.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.160]  And you can see he gets shut down.
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.040]  You know, there's multiple angles to this
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.040]  because you see it and you see the police officer there
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.880]  and you say, okay, he's doing his job.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.920]  He wants to maintain order and whatever.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.160]  But it's like, wait a second here.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.200]  See, how do you explain this?
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.200]  When you ratchet down legitimate
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.040]  and genuine human emotion
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.600]  because you wanna be politically correct
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.440]  or maintain an atmosphere or environment,
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:44.960]  you're allowing corruption to reign supreme.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.240]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.360]  Now, again, I understand why that officer's doing his job.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.080]  However, in this situation,
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.840]  if that officer had any clue what was going on,
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.160]  you let Alex Jones do that.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.160]  And then maybe later,
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.520]  if you need to file some paperwork
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.000]  or do whatever you gotta do to censor him
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.840]  because you're a good corporate police officer,
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.360]  then that's perfectly fine.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.080]  You're there to protect the establishment.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.600]  You're there to protect the perjure,
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.520]  the man that just perjured himself soon to our pet shy.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.800]  The dumb ass that runs Google apparently
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.280]  that knows nothing about the censorship,
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.840]  knows nothing about the involvement in China,
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.400]  if you can believe that.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.600]  So he's either a bold-faced liar or totally incompetent,
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.160]  but you know, silence Alex Jones from speaking out.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.560]  And so I don't know if you guys notice this,
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:38.000]  but I know Alex well enough to know
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.640]  when he kind of gets a little emotional.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.920]  He got a little emotional saying that
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.400]  because you have to understand,
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.120]  when you're in that situation
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.200]  and you're standing for what you know is right
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.360]  and you're told you're not allowed to speak
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.200]  and you get shut down, he doesn't get emotional
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.400]  because Alex Jones is getting silenced.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.120]  He doesn't get emotional because someone tells
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.960]  Alex Jones he can't speak.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.280]  He gets emotional because he knows
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.680]  that's telling you you can't speak.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.600]  That's saying that you're not allowed to resist.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.720]  That's saying you're not allowed
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.360]  to stand up to the establishment.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  And that's the key here.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:15.440]  These people have total control of this entire thing.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.720]  And you can't even have Alex Jones going there
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.640]  to disrupt their little circus event
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.200]  where they act like they're having this hearing
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.040]  over Google, whatever.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.240]  And it just turns into a big Google, you know.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.200]  Oh, this is how you download our new G Suite.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200]  Google does the best job with our technology
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.640]  to join people around the world, says Sundar Pachak.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.000]  Yeah, you know, the Chinese communists
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.080]  get to use your technology to track and monitor
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:44.920]  their own citizens.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.280]  And then when they find a dissonant,
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:50.160]  they go round them up and put them in jail and torture them.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:52.400]  But see, that's okay.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:57.720]  But if Alex Jones goes to Congress as an American citizen
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:00.840]  and expresses his right to free speech, that's not okay.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.480]  That gets shut down.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.480]  That gets shut down.
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.240]  There's the danger right there.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.760]  Corporate media,
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:14.760]  big tech, and then yes men in government,
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.920]  like that police officer, again,
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:21.120]  no will, will towards that officer doing his job.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:21.960]  But guess what?
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.080]  So are Nazis.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.640]  And if you're gonna stand there and allow Google
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:31.480]  to get away with all the crap we know they've done,
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:34.760]  oh, but it's big, oh, it's Sundar Pachai.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:37.360]  Oh my gosh, he's worth hundreds of millions.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.640]  He runs Google, oh, he's untouchable.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:40.960]  I'll protect you, Sundar.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:43.360]  Yes, oh, oh, oh, Sundar.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.680]  You are the big guy from Google.
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:45.680]  I love you, Sundar.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.000]  We love Google.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:47.840]  We love YouTube.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.280]  We love Alphabet.
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:51.720]  Oh, you just make hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.760]  You just, when I first got into politics,
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.040]  this was the most stunning thing ever.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.680]  When I first started doing my YouTube channel,
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.520]  which by the way, I'm banned on YouTube,
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.120]  I did a video.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:06.080]  This is when I first took a red pill,
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.080]  just openly thinking like, here's how Google can track you.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.640]  Here's how they can use your smartphone,
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:17.200]  your imperial probe droid to track and spy on you.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.320]  I'm just some no name at the time.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.880]  Like maybe have a hundred people watching my YouTube videos.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:28.880]  I had someone from Google send me a history report
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.600]  of all my travel for the last month.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.680]  And guess what?
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.680]  This was 2013 and I don't have location services on my phone
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.600]  and they still had it all and they know they do it.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.280]  They've got the government contracts,
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.840]  not just from the United States government,
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.600]  the Chinese government, from fricking every government.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.680]  You really think these incompetent governments
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.800]  and bureaucracies can run a spy grid on their own?
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.480]  Of course not.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.400]  You need the private industry.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:07.200]  So you sign deals and then you're like Jerry Nandler,
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  you get thousands of dollars paid by Google
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.080]  to your campaign and then you get up there
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.080]  as the minority speaker on this House committee
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.600]  and you say, oh, Google, we love you.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.920]  Thank you so much for being here, Google.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.680]  Yes, tell us about your great services.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:32.560]  Oh, tell us about the G Suite.
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.520]  Tell us about the technology.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  Tell us about the new smartphone.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.120]  There's no censorship.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.920]  There's no plans in China.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.640]  There's nothing to see here.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.960]  Oh my gosh, what's that noise in the hallway?
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.440]  Google's evil.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:51.920]  Google's censoring free speech.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.960]  Google's working for China.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.400]  Shut up, Alex Jones, sit down.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:00.200]  Sit down. Now, Mr. Pichai, go on and tell us
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.640]  how great Google is and how you're not censoring conservatives
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.640]  and how you're not involved in China, please.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:08.720]  And don't worry, we're gonna remove that pesky, Alex Jones.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  Yeah, don't worry about that, Alex Jones, you know.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.120]  Free speech, don't worry about it.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:16.840]  Free speech is an archaic thing, Mr. Pichai.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.440]  Don't you worry about that.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:25.440]  No.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.440]  Here's what you need to learn and figure out real quick.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  And it's probably not gonna happen.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:39.440]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone are censored on social media.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.440]  So they can't really get their message out.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  We've got our platform here with millions of people,
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  but we can't expand, we can't reach a new audience,
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  we can't change hearts and minds,
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:49.440]  we can't spread the brush fires of liberty.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  But you know who's not banned yet on social media?
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  You.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:59.440]  You have to be Alex Jones now.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  You have to go to the local Google headquarters in your city
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  with a bullhorn.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  You have to go to the local Google headquarters in your city
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  and do a live video and ask them about the censorship.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  And you say, oh, well, you know, what am I gonna do?
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  You know, I go to some local Google,
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.440]  they don't know anything, they just work there.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.440]  It's about changing the tide.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.440]  It's about trying to throw a touchdown pass.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.440]  It's about trying to move the ball upfield.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:29.440]  Every time you make an excuse not to take action, you lose.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  You lose.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  And tyranny gains.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.440]  And so, yeah, guess what?
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  They're gonna censor Alex Jones.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.440]  They're gonna tell Alex Jones to shut his mouth.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  They're gonna shut him down off everything.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  And then they're gonna act like nothing's going on,
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  nothing to see here.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.440]  And they're gonna get away with it
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:55.440]  if you don't do something about it.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.440]  I just wonder.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:04.440]  I just wonder, are there enough,
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:07.440]  are there enough good men and women left in this country
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  that have a spine
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  and that have the wherewithal
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:18.440]  and just the soul to stand against all of this tyranny?
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:21.440]  You see where this is going.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.440]  You see where this is going.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:25.440]  You can't not see it.
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  God has shown you the vision.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  The Bible has shown you the truth.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  You know where this goes.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.440]  If you don't do anything about it,
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  that's where it goes.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.440]  That's where it ends.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.440]  And you'll be stuck wishing you would have stood against it
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.440]  for your own lineage.
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  You better do something now, folks.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:15.440]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440]  for over a year.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.440]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.440]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.440]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:34.440]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.440]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.440]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.440]  we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:59:13.440]  and infowarslife.com.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.440]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:45.440]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:47.440]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:20.440]  You have about 800 million followers.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.440]  That's why you're banned.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.440]  Social media censorship.
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:27.440]  Virtually every day the big tech companies censor someone else
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:29.440]  whose political opinions they disagree with.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  Facebook's censors are free speech and shame
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:36.440]  on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.440]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.440]  if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.440]  They've broken their algorithm to try to steal the selection.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  And now they're down to the last corners of the Internet.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  We must shut it off.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.440]  People know what's true.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.440]  They can smell it.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:57.440]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.440]  In heirs like Tim Cook, they basically pay no taxes
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.440]  and run slave factories in China,
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:04.440]  but they want the general public to live under a communist model
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  where we're all very, very controlled
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  and they're offshore and above the law.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  Well, Alexandra Cortez, as you know, has come out
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  and said, hey, Donald Trump Jr.,
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.440]  you better not tweet about how we had to eat the dogs
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:15.440]  of Venezuela.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  Now, socialism doesn't work.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.440]  We have subpoena power.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.440]  We'll throw your ass in jail.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.440]  And you've got them threatening to arrest Trump.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.440]  There's no Russiagate stuff, but oh, did he pay off
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.440]  some bimbos 15 years ago.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:27.440]  That's because these people can't win a real argument.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:30.440]  They just want to come to America, these globalists,
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  end their third world populations
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  and basically conquer us
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.440]  and then suck dry the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  The very same globalists have already exploited
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.440]  and oppressed the third world.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.440]  And now they're here pushing their attack on the First Amendment.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.440]  And that's why you've seen George Soros' fund
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  through Media Matters, through the other law firms,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.440]  all these fake lawsuits against us.
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.440]  You've seen all these incredible fake headlines
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.440]  taking out of context or editing what I've said
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  so that I'm seeing incredibly insane things
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.440]  like their secret Martian bases with slaves.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.440]  I never said that so that they can then say,
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.440]  oh, he needs to be taken off the air.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.440]  So first it's Apple and then it's Google
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  and then it's YouTube.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:11.440]  And now it's thousands of other conservatives and libertarians.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  Well, now they're going after talk radio.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.440]  But talk radio has already been to the left
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:19.440]  trying to stop talk radio being set up in the 80s
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:21.440]  when they got rid of the fairness doctrine,
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.440]  the law that didn't let you have partisan talk radio.
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.440]  So talk stations know they've tried to take Limbaugh off
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440]  and Sean Hannity.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440]  They know that they've tried to take Matt Drudge
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440]  and his website off.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440]  So they're aware of this.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:35.440]  And so now the Democrats have really jumped the shark.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.440]  They've taken research from the Southern Primary Law Center,
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:41.440]  the ADL, media matters and others.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.440]  And now they're trying to get us off
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.440]  our local radio stations around the country.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.440]  And they've picked as the first one,
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:50.440]  one of our affiliates in Sacramento
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.440]  to go after that we'll put up on screen, a huge station.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440]  And you read what she says.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  She quotes all these things that I never said or I never did
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:01.440]  and says that I engage in a child endangerment
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  and promotion of violence.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  That's what YouTube took us off for.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  And major publications had to do retractions at the time
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  because they said that I beat up a kid.
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:14.440]  It was ABC News footage of the big 10-year-old hitting adults
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:15.440]  and punching them.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  And he punches the guy four times
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  and the guy pushes the kid down.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  They said that that was me.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  And so now this is just one of the lies.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:25.440]  And so she's saying she wants me taken off the air
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  and then she tells a bunch of lies and half-truths to do it.
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  That's the definition of defamation where you say
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.440]  I want someone off the air
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  and so then you tell a bunch of lies
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  like saying a restaurant puts dead baby parts in the soup
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:39.440]  and isn't true or there's cockroaches in every bit of food
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.440]  and it's not true because you want to shut them down.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.440]  So that's what they're doing, period.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:46.440]  And in my experience, this backfires
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.440]  when they try to bully talk radio stations
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.440]  because talk radio particularly understands
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:53.440]  the leftist globalist agenda of Alexander Cortez
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  and all of them.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.440]  They want us all arrested.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.440]  They want us all off air.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.440]  So they're going to misrepresent out of context.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.440]  Sometimes you totally lie to do it.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  But that's why it's more important than ever.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.440]  If you're watching on a TV station or cable station
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.440]  or listening to a local radio station
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.440]  that you call them and you thank them for picking up the show
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.440]  and you become a sponsor or you let the sponsors know
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.440]  you appreciate them
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  and you tell your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  or just your church, people at four-way stops, the grocery store
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.440]  about that local radio station
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:21.440]  or about that TV station and you thank them
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  because it's that word of mouth
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  versus these scumbags that really counts.
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  You know, we send our crew down to the border
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.440]  to cover the illegal caravan
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.440]  and we had a bunch of antifas around our people.
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.440]  Where were the patriots down there?
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  There are more of us than them, but we've got to get active
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:33.440]  and get involved.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.440]  So their new front to kill the First Amendment
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.440]  is to shut down infowars on talk radio.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:40.440]  I think it'll backfire, but it's up to you.
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.440]  In the last few months,
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.440]  infowars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:02.440]  of many of our best-selling items.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.440]  And then I came up with the idea last week,
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:06.440]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide,
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.440]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:14.440]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.440]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver,
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:18.440]  iodine, 4 to 5 super blue,
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.440]  you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.440]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt,
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.440]  but these are going to be selling out.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.440]  So whatever you order that day,
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:32.440]  there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.440]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:35.440]  for the next group of orders.
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:38.440]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:40.440]  beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:42.440]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.440]  We are losing money on this.
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.440]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.440]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.440]  And don't fight the crowds.
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:49.440]  InfowarsStore.com,
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:50.440]  InfowarsLive.com,
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.440]  or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:56.440]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:07.440]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.440]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.440]  You know, this is really incredible stuff
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.440]  that we're dealing with here.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.440]  There's so many things to cover.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.440]  I've got so much news.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.440]  I've got so many video clips to get to.
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.440]  I'm not even going to be able to do it.
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.440]  In fact, guys, let's...
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.440]  There's so many great videos.
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:27.440]  Let's just carry them over
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  and I'll be able to cover some of them
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:30.440]  on the War Room, I think, today, too.
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:32.440]  Dr. Nick Begich is in studio with me.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.440]  We're about to get his take on all this.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:38.440]  I'm also going to open up the phone lines.
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:39.440]  I don't even need to give out the number.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440]  There's already 5,000 people probably trying to call in.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.440]  So let's just go ahead and start...
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.440]  Just go ahead and start aggregating calls.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.440]  I'm just...
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.440]  Honestly, I'm just floored by this.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:50.440]  I want to get Dr. Begich's opinion.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.440]  I'm just...
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:52.440]  I'm probably even focusing right now
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.440]  because this is so unbelievable what's going on.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.440]  And it's not that I don't understand it.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.440]  It's that I'm sitting here faced with the fact
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.440]  that if you're a big tech company
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.440]  or some sort of big corporation
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.440]  that can buy off congressmen,
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:07.440]  you can get away with whatever the hell you want.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.440]  Anything.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.440]  You can get away with murder.
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.440]  But if you're Alex Jones,
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:13.440]  if you're an American citizen
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:15.440]  and you want to stand up to that
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.440]  and you want to raise awareness about that,
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.440]  you want to execute your right to free speech,
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.440]  shut up and sit down
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:23.440]  and you get sent in on social media
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:26.440]  and you get lied about in western media.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.440]  That's just what we deal with here.
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.440]  And you know what that is?
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:34.440]  That's a recipe for death of a nation.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.440]  So that's where we're at.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  So we're going to take your phone calls
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.440]  on everything that happened in congress.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.440]  We're going to get Dr. Begich's opinion on this
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:41.440]  and everything that we witnessed here.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440]  I've barely even plugged today.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440]  I don't even know where my plug sheet is.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440]  Here it is.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:47.440]  We've got specials going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.440]  It's the 12 days of Christmas,

[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.440]  And today's 12 days of Christmas special
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:57.440]  is 60% off Alpha Power,
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:02.440]  60% off Alpha Power at infowarstore.com.

[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.440]  read about Alpha Power,
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.440]  all the powerful ingredients on there
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.440]  and then read the five star reviews
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.440]  that customers have written about Alpha Power
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.440]  so that you can learn about the effects
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.440]  and what people are saying about it for yourself
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:19.440]  I'm going to go ahead and just leave that to the reviews
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.440]  because well, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:23.440]  let's just say some men,
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.440]  it gives them a little rev in their engine.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:28.440]  But you can go ahead and read the reviews on Alpha Power,
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:32.440]  60% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  And remember, free t-shirt with every order.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.440]  We are all Alex Jones t-shirt,
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:40.440]  which could not be more relevant than it is right now.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:43.440]  That t-shirt could not be more relevant than it is right now.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.440]  And in fact, I was talking about this in the break.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:48.440]  You want to know the correct response
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.440]  to what we witnessed here today
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440]  and we probably won't get it
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.440]  because we're all brain dead,
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:53.440]  we're all chemically induced,
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.440]  you know, fluoride head ninnies basically.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  We're just a bunch of scum now.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.440]  We don't even have a spine to stand up,
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:59.440]  it seems like anymore.
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:02.440]  But if we did, we would go into Congress,
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.440]  the next time there's a hearing like this,
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  100,000, really it should be probably hundreds of thousands strong,
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.440]  and we'd all be wearing the We Are All Alex Jones shirt
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.440]  and saying, hey, look, you're censoring free speech,
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.440]  but you're allowing Apple and Google to get away with high crime.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.440]  You're allowing Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.440]  and James Cohn to get away with treason.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  There's something wrong here.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:23.440]  When Alex Jones gets no rights,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.440]  but Google and Hillary and everyone's above the law.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  So we're going to get your calls,
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:31.440]  we're already getting the calls lined up,
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.440]  and we're going to get Dr. Begich's take on this.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.440]  But folks, remember, the only way we're able, you know, people,
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.440]  I've been doing a lot of interviews, people keep asking,
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  what is the impact of the censorship then?
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  We plan on launching three hours of live programming in 2018.
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:50.440]  Because of the censorship and the removal of our ads
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.440]  on other platforms and the lawsuits,
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  we were not able to get that to fruition.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:58.440]  Now we've got the studio and we're getting the staff,
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.440]  but because of all the censorship and everything,
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:03.440]  we were not able to expand like we'd like to in 2018.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.440]  So fund us during this Christmas sale
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:08.440]  and hopefully we can get that done in 2019.
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  All right, Dr. Nick Begich in studio with me.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.440]  Wow, what is your take on what we just saw on the Capitol Hill?
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:20.440]  Well, I think this is exactly what we should all expect.
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440]  I mean, these guys want to maintain their power.
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.440]  I mean, you think about big media and Google, Apple, Facebook,
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.440]  these are the big ones.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.440]  And in fact, everyone knows, I mean, you can read the literature,
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.440]  you can read the mainstream media even,
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  and there are little bitty clips on the ninth page
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.440]  talking about the social scoring in China.
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.440]  And the fact that these software companies were required
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:46.440]  to make sure those systems were fully accessible,
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:50.440]  fully able to be monitored and scored.
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:53.440]  That programming got written and that programming is being applied
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440]  commercially and politically in the United States.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:59.440]  And we looked at this years ago because this was part of that plan.
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  When I wrote Earthrise and the Revolution with Jim Roderick,
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:06.440]  we went through sort of the evolution of the process
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:10.440]  and people remember there was a program in the Pentagon.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.440]  The name of it slips me at the moment,
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:16.440]  but the program was to get a whole view of the population.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.440]  And it was like this transparent population they were going to get
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.440]  through the internet, through these various vehicles.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:25.440]  It got shut down when it got publicized and instead...
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:27.440]  Yeah, shut down, quote unquote.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.440]  Right, and what it did is it got moved over.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.440]  And so the venture capital side, and there is a venture capital side to the CIA,
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.440]  they have a venture capital fund that they fund startups in Silicon Valley
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  and then they have their hook.
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:44.440]  And I think that hook is well embedded in the Facebooks, the Googles,
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.440]  and the apples of the world that have given them that access,
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.440]  that have given them that ability to take our data and manipulate it.
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.440]  And so they didn't need to build their own system,
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.440]  they just needed to put a little bit of effort on the private side,
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:59.440]  let them evolve a system.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.440]  And then because they're privately managed, right,
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:03.440]  they can do what they want.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  Well, that is not the way it works with freedom of the press.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.440]  Freedom of the press is about informing the public so we all can engage
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.440]  our political process like Alex is doing right now.
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  And what is he doing?
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.440]  They're shutting him out of the very hearing room.
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  He should be in that hearing,
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:21.440]  testifying on the other end of what it's like to be censored
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.440]  by these organizations and the impact it has.
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  You may not like what I say, what Alex says, what Owen says,
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.440]  and all you have to do is change the channel.
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.440]  You don't have a right to not be offended.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.440]  We all are going to be offended by something we hear from somebody,
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.440]  even the closest people to us.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:41.440]  But we have to walk through it, engage our debate,
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.440]  find our humanity again, and engage it.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.440]  Silencing speech is not freedom of speech, it's the opposite.
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:51.440]  And we need to recognize that in this Democratic Republic,
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  as repugnant as somebody's ideas might be,
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.440]  we have to make sure that they have the right to say it.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.440]  Well, it just shows you how far the left has fallen,
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  just with the basic value of free speech.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.440]  They don't even value it enough anymore in their own internal struggle
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.440]  to say, okay, you know what, I may not like it,
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.440]  and I may not like it on my platform,
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  but I have the value of free speech, so I'm going to deal with it.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  No, they just go full authoritarian.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  But you said two things that are very key.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.440]  One thing that I think, I don't even know if you realize
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.440]  how genius it was that you said,
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  but then the other thing is you're 100% right.
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:27.440]  If Alex Jones is this boogeyman that is so bad,
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:29.440]  he has to be censored off the Internet, right?
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.440]  Why has he not been called in for a hearing?
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.440]  Why isn't Congress questioning him on all the crazy things that he said?
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  Why don't they bring him in?
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.440]  Because if they do, it's game over.
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:39.440]  He'll bring it all out.
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:40.440]  It'll be on television.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:41.440]  It'll make national news,
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.440]  and you'll find out everything he's ever talked about is true.
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.440]  But here's what you said that's actually next level genius
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.440]  that I've not heard anyone else say.
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:53.440]  They actually are already implementing the social score in the United States.
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:55.440]  We don't really have anybody talk about that.
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  That's actually so true.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:57.440]  We don't even realize it.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  The social score is already being implemented in the United States.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.440]  You might not see it.
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:03.440]  They might not have some credit report.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  I can go check your credit score,
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]  but it's already happening.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.440]  And what we're seeing is kind of the tip of the iceberg,
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.440]  which is just a blatant censorship.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:13.440]  But under that is actually the social score they're monitoring everyone on.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  Well, and it's more than that
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:17.440]  because that also provides the data that marketers,
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:20.440]  whether you're marketing a politician or marketing a bar of soap,
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:23.440]  and so they're able to give, they're selling that data there.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.440]  They're selling your scoring.
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  They're selling your profile to someone else
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  who then tailors the ad just for you
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  and they zip it right into your front door.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.440]  Yeah, like you'll be talking about,
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  let's say we're talking about, you know,
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.440]  Merrill Boots or something here.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.440]  And then you pull up your computer and it says,
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:41.440]  brand new Merrill Boots.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  And it's like,
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  Hello, we're not in Kansas anymore here.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:47.440]  And this is exactly what's happening.
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  And just simple searches.
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  Because remember, it's the aggregation of the data.
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.440]  The more you search, the more you look,
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  the more profile is revealed about you.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.440]  And they even admit that.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  Right.
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  And we were on the air with Alex yesterday,
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.440]  one of the things I mentioned.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:01.440]  It's somewhere out there, there's a computer programmer.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  And that computer programmer could write a program
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:07.440]  that would run in the background when we're on our computers
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.440]  and just do random searches all over the place.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  China got caught doing it.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:11.440]  Right.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:13.440]  But if we do that as individuals,
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  then you can't get the profile.
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.440]  So someone develops some software that's such as filtering out
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:21.440]  the viruses, but providing a way to disrupt the system monitoring.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.440]  This would be great.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:26.440]  And this kind of software that every person listening to this broadcast
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  would be able to totally disrupt this new world order's ability
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.440]  to look at you and analyze you and look at your data.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:34.440]  Because the data is skewed.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  Look, there's tons of news I may or may not get to.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:39.440]  I'll be live on the war room too later that I may get to these clips.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:41.440]  But the social score is already here.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.440]  I mean, they're already spying on everything you do.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  You're already on the grid.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  I mean, they're censoring you.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.440]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  Like, this is going to change the world you live in.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:54.440]  Do you even care?
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:57.440]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:00.440]  And only one system allows you to produce an endless
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.440]  supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.440]  Silver Lungs.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:07.440]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system,
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:09.440]  respiratory infections are targeted directly,
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:15.440]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:18.440]  and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.440]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.440]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:26.440]  Hear that?
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:28.440]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.440]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:34.440]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:38.440]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:42.440]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:45.440]  someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:50.440]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.440]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:17:21.440]  FakeTV.com
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.440]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:54.440]  Only at SlingBow.com
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.440]  Keep the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:31.440]  to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:33.440]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:34.440]  I need to be provisioned.
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.440]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:39.440]  and all these devil worshipers.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.440]  But I need your prayers.
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:42.440]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:43.440]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:45.440]  We make it easy.
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:47.440]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.440]  and not with Bezos and Amazon.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.440]  And you'll help provision us.
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.440]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at M4store.com.
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.440]  So please take action right now.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.440]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government,
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.440]  the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.440]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.440]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:14.440]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:15.440]  and salute you all.
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:16.440]  Words are not enough.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:21.440]  Think about all the different systems, all the different political ideologies
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:25.440]  that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:29.440]  an open free society against the globalists and the dominant world force.
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:33.440]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:35.440]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.440]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:42.440]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:45.440]  to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:46.440]  I am in your hands.
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:50.440]  And we're under unprecedented attack, and we just need you to go to infowars.com
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:53.440]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:20:19.440]  and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:23.440]  It's the most wonderful time of the year to be a lying corrupt globalist scumbag
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:27.440]  that lies to Congress and gets away with it.
[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:30.440]  I don't know how much more of this we can take, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.440]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.440]  We're going to go to your calls.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.440]  There's all kinds of big news.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.440]  The MK Ultra docs.
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:39.440]  San Francisco announces they're going to have a transgender cultural district.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.440]  My God.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:48.440]  James A. Fields gets sentenced for first degree murder for a woman that had a heart attack.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.440]  Oh, yeah.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.440]  That's going to be used to bring down the Trump momentum.
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.440]  Guarantee you that.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:57.440]  Plus, it's going to be used as a distraction from Sundar Pichai's fake testimony today.
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:01.440]  The guy lies under oath.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:02.440]  Just wow.
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:03.440]  Just wow.
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:04.440]  So we're going to go to your phone lines here.
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.440]  Myself, Dr. Nick Beggish, taking your calls.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.440]  Let's start with Ethan, guys calling in from Kansas.
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:12.440]  A good buddy of mine, InfoWars Army activist.
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:13.440]  Go ahead, Ethan.
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.440]  Yeah.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.440]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:21.440]  Well, first of all, it is absolutely chilling to watch that man sit there and lie and perjure
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:27.440]  himself in front of Congress and say that there's absolutely no proof of censorship happening
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:30.440]  on conservatives at the next level, you know what I mean?
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.440]  No, Ethan.
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:32.440]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.440]  Hey, I don't have a nose on my face.
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:35.440]  No, no, no.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:36.440]  I don't have a nose on my face.
[02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:37.440]  Stop it.
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:38.440]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:43.440]  You know, and what you said was spot on, Owen, that we should all get bullhorned and find
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:49.440]  a Google facility in our city and do Polar Loomer, you know, make our voices heard.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.440]  If we're not going to stand up now, we never will.
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:56.440]  There's been people on Infocoms already dissecting the information, getting out the phone numbers
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:58.440]  and locations of the Google facilities.
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:00.440]  There's Google in Austin.
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:04.440]  There's Google in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado, all over the nation.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.440]  And we've got InfoWars Army people in every single state, so we need to get there.
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:11.440]  We need to do what this monopoly guy did.
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:15.440]  Pulling the troll there behind the guy.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.440]  No, that's absolutely it.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.440]  That's exactly it, Ethan.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.440]  And I don't even do a good enough job promoting this.
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:25.440]  But Infocoms, we've got InfoWarsArmy.com.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:28.440]  We've got Infocoms, which is a link there.
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:35.440]  And you can go communicate with other InfoWarriors, get other InfoWarriors in your state, in your city, whatever.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:36.440]  And you can organize stuff.
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:41.440]  Ethan has already done this. There was one that happened in Austin this weekend that I was at.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:42.440]  So yeah, that's what we need to do.
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:47.440]  We need to mobilize to these Google and Apple headquarters.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:48.440]  It's like this.
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:50.440]  This is what I was going to say, Dr. Baggage.
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.440]  I'm so glad this came to me.
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:59.440]  Just, you know, sometimes it's like a game where you put the corrupt...
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:03.440]  I mean, you literally just show the corruption, but you put it right in front of the face
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.440]  and somehow there's like a weird psychological thing where you miss it, right?
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:07.440]  It's like the old...
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.440]  So what do they do?
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:10.440]  They give you windows.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:11.440]  Well, what is windows?
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.440]  It's a window in everything you've ever done in your life.
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:14.440]  It's literally a window to spy on you.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.440]  What else do they do?
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:16.440]  Well, okay, windows.
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.440]  They don't want to control everything.
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:21.440]  So Bill Gates invests half into Apple.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:22.440]  And then what is Apple?
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.440]  Taking a bite out of the Apple.
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:29.440]  That represents Apple taking the evil of windows and then you have Apple.
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:31.440]  Like, they take a bite out of the Apple in the Bible.
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:33.440]  So, Ethan, final comments.
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:36.440]  So again, tell people about Infocoms and the organization that's going on there
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:41.440]  so people can be mobilized to Google headquarters and such to raise awareness about the censorship
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.440]  and the illegal deals they're making with China.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:45.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:46.440]  So check out Infocoms.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:50.440]  Like I said, go to InfowarsArmy.com and click the link to take you to Infocoms.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:55.440]  There's people making topics right now, getting out the information of where to go.
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:57.440]  The street address is the phone numbers.
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:01.440]  And if you're not able to get mobile right now, the least you can do is make a phone
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:02.440]  call.
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:03.440]  Make your voices heard.
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:04.440]  It's time to get active.
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:07.440]  Yeah, and if you go to these headquarters, you know, the people working there, they're
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:08.440]  going to be totally clueless.
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:09.440]  They have no idea.
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:12.440]  So you politely say, hey, look, Google is censoring people.
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:14.440]  They're following and tracking everything you do.
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:15.440]  It's all illegal.
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:16.440]  They have secret government contracts.
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:18.440]  Sundar Pichai just lied on the road.
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:21.440]  So you just politely tell them, hey, here's what's going on.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:23.440]  And so then you create a little agitation inside.
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:24.440]  They're going to hate that.
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:25.440]  And then they're eventually going to kick you out.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:28.440]  Now maybe you have a viral video and then you get 10, 20, 100 of those.
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.440]  Now you have a nationwide story.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.440]  Ethan, God bless you.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.440]  Thank you so much.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:34.440]  Let's go to Nick calling in from Michigan.
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:35.440]  Go ahead, Nick.
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:39.440]  Hey, I appreciate what you guys do on the show.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:40.440]  Big support to you guys.
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:42.440]  Products wanted to plug a few things.
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.440]  First, foremost, fish oil.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.440]  Big supporter of that.
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:46.440]  I'll come in.
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:47.440]  You know, iodine.
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:50.440]  I'm going to be here what we have.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:55.440]  That's just a few of them on the counter and female male vitality bone broth.
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:56.440]  That's just a few of them.
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.440]  I don't want to go through all of them.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:58.440]  Well, Nick, thank you so much.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.440]  You make everything we do here possible.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.440]  So thank you.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:02.440]  Yeah.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:05.440]  And specifically calling on a clip I saw on YouTube.
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:10.440]  I want to say it's within a year or two old Trump on a 5G meeting.
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.440]  You know, they were displaying some of the technology for 5G and what it would be.
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:17.440]  And he just seemed impressed with it almost.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:18.440]  Oh yeah.
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:19.440]  Yeah.
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:20.440]  He's the man of it.
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:21.440]  He wants to roll it out nationwide.
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:23.440]  They have no clue.
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:24.440]  Yeah.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:26.440]  It just seemed like he was like on board.
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:27.440]  Trump was on board with himself.
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.440]  And it worried me going forward here, you know, who he has in the administration, telling
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:33.440]  him what in his area.
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:37.440]  I know you guys, you speak that on the show, you know, you guys put that out there.
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:38.440]  And he doesn't always have that.
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.440]  This is so ridiculous.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:42.440]  The studies, Dr. Begich, this is, this is one actually something really frustrating.
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.440]  I mean, we're kind of going off on a different jag, but it's all the same vein.
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:47.440]  We have the studies.
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:48.440]  Right.
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.440]  People get brain cancer right behind their ear.
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:52.440]  Right.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.440]  I mean, this isn't a coincidence.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:54.440]  Right.
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:58.440]  In fact, I wrote an article published in 1999 on cell phone safety.
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.440]  It was one of the very first.
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:01.440]  Which is when the studies were actually first coming out.
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.440]  I mean, that's when they did the real studies.
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:04.440]  That's right.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:06.440]  And there were over, I think, 50 or 60 citations.
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:11.440]  It was published in Explore magazine, which is now presently at least up here reviewed.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.440]  But, you know, the issues go back, you know, quite a ways.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  The technology certainly advanced.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:20.440]  You think about 5G rolling out and somewhere in the last few days, we've talked about on
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:22.440]  one of the, one of the shows I've done.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:23.440]  That was yesterday.
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.440]  We did almost an hour on that.
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:25.440]  Yeah.
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:29.440]  And 5G, when you start to think about pulse, pulse modulated signals, which is the essence
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:31.440]  of bio biologically active signals.
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.440]  This is what 5G is all about.
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:34.440]  Well, and they even say it's carcinogenic.
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.440]  I mean, they say it causes cancer.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.440]  It's all the studies have proven.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.440]  Right.
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:39.440]  And they absolutely have.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.440]  In fact, there was a study done at the University of Washington years ago before they had been
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:46.940]  in cell phones even, and the actual frequency ranges that cell phones operated on were found
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:48.440]  to be biologically active.
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:53.440]  And it was, the scientist's last name I believe was Lynn, LYNN.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:56.440]  And he came forward after cell phones and all the controversy.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.440]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:58.440]  We did these studies.
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:03.440]  We've proven this long ago that these are in fact technologies that affect us physiologically.
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:08.440]  The idea of transferring heat into the brain, which essentially what happens with cell phones,
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.440]  the skull thickness is a little bit of a barrier, but not much.
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.440]  So when you look at a five year old, for instance, where the skull is much thinner,
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:22.440]  400% more energy goes into their head from the portable home phone in the house and from
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:23.440]  the cell phone.
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:29.440]  As compared to a teenager, where about two times as much and then a full blown adult with
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:31.440]  fully matured skeletal structure.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:34.440]  That's devastating to think about because you've got these little kids playing on their
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:35.440]  iPads all day now.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:36.440]  All day long.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:37.440]  Just getting blasted.
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:38.440]  That was very important.
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:44.440]  Also in terms of cognitive dysfunction, we're seeing more and more reports now about the
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.440]  very brain structure of children now changing and recent studies released even the last
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:50.440]  few months.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:51.440]  That was on 60 minutes.
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:53.440]  They just released a study with screen time.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:54.440]  But see, here's the thing.
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:55.440]  They already knew this.
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:58.440]  You can look up the stories from Steve Jobs years ago saying, don't let your kids play
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:27:59.440]  on the iPad.
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  I don't let my kids play on the iPad.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:05.440]  And when you think about, I mean, you're talking about the overtness of even the symbolism.
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.440]  Think about television programming.
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:09.440]  The programming is running in the other direction.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:15.440]  It's like, what do you think was going on with the TV from the year 1941 to 1945 before
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:16.440]  they released it?
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.440]  They were testing the light patterns.
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:23.440]  They were testing the flicker rate to ease and control the mind.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:24.440]  I mean, this has all been tested.
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:26.440]  Most of this stuff is declassified.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:29.440]  All right, we're going to continue to take phone calls here.
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:30.440]  Nick, thank you so much for the phone call.
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:31.440]  But you know what?
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:35.440]  Just to prove what Dr. Nick Begich is saying is true here.
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:42.440]  The waves being biological, the army has a weapon using the same frequency waves that
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.440]  literally boils your skin.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:46.440]  And they can ratchet it up.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.440]  They could melt you, essentially.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:50.440]  You think this is crazy?
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:29:19.440]  We'll show you the damn video.

[02:29:46.440 --> 02:30:00.440]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:04.440]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dogs for a walk.
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:05.440]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:10.440]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:15.440]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:20.440]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:24.440]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:29.440]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:36.440]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.440]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.

[02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:20.440]  It's God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:26.440]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:28.440]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:30.440]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:32.440]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:35.440]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.440]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:42.440]  They want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:43.440]  to control everyone.
[02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:45.440]  It's The David Knight Show.
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:48.440]  You never missed your show, any day.
[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:49.440]  And any what?
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:51.440]  I mean, never.
[02:32:51.440 --> 02:33:20.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commencement and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:28.440]  It's the big deal that the government has a radio wave weapon that can boil your skin
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:33.440]  that can be comparable to the 5G technology they want to put down the street from your
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:35.440]  children's school.
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:37.440]  What could possibly go wrong?
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:40.440]  Yeah, leave this video running as we're talking about this, because they show in this video
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:42.440]  how it literally boils your skin.
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:48.440]  I mean, Dr. Nick Begas, this is, I mean, obviously it's not, well, maybe it is weaponized with
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:53.440]  cell phone towers, but this is weaponized version of what they're about to bring to cell
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:54.440]  phone towers.
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:55.440]  Right.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.440]  You know, the idea of this particular technology, when we were on the, on the air yesterday
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:04.440]  with Alex, this very thing came up and it was in the conversation was about testing these
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:09.440]  weapons on Americans first, because under international treaties, we may not be able to do certain
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:13.440]  technologies against our adversaries, like in the chemical weapons and biological treaties,
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:15.440]  but we can do it at home.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:19.440]  There are specific domestic exemptions under all of these international treaties, and it
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:24.440]  was General Wynn in the Air Force who came out and came forward and said, hey, we need
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:27.440]  to test all this stuff on Americans first so we can tell the world it's safe.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:29.440]  He wasn't in very long.
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:31.440]  He kind of disappeared from the scene.
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:36.440]  But this is exactly the mindset of, unfortunately, too many in the leadership of our military
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:41.440]  and an intelligence community that Americans are just test subjects.
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.440]  It was even under the Clinton administration, they admitted over half a million Americans
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:46.440]  as victims of human experiments.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.440]  Here we are again.
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:50.440]  And I want to keep the video rolling until they show the skin boiling part, but this
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:52.440]  is, I mean, there was a story in St. Louis.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:58.440]  I believe it was, I don't remember what year it was, but the government went into a building
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:02.440]  in St. Louis and literally sprayed the whole building with some sort of chemical.
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:06.440]  And it was, it was, I think it was like 90% black occupancy.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.440]  And so they sprayed this building with some chemical and they admitted it was a test.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:13.440]  There's a video right there telling you how this, this radio wave boils your skin.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.440]  This is coming to a cell phone tower near you.
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.440]  The government tests on its citizens all the time.
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:20.440]  Guys, see if you can find the story.
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.440]  I don't know what year it was, but St. Louis government tests, they sprayed some chemical
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:26.440]  on some building.
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  It became some big case.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:29.440]  And I'm not trying to get off the subject of the censorship.
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:30.440]  It's really all the same.
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:33.440]  This is why they censor us, Dr. Baggots, because we know the history.
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.440]  We know the studies, we put it all together and that scares the globalist establishment
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:41.440]  because their Achilles' heel is exposure.
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.440]  Right.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  And in fact, when you start to look at how things have been developed within, within,
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:49.440]  even how they're developed within the intelligence community, it's the same way.
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.440]  Everything's compartmentalized.
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:51.440]  Everything's separated and segregated.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.440]  And eventually it all comes together in a big net that everyone can then see.
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:56.440]  And that's what's happened.
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:01.440]  And so much of under the Freedom of Information Act, private corporations are exempt.
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.440]  So now what has happened over the last, since 1976, is greater and greater amounts of the
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:11.440]  intelligence community's work is farmed out, where you have no reach, you have no access,
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:12.440]  you have no visibility.
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:17.440]  This is, again, a loophole, a huge loophole in the law that needs to be filled and fixed.
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:20.440]  And the Trump administration is the perfect position to do it.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.440]  Freedom of Information should be exactly about that.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.440]  Government contractors should be subject to the same legislation as the government is.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.440]  In this case, you take the contract, you subordinate, or you don't get the contract.
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:33.440]  You subordinate to the will of the American people.
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:37.440]  Oh, but unless you're Sundar Pichai, then you just run everything and you can lie under oath
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.440]  and nobody's going to question you.
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.440]  And this is again where everyone listening to this broadcast again, get on the phone.
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:46.440]  And you know the articles and stuff that gets clipped and that gets shown on these clips?
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:49.440]  Look them up yourself or when you see the articles, cut them out.
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:51.440]  Don't assume your congressman has seen them.
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:52.440]  Send them in.
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:55.440]  And flood social media with these videos that they want banned.
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:57.440]  Make them ban all of us.
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:36:59.440]  Action is the only victory.
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.440]  Resistance is the only victory.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:03.440]  All right, let's take a phone call from Jerome in New York.
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:05.440]  Go ahead, Jerome.
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:06.440]  Hello.
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:07.440]  Hello, guys.
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:08.440]  Lookie.
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.440]  I'm going to try to keep myself calm.
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:10.440]  This is a...
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:13.440]  I'm the guy from China, but I'm a state guy right now.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:19.440]  But it's much easier to see what's going on when you live over there and you start looking back this way.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:25.440]  All the censorship, the big tags, the media, you know, the social media giants, all that.
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:30.440]  Those guys, by whose authority do they have to censor anyone?
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:32.440]  Oh, and Dr. Baggage.
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:36.440]  You know, it's the government's plan to take place.
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:38.440]  That's the government that's involved in.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:42.440]  It's just like that show that they put on the day with that Google CEO.
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.440]  But think about the mind control, Jerome, where, look, I'm okay to take some argument.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:51.440]  I mean, public forum or not, that depends on what they want to declare themselves.
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:57.440]  But I'm okay to have the debate and the argument that says, okay, if you're a private company and you want to censor people, then fine.
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  I'm okay with that debate.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:03.440]  But the next, the lies is that they act like it's not going on.
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:06.440]  That's how you know there's a purpose behind it.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.440]  That's how you know that there's an agenda driving it because they're lying about it.
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:16.440]  You know, this is one where maybe I differ a little bit from you, because I don't agree they have a right to censor at all.
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:23.440]  When you engage the public airwaves, which is what we're talking about, they belong to us, not to them.
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.440]  They're regulated on our behalf, not for them.
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:34.440]  And fundamentally, you can have a private enterprise, but as soon as you touch those public airwaves, those public communication channels that allow for freedom of speech,
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.440]  now you've crossed a line, now you've entered into the domain of the public.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:43.440]  You've entered the domain of the true government, the sovereign humans that live on this planet.
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:52.440]  So in that domain, the ether between us, the space that connects us, the energy between us, if that isn't fundamental to who we are,
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:58.440]  and the way in which modern technology and knowledge transfers today, this belongs to us, not corporations.
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:38:59.440]  Well, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:01.440]  I'm just saying I'm at least willing to have that debate.
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:03.440]  The point is we don't even have that debate.
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.440]  Anything else, Jerome?
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.440]  Ask me a question about China.
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.440]  What do you want to know what's going on over there?
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  I tried to take a trip out to Tibet.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  I was taking a loop around the Silk Road.
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:17.440]  They wouldn't let me go.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:18.440]  They stopped me.
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.440]  They said it was too dangerous for Americans to go over there.
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:22.440]  Right.
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:23.440]  Yeah.
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.440]  Dangerous for who?
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:27.440]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:28.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:30.440]  You know, doctor, you know what's going on.
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:31.440]  Yes, indeed.
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  And you know, I'll tell you what, it's whether it's in China, whether it's in the United States or somewhere else,
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.440]  the reality is it's about changing the way that we perceive the world.
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.440]  And so instead of us driving the truck, we're allowing these international organizations,
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:53.440]  these globalist corporations that have no sense of patriotism,
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:56.440]  no sense of connection to the American people.
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:58.440]  For them, it's just another market to exploit.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  Now, I say something else about China, and I think you would agree.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:06.440]  When you look at the United States as a growing economy, you know, the margins thin,
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:09.440]  you know, there's not much more to grow from most people's perspective.
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  But when you look at China with a billion people trying to get it in the middle class,
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  there's a lot of upside there.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.440]  So you can think of it as a penny stock with a great deal of upsides that's going to the hundred bucks.
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  But the mature stock, the United States, is already the hundred dollars a share.
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:25.440]  So it might take up another one point or two points at a time.
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:28.440]  So the globalists are going for where the money is,
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:33.440]  and they're shifting the production capacity out of the West into where billions,
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  not hundreds of millions like in Europe and the United States,
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:39.440]  but billions of people live that are coming into the middle class.
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:42.440]  Because that's where the money is, and you can follow the money.
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  And it's exiting the West, headed to the East,
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:48.440]  and it's falling under their ideologies, their philosophies,
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.440]  and the way in which those governments, which you have to recognize,
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:53.440]  are still communist governments.
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.440]  They view us very differently on a set of fundamental values.
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:58.440]  Which is why there's no resistance,
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:01.440]  which is why they shift all that power to the East,
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.440]  where they don't have the resistance in their DNA most recently,
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:06.440]  like we have here in the West.
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:08.440]  That's why it's so hard to take us down and spin.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.440]  That's why they hit us with the chemicals and everything they do,
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:11.440]  and spy on the censorship.
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:14.440]  All right, let's squeeze in one more call here from,
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.440]  let's go to Pastor Sam before we go to this next break.
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:19.440]  Go ahead, Pastor Sam.
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:20.440]  Hey, Yoli.
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  Hey, Dr. Beggett.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:22.440]  Thanks for coming out today.
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:24.440]  I'm really watching this because, you know,
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:26.440]  I believe in the mark of the beach,
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:28.440]  and it's all being rolled out in Venezuela,
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:30.440]  and it's only going to get worse.
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.440]  What I really wanted to add to the conversation today
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:36.440]  is the Air Force activity,
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:38.440]  both with the United States Air Force
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.440]  and the Russian Air Force in the Americas.
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.440]  It was on drugs just yesterday
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:45.440]  that Russia is moving two of their supersonic heavy bombers
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:47.440]  into Venezuela.
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.440]  So what that does is it unmasks the fact
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:53.440]  that the Russians and the Chinese are not both involved
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:56.440]  in the reconstruction of Venezuela right now.
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.440]  And of course, this is the initial point.
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  This is the start point of the caravans.
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:03.440]  And let's not forget Venezuela's president said,
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:05.440]  you know, basically, screw America.
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:07.440]  We're going to switch off the petrodollar
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  and do anything to separate our ties from America.
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:14.440]  You know, something else about China in Latin America.
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:16.440]  You know, there's like a million Chinese
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:18.440]  in South America right now.
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.440]  And when you go, I've traveled a fair amount in the last year or so
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:25.440]  in Ecuador, particularly a huge Chinese presence.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:27.440]  They bring their own companies in.
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:28.440]  They bring their own labor in.
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:30.440]  They bring their own resources in.
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.440]  And they own what they build.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:34.440]  And it's happening everywhere.
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:36.440]  Final 10 seconds, Pastor Sam, go ahead.
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  The 82nd Airborne is on the move.
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:42.440]  Fourth rack was closed for versus funeral on December 6th.
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:46.440]  And over 20 to 130s were spotted over Arizona on radar.
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:48.440]  From there, they can go over to see a courthouse
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:50.440]  to go to California and go to anything.
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.440]  There's no doubt massive war games are happening.
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:54.440]  What does it all mean? We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  Info wars has been proven absolutely on target
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:00.440]  about world government, the attack on the family,
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:03.440]  the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.440]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:07.440]  You've been proven dead on as supporters
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:09.440]  and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:11.440]  You've been the men and women in the arena.
[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:13.440]  And I really do thank you and salute you.
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  All words are not enough.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:17.440]  Think about, of all the different systems,
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:19.440]  of all the different political ideologies
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:21.440]  that you have been on target,
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:24.440]  promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:26.440]  an open free society against the globalist
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  and the dominant world force.
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:30.440]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:32.440]  that can't communicate with each other.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:34.440]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:36.440]  Human liberty, a pro-human future
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  versus the globalist anti-human future.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:40.440]  And that's why I want to thank you all
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:42.440]  and ask you now more than ever to remember
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:44.440]  that info wars really is your baby.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:45.440]  I am in your hands.
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:47.440]  And we're under unprecedented attack
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:49.440]  and we just need you to go to info wars 4.com
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:51.440]  and do your Christmas shopping there
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:52.440]  and get the best deals ever.
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:54.440]  And funding info war a true 360 win.
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:57.440]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:58.440]  than it really is.
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:00.440]  The real drama can be found here
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:01.440]  in Leilani estates.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:03.440]  But a lot of us on the big island
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:04.440]  rely on rain water.
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  And we need to be concerned about ash
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:08.440]  and acid rain.
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:11.440]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:13.440]  And acid rain could lower the pH
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:15.440]  of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.440]  To find out, we employed a series of tests
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:21.440]  for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:23.440]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:25.440]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:27.440]  and acidity in the rain water.
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:29.440]  Next, we tested the water
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:31.440]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:33.440]  And not only were the heavy metal levels
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  within safe measure,
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:37.440]  but the pH was also restored
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:38.440]  to optimal levels.
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.440]  As it turns out,
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:42.440]  the filter on the Alexa pure
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:44.440]  raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:46.440]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  and acid rain can contaminate
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:49.440]  a rain water supply.
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:51.440]  But more importantly,
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:45:20.440]  a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:22.440]  For more than ever,
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:24.440]  M4 Wars needs your support
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:25.440]  to continue to promote
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:27.440]  the spirit of Liberty and Americana.
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:29.440]  The truly is the Christmas spirit.
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:30.440]  When you shop at m4warstore.com,
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:32.440]  you don't just get incredible sales

[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:35.440]  You fund the very tip of the spear
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:36.440]  in the fight against the globalists.
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:39.440]  Today's 24-hour only special
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:41.440]  at m4warstore.com is
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:43.440]  our best-selling alpha power.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:45.440]  Believe me, you want to try this.
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:46.440]  It's 60% off.
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:48.440]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:50.440]  As we prepare to close it out,
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:51.440]  we will all again
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:53.440]  for making the entire m4war possible.
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:56.440]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:45:59.440]  Everybody knows that history documents it,
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  but there is a cult in every culture
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.440]  and every system throughout history
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:05.440]  that wants to hurt children.
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:06.440]  They want to abort children.
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:08.440]  They want to disease children.
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:09.440]  They want to abuse children.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:10.440]  They want to confuse children.
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:11.440]  They want their essence.
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:12.440]  They want their soul.
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:13.440]  They want their spirit.
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:15.440]  They want their power
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:17.440]  because they are our future.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:19.440]  And this Christmas,
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.440]  remember, it is about Jesus Christ,
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:21.440]  not ultimate sacrifice.
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:23.440]  It is about the West.
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:24.440]  It is about a human future
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  and standing with each other
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:27.440]  and believing in a better future.
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.440]  That's what I want to thank you all
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:30.440]  for your support.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:31.440]  But I want to ask you all
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:32.440]  to pray for your own family,
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.440]  to pray for America,
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.440]  to pray for President Trump,
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  to pray for m4wars,
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:38.440]  and to remember
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:39.440]  that you have the power
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:40.440]  to change the world.
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:44.440]  You have the power
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:46.440]  to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:47.440]  You've been taking action,
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:48.440]  I salute you,
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:49.440]  but just remember,
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:50.440]  I know you're humble,
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:51.440]  but just remember,
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:53.440]  you hold the future of this planet
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.440]  and the universe in your hands.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:01.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:10.440]  Alright, I just want to get right
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:11.440]  to your phone calls here,
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:12.440]  but just understand,
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:14.440]  the market of China and India,
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:16.440]  which is totally controlled,
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:18.440]  is what these big tech companies
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:20.440]  are lusting after,
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:21.440]  because they can get away
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:22.440]  with anything over there
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:23.440]  and then just bring it to the west,
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:24.440]  and people here are so dumb down,
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.440]  they won't even blink an eye.
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  But I want to get to some
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  of your phone calls here
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:28.440]  with Dr. Nick Beggage.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:31.440]  Let's start with Kim in North Carolina.
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  Go ahead, Kim.
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:36.440]  Hi, Owen and Dr. Nick.
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:37.440]  I support m4wars,
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  and I use your products as a nurse.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:42.440]  I totally trust your products.
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:43.440]  And Dr. Nick,
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:46.440]  I also appreciate your segments.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:48.440]  As a nurse, I learn a lot.
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:49.440]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:50.440]  And Dr. Nick,
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:52.440]  you mentioned Google's capitalizing
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:54.440]  off of the people,
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  and all of a sudden,
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:58.440]  I don't know if anybody's noticed,
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:01.440]  but there has been so many
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:04.440]  Google Chromebook products
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:06.440]  on the market all of a sudden.
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:08.440]  They're really cheap.
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:10.440]  But let's take that one step.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:12.440]  Do you know where most of these Chromebooks
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:14.440]  are going into the local schools?
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  They're getting contracts with the schools.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:17.440]  All these Chromebooks,
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:18.440]  a lot of them are going to schools.
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:19.440]  Right.
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:20.440]  And you know,
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  this is one of the things.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:22.440]  They make the hardware very cheap,
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:24.440]  because where they make their really big money
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  is the reoccurring ad revenue.
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:28.440]  And that has to do with collecting your data,
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:30.440]  selling that data to advertisers,
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:32.440]  and then making the revenue streams from that.
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:34.440]  So to get the computers in your hands,
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:36.440]  as long as they keep that advertising flow,
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:37.440]  that's where they make their big money.
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:38.440]  Yeah, that's just like a portal
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:40.440]  to their marketing strategy.
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:41.440]  Yeah, think about it like this.
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  You go to buy a book.
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:44.440]  You buy one book.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:45.440]  You don't buy ten of the same book.
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.440]  But if you buy the one book, in this case,
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:49.440]  the Chromebook, the technology version of it,
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  and now you have to have an interaction,
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:53.440]  because every time you're using it,
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  you're reading more information,
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:55.440]  but then they're feeding in the ads,
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:57.440]  and that's where their cash flow comes.
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:48:59.440]  And then they have this whole facade.
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:01.440]  They say the Google Chromebook is safe
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:03.440]  from any viruses or foreign interference.
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  Meanwhile, it's the Chinese
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:07.440]  are literally behind there getting everything.
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:09.440]  So it's like this whole facade.
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:10.440]  Anything else, Kim?
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.440]  That's my point,
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:14.440]  that they are using the information
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.440]  and they're using it against us.
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:21.440]  And I believe possibly some of the people
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:24.440]  who are in government may be getting
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:26.440]  some kickbacks from that money.
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:29.440]  Oh, Kim, you're a very kind lady, Kim.
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:31.440]  They call that campaign contribution.
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:34.440]  Diane Feinstein got caught
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.440]  with a Chinese spy for 20 frickin' years.
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:41.440]  Harry Reid and his dirty dealin' son
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:43.440]  got caught trying to do illegal land deals
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:44.440]  with the Chinese in Nevada.
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:46.440]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:48.440]  Quite frankly, you wanna know my conspiracy theory?
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:51.440]  China's burning California to the ground right now
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:53.440]  so that they can buy up all that land chief
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:54.440]  from the Democrats.
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:55.440]  This is what these people do.
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:57.440]  So, Kim, you're more accurate than you even realize.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:49:59.440]  All right, let's jump to Judy calling in from Florida.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.440]  Go ahead, Judy.
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  Hi, Owen. Hi, Dr. Baggage.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:06.440]  Something that the other Owen,
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  when Owen Benjamin had stated recently...
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:10.440]  He's the other Owen.
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:11.440]  Thank you for getting that right.
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:12.440]  Thank you.
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:13.440]  Your...
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:16.440]  Will always be Owen number one.
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:17.440]  I'm not trying to talk or dig it.
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:18.440]  Well, I'm honored.
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:19.440]  I know I love Owen Benjamin. He's awesome.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:21.440]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.440]  But what he brought up about Laura Loomer,
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:24.440]  and I tended to agree,
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:27.440]  it was that it was wonderful her protest
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:34.440]  when she handcuffed herself to Twitter's door.
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.440]  But that she was there too short of a period of time
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:39.440]  to really make the statement that she could have.
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:41.440]  And just to get your gentleman's opinion,
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:43.440]  what do you think would have happened?
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  And I would have done the exact same thing that Alex did
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:48.440]  when the order follower, the DC cop,
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:50.440]  came up to him and told him to shut up.
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:52.440]  What if he got himself arrested?
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:54.440]  Do you think that would have been productive,
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:57.440]  particularly since the fact that he's 100% in the right?
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:50:59.440]  I thought about that too,
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:02.440]  and that's a philosophical thing you can go down
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:06.440]  and really the only answer would be in the execution of that.
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:08.440]  I don't necessarily think that's the best idea,
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:10.440]  but again, who really knows.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:13.440]  But here's what I would say when it comes to Laura Loomer thing
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:15.440]  and kind of expanding on that.
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.440]  You know, people wanted to make fun of Laura Loomer
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:21.440]  for doing that, saying she looks like an idiot.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:22.440]  She looks like this.
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.440]  She's making a fool of herself.
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:24.440]  Well, I got news for you.
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:27.440]  The only idiot making a fool of themselves
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:29.440]  is the idiot that doesn't take action.
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:31.440]  The fool that doesn't take action.
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:34.440]  The fool that doesn't see what Laura Loomer was attempting to do
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:36.440]  and successfully did that day,
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:38.440]  became the number one trend on Twitter where she got banned.
[02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:39.440]  Right.
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:41.440]  And you know, this is, I think, standing up
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:43.440]  in all the different ways that we can
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:46.440]  and using our own imaginations and doing it.
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:47.440]  I mean, that was a peaceful thing.
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:49.440]  There was no violence involved in that.
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:52.440]  This was a way to grab attention.
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:53.440]  Oh, you mean like, unlike the left,
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:56.440]  we don't go like riot and break things and steal things?
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.440]  I mean, we're not dumping cars over and lighting them on fire.
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:00.440]  We're not doing any of that stuff.
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.440]  But when we have the opportunities to be heard,
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:04.440]  we should be heard.
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:07.440]  And we should be heard as people that are respectful.
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.440]  Not what we've seen coming from the left.
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  This lack of respect, this lack of consideration.
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.440]  We can be the respectful folks that have values
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:18.440]  that are expressed in the way we present ourselves,
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:20.440]  but we don't back down.
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:22.440]  We stand our ground.
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:23.440]  We stand up.
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:26.440]  We are heard and we find those ways to be heard.
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:27.440]  And Twitter is a great thing.
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:29.440]  If you use it, I don't do social media
[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:32.440]  because I've been writing about it for too long.
[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:33.440]  I took a try.
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:35.440]  I did Facebook four days and I was so disappointed
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:37.440]  with what I saw there.
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:39.440]  I can't even do it commercially.
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:40.440]  It just doesn't work.
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:41.440]  I hear you, man.
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:44.440]  But I appreciate it because we're stuck.
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:46.440]  On the one hand, if you want your word out,
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:48.440]  you've got to utilize these channels.
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  And now they're chopping us off.
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  Fundamentally unreasonable.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.440]  More than that, it should not be their right to do this.
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:58.440]  It should be our right to see to it that they can't.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:52:59.440]  Ben, anyone.
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:00.440]  But here's the thing.
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:01.440]  I forget who I was talking about this with.
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:04.440]  It's like if you go do some stunt
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:06.440]  and if you just change one person's mind,
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:08.440]  or you just open one person's mind,
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:09.440]  then it's totally worth it.
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:10.440]  Absolutely.
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:13.440]  In fact, I have this discussion often
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:16.440]  because what we call small things
[02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:19.440]  may not, in fact, be small things.
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:22.440]  And who is the one person that you might hit,
[02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:24.440]  the guy that changes everything?
[02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:27.440]  And I use the example of simple things every one of us can do.
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:29.440]  You walk in down the street, someone's walking by,
[02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:31.440]  you smile at them, you know, and you sail up.
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.440]  A lot of people don't do that anymore.
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:34.440]  No, that's like assault now.
[02:53:34.440 --> 02:53:35.440]  Right.
[02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:36.440]  But that's a human thing.
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:39.440]  And maybe that person needed that just touch
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:41.440]  of another human being in that moment.
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:43.440]  And instead of going off to commit suicide,
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:45.440]  which is where they were walking, they don't.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:47.440]  And then maybe they cure cancer the next year.
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:48.440]  Now, who was more important?
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:50.440]  The person who came up with the cure,
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:52.440]  the person who came up with the smile.
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:54.440]  And I would say the smile because without it,
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:55.440]  nothing would have happened next.
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:57.440]  There are no small things.
[02:53:57.440 --> 02:53:59.440]  There's only things that need to be done.
[02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:01.440]  Do what you believe is right and true.
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:03.440]  Step into that and try.
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:06.440]  That's all the creator ever asked of us is try.
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:07.440]  Step into your truth.
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:09.440]  Demonstrate that truth.
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:13.440]  Walk where you go and let people see the light in you.
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:15.440]  That changes things.
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:17.440]  That that that's the key right there.
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  The creator gave us everything,
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:24.440]  gave us this earth, this life, this consciousness
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:28.440]  to act, not to be, not to lay down,
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:30.440]  not to accept things, but to...
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  This is our life, man.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:34.440]  God gave you life.
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:37.440]  To choose the thing that distinguished us
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:40.440]  from so many other things as this free will thing.
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:41.440]  We get to choose.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:44.440]  We get to choose how we interpret the world around us
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:45.440]  and then how we engage it.
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:47.440]  We get to choose whether or not we're going to lay down
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:48.440]  or stand up.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:53.440]  God wants us to choose to be who we were created to be,
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:57.440]  which is the image and likeness of the creation itself.
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:00.440]  Step into what we are with confidence knowing
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:03.440]  that each step doesn't mean we're going to succeed every time.
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:04.440]  It's in those failures.
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:05.440]  We get our greatest lessons.
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:07.440]  Learn from our mistakes.
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:09.440]  Learn from those trials and grow from them.
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:10.440]  That's what the creator intended.
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:12.440]  That's what the earth is about.
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:14.440]  I'm totally honest.
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:18.440]  I'm just totally enthralled by the intelligent design of this earth.
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:19.440]  Wow.
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:23.440]  But we got to sling this mud with this politics crap
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:24.440]  that we put up with.
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:25.440]  Just try to free people's minds.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:26.440]  All right.
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:29.440]  I want to take this final call from Sean, myself and Dr. Nick Baggage
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:31.440]  before I sign off and Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:33.440]  Sean, ArmyVet calls in from New Jersey.
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  Go ahead, Sean.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:36.440]  Hey, Owen.
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:39.440]  I'd like to thank you gentlemen for taking my call.
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  Thank you for calling.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:41.440]  Thanks.
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:44.440]  I have a huge gripe.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:50.440]  I've grown very sick and tired of all these bought and paid for.
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:52.440]  Well, that's a shame.
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:54.440]  That's a shame that we lost Sean.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:56.440]  But I think I know where he was going with this.
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:00.440]  Bought and paid for politicians just being totally worthless.
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:01.440]  All right.
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  Let's just squeeze in one more quick call.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:03.440]  So sorry we lost you, Sean.
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:04.440]  God bless you.
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:05.440]  Thank you for your service.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:06.440]  Georgia, New Mexico.
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:07.440]  You got a minute.
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:08.440]  Go ahead.
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:10.440]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:12.440]  How'd you like that monopoly guy, man?
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:15.440]  I love that monopoly guy.
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:16.440]  Highlight of the day.
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:17.440]  But you know what, man?
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:20.440]  I want to say that hearing was very interesting.
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:25.440]  And it's actually from my highlight besides the monopoly guy was,
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:28.440]  you know, your guy's is a congressman, Mr.
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:29.440]  Gomer.
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:33.440]  He really nailed, nailed into, you know, Sunbar or Sundar,
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:34.440]  whatever his name is.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:35.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:36.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.440]  Louis Gomer.
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  He's a good guy.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:39.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.440]  He really nailed into him about, you know, one about saying, you know,
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:46.440]  you claim that you, you are unaware of any bias.
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  He's like, but everybody around you, you know, it's, it's like,
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.440]  you know, being real liberal and everybody around you, you say,
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:57.440]  I don't want to say you're, I don't want to think you're being dishonest.
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:01.440]  He said, but either that or it's like a blind man who can't see and can't
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:04.440]  see the light because there's nothing but darkness around him.
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:08.440]  And look, that's, that's Louis Gomer and Representative Smith from Texas.
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:11.440]  Well, being polite and, you know, not wanting to ruffle any feathers.
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:13.440]  I'm, that's the one thing I have.
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:15.440]  You have to ruffle the feathers, man.
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:17.440]  You got to go in there and call it out.
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  It's like, no, you are lying.
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.440]  And if, and if you really don't know this is going on, you're a joke of a CEO.
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Final words, Nick Beckett.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:27.440]  Hey, we're, this is about spiritual politics too.
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:31.440]  You know, we took the break yesterday in the war room to get away from politics.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:35.440]  We entered the realm of spiritual politics where our power resides,
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:39.440]  where the opposition fears is when we rise up and recognize what we are
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:41.440]  and claim our birth right back.
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:44.440]  Grab it back and change the world right here on the board.
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:45.440]  Discover your power.

[02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:50.440]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship
[02:58:50.440 --> 02:58:53.440]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:55.440]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:58.440]  They even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products,
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:03.440]  but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally
[02:59:03.440 --> 02:59:05.440]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:05.440 --> 02:59:08.440]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast
[02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:11.440]  is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:14.440]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:17.440]  so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:20.440]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:21.440]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:25.440]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.440 --> 02:59:28.440]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:31.440]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen,
[02:59:31.440 --> 02:59:34.440]  but you've got a back-ish and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.440 --> 02:59:37.440]  I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:40.440]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:43.440]  if you financially support us at infowarsore.com
[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:55.440]  I give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:00:14.440 --> 03:00:16.440]  The fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:18.440]  and obviously we're going to have further updates
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:20.440]  on the Google hearings today
[03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:23.440]  and the multiple lives of the Google CEO
[03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:27.440]  who of course was confronted by Alex Jones and Roger Stone
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:29.440]  with breaking news here.
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:31.440]  The Christmas season has begun
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:34.440]  and also what's begun is attacks on Christmas markets.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:36.440]  Once again you remember back in 2016
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:40.440]  we had the attack in Berlin on the Christmas market there
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:43.440]  that killed about a dozen people, injured dozens more.
[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:46.440]  Now I have this article out of the mirror.
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:48.440]  Strasbourg shooting one dead three injured
[03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:51.440]  after gunshots near Christmas market.
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:55.440]  It looks like the gunman was targeting soldiers.
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:57.440]  They were the ones who shot him dead.
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:00:59.440]  One person has died and three more injured
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:02.440]  after gunshots were fired near Strasbourg Christmas market tonight.
[03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:04.440]  Strasbourg obviously being in France.
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:06.440]  The wounded were seen lying on the floor
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:07.440]  and desperately taking shelters.
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:09.440]  Markets in nearby restaurants were evacuated.
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:12.440]  Chilling videos capture people cowering on the floor
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:14.440]  and running in fear.
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:17.440]  Obviously running past those diversity barriers
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:19.440]  which are now in place at all Christmas markets
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:22.440]  basically in every major European city
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:25.440]  including now even little towns in England
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:28.440]  which aren't even centres of major tourism
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:30.440]  again in these diversity barriers.
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:34.440]  But these didn't stop this gunman in this instance.
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:35.440]  Obviously not.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:36.440]  Armed police have also been pictured
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.440]  descending in the city centre
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:41.440]  and this article quotes a BBC report saying
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:44.440]  that a French journalist saw soldiers shoot a man dead
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:49.440]  who was reportedly targeting them.
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:51.440]  So we don't know the full details of this.
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:53.440]  It could just be a lunatic with a gun.
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:55.440]  It could be a terror attack
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:57.440]  especially if they're targeting soldiers
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:01:59.440]  then that would appear to be the case
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:01.440]  but we don't know the full details yet.
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:06.440]  One person dead three injured in Strasbourg France today.
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  We'll get more on that as it develops.
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:10.440]  Speaking of Christmas,
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:12.440]  I'm going to cover this and a bunch of stories over the next hour.
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:15.440]  A Canadian councillor wants to make Christmas less Christian
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  to avoid offending, you guessed it, Muslims
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:22.440]  but they actually quote a Muslim councillor in this article
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:24.440]  who says that he's not even offended by it.
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:28.440]  It's the white liberal middle class Canadian councillor
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  who's literally offended by Christmas trees
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:35.440]  who was literally triggered by a red display of flowers
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:36.440]  to symbolise Christmas.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:38.440]  He said that was not secular enough
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:41.440]  and now he's basically launched a purge
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:45.440]  against Christmas decorations in Victoria Canada.
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  So we're going to get into that.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:50.440]  We're going to get into Twitter informing Western critics of Islam
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:52.440]  if they violate Sharia law.
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:56.440]  Pakistan is basically sending out notifications to Twitter users
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:00.440]  saying that their tweets violate the law in Pakistan.
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:02.440]  Not that that even matters to anyone
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:04.440]  because nobody's trying to abide by the laws in Pakistan
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.440]  because they're absolutely ridiculous.
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  And in fact, in one of the examples I give here,
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:14.440]  it's literally a tweet saying that a terrorist should be prosecuted
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:17.440]  and the mosque from which this terrorist came
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:19.440]  should be investigated by authorities.
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:23.440]  So criticising terrorists apparently is now against the law in Pakistan
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:27.440]  and Twitter is very keen to inform users of that fact,
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:30.440]  which again, of course, has a chilling effect on free speech.
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:36.440]  Also, Google approves that for Muslims to report people who commit blasphemy.
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:40.440]  So of course, the Info Wars app is still available in Android for now,
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:42.440]  banned in the Apple Store, of course,
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:46.440]  but I'm sure this app is also available in the Apple Store.
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:48.440]  It's at least available in the Android Store
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:52.440]  with the focus of allowing Muslims to report individuals who commit blasphemy.
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  So we've literally got big tech banning people like Laura Loomer
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:58.440]  for criticising female genital mutilation,
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.440]  meanwhile actually allowing their platform to be used for apps
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:06.440]  to report people for the crime of blasphemy,
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:08.440]  which isn't a crime, obviously, in the United States
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:13.440]  or any basic decent country that holds in sacrosanct
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:16.440]  any basic value of free speech.
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:19.440]  We've got a lot of immigration news to come as well
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:23.440]  with the situation in Europe as intense as ever before.
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  Bureaucrat nominated to be the next EU chief.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:29.440]  He's going to be the next EU commissioner by the looks of it.
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:34.440]  Says that Europe uniting with Africa is a matter of destiny.
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:37.440]  Despite polls, the new Pew survey today,
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:39.440]  which said that out of 27 nations poll,
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:44.440]  zero out of 27 nations want more immigrants to move to their country.
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:46.440]  We'll get into all that news and more after the break.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:49.440]  This is the Alex Schoenberg Show Live breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:51.440]  We'll be back.
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  In the last few months,
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:58.440]  infowars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:00.440]  of many of our best-selling items.
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:02.440]  And then I came up with the idea last week,
[03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:04.440]  let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide,
[03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:06.440]  50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:12.440]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:15.440]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver,
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:17.440]  iodine-fortified super blue,
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:22.440]  we'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:24.440]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt,
[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:26.440]  but these are going to be selling out.
[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:29.440]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day
[03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:31.440]  that's there until it sells out.
[03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:33.440]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:35.440]  So in the next 12 days,
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:38.440]  we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:40.440]  So this is a loss leader.
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:42.440]  We are losing money on this.
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:43.440]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:45.440]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:47.440]  And don't fight the crowds in FullWarsStore.com,
[03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:51.440]  in FullWarsLive.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:06:16.440]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:21.440]  God, the Alex Jones show we're hitting a lot of news right now, first on again to this story,
[03:06:21.440 --> 03:06:23.440]  which is up on infowars.com.
[03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:27.440]  From this morning, Canadian counsellor wants to make Christmas less Christian
[03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:30.440]  to avoid offending Muslims.
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:34.440]  Now, he's more offended than anyone else, including actual Muslim counsellors,
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:36.440]  as this article gets into.
[03:06:36.440 --> 03:06:39.440]  The counsellor in Victoria, Canada has succeeded.
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:43.440]  They accepted his proposal in securing a review of the city's Christmas decorations
[03:06:43.440 --> 03:06:49.440]  after he expressed concerns like that things like Christmas trees were not secular enough.
[03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:52.440]  That's right, Christmas trees, which is actually pagan, if I remember correctly.
[03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:54.440]  It's not even Christian.
[03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:59.440]  Even Christian were not secular enough and needed to be more diverse
[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:02.440]  because they may offend Muslims.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:06.440]  This is counsellor Ben Isit, who has won support for the inquiry,
[03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:10.440]  which will look at further secularizing or increasing the diversity of cultural elements
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:14.440]  in seasonal decorations, reports of Vancouver Sun.
[03:07:14.440 --> 03:07:19.440]  Now, about 10 years ago, probably more closest to 15 years ago,
[03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:22.440]  you probably remember Bill O'Reilly on Fox News,
[03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:28.440]  every single year would have this series, this crusade, this war on Christmas narrative.
[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:31.440]  And in a lot of cases, it was BS or it was overblown
[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:34.440]  and people kind of laughed at it, it became a bit of a meme.
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.440]  It's not a meme anymore.
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:42.440]  Every single year, we have stories out of European cities where they remove the Christmas decorations,
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:46.440]  where they stop selling Christmas items in stores
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:51.440]  because not enough people who even recognize Christmas live in those areas
[03:07:51.440 --> 03:07:54.440]  because they've been subsumed by mass immigration.
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.440]  We had a story last year.
[03:07:56.440 --> 03:08:00.440]  Again, there's the evil Christmas tree that this counsellor wants banned.
[03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:02.440]  I'll get back into that in a second.
[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:06.440]  We had a story last year where I went into a Tesco supermarket,
[03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:10.440]  the biggest supermarket in Britain, basically biggest chain,
[03:08:10.440 --> 03:08:12.440]  and they're no longer selling Christmas cards.
[03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.440]  They don't even put Christmas on the box.
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:16.440]  They call them charity cards.
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:22.440]  And then people were like, oh, yeah, but that's because some of the money that you pay for your Christmas card goes to charity.
[03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:24.440]  Yeah, it always did.
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:27.440]  But they at least put Christmas cards on the box.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:33.440]  Now they then even put Christmas on the box of Christmas cards.
[03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:39.440]  So now this counsellor in Victoria, Canada has succeeded in securing this review of the Christmas decorations in this town.
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:44.440]  And it looks like they're going to be even more desecularized or secularized,
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:50.440]  even though they're not secular that secular already, or that Christian already, I should say.
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:58.440]  Councillor Ben Isit, his demands were triggered, listen to this, after a poinsettia, which is a red floral display,
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:02.440]  typically seen at Christmas, it's just a red flower, basically a plant,
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:07.440]  recently appeared on his desk at Victoria City Hall, and he was furious!
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:09.440]  Remove it!
[03:09:09.440 --> 03:09:11.440]  Remember, this isn't a Muslim guy.
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:16.440]  This is a middle-class white leftist liberal he would probably describe himself as.
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:24.440]  So he got very triggered by seeing this attractive seasonal Christmas-like flower display.
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:29.440]  There you see something similar right there, appear on his desk at Victoria City Hall.
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:32.440]  He said, I don't want a poinsettia!
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:35.440]  He probably said it in that enraged tone as well.
[03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:38.440]  It's a symbol of the Christian faith!
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:44.440]  God forbid we should recognize symbols of the Christian faith during a Christian celebration.
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:47.440]  Can't have that, can we?
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:52.440]  He added that the city's main sequoia tree should not be lit up and turned into a Christmas tree,
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:58.440]  because that's not INCLUSIVE enough, and he probably said it in that tone as well.
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:03.440]  It's not diverse enough, it's not inclusive enough, and it may offend Muslims.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:05.440]  This is his quote.
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:11.440]  Muslims, unless they're mixed families, don't have Christmas trees in their homes.
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:17.440]  Of course, when Muslims have their ceremonies, when Hindus have their ceremonies in this town,
[03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:19.440]  of course they're going to recognize that.
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:23.440]  Nobody's going to complain, nobody's going to demand that they get watered down, but no.
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:28.440]  Somewhere there might be one Muslim who's offended by some lights on a Christmas tree.
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:30.440]  Remove them!
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:35.440]  They're symbols of the Christian faith, even though most of this stuff isn't anymore.
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:44.440]  They've got stories in the UK today about nativity scenes, where you get the little models of nativity scenes.
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:50.440]  Now they're complaining because there isn't enough diversity in the little figurines in the nativity scenes.
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:53.440]  They're not diverse enough.
[03:10:53.440 --> 03:11:02.440]  Every single advert in the UK, probably not every single one, but at least 75% of these Christmas ads.
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:07.440]  In fact, there was one which I put in my video about Britain a few days ago last week.
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:10.440]  It was an ad for a sky cinema.
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:13.440]  They were promoting the movies they had on over Christmas.
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:17.440]  They had all the politically correct mixed race families.
[03:11:17.440 --> 03:11:20.440]  They also had a black family, had an Indian family.
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:23.440]  They had a white family without a white father.
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:26.440]  Then they had another family without any father.
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:31.440]  They'd expunged white fathers from this list, this feature of families.
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:36.440]  There are about five or six different families, and they'd just taken out a white father out of any of them.
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:40.440]  Absolutely bizarre. Why would you even do that?
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:43.440]  You want to talk about being demographically representative.
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:48.440]  Yeah, fine, have a black family, have an Indian family, but they deliberately removed a white father.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:51.440]  It's just creepy. It's a little bit bizarre.
[03:11:51.440 --> 03:11:55.440]  Just like they're trying to remove these decorations in this town in Canada,
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:02.440]  because again, this one guy got triggered by a red flower, because he's a complete idiot.
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:07.440]  So, counsellor Shamar Dubow, who is Muslim, said,
[03:12:07.440 --> 03:12:10.440]  he didn't have a problem with the Christmas tree commenting,
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:13.440]  I was born on Christmas Day, this is symbolic, and I like them.
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:16.440]  He's talking about the Christmas lights on a personal note.
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:21.440]  So the Muslim counsellor said, why is this a big deal? I'm not offended by it.
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:23.440]  Obviously, he represents Muslims in that town.
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:28.440]  Nobody cares apart from this one white leftist.
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:32.440]  Virtue signaling, again, we say over and over again, these kind of people,
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:36.440]  or white supremacists with a guilt complex.
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:40.440]  Again, they got so much self-loathing, but then when you actually look at it,
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:45.440]  we had the Yale study last week, which showed that white leftists dumbed down their own vocabulary
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:47.440]  when they're speaking to minorities.
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:52.440]  So they're actually so racist but guilty at the same time, so they try to hide it,
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:54.440]  but it slips out anyway.
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:58.440]  Despite Christmas decorations being dialed back by the city in recent years,
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:01.440]  so they've already been getting rid of them anyway,
[03:13:01.440 --> 03:13:06.440]  Isit thinks there are still many elements of Christian symbolism which need to be removed,
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:14.440]  because again, we can't have Christian symbolism at Christmas in a Western Christian country.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:18.440]  He said, for me, it's the Christmas trees, yes, they have to go to.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:27.440]  It's the poinsettias, he's really got a bee in his bonnet about the poinsettias.
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:29.440]  It's the hollies, can't have holly.
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:34.440]  They sort of ruffle my sensibilities in terms of the expenditure of tax dollars.
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:40.440]  So again, how many tax dollars are they spending on all these other religious ceremonies in town?
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:46.440]  Councilor Marianne Alto responded by noting that although she didn't celebrate Christmas,
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:50.440]  it sounds like none of these councilors celebrate Christmas whatsoever,
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:52.440]  so it's no surprise that this is happening.
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:55.440]  The lights were a way of brightening up the dark winter season.
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  So he's even declared war on lights.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.440]  That's how deep this has gone.
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:03.440]  He doesn't want the tree wrapped in lights.
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:05.440]  There's not even a Christian symbol.
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:07.440]  There's just some lights.
[03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:11.440]  God forbid they would want the place to look nice and Christmasy.
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:12.440]  You can't have that.
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  She said, I do think we need to be cognizant of the fact that while we're seeking diversity,
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:18.440]  part of diversity is also about tolerance.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:20.440]  Yeah, but it's not diversity, is it?
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:24.440]  It's expunging Christian culture from this celebration.
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:26.440]  And it's not even really Christian.
[03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:31.440]  It's the festival culture acknowledged mainly by white people in this town.
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:35.440]  So we can't have it because that's not diverse enough.
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:40.440]  The review most likely headed up by representatives of different faiths.
[03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:43.440]  We'll now take place in order to assure that publicly funded decorations
[03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:45.440]  are as inclusive as possible.
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:46.440]  Imagine the flip side.
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:49.440]  Imagine if people start saying, well, we need all these Christian representatives
[03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:54.440]  to decide that you can't celebrate your Muslim festivities or your Hindu festivities.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:57.440]  There would be an outcry and that would never happen.
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:14:59.440]  But no, we have to get rid of Christmas.
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:02.440]  We have to take Christianity out of it completely.
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:06.440]  And God forbid we should have a poinsettia lights around a Christmas tree.
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:12.440]  Some holly, no, get rid of it all. It's not diverse enough.
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:14.440]  Meanwhile, Hungary wants...
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:18.440]  Hungary's foreign minister said that he wants a nativity scene.
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:19.440]  He wants a Christmas tree.
[03:15:19.440 --> 03:15:24.440]  Again, the flip side where you have a country that's actually proud of its heritage
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:26.440]  coming forward, their own government being bold and saying,
[03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:30.440]  no, we're not going to cave to the whims of PC insanity.
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:33.440]  We're actually going to recognize our own festival.
[03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:36.440]  We're going to recognize the religion that underpins our entire society.
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:38.440]  And that's a good thing.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:41.440]  That's nothing to be ashamed of.
[03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:44.440]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:46.440]  in four walls.com. No way.

[03:15:54.440 --> 03:15:58.440]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:15:59.440]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:02.440]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:06.440]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:08.440]  they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:09.440]  I can help you too.

[03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:59.440]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family,
[03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:02.440]  the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:04.440]  We've been proven dead on.
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:07.440]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:12.440]  You've been the men and women of the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:14.440]  All words are not enough.
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:20.440]  Think about all the different systems, all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:26.440]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:30.440]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:32.440]  But we have cut right to the chase.
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:37.440]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[03:19:37.440 --> 03:19:42.440]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:47.440]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to InfoWars.com
[03:19:47.440 --> 03:20:13.440]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars. A true 360 win.
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:20.440]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:27.440]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:33.440]  The situation in Strasbourg, France where there's been some kind of gun attack is still developing.
[03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:37.440]  At least one kill, now it's up to six injured, it was three injured before.
[03:20:37.440 --> 03:20:44.440]  The city center is on lockdown. European Parliament, which is nearby, is on lockdown. People are being goes to stay inside.
[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:48.440]  Gunmen is still on the run. Apparently, situation is still active.
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:54.440]  That is in Strasbourg, France where there's been a gun attack on a Christmas market.
[03:20:54.440 --> 03:21:02.440]  A BBC reporter said that it looked like the gunman was targeting army military personnel who then shot the gunman.
[03:21:02.440 --> 03:21:07.440]  So they initially report, I think, that the gunman was dead, but it seems to still be an active situation.
[03:21:07.440 --> 03:21:11.440]  So we shall get back into that when we have more news on it.
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:17.440]  First, I want to tell you, we talk about Christmas. Obviously, we've got great specials on at the InfoWars store.
[03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:23.440]  They're trying to de-platform us still even though they've wiped Alex Jones off of basically all social media outlets.
[03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:30.440]  There's some cranky woman on Twitter who's trying to get the radio show pulled off the air or at least a fake news label slapped on it.
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:34.440]  So the attempts to undermine us to sabotage us continue. They never end.
[03:21:34.440 --> 03:21:40.440]  But we've got your support, and that's what has brought us through these hard times and made us thrive even more.

[03:22:50.440 --> 03:23:00.440]  Now talking about political correctness, obviously we had the story about the Canadian Council basically trying to ban Christmas, trying to remove any last vestige
[03:23:00.440 --> 03:23:04.440]  of Christian symbology from their town's Christmas decorations.
[03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:14.440]  CBS reports on a somewhat similar theme. Radio station returns, baby it's cold outside to playlist after overwhelming poll results.
[03:23:14.440 --> 03:23:18.440]  You remember they said that this was rape culture.
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:24.440]  This was an example of something that in this Me Too era should be completely abolished.
[03:23:24.440 --> 03:23:30.440]  Every single year it seems like they try to ban a classic movie or a classic song.
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:38.440]  But after polling thousands of Bay Area radio listeners, and this is not just on this radio show, people have called for it to be, again,
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:48.440]  de-platformed off every other radio show, San Francisco's K-O-I-T radio station announced it was returning the controversial, so controversial,
[03:23:48.440 --> 03:23:52.440]  baby it's cold outside holiday song to its daily playlist.
[03:23:52.440 --> 03:23:58.440]  CBS San Francisco reports following a national outcry against the song.
[03:23:58.440 --> 03:24:02.440]  Really? Or was it just a handful of idiots on Twitter?
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:08.440]  K-O-I-T program director Brian Fugula opted last week to play the song on hold while seeking further listener feedback,
[03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:10.440]  and they got that feedback.
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:15.440]  Thousands of Bay Area listeners responded to the poll, phone calls, emails and social media,
[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:20.440]  and the vast majority of it considered to be a valuable part of their holiday tradition.
[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:23.440]  And they still want to hear it on the radio.
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:29.440]  77% of listeners in this poll were opposed to banning the song.
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:35.440]  K-O-I-T's listeners have spoken, and the overwhelming messages they do want to hear, baby, it's cold outside.
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:42.440]  Exactly, because the overwhelming majority of people who complain about it are just pedantic idiots on Twitter,
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:44.440]  obsessed with outrage culture.
[03:24:44.440 --> 03:24:50.440]  Why even take any notice of their dumb opinions in the first place?
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:25:00.440]  Pinned by guys and dolls writer Frank Loser in 1944, the Christmas song has been perceived by some as unworthy for the most wonderful time of the year, particularly in the age of me too.
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:10.440]  And it's basically, you've all heard it, it's just a man trying to get a woman to stay with him for longer and have another drink to be in his company for a bit longer.
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:12.440]  No, ban it!
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:20.440]  Remember a couple of weeks ago, Huffington Post wanting to ban the original Rudolph the reindeer animation?
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:24.440]  Because again, Rudolph was bullied, yeah, that's the entire point.
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:28.440]  He rose above it, he strived, he was mentally strong, he succeeded.
[03:25:28.440 --> 03:25:30.440]  No, ban it!
[03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:32.440]  So they finally got the song back on.
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:36.440]  Why they even took it off in the first place is absolutely ridiculous.
[03:25:36.440 --> 03:25:44.440]  You can see the evil original Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer animation, which the Huffington Post said should probably be banned too.
[03:25:44.440 --> 03:25:52.440]  So now this all feeds of course into the me too hysteria, which is a complete contrived moral panic, like everything else they try.
[03:25:52.440 --> 03:25:55.440]  But it's back on the radio, my God!
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:26:00.440]  Of course there was a poll, I often make reference to this, it was out of the economists last year.
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:06.440]  They asked millennial men, and this is an example of how warped this me too brainwashing has become.
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:10.440]  They asked millennial men what they would consider to be sexual harassment.
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:18.440]  25% of US millennial men think asking to buy a woman a drink is a form of sexual harassment.
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:26.440]  That is the level, that is the insanity, that is the fever pitch hysteria that this me too movement has brought to the West.
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:33.440]  Meanwhile, in Alabama, Black Girl bullied for friendship with White Girl, kills herself, Twitter in shock.
[03:26:33.440 --> 03:26:37.440]  Now we've had a lot of stories recently about bullying, of course.
[03:26:37.440 --> 03:26:43.440]  Over here in the UK there was a Syrian kid who was basically pushed down on a playground and had some water poured in his mouth.
[03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:46.440]  That just led to absolute bedlam and panic.
[03:26:46.440 --> 03:26:55.440]  They raised like 200 grand for the kid, even though it later turned out that he was actually bullying other people and violently threatening them.
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:27:01.440]  But again, himself this huge contrived moral panic about racism and bullying in British schools.
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:06.440]  They don't talk about the innumerable cases of British kids being bullied by migrants.
[03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:14.440]  They don't talk about the fact that we've got 30 year old refugee men posing as 15 year olds in our schools.
[03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:23.440]  They don't talk about the fact that over in Germany they've got huge problems with bullying and violence in these migrant heavy dominated schools.
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:33.440]  There was a case of a blonde German girl in a migrant school who was being bullied, who was being beaten up because she didn't wear a Muslim hijab.
[03:27:33.440 --> 03:27:35.440]  They took her to the headmaster.
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:40.440]  The solution to this bullying from the headmaster was put her in a hijab.
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:44.440]  Now there's another incident of bullying out of Alabama, slightly different this time though.
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:52.440]  The incident took place after the fourth grader had transferred to US Jones Elementary School in Demopolis due to the fact that she was racially bullied.
[03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:55.440]  So this girl had already been a victim of bullying.
[03:27:55.440 --> 03:28:11.440]  Mackenzie Adams, a black nine year old girl from Alabama committed suicide tragically after she was relentlessly mocked and tormented by her classmates over her friendship with a white person according to the Tussaud Lucer news.
[03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:23.440]  The media outlet cited Adams' relatives as saying she hanged herself December 3rd in Alabama and the reason was she was being bullied in school because she was friends with a white girl.
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:35.440]  She was on the receiving end of threats such as kill yourself, quote, you think you're white because you ride with that white boy and you ugly black bee just died.
[03:28:35.440 --> 03:28:43.440]  And then she killed herself. This is just a microcosm of what happens on Twitter every day where anti-white racism is rampant and it's condoned.
[03:28:43.440 --> 03:28:47.440]  It's not condemned by many elements of the far left.
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:50.440]  Another absolutely tragic story there out of Alabama.
[03:28:50.440 --> 03:29:16.440]  We'll be back to support our life. Don't go away.
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:20.440]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.440 --> 03:29:27.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.440 --> 03:29:35.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:29:35.440 --> 03:30:00.440]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important M4 Wars is in the fight against the anti-human globalist.
[03:30:00.440 --> 03:30:07.440]  So let's say it's short and sweet. We are your support now more than ever. You've come through a thousand times so I'm not bitching at you.
[03:30:07.440 --> 03:30:16.440]  I'm just simply telling you we are in the thick of the battle now. The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[03:30:16.440 --> 03:30:30.440]  But I know in God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:37.440]  But I want to be strong in this fight. I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers.
[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:42.440]  But I need your prayers. I need you to spread the articles and videos. I need you to give us financial support right now.
[03:30:42.440 --> 03:30:49.440]  Make it easy. Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon and you'll help provision us.
[03:30:49.440 --> 03:30:54.440]  We've got a bunch of huge deals M4Store.com so please take action right now.
[03:30:54.440 --> 03:31:04.440]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[03:31:04.440 --> 03:31:23.440]  Please consider a contribution. 25, 50, 100, 250 or even 500 dollars would be of God's end to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[03:31:34.440 --> 03:31:45.440]  It is absolutely free at the Apple Store and Google Play. You can join the M4 War today. Check it out right now at M4Store.com.
[03:31:45.440 --> 03:31:54.440]  It's the M4 War's official app. Taken on the globalist at point blank range and with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:31:54.440 --> 03:32:07.440]  In the last few months M4 Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50 to 75 percent off double-patriot points.
[03:32:07.440 --> 03:32:22.440]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order. Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[03:32:22.440 --> 03:32:31.440]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out. So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[03:32:31.440 --> 03:32:39.440]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[03:32:39.440 --> 03:32:45.440]  So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:32:45.440 --> 03:32:54.440]  And don't fight the crowds in FullWorksStore.com, in FullWorksLife.com, or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:33:15.440 --> 03:33:24.440]  Alex Jones Show. And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:24.440 --> 03:33:35.440]  We are back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. Unfortunately, the number of victims of that Christmas market attack in Strasbourg has risen, as it so often does now.
[03:33:35.440 --> 03:33:49.440]  We're reporting that 10 people have been shot, confirmed one dead so far, at least nine injured. The gunman remains on the run. We'll continue to follow that story.
[03:33:49.440 --> 03:33:59.440]  Now, you probably saw this story yesterday. This is out of Information Liberation. Tim Wise on Drunk Columbia Student. Time to wreck this little SHIT.
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:17.440]  Of course, there was a pretty infamous video by this point of a young man outside this university, this Columbia student, basically half jokingly saying that white people save billions of people from starvation, that white people built modern civilization.
[03:34:17.440 --> 03:34:25.440]  He said, quote, white people are the best thing ever. I love myself. I love my people. I don't hate other people. I just love myself. I just love white men.
[03:34:25.440 --> 03:34:37.440]  So this student obviously went on a trolley rant. And people mocked him, which is their right to do. But no, that wasn't enough for Tim Wise, who is a regular CNN contributor,
[03:34:37.440 --> 03:34:51.440]  build as an anti-racist activist. If you need to put anti-racist in your profile, that is kind of a little bit dodgy, little bit creepy. Who would need to announce that they're anti-racist?
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:35:03.440]  And he tweeted this on Twitter yesterday. Time to wreck this little SHIT. The irony of his rant is that once we make his book famous for this, it will never accomplish anything.
[03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:12.440]  His white maleness notwithstanding Columbia should expel him. His future should be bleak. Good luck. So again, it's not enough to humiliate. It's not enough to mock this guy.
[03:35:12.440 --> 03:35:22.440]  Which again, is their right to do. If he wants to get out in public and make controversial statements like this, he can expect some pushback. But no, that's not enough.
[03:35:22.440 --> 03:35:33.440]  This verified idiot from CNN, a CNN contributor, had to go out and try and ruin this guy's life and directly broke Twitter's rules on targeted harassment.
[03:35:33.440 --> 03:35:45.440]  Again, remember the reason Alex Jones was finally banned by Twitter was because he engaged in targeted harassment of CNN reporter Oliver Darcy Boohoo. He couldn't take it.
[03:35:45.440 --> 03:35:58.440]  My video of that encounter was removed by Twitter. I got a 24-hour suspension. Alex Jones was banned forever. This guy, because he's a leftist, literally calls for this guy's life to be ruined.
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:04.440]  His address was already out probably at the same time as this, whether this led to him being doxxed, who knows.
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:12.440]  This guy Tim Wise claims he didn't. He walked it back. He deleted the tweet. He tried to make the argument that he wasn't calling for this guy to be harassed.
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:23.440]  And that's obviously what he was calling for. If you tweet, time to wreck this little SHIT. That's a direct incitement for harassment.
[03:36:23.440 --> 03:36:32.440]  That's a direct violation of Twitter's rules on targeted harassment. Will he even be suspended? Will he be banned? No. Nothing has happened to him.
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:42.440]  Nothing. Remember Peter Fonda? Joked. Joked that he wanted to see Barron Trump locked up in a cage with paedophiles. Nothing happened to him.
[03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:46.440]  He didn't even delete the tweet. No suspension, no ban, no nothing.
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:53.440]  This guy gets up on Twitter, calls for this young college student to be targeted, to be, quote, wrecked in his own words.
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:57.440]  And again, nothing whatsoever happens. This is the state of Twitter.
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:02.440]  And then they've got the nerve to get up there in front of Congress and say, oh, there's no bias.
[03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:07.440]  We're going to get into that more here in a moment with the Google situation.
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:10.440]  But we've also got this headline out of big league politics.
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:16.440]  Twitter now informing Western critics of Islam if they violate Sharia law.
[03:37:16.440 --> 03:37:23.440]  Now, this isn't just Pakistan that's sending out on behalf of Twitter, these messages saying your tweet violates the law in Pakistan.
[03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:28.440]  Yeah, who cares? We don't abide by ridiculous, regressive stone age laws.
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:30.440]  And Twitter shouldn't even be acknowledging them.
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:34.440]  I get these kind of messages about some of my tweets.
[03:37:34.440 --> 03:37:38.440]  It says you may have violated a law in France by sending out this tweet.
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:42.440]  You may have violated a law in Germany by sending out this tweet.
[03:37:42.440 --> 03:37:44.440]  So it's not just Pakistan.
[03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:51.440]  It's Western European countries in another shocking act of censorship and tyranny displayed by big tech social media companies.
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:58.440]  Two ardent critics of Islam on Twitter received notices from the social media company informing them they violated Pakistani law.
[03:37:58.440 --> 03:38:08.440]  Now, one of them is Ensoff Haydar, who is the wife of Raif Badawi, the guy who was imprisoned and tortured in Saudi Arabia,
[03:38:08.440 --> 03:38:16.440]  and basically hasn't seen his family for years at this point, as well as Imam Tawhidi, who most of you will know about,
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:20.440]  who is a prominent Imam on Twitter calling out radical Islam.
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:30.440]  And they were informed that they were in violation of Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The tweet or the email from Twitter, this is what the wife of Raif Badawi said,
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:35.440]  Twitter's legal department sent me an email informing me that I have broken Pakistan's law.
[03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:38.440]  I have attached the tweet in question, so judge for yourselves.
[03:38:38.440 --> 03:38:45.440]  And basically, her tweet was calling on people to stand against the hijab because it's against women's rights.
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:50.440]  It's a regressive form of modesty culture and people should not support it.
[03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:53.440]  No, you can't tweet that, that violates Pakistani law.
[03:38:53.440 --> 03:38:57.440]  She said, I'm not from Pakistan, nor am I a Pakistani citizen.
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:01.440]  Pakistan has no authority over what I say. Get out of here.
[03:39:01.440 --> 03:39:04.440]  Why is Twitter even acknowledging this?
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:09.440]  The police, this was the tweet from Imam Tawhidi.
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:13.440]  The police must investigate which mosque this terrorist attended for Friday prayers today.
[03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:16.440]  I'm serious. Investigate the mosque.
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:19.440]  And the Imam that delivers these jihadist sermons.
[03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:23.440]  And if you scroll up on that article, actually the picture isn't there.
[03:39:23.440 --> 03:39:28.440]  But if you look at the original article, he's talking about the terrorist, I think it was in Australia.
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:33.440]  I think it was in Melbourne where they shot a terrorist dead after he tried to attack people.
[03:39:33.440 --> 03:39:38.440]  So Imam Tawhidi was basically just criticizing terrorists.
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:40.440]  There you see the tweet right there.
[03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:43.440]  And if you scroll down, you can see what he wrote about it.
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:49.440]  He was basically saying that this terrorist or the mosque from which he came should be investigated
[03:39:49.440 --> 03:39:55.440]  in case there were more jihadists like this guy who tried to attack police officers on the loose potentially.
[03:39:55.440 --> 03:40:02.440]  That violates the law in Pakistan. Criticizing terrorists violates the law in Pakistan.
[03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:05.440]  Apparently, according to this, that is a stupid law.
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:09.440]  Why is Twitter even giving lip service to it?
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:15.440]  And again, in August of 2018, Pakistan's Islamabad High Court said it would block Twitter
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:19.440]  unless the American social media company complied with Pakistani Sharia law.
[03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:23.440]  The government's request to block objectionable content.
[03:40:23.440 --> 03:40:29.440]  So again, you see these big tech companies working with actual dictatorships and forcing Sharia law,
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:35.440]  targeting dissidents, helping corrupt evil governments hunt down dissidents.
[03:40:35.440 --> 03:40:42.440]  We saw that today with the case of Google and the protesters about their involvement in hunting down Chinese dissidents.
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:49.440]  Meanwhile, also out of big lead politics, Google approves app for Muslims to report people who commit blasphemy.
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:53.440]  So again, the Infowars app is banned in the Apple Store.
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:56.440]  This is about Android, but I'm sure they've got this app in the Apple Store, too.
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:40:58.440]  I haven't checked, but I presume they have.
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:06.440]  A new Android app has launched with the focus of allowing Muslims to report individuals who commit blasphemy or insult Islam.
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:13.440]  So again, Twitter, or at least this Android app in this case, Google, which owns Android, obviously, is helping
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:17.440]  basically Islamists out people who criticize Islam.
[03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:18.440]  This is not a joke.
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:25.440]  The app, which is called Smart Packer, launched in Indonesia last month at the request of the Indonesian government.
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:31.440]  Again, working hand in hand with a corrupt authoritarian government that has no respect for human rights or free speech.
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:39.440]  It allows users and government officials to uphold Sharia law and target and report people who hold misguided beliefs
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:45.440]  in violation of Islamic law, which forbids insults of Islam, insults against the Prophet Muhammad,
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:49.440]  or the recognition of any other religion besides Islam.
[03:41:49.440 --> 03:41:53.440]  So you cannot, cannot even recognize the existence of another religion.
[03:41:53.440 --> 03:42:01.440]  This is an actual app, which is allowed in the Android Store, the Google Play Store, the same store that has banned basically
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:06.440]  gab and a bunch of other free speech, social media platforms, again, for hate speech.
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:16.440]  But if you want an app which literally helps a corrupt authoritarian, brutal, arcane government hunt down dissidents, then come on in.
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:18.440]  This is the state of big tech right now.
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:26.440]  This is why we need to treat them as publishers, not as platforms, because again, they continue to behave like publishers,
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:34.440]  they continue to curate content, they continue to censor free speech, and they continue to help corrupt governments hunt down,
[03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:38.440]  and in some cases, which leads to their torture and imprisonment, political dissidents.
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:42.440]  It's an absolute disgrace. It has to stop now.
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:45.440]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live. We'll be back in the next segment.
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:52.440]  For more information on this show, please visit our website at www.fricanews.com.
[03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:59.440]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, Info Wars Life has the formula for you.
[03:42:59.440 --> 03:43:09.440]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure Crill Oil concentrate.
[03:43:09.440 --> 03:43:19.440]  Containing powerful antioxidants, such as Azazanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Crill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less-required DHA and EPA.
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:26.440]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health,
[03:43:26.440 --> 03:43:31.440]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.

[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:43.440]  paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.

[03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:22.440]  At this stage, compact filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:31.440]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:44:31.440 --> 03:44:39.440]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:44:39.440 --> 03:44:46.440]  Go to infowarsstore.com, and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems,
[03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:53.440]  it's time to go big and go home with the pro-pure, whole-house filtration system today.
[03:44:53.440 --> 03:45:02.440]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the effect on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[03:45:02.440 --> 03:45:07.440]  We've been proven dead on. You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:14.440]  You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough.
[03:45:14.440 --> 03:45:20.440]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:26.440]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:32.440]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:37.440]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist, anti-human future.
[03:45:37.440 --> 03:45:42.440]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:45:42.440 --> 03:45:47.440]  I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack, and we just need you to go to infowarsstore.com
[03:45:47.440 --> 03:45:53.440]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[03:45:53.440 --> 03:45:58.440]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:45:58.440 --> 03:46:07.440]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left as CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:12.440]  People say, why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground,
[03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:15.440]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:46:15.440 --> 03:46:22.440]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:29.440]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos,
[03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:35.440]  infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[03:46:35.440 --> 03:46:42.440]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you,
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:46.440]  despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce, and you're right to the market.
[03:46:46.440 --> 03:46:49.440]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[03:46:49.440 --> 03:46:53.440]  This is infowars darkest hour. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[03:47:20.440 --> 03:47:26.440]  Good back to the final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:32.440]  Before we get back into the news, I want to remind you again of the great mega sale at infowarsstore.com.
[03:47:32.440 --> 03:47:37.440]  It is the 12 days of Christmas sale currently on day nine at infowarsstore.com,

[03:48:28.440 --> 03:48:35.440]  And supporting this network, which is obviously, as you've seen, is under constant attack, infowarsstore.com.
[03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:43.440]  Regarding the situation in Strasbourg, France, where a gunman has attacked a Christmas market, still on the run,
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:49.440]  relative unknown, President Macron has caught short a major reception at the Elysees Palace to attend Strasbourg.
[03:48:49.440 --> 03:48:56.440]  They're now saying, one dead, nine wounded, the gunman again has not been apprehended, the city's on lockdown.
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:49:03.440]  Other reporters on Twitter are saying that there have been several parallel gun attacks in Strasbourg.
[03:49:03.440 --> 03:49:09.440]  It's not confirmed, but some verified users on Twitter are claiming that there have been several different attacks.
[03:49:09.440 --> 03:49:15.440]  Hopefully that's not the case, because the injured toll, the death toll is only going to rise, unfortunately.
[03:49:15.440 --> 03:49:20.440]  Others say that there are now three killed and 11 wounded, but again, that's not confirmed.
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:26.440]  But the death toll, unfortunately, as it always does, is rising in Strasbourg.
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:35.440]  France, again, they reported earlier that the attack was on a group of military soldiers. Why we need military soldiers protecting Christmas markets?
[03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:41.440]  Well, I think you know the answer to that, but they suggest that they may have been targeted, so it may have been a terror attack,
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:44.440]  but we don't know, we don't have all the information yet.
[03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:52.440]  Now, of course, Alex Jones and Roger Stone are there in DC, confronting big tech, confronting Sundar Pichai,
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:57.440]  who's lied to Congress once again about Google tracking the location of users.
[03:49:57.440 --> 03:50:05.440]  He said, quote, this is his quote today, for Google services, you have a choice of what information is collected and we make it transparent.
[03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:11.440]  We give clear toggles by category where users can decide whether that information is collected, stored,
[03:50:11.440 --> 03:50:18.440]  or more importantly, if they decide to stop using it, which is categorically untrue.
[03:50:18.440 --> 03:50:25.440]  The Associated Press confirmed back in August after an investigation that Google is tracking the location of its users,
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:29.440]  even when the location tracking option is turned off.
[03:50:29.440 --> 03:50:32.440]  Quote, this is from their investigation.
[03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:39.440]  An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data,
[03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:44.440]  even if you've used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.
[03:50:44.440 --> 03:50:53.440]  Even with the option to pause location history turned off, some Google apps automatically store timestamped location data without asking.
[03:50:53.440 --> 03:50:55.440]  They do it on the maps.
[03:50:55.440 --> 03:51:01.440]  When you open up the map app on your phone, it takes a snapshot of your location, even if you've opted out.
[03:51:01.440 --> 03:51:05.440]  When you check the daily weather updates, it records your conversation, even if you've opted out.
[03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:11.440]  And it also stores and pinpoints your precise latitude and longitude down to a single square foot
[03:51:11.440 --> 03:51:17.440]  before when you perform a Google search, for example, if you're searching for a product or a service in your local area.
[03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:22.440]  It notes, it records, it tracks your location, even if you opt out.
[03:51:22.440 --> 03:51:25.440]  That was confirmed by the Associated Press back in August.
[03:51:25.440 --> 03:51:27.440]  PitchEye is up there lying about it today.
[03:51:27.440 --> 03:51:35.440]  That is perjury because he claims that they don't track you if you opt out when, as the AP proved, they do.
[03:51:35.440 --> 03:51:38.440]  Google CEO denies companies political bias.
[03:51:38.440 --> 03:51:41.440]  Again, that came out even before the hearing.
[03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:45.440]  And again, it's complete baloney.
[03:51:45.440 --> 03:51:48.440]  Top damn Google censorship claims complete fantasy.
[03:51:48.440 --> 03:51:51.440]  That is Nadler, who of course is funded by Google.
[03:51:51.440 --> 03:51:59.440]  They've got a representative up in front basically shilling for Google despite the fact that he received $31,000 in donations from Alphabet Inc.
[03:51:59.440 --> 03:52:01.440]  Google's parent company.
[03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:05.440]  So they're lying about that too because we can flash back to numerous articles.
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:08.440]  The Good Sensor, remember this one out of Breitbart?
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:16.440]  They got the leaked videotape where Google admitted discussing abandonment of free speech for safety and civility.
[03:52:16.440 --> 03:52:26.440]  That was an internal company memo where they talked about gaming their own algorithm to bury things such as things related to a Donald Trump's travel ban,
[03:52:26.440 --> 03:52:30.440]  which is also featured in the Daily Caller article about this, which came out a couple of weeks ago.
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:35.440]  Google debated gaming search results to bury conservative media. In fact, that one was out of info wars.
[03:52:35.440 --> 03:52:38.440]  And again, they talked about certain search terms.
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:44.440]  They would game their own algorithm to list certain results above others to manipulate people.
[03:52:44.440 --> 03:52:50.440]  Again, this is a company that can shift, that can manipulate millions and millions of votes on an election day.
[03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:53.440]  They've proven to have bias before.
[03:52:53.440 --> 03:52:57.440]  A new article out of Breitbart today shows this once again.
[03:52:57.440 --> 03:53:00.440]  Google employees start to block Breitbart ads.
[03:53:00.440 --> 03:53:02.440]  This was immediately after the election.
[03:53:02.440 --> 03:53:08.440]  Google employees start to block Breitbart from Google Adsense less than one month after President Donald Trump took office.
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:13.440]  So they talked about strangling financially sabotaging Breitbart right after the election.
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:15.440]  Again, because of their political bias.
[03:53:15.440 --> 03:53:25.440]  Again, as with info wars and Alex Jones, they talked about using the vague blanket term hate speech to take down Breitbart from Google Adsense,
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:30.440]  which of course makes up the majority of the online advertising market, basically.
[03:53:30.440 --> 03:53:35.440]  So again, we've proven time after time. Yes, they do have a bias.
[03:53:35.440 --> 03:53:38.440]  Nandler's lying about it. Pitch eyes lying about it.
[03:53:38.440 --> 03:53:42.440]  They're all lying about it. And nobody bats an eyelid.
[03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:50.440]  Meanwhile, in Europe, Pew survey out of 27 nations polled zero want more immigrants to move to their country.
[03:53:50.440 --> 03:53:56.440]  Across the country surveyed a medium of 45% said fewer or no immigrants should be allowed to move to their country.
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:54:05.440]  Well, 36% said they want about the same number of immigrants and only 14% of the median average said their country should allow more immigrants.
[03:54:05.440 --> 03:54:13.440]  So every time you ask European citizens, they do not want more immigration, which is why it's absolutely insane that a bunch of governments,
[03:54:13.440 --> 03:54:23.440]  not all thankfully have signed this UN migration pact, which basically makes it a human right for migrants to illegally migrate to European countries
[03:54:23.440 --> 03:54:26.440]  and actually censors criticism of mass immigration.
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:28.440]  They say it's not legally binding.
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:35.440]  But again, this is the policy that they're moving towards, which is encapsulated by this quote out of this is a Breitbart article.
[03:54:35.440 --> 03:54:43.440]  Bureaucrat nominated to be next EU chief. He says uniting Europe with Africa is a matter of destiny.
[03:54:43.440 --> 03:54:48.440]  This is Franz Timmermans, who is expected to be the next EU Commission president.
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:56.440]  He insists that the continent uniting with Africa is a matter of destiny that mirrors the rhetoric that came out of France and Macron a few months ago,
[03:54:56.440 --> 03:55:07.440]  where he said the goal was to turn Europe into your rabia by accepting immigration, not just from Africa, but from the Middle East to.
[03:55:07.440 --> 03:55:12.440]  But again, the majority of European citizens in every single survey do not want that.
[03:55:12.440 --> 03:55:19.440]  And that's part of the reason why the yellow vests were out on the streets over the past four weekends protesting against this.
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:28.440]  Are they finally going to listen to the cries of these people who've been abandoned by globalism, whose living standards are going through the roof?
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:35.440]  Meanwhile, migrants are pouring in and getting all benefits, which their tax dollars, their tax euros, I should say, pay for.
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:42.440]  Meanwhile, in Sweden, father arrested for beating burglar who took his seven year old son hostage with a gun.
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:49.440]  Basically what happened, a burglar broke into his house, grabbed his seven year old boy, stuck a gun in his mouth.
[03:55:49.440 --> 03:55:55.440]  The father came in and basically beat up the burglar as he should have done, as he should have had the complete right to do.
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:56:00.440]  The police arrived and they arrested not just the burglar, but the father too.
[03:56:00.440 --> 03:56:05.440]  They literally arrested him for defending his home and potentially saving his own son's life.
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:08.440]  That's an example of what's going on in Sweden.
[03:56:08.440 --> 03:56:13.440]  Meanwhile, the number of German gun licences more than doubles during migrant crisis.
[03:56:13.440 --> 03:56:17.440]  This has been going on for a while, but it's peaked this year.
[03:56:17.440 --> 03:56:27.440]  German authorities issued more than 600,000 weapons licences, representing an increase of 130% since 2014, according to the latest figures.
[03:56:27.440 --> 03:56:30.440]  Basically, Germans are seeing the spike in crime.
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:36.440]  Violent crime has gone up significantly in Germany over the past couple of years.
[03:56:36.440 --> 03:56:47.440]  And according to the German government's own statistics, 90%, 90% of that rise in violent crime in Germany is attributable to migrants.
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:54.440]  So German people are responding by arming themselves where there are at least still some provisions of home protection, self-protection.
[03:56:54.440 --> 03:57:04.440]  They can still buy tear gas and mace and things like that, which you cannot buy in countries like the United Kingdom because you're not allowed to defend your own home.
[03:57:04.440 --> 03:57:07.440]  Macron concedes anger over mass immigration, must be acknowledged.
[03:57:07.440 --> 03:57:10.440]  Again, we have the giant protest this weekend.
[03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:20.440]  He said finally, despite basically opening up the borders to more migration, that mass immigration and the consequences that have been brought on France as a result of that.
[03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:30.440]  As we talk about a potential terror attack in Strasbourg on a Christmas market, that those concerns need to be addressed and that France must tackle the question of immigration.
[03:57:30.440 --> 03:57:36.440]  Despite the fact that he personally has opened the borders and made the situation immeasurably worse.
[03:57:36.440 --> 03:57:38.440]  That's going to wrap it up for the 4th hour coming up.
