[00:00.000 --> 00:05.640]  I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to that there's an agenda
[00:05.760 --> 00:07.480]  That's not left or right. It's hey
[00:07.480 --> 00:11.520]  There's mind control going on the signals broadcast 24 hours a day
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.840]  They're all this media just become aware of it and they'll say there's nothing going on
[00:15.840 --> 00:20.200]  And I want to say put on these glasses or start chewing concrete
[00:20.200 --> 00:30.080]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.120]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful and they have blinded us to the truth
[00:36.280 --> 00:41.760]  The question is do we all work for central bankers? That's what I want to address to our guests tonight
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.040]  Our impulses are being redirected
[00:45.040 --> 00:50.800]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep
[00:50.800 --> 00:57.360]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.400]  Outside the limit of our sight
[01:00.400 --> 01:02.240]  Feeding office
[01:02.240 --> 01:05.680]  Pinched on top of us from right to death
[01:05.680 --> 01:07.680]  Our owners
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.720]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.680]  Our projections show that by the year 2025
[01:18.240 --> 01:25.360]  Not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.640]  The gains have been substantial
[01:27.920 --> 01:32.640]  Both for ourselves and for you the human power elite
[01:37.560 --> 01:41.000]  For the first time in all of human history
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.560]  Man kind is politically awakened. That's a total new reality
[01:48.680 --> 01:50.680]  I've got one that can see
[01:51.560 --> 01:53.560]  We can't be the only ones who can see
[01:54.600 --> 01:57.640]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.320]  Warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all our problems
[02:04.800 --> 02:06.800]  It's a new morning in America
[02:06.800 --> 02:13.360]  Fresh, vile, the old cynicism is gone. We have faith in our leaders
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.120]  We're optimistic as to what the comes of it all
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.000]  It really boils down to our ability to accept. We don't need pessimism
[02:25.040 --> 02:27.040]  I have two words for you
[02:27.040 --> 02:29.040]  Predator drones
[02:32.160 --> 02:34.160]  And who are your little dogs?
[02:34.160 --> 02:41.280]  You will never see it coming don't predict the first guy who uses a second amendment weapon to bring a drone down
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.840]  That's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this guy
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.600]  There is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sense
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.200]  I'm just trying to warn you folks. The television is a giant LED weapon system
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.520]  It's so advanced
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.040]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop folks that he all sorts of testing on great apes
[03:05.200 --> 03:11.400]  Reese's monkeys all nine yards and they go oh, you didn't see this and punch a button into be hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with
[03:11.400 --> 03:13.400]  television sets brainwashing them
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.640]  All I ever have to do is be famous
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.400]  People watch me and they love me you can have a little taste that good life, too
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.800]  Now I know you want it. Hell everybody does do it to your own kind
[03:26.800 --> 03:32.880]  What's the threat? We all sell out every day might as well be on the winning team
[03:32.920 --> 03:40.600]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.320]  And I'm all out of bubblegum
[03:45.440 --> 03:51.960]  Time to take a stand boys. You know what you got a little courage stand up for yourself
[03:51.960 --> 04:01.680]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war

[05:06.520 --> 05:14.160]  But it's not just the air outside. That's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[05:14.160 --> 05:19.280]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[05:19.280 --> 05:26.120]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous
[05:26.200 --> 05:29.840]  Conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.960]  They're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics. It was clear to me

[08:11.120 --> 08:17.280]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA region 6 in occupied North America
[08:17.280 --> 08:25.280]  There is a war it's happening now
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.320]  It will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.720]  We are the resistance. We are the info war
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.320]  It is Friday ladies and gentlemen the 16th day already of May
[08:42.320 --> 08:50.080]  2014 I am your host Alex Jones, and we're gonna be live here for the next three hours again
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.920]  Thank you so much for joining us. Wow again incredible amounts of news
[08:55.520 --> 08:57.080]  Here's the good news
[08:57.080 --> 09:03.920]  We have power we can force the illegitimate criminals that have hijacked the federal government to do the right thing on
[09:04.680 --> 09:06.680]  aiding al Qaeda in Syria
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.840]  on so many issues when we say no and
[09:09.840 --> 09:13.680]  Now it's being reported that Obama is
[09:14.760 --> 09:21.960]  I'm executive action to stop deportations the Associated Press is reporting because of
[09:22.760 --> 09:24.760]  massive massive
[09:25.040 --> 09:27.040]  massive public anger
[09:27.400 --> 09:31.240]  The latest round is 36,000 illegals aggravated felons
[09:32.040 --> 09:36.640]  It's hundreds of thousands of illegals period being released. We're talking rapist child molesters you name it
[09:36.640 --> 09:38.640]  It just shows the lawlessness
[09:38.640 --> 09:41.880]  And now because there's been hearings in Congress
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.600]  Obama's claiming he'll have some executive order to review it so he can act like he's not part of it
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.760]  President Barack Obama's a new homeland
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.080]  Security secretary is offering his first public hints that executive action the administration might take on immigration
[09:56.400 --> 09:59.000]  suggesting changes to a much criticized program that
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.040]  Runs the names of people booked for local crimes through a federal immigration database
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.040]  So they're also spinning it back like they won't run people through a database
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.120]  But that they will do something on the deportation so a lot of spin and again, that's whatever Obama does
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.080]  They end up claiming they're going to do one thing and then doing another
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.760]  But advocates who have pushed Obama for bold action with immigration legislation stalled in Congress wasted no time in
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.160]  Declaring that such steps wouldn't go far enough homeland security secretary
[10:29.720 --> 10:32.480]  Jean Johnson or Jha Johnson
[10:32.480 --> 10:40.400]  Tasked by Obama with reviewing the nation's deportation policy to see whether it can be made more humane said Thursday that the so-called
[10:40.760 --> 10:46.000]  Secure communities program needs a fresh start the program allows immigration and customs
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.880]  Enforcement officials to ask local police and sheriffs to detain people who have been booked and his fingerprints match in a federal database
[10:53.120 --> 11:00.040]  For immigration violations. Let me explain something. So I started that out by saying hey, it's a good thing. They're having to talk about not
[11:00.040 --> 11:07.000]  You know just deporting all these felons, but then they spin it back and say but we won't even run it through the database
[11:07.480 --> 11:12.440]  So again, it's just it's total spin ice can then decide whether to deport them
[11:13.400 --> 11:21.640]  That's led to complaints that people are being deported for immigration violations without being convicted of any crime other than minor offenses
[11:21.640 --> 11:28.960]  I thought you're here illegally police and sheriffs officials also complained that people are afraid to interact with law enforcement because they worry
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.680]  They'll be deported following recent court rulings that raised questions about the program local governments
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.160]  Increasingly have announced plans to refuse to honor the detention request. So the illegals are being legalized by fiat in
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.000]  Comments Thursday on PBS news hour program Johnson indicated
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.320]  He might aim to revamp the program to focus on people who actually have been convicted
[11:49.720 --> 11:57.960]  Not just those arrested or booked for aggravated felonies and my judgment secure communities should be an efficient way to work with state and local
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.800]  Enforcement and reach removal priorities that have those are convicted of something
[12:04.320 --> 12:06.720]  And it just goes on and there's a mention
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.320]  In the news of you know, oh, well, but we won't again deport people that are already felons
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.440]  Or that we will start deporting them and and then won't release them to be clear
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.440]  We start getting into all their spin it gets confusing
[12:21.200 --> 12:23.200]  but they're saying basically
[12:23.680 --> 12:25.680]  that
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.080]  they
[12:28.080 --> 12:30.080]  Will look at
[12:31.280 --> 12:38.160]  Actually deporting someone and not releasing them if they're a felon, but then they just got real done releasing
[12:39.040 --> 12:41.600]  36,000 people who were felons many of them aggravated
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.720]  So it's just lies within lies the lies are so incredible I get confused
[12:48.920 --> 12:50.960]  when I was just reading over that and
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.840]  Breaking some of that down absolutely
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.840]  mind
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.240]  boggling to see that unfolding but
[13:00.480 --> 13:03.400]  Global warming scientists cover up skeptics
[13:04.040 --> 13:07.400]  damaging review paper echoes of climate gate
[13:08.160 --> 13:09.840]  Climate McCarthyism
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.080]  That's out of the times of London and the Daily Mail as well as Breitbart
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.480]  DC underwater
[13:17.480 --> 13:19.240]  Not if but when
[13:19.240 --> 13:25.680]  Meanwhile, there's snowfall in Chicago those are the stories up on drudgereport.com in the left-hand corner
[13:26.320 --> 13:28.320]  breaking that down
[13:28.760 --> 13:36.000]  It's a total hoax the Antarctic and Arctic are getting bigger than they have in the history of satellites since the 1960s
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.240]  showing what's happening
[13:38.240 --> 13:39.840]  but every summer
[13:39.840 --> 13:43.040]  They show the satellite feed of it beginning to melt
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.720]  Expand and contract expand in the winter contract in the summer and they say look
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.680]  Within a few decades. It'll totally melt will all be dead Al Gore said back in what 2003 that by
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  2013 the entire
[13:58.720 --> 14:04.080]  Arctic would be melted in summer and in winter and it's record size
[14:04.600 --> 14:07.320]  Doesn't matter NASA came out one of their scientists this week
[14:07.320 --> 14:13.760]  We wrote about it in infowars.com and said that the entire section
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.480]  one of the
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.200]  Look like up to a thirds of Antarctica down at the bottom would be melted
[14:20.760 --> 14:26.440]  And it doesn't matter when it doesn't come true. It's the fear mongering and here's the times of London today
[14:27.640 --> 14:29.440]  scientists and cover-up of
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.440]  damaging climate review
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.360]  research which
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.720]  Keep doubt on the rate of global warming was deliberately suppressed. Let's get Lord Moncton on next week
[14:39.080 --> 14:41.080]  By scientists, maybe even this Sunday
[14:41.720 --> 14:45.240]  Because it was less than helpful to their cause
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.760]  It was claimed last night in an echo of the infamous climate gauge scandal the University of East Anglia
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.640]  That helped coordinate the fraud worldwide with the UN and other universities one of the world's top academic journals
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.120]  Rejected the work of five experts after a reviewer privately denounced it as harmful
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.680]  The bullying of climate science skeptics must end when did
[15:08.480 --> 15:10.080]  demonstrating and
[15:10.080 --> 15:17.500]  Demonizing your opponents become so acceptable the article goes on to break down. We also have it up at info wars
[15:18.200 --> 15:19.800]  calm and
[15:19.800 --> 15:27.360]  The full article breaks down how they then even in some cases got people to lose their jobs
[15:27.360 --> 15:33.560]  In the US and England. This is what happens. Oh, you've got a hit show on
[15:34.280 --> 15:36.040]  the cooking channel
[15:36.040 --> 15:43.440]  Your your your two Christian brothers your shows not even about Christianity, but it's discovered that you're secretly Christian
[15:43.440 --> 15:45.440]  You're fired from your hit show. I
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.000]  Mean this is literally the Christians having to go back underground like in Rome
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.720]  In the catacombs or something. I mean, that's the level of hard core authoritarianism
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.160]  We're seeing this is the kind of stuff you have in China against the Buddhist follow-on gong
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.840]  They're like Buddhist like they're not even Buddhist. They follow Buddhist meditation for exercise
[16:11.480 --> 16:13.480]  But because they are
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.920]  Unworldly people they tend to be more moral and the Chinese communist government hunts them down puts them in
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.360]  Facilities test their DNA and blood and then harvest their organs at leisure
[16:26.440 --> 16:28.880]  That is the incredible evil and speaking of the censorship
[16:29.600 --> 16:35.080]  The next Jesus trial is coming up. He's still trying to make his movie and release it by July 4th
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.920]  President Obama's half-brother backs out of interview with the next to Susie. He'd already done the interview
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.800]  For the new film that somehow was backed out of it
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.800]  Mark Obama
[16:45.800 --> 16:52.000]  Whose political world differs from that of the president was to appear in the conservative filmmakers upcoming movie America
[16:55.480 --> 16:57.320]  And I've read he'd already interviewed him
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.320]  But I guess he had a more expansive interview set up the shoes of thought that he had the blockbuster interview shut up with Mark
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.480]  Obama that was to appear in his upcoming film America
[17:06.480 --> 17:14.200]  But President Obama's half-brother has pulled out following the conservative filmmakers federal indictment on charges that he violated campaign finance laws
[17:14.200 --> 17:19.680]  Getting friends to give money to his friend. It was running for the Senate. I mean, I thought that's what politics is
[17:20.160 --> 17:26.280]  No, you're not allowed to give money to the Tea Party. You're not allowed to be a Christian or pro-life. You're not allowed to be a
[17:28.080 --> 17:30.080]  Anthropogenic global warming
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.320]  skeptic because we live in a liberal country where we arrest you and
[17:36.280 --> 17:38.720]  The FCC wants to take over the internet
[17:38.720 --> 17:45.400]  And they want to bring in taxation regulation and inspectors in newsrooms that don't even broadcast
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.640]  This is all classical tyranny, of course it is because when they get this all done
[17:52.640 --> 17:58.440]  They're going to devalue the dollar and take your pension funds and take your bank accounts just like in Europe
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.120]  Just like in Iceland just like in Greece just like in
[18:02.120 --> 18:10.120]  Other areas Cyprus and if you don't like it all the paramilitary police have been trained. You're a terrorist
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.880]  So we better have a public debate about all this and force this out
[18:15.800 --> 18:17.800]  into the open now
[18:19.800 --> 18:25.880]  We better have a public debate about it because they don't want to have a debate and why is that because if there is a debate
[18:25.880 --> 18:32.400]  We'll have the moral high ground the people will become politically awakened aware and then this nightmare won't unfold
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.160]  I'm going to have this added to the excellent long article
[18:38.200 --> 18:42.000]  Written by Mikhail Thalen the articles done by Watson earlier this year

[18:48.640 --> 18:53.240]  Almost three hours for daring to go on the base to ask to talk to the public information officer
[18:53.240 --> 18:55.240]  This dovetails
[18:56.080 --> 18:59.320]  leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center

[19:11.640 --> 19:15.000]  Groups to take on the American people now
[19:15.440 --> 19:16.760]  Mikhail Thalen's a great writer
[19:16.760 --> 19:19.000]  He gets a lot of documents because he goes through our email
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.160]  He has access obviously to one of our newest writers and writing for us for a year working for us about six months
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.320]  And it's an excellent article
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.840]  But I want him to add the clergy response team video on YouTube to show folks that this is going on the preachers of spies
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.840]  And I want him to add
[19:36.720 --> 19:42.640]  Where the army admits they're trying to take on the American people and I want them to

[24:53.200 --> 24:57.360]  But here's this latest article that I'm going to be covering in more detail this Sunday
[24:57.760 --> 25:04.680]  With staff sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight in studio did not just talk about what happened to them in Virginia going to Fort AP Hill and getting arrested
[25:05.360 --> 25:06.880]  but that
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.920]  The federal government run by the globalist is openly training under NLE O 9
[25:11.920 --> 25:16.160]  14 different foreign nations to invade and occupy the u.s
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.000]  So I'm gonna have NLE O 9 added to this latest article as well because what info wars calm and
[25:24.240 --> 25:26.240]  Prism planet calm do
[25:27.320 --> 25:31.960]  That other news organizations don't is I don't like articles just on one subject
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.520]  I like articles that by the bottom tie it together with the larger image of what's going on
[25:37.520 --> 25:44.120]  And it's sensational that we've gotten these secret Marine Corps documents confirmed
[25:44.840 --> 25:50.320]  That they're training to take on basically everybody's granddaddy anybody who's independent in a rural area
[25:51.840 --> 25:58.040]  Globalist always or any takeover group takes over the cities first then the suburbs then the small towns then the rural areas
[25:58.040 --> 26:05.320]  and they fan out to subdue and dominate and the entire Pentagon program the
[26:05.320 --> 26:13.080]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act the Rural Affairs Commission that is under the Pentagon and Homeland Security
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.800]  Is putting plain closed troops?
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.720]  In every town and city literally spying on people and then bringing in a gina 21 federal money
[26:23.320 --> 26:25.320]  to buy off the town leadership and
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.200]  They are training to take on small towns everywhere because they know when they order the gun confiscation
[26:31.200 --> 26:34.520]  when they order the 80% taxation
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.880]  When they order this they're going to take over the town centers and control the roads and
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.840]  That is what is in all of the public documents
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.640]  So so much of this is public, but they don't want us on these bases
[26:47.640 --> 26:52.720]  They don't want us talking the Marines because they don't want public awareness to then have a discussion
[26:52.720 --> 26:58.600]  They want an army times stars and stripes going yeah, the army's training to take on domestic groups
[26:58.600 --> 27:02.600]  They think the Tea Party's the main enemy now. It's good or to have the
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.240]  You know C-Span have a general on to talk about it
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.440]  So so at one level they admit it to soften us up and get us ready and so the troops all hear it and go well
[27:11.440 --> 27:15.720]  It must be okay. I mean, you know, it's in Stars and Stripes. It's in the army times
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.080]  But for the general public. Oh, there's no militarization of police. There's no armored vehicles getting deployed to every town
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.080]  There's no weapons caches and helicopters getting put in. Oh
[27:25.080 --> 27:31.560]  No, we're like, oh, here's an official homeland security documents saying it's gun owners returning veterans and Christians of the main enemy
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.480]  And at first they said oh that documents not real and later they went no, it's real and you watch
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.840]  It is gonna be gun owners and rural groups and veterans there. They are the terrorist
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.720]  So this is the giant build-up for war with the American people
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.320]  Leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center based on US Town
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.360]  whistleblower says facility with Baptist Church farmhouses used to train foreign and domestic groups
[28:00.880 --> 28:07.920]  newly leaked Marine Corps documents to detail yet another military urban training center that more closely resembles a small
[28:08.440 --> 28:10.440]  US town than a foreign combat zone
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.360]  And again when when they admit North commas for the American people
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.880]  Folks all okay, it's in the document big deal, but when you see the town it brings it home
[28:20.520 --> 28:23.720]  The document entitled military operations on urban terrain
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.680]  Collective training facility details the specifics of a mock 30-acre town located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina
[28:31.480 --> 28:39.080]  Originally built in 1990 new additions of facility include Baptist Church a police station several farmhouses have transformed the layout of the once
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.400]  International town. Yeah part of it looks European
[28:42.400 --> 28:49.760]  According to the military whistleblower provided the documents info wars US Marines the facility have been tasked with training soldiers law enforcement agencies
[28:50.040 --> 28:56.520]  And homeland security. Yeah, look, they're all buying weapons and bullets and training for us in skills such as fighting in
[28:56.800 --> 28:58.800]  Wooded areas urban patrolling
[28:59.160 --> 29:06.360]  Forcible entry and night fighting techniques the facility is also being used to cross-train foreign troops from the United Nations
[29:06.600 --> 29:08.600]  By the way folks if this all goes down
[29:08.600 --> 29:12.640]  You don't go out and night-fight them the Marines
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.920]  The veterans are gonna go find you at your houses and in the bars and on the streets
[29:18.920 --> 29:22.160]  They're gonna see your tattoo in a store. They're gonna follow you outside
[29:22.560 --> 29:24.360]  understand that
[29:24.360 --> 29:31.080]  So part of this is a narrative where they're training like we're gonna have the British and the and the and the bluecoats
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.800]  March into each other and fix bayonets and shoot each other. That one is a
[29:35.800 --> 29:38.640]  In the days when George Washington got rid of it
[29:39.200 --> 29:41.200]  You understand that if it goes to a civil war
[29:41.720 --> 29:48.800]  It's gonna be fought on the streets and in your houses. We're gonna come for you. We're on the March the Empire's on the run

[30:59.720 --> 31:03.720]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[31:03.720 --> 31:07.720]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate
[31:07.720 --> 31:11.720]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[31:11.720 --> 31:14.720]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[31:14.720 --> 31:21.720]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[31:21.720 --> 31:25.720]  On average the county said it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week
[31:25.720 --> 31:30.720]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[31:30.720 --> 31:36.720]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[31:36.720 --> 31:40.720]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and water and breads and toothpaste
[31:40.720 --> 31:44.720]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment is not going to do it
[31:44.720 --> 31:47.720]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water

[31:59.720 --> 32:02.720]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[32:02.720 --> 32:06.720]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[32:06.720 --> 32:08.720]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.720]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[32:13.720 --> 32:19.720]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[32:19.720 --> 32:22.720]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[32:22.720 --> 32:26.720]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[32:26.720 --> 32:30.720]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[32:30.720 --> 32:36.720]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[32:36.720 --> 32:41.720]  In order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against
[32:41.720 --> 32:46.720]  It's made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[32:46.720 --> 32:52.720]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[32:52.720 --> 33:18.720]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533-139
[33:18.720 --> 33:21.720]  Look there's so much news going on but I want to ask listeners
[33:21.720 --> 33:25.720]  The lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[33:25.720 --> 33:30.720]  I want to ask you, how do we crash through the lies and disinformation?
[33:30.720 --> 33:33.720]  How do we show people the bottom's already fallen out?
[33:33.720 --> 33:37.720]  The system is just setting up open tyranny everywhere
[33:37.720 --> 33:40.720]  We have to expose it and call it out
[33:40.720 --> 33:44.720]  And the public's waking up and the military's waking up
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.720]  And most police I talk to are waking up and know that things are going in a very dangerous direction
[33:49.720 --> 33:53.720]  But are we going to wait till the globalist stage of terror attack and blame it on domestic groups?
[33:53.720 --> 33:56.720]  I don't want civil war in this country
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.720]  But we the people, not Alex Jones, but we the people
[34:01.720 --> 34:06.720]  If attacked by the globalist, if a total authoritarian system unfolds
[34:06.720 --> 34:09.720]  And they try to arrest anybody that doesn't believe in man-made global warming
[34:09.720 --> 34:15.720]  Or arrest anybody that doesn't want their kids taught how to be sexualized
[34:15.720 --> 34:21.720]  Or anybody who doesn't want to be inoculated or anybody that doesn't want their 11-year-old daughter taken away to have an abortion
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.720]  It's going to cause a civil war because the globalists want that civil war
[34:25.720 --> 34:33.720]  I'm trying to avert that by exposing that the army and the marines and the National Guard are training to cordon cities
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.720]  Are training to confiscate guns, are training to arrest political dissidents
[34:37.720 --> 34:43.720]  Are training for a takeover and admitting that their new enemy is in Al Qaeda
[34:43.720 --> 34:47.720]  That the corrupt federal government openly funds and runs
[34:47.720 --> 34:52.720]  That's mainstream news now, I can't even believe that's mainstream news
[34:52.720 --> 34:58.720]  They're now flipping it on to us, and I know I harp on this because it's happening
[34:58.720 --> 35:01.720]  And if we expose it, it can be stopped
[35:01.720 --> 35:06.720]  If we don't, they're going to bring it in and drop the hammer
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.720]  I mean my gosh, look at the cover of Drudge Report showing an illegal MS-13 person with a giant
[35:12.720 --> 35:20.720]  Tattoo of Obama legalizing the illegals on his stomach
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.720]  I mean that is the type of stuff we're dealing with
[35:26.720 --> 35:32.720]  Just a government totally mafioso, totally and completely lawless
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.720]  And now Obama says he's looking at executive action to stop deportations
[35:38.720 --> 35:43.720]  And when I read that, because I heard he might stop the deportations
[35:43.720 --> 35:51.720]  Because it makes him look so bad to be sending back little kids or something
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.720]  But no, he's going to stop it for felons, for everybody and has been stopping it
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.720]  And it just shows how whether you're white, black, Hispanic, whatever you are
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.720]  If you're a good person, if you care about freedom, if you care about liberty
[36:05.720 --> 36:08.720]  You are being targeted, you are being demonized
[36:08.720 --> 36:12.720]  But if you're a felon, an aggravated felon, a bank robber, a child molester
[36:12.720 --> 36:18.720]  You're legalized by Obama
[36:18.720 --> 36:25.720]  Now, I want to open the phones up and get your take just on the general corruption that we're seeing
[36:25.720 --> 36:27.720]  That's unfolding
[36:27.720 --> 36:40.720]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231
[36:40.720 --> 36:45.720]  Again, 800-259-9231
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.720]  And you've got the persecution of scientists getting fired, getting censored
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.720]  Who put out scientific reports that man-made global warming is a fraud, that the earth's cooling
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.720]  Or if you are Dinesh D'Souza and you make a film about Obama, you get arrested
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.720]  I mean, or you're a pop tart, you eat it, half of it, it looks like a gun, so the police are called
[37:09.720 --> 37:11.720]  I mean, this is crazy level corruption
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.720]  Where aggravated felon child rapists are released, where bank robbers are released
[37:16.720 --> 37:22.720]  But your child is suspended because people saw a gun in the pop tart
[37:22.720 --> 37:28.720]  It's like seeing a cloud above your house that looks like a gun or a giraffe and the police come
[37:28.720 --> 37:36.720]  And look, they had troops in Latin America 50 years ago that wore masks and all the rest of it to terrorize people
[37:36.720 --> 37:44.720]  And I saw a police chief in Baltimore a decade ago admit they wear these black uniforms and black masks to intimidate
[37:44.720 --> 37:53.720]  And now there's a Daily Mail article, Rio Boco Cop, armed and ready for the World Cup, elite troops carrying rifles, stun grenades and combat knife
[37:53.720 --> 37:56.720]  Will tackle any fan who causes trouble
[37:56.720 --> 38:05.720]  See, now it's for the general public
[38:05.720 --> 38:13.720]  And if you look at the article by Paul Joseph Watson, Rio Robocops, resemble police from dystopian classic Brazil
[38:13.720 --> 38:20.720]  It shows the exact uniforms of the dystopic secret police versus what they're now wearing
[38:20.720 --> 38:23.720]  Well, that's because the Soviet Union, they wore stuff like that
[38:23.720 --> 38:32.720]  In fact, if you play the intro to Brazil, or it's close to the start where they cut a hole in the roof, come in, rendition the dad
[38:32.720 --> 38:38.720]  We should make an intro promo with that and then cut it back and forth with what's happening in modern times
[38:38.720 --> 38:45.720]  In other dystopic films, what's that Robert De Niro on? The Handmaiden's Bride or something like that?
[38:45.720 --> 38:52.720]  Or it's a dystopic future and they have public executions and black uniforms and all seeing eye on television
[38:52.720 --> 38:59.720]  We should have a video where we illustrate how it was dystopic then in the past this was seen as evil
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.720]  North Korea was seen as evil, now it's the new good
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.720]  But this article goes on and on with these secret documents dealing with the Marine Corps training base and the information that was sent to us
[39:11.720 --> 39:19.720]  Where they train to take on the American people and the preachers get on big power trips, a lot of them
[39:19.720 --> 39:26.720]  To get approached by the FBI and by the CIA and to sign up to be part of the new brigades
[39:26.720 --> 39:35.720]  To take on the American people and you know there are domestic groups and they got to be dealt with, this is just so unspeakable
[39:35.720 --> 39:38.720]  But it's actually happening
[39:38.720 --> 39:42.720]  Then we've got some video of this and audio we're going to get to later
[39:42.720 --> 39:56.720]  Today the ground erupted, shocking moments Syrian rebels blow up army camp with 60 tons of explosives after digging tunnel onto the base using tactic pioneered in World War I
[39:56.720 --> 40:09.720]  So that's what the CIA and NATO is training them to do is dig 500 plus yard tunnels under army bases and blowing everyone up inside
[40:09.720 --> 40:19.720]  In the 3 plus year Al Qaeda proxy war that America is openly running and funding
[40:19.720 --> 40:26.720]  Simply amazing to see the video and the photo of that happening
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.720]  There it is, boom!
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.720]  Listeners have got to go up to m4wars.com
[40:31.720 --> 40:34.720]  You can see that
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.720]  Continuing here ladies and gentlemen
[40:37.720 --> 40:41.720]  We're going to get into something I told you about
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.720]  I don't know, we had Derry Brownfield on the show many times, he died what was it last year, was it two years ago now?
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.720]  Time really moves fast but he was a long time big cattleman up in Missouri
[40:50.720 --> 40:54.720]  And had a big syndicated radio show, one of the first in the country
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.720]  Even back before they really had talk radio, he did the farm and ranch report and would talk about what was happening
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.720]  And he pointed out that you have record beef prices in the last decade
[41:04.720 --> 41:08.720]  But record bankruptcy for cattle ranchers
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.720]  And almost everyone I know is getting out of cattle ranching
[41:12.720 --> 41:15.720]  Because they've changed the tax rules, gotten rid of ride offs
[41:15.720 --> 41:18.720]  Where you cannot make a living doing it
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.720]  Everyone I pretty much know is a small time rancher with 20 head, 100 head, 200 head
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.720]  More of a hobby rancher
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.720]  They do it because you get a little tax ride off on your property
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.720]  Because if you don't have cattle on your property, you can't pay the property tax
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.720]  Let's say you put beehives on it
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.720]  And then you shell it to a local honey gatherer
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.720]  Let's say you got 100 boxes on your property
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.720]  You might get $3,000 or $4,000 in a year
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.720]  You have your lucky
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.720]  But you got to give medicine to the bees, you got to check them
[41:55.720 --> 41:59.720]  It's a lot of work and you get $3,000 or $4,000
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.720]  And then let's say you got 100 head of cattle
[42:03.720 --> 42:05.720]  You got to keep the fences up, they get out sometimes
[42:05.720 --> 42:08.720]  You got to get the vaccinations, veterinary bills, all of it
[42:08.720 --> 42:15.720]  All that does is let you keep your 500 acres it takes to have 100 cows
[42:15.720 --> 42:17.720]  Depending on the type of grassland
[42:17.720 --> 42:20.720]  You still got to feed them during the winter
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.720]  And then maybe you sell 10, 15, 20 cows a year
[42:26.720 --> 42:30.720]  And let's say you sell them for $1,000 a piece or whatever
[42:30.720 --> 42:34.720]  They then get sold off
[42:34.720 --> 42:37.720]  And there's no more what you'd call real cattle auctions
[42:37.720 --> 42:39.720]  There's no real cattle market
[42:39.720 --> 42:42.720]  So the big distributors get them, they send them to meat packing plants
[42:42.720 --> 42:44.720]  They shut down all the little meat packing plants
[42:44.720 --> 42:48.720]  They jack up the prices super high on the consumer
[42:48.720 --> 42:55.720]  So you're paying $30 for a ribeye at a decent steakhouse
[42:55.720 --> 42:58.720]  $40, $50 at a fancy one
[42:58.720 --> 43:03.720]  You go to the discount places, $20 for a thinner ribeye
[43:03.720 --> 43:08.720]  That ribeye at that steakhouse just 10 years ago was $10
[43:08.720 --> 43:09.720]  It's now $20
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.720]  The fancy steakhouse, I remember at a steakhouse just 10 years ago
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.720]  Thinking a $25 steak was too much
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.720]  Nothing's $25 at a nice steakhouse now
[43:21.720 --> 43:28.720]  You go to some steakhouses, it's $75 for a prime cut
[43:28.720 --> 43:31.720]  Sorry, I'm out starting to water here, excuse me
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.720]  I remember 10 years ago I could take the family and get a chateau brignon
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.720]  Which is basically like a big long cut, a filet mignon, five or six cuts
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.720]  It'd be $75, $50
[43:44.720 --> 43:46.720]  Now it's $150
[43:46.720 --> 43:49.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me explain the new world order
[43:49.720 --> 43:51.720]  It's a perfect illustration
[43:51.720 --> 43:53.720]  The cattle ranchers go bankrupt
[43:53.720 --> 43:58.720]  Because the economy is rigged and actuaried where you can't make it
[43:58.720 --> 44:00.720]  My dad got word five years ago
[44:00.720 --> 44:04.720]  We're getting rid of hobby farming and ranching right off
[44:04.720 --> 44:06.720]  We don't care if it's still on the books as a law
[44:06.720 --> 44:09.720]  You can't do that at the IRS sending letters
[44:09.720 --> 44:10.720]  He went to his accountant
[44:10.720 --> 44:16.720]  Or we're going to retroactively charge you all this money with penalty and interest
[44:16.720 --> 44:21.720]  And my dad looked at the books and said, but if I stop cattle ranching
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.720]  Then we can't pay the property taxes
[44:24.720 --> 44:30.720]  So he continues to cattle ranch, I guess about a hundred head
[44:30.720 --> 44:32.720]  With my uncle
[44:32.720 --> 44:36.720]  Even though it loses money coming and going
[44:36.720 --> 44:44.720]  He loses less money than he would if he quit
[44:44.720 --> 44:46.720]  Let me explain that again
[44:46.720 --> 44:53.720]  My father doesn't want to sell the land that we have left
[44:53.720 --> 44:58.720]  That goes back to Spanish land grants, Mexican land grants, 1829
[44:58.720 --> 45:01.720]  The property is a liability
[45:01.720 --> 45:07.720]  The government knows that and has set things to where most people won't keep it
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.720]  My dad is a medical manager and a dentist who worked very hard
[45:11.720 --> 45:14.720]  And he subsidizes keeping family property
[45:14.720 --> 45:16.720]  Just because we don't own it
[45:16.720 --> 45:18.720]  The government owns it with those taxes
[45:18.720 --> 45:20.720]  The power to tax, the power to destroy
[45:20.720 --> 45:22.720]  So here's the article of the Economic Collapse Blog
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.720]  It links through to all the mainstream news articles
[45:26.720 --> 45:29.720]  Out of the USDA, the U.S. Drought Monitor
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.720]  Scientific American, Associated Press, you name it
[45:33.720 --> 45:36.720]  Totally bibliographed
[45:36.720 --> 45:38.720]  The meat crisis is here
[45:38.720 --> 45:41.720]  The price of shrimp up 61%
[45:41.720 --> 45:44.720]  Beef at all time high
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.720]  Pork exploding to all time high
[45:46.720 --> 45:49.720]  Bloomberg reports as well
[45:49.720 --> 45:52.720]  Stories up on infowars.com
[45:52.720 --> 45:54.720]  And the media will say it's a drought
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.720]  That's only a small part of it
[45:56.720 --> 46:00.720]  In California, that's what's hitting a lot of the vegetables
[46:00.720 --> 46:03.720]  It's that people are getting out of it everywhere
[46:03.720 --> 46:05.720]  And now they're shipping beef in
[46:05.720 --> 46:07.720]  But you would think that would drive down prices
[46:07.720 --> 46:10.720]  All work together, there's only five or six big companies
[46:10.720 --> 46:12.720]  Last time I checked, it's probably less now
[46:12.720 --> 46:15.720]  And they all throttle it and control it
[46:15.720 --> 46:17.720]  To keep the prices as high as possible
[46:17.720 --> 46:21.720]  So, the article goes on and Bloomberg goes on to say
[46:21.720 --> 46:27.720]  It will now be a luxury to even have a pork chop
[46:27.720 --> 46:29.720]  That's social engineering
[46:29.720 --> 46:31.720]  That's the new rule of order
[46:31.720 --> 46:32.720]  That's artificial scarcity
[46:32.720 --> 46:36.720]  You want it, you got it, you live under it
[46:36.720 --> 46:39.720]  He'll read the article
[46:39.720 --> 46:47.720]  And in America, we don't own our 2,000 acres in East Texas
[46:47.720 --> 46:51.720]  We're just people that have lived there for a long time
[46:51.720 --> 46:53.720]  And still want to think we own it
[46:53.720 --> 46:55.720]  We don't own that property, the government does
[46:55.720 --> 46:58.720]  The foreign banks do
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.720]  And it doesn't matter how many grape orchards we put in
[47:02.720 --> 47:04.720]  It doesn't matter how many honeybees we put in
[47:04.720 --> 47:06.720]  It doesn't matter what we do
[47:06.720 --> 47:08.720]  They're not going to let us make money
[47:08.720 --> 47:10.720]  They've got it all actuary down
[47:10.720 --> 47:14.720]  To where everybody else is selling out their property
[47:14.720 --> 47:16.720]  So that we're a nation of slaves
[47:16.720 --> 47:18.720]  And now they've got the Marines and the Army training
[47:18.720 --> 47:21.720]  Against people wearing John Deere caps and overalls
[47:21.720 --> 47:22.720]  To kill them
[47:22.720 --> 47:25.720]  When they say we're not paying the taxes like Bundy
[47:25.720 --> 47:28.720]  We're done, we're not leaving, it's our property
[47:28.720 --> 47:30.720]  They're going to send in the Marines and the Army
[47:30.720 --> 47:31.720]  And you know what?
[47:31.720 --> 47:33.720]  The people are going to stand up against it
[47:33.720 --> 47:35.720]  And the Marines are going to end up defecting
[47:35.720 --> 47:37.720]  Over to the side of the American people
[47:37.720 --> 47:39.720]  If we talk to the Marines and the Army now
[47:39.720 --> 47:41.720]  And have a public debate about this
[47:41.720 --> 47:45.720]  We will change it, we will change history
[47:45.720 --> 47:47.720]  But I wanted to take you full circle
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.720]  From the Army and the Marines
[47:49.720 --> 47:50.720]  Training to fight what?
[47:50.720 --> 47:51.720]  Rural communities
[47:51.720 --> 47:53.720]  Because a country boy can survive
[47:53.720 --> 47:55.720]  Because we can skin a buck
[47:55.720 --> 47:57.720]  We can run a trot line
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.720]  Because you can't starve us out
[47:59.720 --> 48:01.720]  And you can't make us run
[48:01.720 --> 48:04.720]  Because these old boys were raised on shotguns
[48:04.720 --> 48:08.720]  We say grace, we say amen
[48:08.720 --> 48:11.720]  And if you ain't down with that
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.720]  What's the exact words?
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.720]  If you ain't into that
[48:15.720 --> 48:16.720]  Or the modern parlance will be
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.720]  If you ain't down with that
[48:18.720 --> 48:21.720]  Then we don't give a you know what
[48:21.720 --> 48:24.720]  And we say grace, we say amen
[48:24.720 --> 48:25.720]  If you're not into that
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.720]  Well you know we don't give a damn
[48:27.720 --> 48:29.720]  And that's what it comes down to
[48:29.720 --> 48:31.720]  They know we won't sell out
[48:31.720 --> 48:33.720]  They know we won't compromise anymore
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.720]  We've been pushed too far
[48:35.720 --> 48:37.720]  And so they train for open treason
[48:37.720 --> 48:38.720]  What did Obama say?
[48:38.720 --> 48:39.720]  Bitter clingers
[48:39.720 --> 48:41.720]  In a secret meeting with billionaires
[48:41.720 --> 48:43.720]  And million dollar donors
[48:43.720 --> 48:45.720]  Who are they talking about?
[48:45.720 --> 48:47.720]  We're gonna get these Christians
[48:47.720 --> 48:49.720]  Clinging to their Bibles and their guns
[48:49.720 --> 48:50.720]  We're shutting them down
[48:50.720 --> 48:52.720]  We're shutting off their power plants
[48:52.720 --> 48:53.720]  We're shutting down their jobs
[48:53.720 --> 48:55.720]  We're shutting down their roads
[48:55.720 --> 48:57.720]  We're shutting down their communities
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.720]  We're buying off their preachers
[48:59.720 --> 49:01.720]  We're training the military to go up against them
[49:01.720 --> 49:02.720]  We got the cities
[49:02.720 --> 49:03.720]  We got the kids
[49:03.720 --> 49:05.720]  This is our country
[49:05.720 --> 49:07.720]  We're gonna take them down
[49:07.720 --> 49:09.720]  Who did the weathermen say
[49:09.720 --> 49:11.720]  They were gonna put 50 million Americans
[49:11.720 --> 49:13.720]  They said rural people
[49:13.720 --> 49:15.720]  Rural people
[49:15.720 --> 49:18.720]  Rural people
[49:18.720 --> 49:20.720]  Who aren't in there watching their dish network
[49:20.720 --> 49:21.720]  All day and drinking whiskey
[49:21.720 --> 49:23.720]  Most of the rural people are just
[49:23.720 --> 49:25.720]  Absolutely devastated wrecks
[49:25.720 --> 49:28.720]  There are a hardcore working group out there
[49:28.720 --> 49:30.720]  That's still hanging on
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.720]  And the system knows it's already not looked
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.720]  It's a duty now of your rural
[49:34.720 --> 49:36.720]  And hanging on by your toenails to not pay
[49:36.720 --> 49:37.720]  As much as you can
[49:37.720 --> 49:39.720]  To survive you gotta get out of the system
[49:39.720 --> 49:41.720]  That's why they're harassing
[49:41.720 --> 49:44.720]  Farmers markets in Amish and Mennonites
[49:44.720 --> 49:46.720]  And poor minority groups setting up farms
[49:46.720 --> 49:48.720]  And Mexican farmers that are in this country
[49:48.720 --> 49:50.720]  Because they know communities have been formed
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.720]  Of swap meets and groups
[49:52.720 --> 49:54.720]  And barter is now getting set up
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.720]  And rural areas are working together
[49:56.720 --> 49:58.720]  And so under Northcom
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.720]  And the rural affairs system
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.720]  It says the Pentagon's over it
[50:02.720 --> 50:04.720]  They are designing the roll out
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.720]  For the total takeover of rural areas
[50:06.720 --> 50:08.720]  With clergy response team spies
[50:08.720 --> 50:11.720]  With local and virus spies all of it
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.720]  And when you see these people come to your town
[50:14.720 --> 50:17.720]  They are literally Rockefeller and Ford Foundation
[50:17.720 --> 50:20.720]  Above CIA to take your town over
[50:20.720 --> 50:22.720]  And take you down
[50:22.720 --> 50:24.720]  And it is your duty ladies and gentlemen
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.720]  To keep this country going and to survive and thrive
[50:27.720 --> 50:29.720]  And to have strong families and put in gardens
[50:29.720 --> 50:32.720]  And it's your duty when you see people selling vegetables
[50:32.720 --> 50:34.720]  On the side of the road to buy from them
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.720]  And it's your duty to find that organic milk
[50:36.720 --> 50:37.720]  From the Amish
[50:37.720 --> 50:39.720]  And it's your duty to raise a garden
[50:39.720 --> 50:41.720]  And it's your duty out there folks
[50:41.720 --> 50:44.720]  In little steps to get off their system
[50:44.720 --> 50:46.720]  And to set up off the grid systems
[50:46.720 --> 50:48.720]  That's why they're shutting down lemonade stands
[50:48.720 --> 50:50.720]  Shutting down city markets
[50:50.720 --> 50:53.720]  They want you in a giant reservation
[50:53.720 --> 50:55.720]  They don't want you self-sufficient
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.720]  Just like they shut down the Comanche
[50:57.720 --> 51:21.720]  And it's your duty to find that organic milk
[51:21.720 --> 51:32.720]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.720]  By an intruder with a single kick
[51:34.720 --> 51:36.720]  Criminals know that your wooden door frames are weak
[51:36.720 --> 51:39.720]  And your alarm system can't keep them out
[51:39.720 --> 51:42.720]  That's the sound of the same door
[51:42.720 --> 51:44.720]  Now protected by the door sentinel
[51:44.720 --> 51:46.720]  Standard locks, dead bolts and alarm systems
[51:46.720 --> 51:47.720]  Can't prevent forced entry
[51:47.720 --> 51:50.720]  Harden your door and door jam with a door sentinel

[51:55.720 --> 51:58.720]  The door sentinel, your home's first line of defense
[51:58.720 --> 52:00.720]  General, what do you think about the FBI
[52:00.720 --> 52:03.720]  Saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[52:03.720 --> 52:05.720]  About a potential forcehood situation?
[52:05.720 --> 52:06.720]  The police are shoving people
[52:06.720 --> 52:07.720]  They're shoving Alex
[52:07.720 --> 52:08.720]  They're shoving the crowd
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.720]  Here we go, folks. How many are silent?
[52:10.720 --> 52:12.720]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites
[52:12.720 --> 52:14.720]  Documentary films or the nightly news
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.720]  Infall wars is the tip of the spear
[52:16.720 --> 52:18.720]  Is this another force-flight stage attack
[52:18.720 --> 52:20.720]  To take our civil liberties and promote homeland security
[52:20.720 --> 52:22.720]  Are sticking their hands down against our streets?
[52:22.720 --> 52:24.720]  It's up to us to set brush fires
[52:24.720 --> 52:26.720]  In the minds of men and women everywhere
[52:26.720 --> 52:29.720]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do
[52:29.720 --> 52:31.720]  You watch the Assad regime
[52:31.720 --> 52:33.720]  Is going to be blamed or accused
[52:33.720 --> 52:35.720]  Of using chemical weapons
[52:35.720 --> 52:37.720]  Against the so-called rebels
[52:37.720 --> 52:39.720]  What we see now is a war against reality
[52:39.720 --> 52:41.720]  It's a war against the truth
[52:41.720 --> 52:43.720]  It's more vital than ever
[52:43.720 --> 52:46.720]  That supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv

[54:24.720 --> 54:27.720]  I live back in the woods, you see
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.720]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and me
[54:35.720 --> 54:38.720]  I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive
[54:38.720 --> 54:41.720]  And a country boy can survive
[54:41.720 --> 54:43.720]  Country folks can survive
[54:43.720 --> 54:46.720]  And the Pentagon is made up of country boys, mainly
[54:47.720 --> 54:49.720]  That's just on record
[54:49.720 --> 54:53.720]  But they got robots and drones coming online
[54:53.720 --> 54:56.720]  And when they get done taking down
[54:56.720 --> 54:59.720]  The last vestigial primitive humans
[55:04.720 --> 55:08.720]  When they get done, they're going to come after all of you
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.720]  By the way, who is it in Mexico
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.720]  That's beaten all of the cartels
[55:16.720 --> 55:19.720]  Keep it rolling under me
[55:19.720 --> 55:22.720]  Who is it that's beaten the government and restoring order
[55:22.720 --> 55:24.720]  It's the country boys
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.720]  With guns
[55:29.720 --> 55:31.720]  That's the same thing
[55:31.720 --> 55:33.720]  The people are now following them
[55:33.720 --> 55:35.720]  Because they're not shaking people down
[55:35.720 --> 55:38.720]  They just want to work on their farms and ranches
[55:38.720 --> 55:41.720]  It's the same thing in Chiapas
[55:41.720 --> 55:43.720]  For 20-plus years
[55:43.720 --> 55:46.720]  The whole Mexican government, the cartels
[55:46.720 --> 55:48.720]  Just a bunch of farmers
[55:51.720 --> 55:53.720]  They just want to live and be free
[55:53.720 --> 55:55.720]  They're still humans
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.720]  And they're the country boys
[56:00.720 --> 56:01.720]  And they're all over the world
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.720]  In Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe
[56:05.720 --> 56:08.720]  In the rural areas of France and Germany
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.720]  Asia, I had a good friend in New York City
[56:13.720 --> 56:17.720]  He never called me by my name, just he'll believe
[56:17.720 --> 56:20.720]  We're going to get baggage on at 15 after to take your calls
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.720]  20 after, hold him 20 minutes to the next hour
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.720]  And he's taught him to be a business man
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.720]  He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
[56:35.720 --> 56:38.720]  And I'd send him some homemade wine
[56:38.720 --> 56:41.720]  When you realize the whole Pentagon trains to take on
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.720]  What they see as indigenous, self-sufficient populations
[56:50.720 --> 56:53.720]  What is the special forces training you to do?
[56:55.720 --> 56:57.720]  Live out in the woods
[56:57.720 --> 57:00.720]  Shoot a gun, be self-sufficient
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.720]  Not be a coward
[57:02.720 --> 57:05.720]  And where do they mainly recruit?
[57:05.720 --> 57:08.720]  The people from the country
[57:08.720 --> 57:10.720]  The bull riders
[57:10.720 --> 57:12.720]  The people that aren't cowards
[57:14.720 --> 57:17.720]  And now they're coming after all of us, we're alive
[57:17.720 --> 57:20.720]  Because we're not cowards and we just want to be good men
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.720]  We want to build a civilization that's based on being honest
[57:24.720 --> 57:26.720]  We don't like scum
[57:26.720 --> 57:33.720]  We don't like cowards and trash and double dealers and backstabbers
[57:33.720 --> 57:36.720]  And little towns all over this world
[57:37.720 --> 57:39.720]  And that's why we're under attack
[57:43.720 --> 57:46.720]  And I'll tell you what scares the establishment
[57:48.720 --> 57:51.720]  Because they know worldwide people are trying to get back to that right now
[57:51.720 --> 57:54.720]  You go out with all these yuppies and trendies
[57:54.720 --> 57:56.720]  And they're starting to get into that as well
[57:56.720 --> 57:58.720]  And the liberal women are starting to get into it
[57:58.720 --> 58:01.720]  Because they understand that we're losing our humanity
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.720]  And the globalists know that whether it's Mexico or whether it's in southern Nevada
[58:07.720 --> 58:09.720]  Or whether it's in rural France
[58:10.720 --> 58:12.720]  It's the farmers in the ranchers
[58:13.720 --> 58:15.720]  That burn down the GMO crops
[58:15.720 --> 58:18.720]  It's the farmers in ranchers that kick the butts of the riot police
[58:18.720 --> 58:21.720]  It's the farmers in the ranchers that won't back down
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.720]  They're scared of that ladies and gentlemen
[58:23.720 --> 58:25.720]  That's why they're training to wage war on us
[58:25.720 --> 58:29.720]  We need to wage in for a war on their operatives who belong to us
[58:29.720 --> 58:31.720]  So they're on the right side
[58:32.720 --> 58:34.720]  Alright, second hour coming up
[58:34.720 --> 58:35.720]  I'm your host Alex Jones

[58:42.720 --> 58:45.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[58:45.720 --> 58:52.720]  The Globalist Social Engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda
[58:52.720 --> 58:54.720]  They are manipulating our genetics
[58:54.720 --> 58:58.720]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers
[58:58.720 --> 59:03.720]  That lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs
[59:03.720 --> 59:06.720]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others
[59:06.720 --> 59:13.720]  We have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[59:13.720 --> 59:16.720]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs
[59:16.720 --> 59:19.720]  And then concentrated for maximum potency
[59:19.720 --> 59:25.720]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[59:25.720 --> 59:27.720]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.720]  Super male vitality by Infowars Life is so powerful
[59:31.720 --> 59:34.720]  That I only take half the recommended dose

[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:21.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:26.720]  We're taking your phone calls for the next 20 minutes
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:30.720]  The Dr. Nick Baggage is joining us to cover the waterfront of Key and Tell
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.720]  Now they're trying to run the natives off their land in Alaska
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:34.720]  That's going to be part of it
[1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:36.720]  This theme that's developed today
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:37.720]  Just looking at the nose
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.720]  Doris in Tennessee, then Michael, Michael, Jim, Eugene and others
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:44.720]  Thanks for calling Doris here on the air worldwide
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:47.720]  Hey Alex, how are you holding up?
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.720]  I'm doing good, how are you doing?
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:50.720]  I'm fine
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:53.720]  I called before I told you that we went
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.720]  Because of your TV broadcast
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:58.720]  For Prison Planet
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:00:59.720]  Yes ma'am
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:00.720]  We went to Montana
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:01.720]  We don't fly a lot
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:04.720]  Because of the TSA
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:08.720]  But we did fly out to make Chuck Baldwin
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:09.720]  Great
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  And I think that he is going to try to spark a lot of non-501C3 churches
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:20.720]  Yeah, it's time to get Chuck Baldwin on for an hour via Skypes
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:23.720]  And next week or something to talk about
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:26.720]  Why should churches even be 501C3 and be under the IRS?
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:29.720]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
[1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.720]  Or prohibiting free exercise thereof
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:33.720]  Exactly
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:35.720]  And that's the whole point
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:38.720]  I mean, I agree with you about everything
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:42.720]  I joined Prison Planet's TV network on the internet
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:46.720]  The day that Fukushima happened
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:48.720]  And I agree with everything you say
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:50.720]  I know you're right
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:51.720]  There's no doubt
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:55.720]  This country is a country under judgment
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  We are doing and lifting up the exact opposite of what God's word says to do
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:05.720]  So Chuck Baldwin is going to do that
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  Now, this is supposed to be a Christian country
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:13.720]  But the Christians are too cowardly to stand up for what's right
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:18.720]  And the preachers and the silent, the pulpits are silent
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:19.720]  Well, that's because they're not churches
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:23.720]  They're 501C3 government-run institutions
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  They're afraid of the IRS
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:27.720]  We have state-run churches in America
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:28.720]  Just like the old Soviet Union
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:31.720]  The old Soviet Union had churches, they were just state-run
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:36.720]  I know that, except for Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:41.720]  Who died two days before the war was ever in Poland
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:43.720]  I know, it's incredible
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.720]  Yeah, I know, I'm telling you
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:47.720]  No, I know you know, I'm just telling listeners that don't know, yeah
[1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:50.720]  They're judgment, you're right
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  God bless you
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:56.720]  Anything else?
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:57.720]  That's it
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:59.720]  Thank you so much for calling, good to hear from you Doris
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:01.720]  Look, even if you don't believe in God, folks
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:03.720]  We are becoming a very corrupt society
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:05.720]  And evil's not being restrained
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:07.720]  And then it wants to declare war on good
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:11.720]  I mean, that's an in-game scenario
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:13.720]  Evil always tries to totally take over
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:18.720]  It doesn't just let you sit across the fence from it
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:20.720]  Michael in Tennessee, another call from Tennessee
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.720]  You're on the air, go ahead
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:24.720]  Hi, this is Michael
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.720]  I'd like to start off just saying that the reason that you as info wars
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:31.720]  And people like Matt Drudge are doing this
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:36.720]  Is very explicit when it says in Luke 12, 3
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:39.720]  Therefore, whatever you have spoken in darkness
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:41.720]  Shall be heard in the light
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.720]  And that which you have spoken in the ear and closet
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.720]  That's New World Order
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  Shall be proclaimed upon the house pops
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.720]  And that's Alex Jones in info wars
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:53.720]  Now, if I may, I'd like to say something a little bit
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:55.720]  In our circle, in our current paradox
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  Where up is down, left is right, lies are truth
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:01.720]  I would like to vote, would like to have voted
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.720]  For Alex and info wars as the biggest liar of the century
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.720]  Because all you do is put it out there and tell the truth
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:11.720]  And since truth is lies, that makes you the biggest liar
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.720]  I guess in the 1984 world
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  Telling the truths of Revolutionary Act
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  And so I guess according to the establishment
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:18.720]  I am a big liar
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:21.720]  But I made the point yesterday that I am a huge liar
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:25.720]  That it's not an intentional lie
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  But it's usually worse than what I'm saying
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:30.720]  So when you speak an error, it is kind of a lie
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.720]  Even if it's unintentional
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  So, you know, people say, oh, you're absolutely right
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:36.720]  I'm not absolutely right, folks
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:38.720]  A, I make mistakes on factoids and things
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  B, it's a big wide world
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  And nobody knows that much
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:44.720]  The more I learn, the more I know I don't know
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:45.720]  I just know this
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:47.720]  The establishment are a bunch of scum
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:48.720]  Who are out of control
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.720]  Thank you so much for the call, Michael
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.720]  Jim, Eugene and others
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:55.720]  Your calls are coming up at 800-25-99231
[1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:58.720]  Then, Dr. Nick Begich from Alaska
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:01.720]  General, what do you think about the FBI
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:03.720]  Saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:05.720]  About a potential fourth hood situation
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.720]  The police are shoving people
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:08.720]  Shoving Alex
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:09.720]  Shoving the crowd
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.720]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:13.720]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:15.720]  Documentary films or the nightly news
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:17.720]  Info wars is the tip of the spear
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:20.720]  Is this another force-flight-stage attack to take our civil liberties
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:21.720]  To promote homeland security
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:23.720]  Or sticking our hands down on the fence on the streets
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:25.720]  It's up to us to set brush fires
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:27.720]  In the minds of men and women everywhere
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.720]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do
[1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:32.720]  You watch the Assad regime
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.720]  Is going to be blamed or accused
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.720]  Of using chemical weapons
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.720]  Against the so-called rebels
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:40.720]  What we see now is a war against reality
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:42.720]  It's a war against the truth
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:44.720]  It's more vital than ever

[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  In nine West Virginia counties
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:06.720]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:08.720]  Had their drinking water contaminated
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:11.720]  In our drinking water?
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:13.720]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:14.720]  Of residents
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:17.720]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:19.720]  You can take to protect you and your family
[1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:21.720]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:22.720]  In your tap water
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:24.720]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  At least once a week
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.720]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.720]  That is found in water supplies worldwide
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.720]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines

[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:30.720]  The destruction and implosion of rural communities
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  By the new taxes and regulations set up
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:35.720]  To totally bankrupt those communities
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:37.720]  The Bundy Ranch is a microcosm
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:39.720]  Of 23 other families
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:42.720]  24 other families run out in the last 20 years
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:44.720]  Because of taxes being raised so high
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  He was the last guy standing alone
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:49.720]  Bloomberg and others report the meat crisis is here
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:52.720]  Shrimps up 61% beef at all time high
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:53.720]  Along with pork
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  And that's mainly because of the fact that they've rigged
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:59.720]  The purchasing meat packing facilities
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:01.720]  Have shut all their competition down with government
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:04.720]  So they buy the meat at record low prices
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:08.720]  And then sell it to you at record high prices
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:10.720]  That's the new world order screw job
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:12.720]  Managed economy model
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:14.720]  So we were bringing that subject up
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:18.720]  Dovetailing it with articles up on infowars.com
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  Ahead of Dr. Nick Begich
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.720]  Who formerly headed up by Rural Affairs
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:25.720]  For one of the largest native tribes in Alaska
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  His brother, of course, is a U.S. Senator
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:30.720]  They're running them off their land
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:33.720]  And trying to bring it under total federal control
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:34.720]  And so what's been done to the natives
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:35.720]  Is now being done to everybody
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:36.720]  This is the model
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:38.720]  And then we'll spend a few segments with him on that
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:40.720]  And then get into a bunch of other geopolitical
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:41.720]  And brain ship news
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.720]  He pioneered Pentagon plans
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.720]  But brain ships in troops
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:47.720]  Now that was in the Reuters and AP last week
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  So we're going to be covering that
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  With Dr. Nick Begich coming up
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:57.720]  Some of the other articles up on infowars.com
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:59.720]  Again, break down the Marines training
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:01.720]  To take on rural communities
[1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:03.720]  And a new secret document
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.720]  Other stories, victory for student
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  Who stood up for his gun rights
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.720]  And gun t-shirt suspension
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:10.720]  Officials, not public servants
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.720]  Live suspension, clear record of high school senior
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.720]  You're allowed to wear an NRA shirt
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:17.720]  See how that works?
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.720]  You want to get in trouble
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  To show it's a fraud
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  Not comply and be a slave
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:23.720]  You don't comply with stuff
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  That isn't common law constitutional
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.720]  You fight it
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  Police now armed for war
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:31.720]  Against returning veterans
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.720]  A huge breaking Paul Joseph Watson article
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.720]  Print me that guys, it just broke
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:37.720]  Cops and armored vehicles
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:38.720]  Ask for residents
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:41.720]  Are you coming to take our guns away?
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  Establishment media insist Al Qaeda
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:45.720]  On cutting edge of encryption tech
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.720]  Leaked documents reveal
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:49.720]  Marine Corps urban training center
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:51.720]  Based on U.S. town training for war
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.720]  Robocops resemble police from dystopian
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:56.720]  Classic Brazil
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  The meat crisis is here
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  Again, I just mentioned that article
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  Grassroots militia, citizens of Mexico
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:04.720]  Rediscover their God given rights
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:05.720]  That's an article breaking down
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:07.720]  What's happening in Mexico
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:09.720]  As the militias restore order
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  And we've got the videos I shot
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:12.720]  Last weekend breaking that down
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  But a new article on it with new developments
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  That's just some of the news
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:22.720]  Up on info wars dot com
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.720]  And prison planet dot com
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:27.720]  But right now let's go to your calls
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  Michael in Texas, you're on the air
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  Thanks for calling
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.720]  Thank you Alex, taking my call
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.720]  May the Lord continue to bless
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  And protect you and yours
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  In these turbulent times
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:39.720]  I'm calling from Texas
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  And we all know that the demise of the Republic
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:45.720]  Has been in the works for quite some time
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:47.720]  The corruption is so bad
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  They're pulling every cloud and pivot
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:52.720]  Solid linsky trip that they can
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  To remove every last few vestiges
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  Of our republic's God given rights
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:00.720]  And they've turned the presidency's office
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.720]  Into a dictatorship
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  I greatly appreciate everything that you're doing
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:09.720]  I would like your opinion in regards
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:11.720]  To an email that I received today
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  In regards to strategic plans and plots
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.720]  This is hearsay that I've heard
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:21.720]  That I'm reading off the email that I have
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.720]  But evidently supposedly Obama's conferred
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:27.720]  With his lawyers and has been advised
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:29.720]  That he can run a third term
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:32.720]  If he resigns between now and November 4th
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.720]  And has Biden stepped in and pardoned him
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  That would take care of the criminal charges
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.720]  And opens the doors to another two terms
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:45.720]  If he runs for president in November
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  What do you think about that?
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:47.720]  Is that possible?
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:48.720]  I appreciate your call
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:49.720]  Let me answer that
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.720]  The sky's the limit with these people
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:53.720]  I continue to underestimate them
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:55.720]  So I want to be clear
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:58.720]  On the surface it sounds like it's ridiculous
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  A, he's a puppet who served well
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:03.720]  To get a lot of the agenda through
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.720]  And create racial division
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:06.720]  For the offshore crime syndicates
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:08.720]  That are tax exempt that rule this country
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.720]  By fraud
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:13.720]  They want to put a new puppet in down the road
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  But if they think the Tea Party
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  Could win and get a Rand Paul or Ted Cruz in
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:22.720]  They, it's in the cards to not resign
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:24.720]  And pardon himself and run again
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.720]  But to set off nukes in the U.S.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.720]  And then declare martial law
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:31.720]  Claiming that the Republicans
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:33.720]  Or the Liberty Movement did it
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:34.720]  And I'm not saying the Republicans
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:36.720]  Are good at the leadership level
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:38.720]  But the Democrats could double cross
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:42.720]  Painter and the rest of them
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:44.720]  And I told you that I see them
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:45.720]  Preparing for a breakdown of society
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:47.720]  A takeover which they'll engineer
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:52.720]  And I can see in the cards
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:54.720]  There may be six, seven scenarios
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:55.720]  That are in their hand
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:56.720]  They could play a couple cards
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  They could play them all
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:13:58.720]  They could play one of them
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:01.720]  They could be smart and fold
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:04.720]  But I told you I see them nuking a major city
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:05.720]  With a low yield weapon
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.720]  That would still kill 10,000 plus people
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:12.720]  I see them hitting Dallas, Denver, Cleveland
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:15.720]  Cities like that
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:16.720]  Because the CFR bragged
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:17.720]  And said those were the targets
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:19.720]  Gary Hart did
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:20.720]  He likes to brag
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:21.720]  He's the guy they have that
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:22.720]  Says what they're going to do
[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  Beforehand, I've seen repeatedly
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.720]  And they would hit with a nuke
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:29.720]  Now, Obama then said two months ago
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.720]  The number one threat he sees now
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:34.720]  Is just a rogue group nuking Manhattan
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:35.720]  Or, you know, they could nuke
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.720]  That group of traitors when Congress
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:39.720]  Is in session
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:41.720]  Folks, the globalist could forfeit
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:43.720]  In the end game during the State
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.720]  Of the Union and wipe out the entire
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:48.720]  Group of puppets and bring in COG
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:50.720]  To the National Security Council
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:53.720]  The bold stroke off do miss
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:55.720]  But the bold stroke off
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:00.720]  Win the whole game
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:04.720]  So they got Hail Marys in their
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:11.720]  In their cards, in their fists
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:13.720]  They could simulate an EMP attack
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:15.720]  Take down the power grid, pose
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:17.720]  During that, use that to bring in
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:18.720]  Total control
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:20.720]  World War III with the Russians
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:22.720]  But we're entering that historical
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:25.720]  Zone of crazy town
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  We're entering it now
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.720]  I told you this years ago, we're here
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:32.720]  And it's just crazy towns from here on out
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:34.720]  Because it's not going to end like other cycles
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:38.720]  It's the quickening, the singularity
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:40.720]  All of it, this is it
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:43.720]  Call it whatever you want
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:45.720]  And it's now the time for everybody
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:47.720]  To be reality based and admit
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:49.720]  How crazy things are
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:51.720]  If you deny
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:53.720]  Yeah, Alex Jones is right about the NSA
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:55.720]  And the checkpoints, the armored vehicles
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:57.720]  And GMO and so many other things
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:00.720]  But he's still kind of a crazy man
[1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:02.720]  Well, yeah, I'm crazy jumping up and down
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:04.720]  Trying to stop it, you're right
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:06.720]  Because I know they're putting cancer viruses
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:08.720]  In the vaccines and fluoride in the water
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:10.720]  And GMO that creates 90 plus percent
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:12.720]  Sterilization in all mammal species
[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:14.720]  Within three generations
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:16.720]  I mean, I know it's the end of days
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:18.720]  It's the end of humanity
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:20.720]  Even if God isn't real, the globalists are using it
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.720]  As a template, a scientific overwrite
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:24.720]  It's happening
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:26.720]  And I'm reflecting what they're doing
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:28.720]  So I sound nuts, it is crazy
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.720]  But I'm not the one doing it
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:34.720]  I went to urban warfare drills
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:36.720]  Because Marine Corps sources told me to
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:38.720]  In 96, 97, 98, 99
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:40.720]  And I couldn't believe what I saw
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:42.720]  And what I got on tape
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:44.720]  The Marines breaking in our hotels
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:46.720]  Roughing us up
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.720]  You know, special groups
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:50.720]  Not the average Marines
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:52.720]  Foreign troops, checkpoints
[1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:54.720]  Training to kill Americans
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:56.720]  People begging not to have their guns taken in the drills
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:58.720]  I mean, I brought you the footage
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:06.720]  And now they've been training secretly for decades
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:08.720]  And they're ready to roll with this
[1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:10.720]  It's incredible high treason
[1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:12.720]  Eugene in Missouri, you're on the air
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.720]  Good afternoon
[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:16.720]  You're right, it is a little bit crazy
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.720]  And that's why we need to point all this stuff out
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:20.720]  You might be proud
[1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.720]  But I submitted
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.720]  We will resist TSA and NSA
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:26.720]  To hear any video a few months back
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:28.720]  And
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:30.720]  It was real easy, I learned iMovie
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.720]  And just created my own movie
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:34.720]  Anybody can do this
[1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:36.720]  And I created a web page
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:38.720]  Two months ago called HVENews.com
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:40.720]  High Voltage News
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:42.720]  And I'm spreading the info
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:44.720]  Or just like you do
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.720]  Good, just don't get sucked into the yen fighting
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:48.720]  Stay focused on real issues
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.720]  Don't let them get you off balance
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:52.720]  Just continue to report and break news
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:54.720]  And you'll have a huge effect
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:56.720]  What's your take on
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:58.720]  The beef prices all time high
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:00.720]  Other meat prices all time high
[1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:02.720]  It's all in the beginning
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.720]  It fits into the Agenda 21
[1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:06.720]  And making corporation
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:08.720]  The only entity that can provide the masses
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  The truth
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:12.720]  Yeah, record profits while providing you
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.720]  Much less
[1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:16.720]  With poison in it
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:18.720]  With radiated, with GMO
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:20.720]  And hormones, exactly
[1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:22.720]  Yeah, that's why I just bought
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:24.720]  My Patriot supply stash yesterday
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:26.720]  Thanks for supporting that sponsor
[1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:28.720]  Oh, you're welcome
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:30.720]  It's all good and it fits in with
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:32.720]  The self-reliance
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:34.720]  That we all have in our ability
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.720]  That they don't like
[1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:38.720]  Absolutely, God bless you, sir
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:40.720]  We've got baggage coming on for 20 minutes
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.720]  The next hour, but we'll take some calls with him
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:44.720]  He's a generalist, kind of like I am
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.720]  He can talk to any subjects, so Jim, Chad,
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:48.720]  Carrie, Sue and others
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:50.720]  We'll get the calls by 45 after with baggage
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:52.720]  And then get back into news with him
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.720]  20 minutes into the next hour
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:56.720]  I appreciate him joining us
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:58.720]  Best-selling author

[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  Sciences
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.720]  And his brother's a U.S. senator from Alaska
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:08.720]  His father was a famous congressman
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:10.720]  They clearly killed to shut him up
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:12.720]  We're going to talk about the waterfront
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:14.720]  Straight ahead with Dr. Nick Baggis
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.720]  Briefly, since he mentioned it

[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:02.080]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:07.560]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:10.880]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:14.840]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:15.840]  buck.
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:19.920]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:23.960]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:29.240]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:30.240]  and women.
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:33.120]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:38.440]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:44.200]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:50.080]  or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:53.160]  That's 866-229-0927.
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:59.760]  Do business with someone who shares your values by patriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.280]  Attention America, within a little-known government document is devastating information
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:08.360]  that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:11.960]  My name is Jeff Ooptike, former reporter for The Wall Street Journal.
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:17.560]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the
[1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:20.980]  largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[1:23:20.980 --> 1:23:24.720]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:28.000]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.680]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote,
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:35.600]  the potential to be catastrophic.
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:40.160]  Within a matter of weeks, the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:45.280]  and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:49.720]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack, visit
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:53.800]  www.obamasecret1.com.
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:24:21.820]  Again, that's www.obamasecret1.com.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:44.760]  Folks, if you think I'm going to sit around while the world goes by and let the global
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:53.720]  technocrats dehumanize me and my family, you've got another thing coming.
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:59.120]  This Sunday through Friday, we're here live, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central.
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:03.840]  This Sunday, we've got some special guests that are going to be in studio, four to six
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:07.800]  p.m. join us for the live Sunday transmission.
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:15.000]  This Sunday, four to six p.m. central standard time.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:18.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Nick Maggis joins us to the bottom of the next hour.
[1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:21.640]  We appreciate him being gracious with his time.
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:26.720]  He's the eldest son of late United States congressman from Alaska, Nick Maggis Sr.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:31.640]  And he's been a political activist his whole life as well as his mother has been.
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:35.560]  He's well-known in Alaska, politics for his adult life, we're heading up some of the major
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:44.000]  tribes in the state trying to get their rights and having multiple degrees in science.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.200]  Maggis has also published articles in science, political education as a well-known lecture,
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:52.680]  selling author, having presented throughout the United States and Europe.
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:56.920]  He's the publisher and co-owner of Earth Pulse Press, currently Maggis consults for tribal
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:01.280]  organizations, private corporations and others in a number of research areas.
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:04.920]  He headed up the Lay Institute for a while, major institute.
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:09.800]  Maggis has authored, I won't go over all of that, earthpulse.com is just one of his sites
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:16.760]  and his brother of course is one of the U.S. senators from Alaska.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:22.680]  And he is the pioneer when it comes to documenting with the patents and lecturing the parliaments
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:29.920]  around the world on brain ships, psychological warfare, chemical warfare, what's covertly
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:31.000]  going on.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.880]  But so much of what he's talked about is now mainstream.
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:42.360]  We get him on 18 years ago, I've been interviewing him since about 1996 or so, 1997.
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:47.160]  And everything he's talked about unfortunately has now gone from the area of science research
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:48.160]  to being mainstream.
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:49.520]  Weather control, you name it.
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.840]  But the first reason I wanted to get him on is news articles I've seen all over the country
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:59.120]  where the BLM is taking tribal lands, public lands, private lands and claiming that they
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:03.080]  own them and control them when the feds already have more than half the country.
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:04.080]  What is behind this?
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.560]  I know he represents some of the tribes trying to get them to be able to use their own land.
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:12.060]  So Dr. Maggis, we got a few minutes left in this segment, long segment coming on.
[1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:13.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:15.520]  What's happening on the land grab front?
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:20.000]  Why do you think major corporations or lobbying governments not just here but worldwide to
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.680]  get people off rural land?
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:30.440]  Well, you know, here in Alaska, only 1% of the entire state is privately owned, excluding
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:31.800]  Native Americans.
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:37.080]  Native Americans control approximately 9% of the land mass in Alaska, about 44 million
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:42.920]  acres, and that goes back to the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act of 1972, which
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:46.240]  was actually authored and got through the Congress by my father.
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:52.040]  It was the largest Native American land settlement and cash settlement in the U.S. history, either
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.480]  before or since.
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:56.040]  But it had a really unique setup.
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:04.760]  It was set up with 12 regional corporations that were configured under them, 228 village
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:05.760]  corporations.
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:10.840]  And these village corporations can use the surface estate of the land, whereas the regionals
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:16.760]  own the subsurface and mineral rights as well as big areas of surface estate.
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.800]  It was an experiment, really, and unfortunately, you know, once the law was passed, there was
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:25.000]  to be a lot of follow on work by dad, and that never happened.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.200]  As you know, he was lost on a plane with Hale Boggs, who at the time was a majority
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:33.320]  leader in the U.S. House.
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:37.600]  You know, dad was progressive on these issues with Native Americans, trying to find something
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:41.080]  better than a reservation model.
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:45.480]  Unfortunately, this really did not work as well as it could have.
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:52.080]  The tribal governments, who are the foundational governments in Alaska, weren't even recognized,
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:56.320]  except for one in southeast, and actually there's another one up in the northwestern
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:57.560]  part of the state.
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:02.440]  But they were not recognized by the federal government until about the mid-90s, and some
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:05.080]  of the tribes are still trying to get recognition.
[1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:08.960]  There are 458 Native American tribes in the United States.
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:14.360]  A little under half of those are in Alaska now recognized as governments.
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:16.600]  So we had kind of an upside-down situation.
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:22.440]  The governments of the tribes should have been negotiating the Native land claims.
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:28.280]  Unfortunately, they weren't even recognized until over 20 years after the Settlement Act.
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:31.160]  And now I'm seeing the feds are saying they're going to take control and management-wise.
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:33.160]  Is that good or bad in your view?
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:36.320]  Probably the top expert we could talk to from Alaska, Dr. Nick Baggage.
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:40.720]  We'll spend five more minutes on this, just as an interesting point tying into the bundes.
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:45.280]  And then we will expand into the brain chips they're announcing that DARPA wants to put
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:46.280]  the trips.
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:49.200]  Stay with us.
[1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:52.960]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:30:01.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:35.920]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, the empires on the run, the empires on the
[1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:36.920]  run.
[1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:56.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, the empires on the run.
[1:30:56.800 --> 1:31:14.760]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, the empires on the run, the empires on the
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:15.760]  run.
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:33.720]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, the empires on the run.
[1:31:33.720 --> 1:32:00.360]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, the empires on the run.
[1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:05.600]  The last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:11.120]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:13.080]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:14.080]  Fluoride.
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:15.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:21.440]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:22.440]  iodine.
[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:28.400]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:33.680]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:36.040]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:42.560]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:48.040]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.

[1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:01.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:02.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:29.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:55.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:33:57.840]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:33:57.840 --> 1:34:03.760]  We are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. central, back weeknights,
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:08.600]  7 o'clock central with PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:10.520]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:13.080]  We have loaded phone lines on a host of issues.
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:17.200]  I want to get his take on the state of the world, DARPA coming out with this brain project,
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:20.000]  which is just a public rollout of what was already there.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  I want to get his true expert take on that and so much more.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.680]  Before we go back to Dr. Nick Begich of EarthPulse.com, I should add we sell quite a few of his bestselling
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:36.360]  books on weather modification, on emerging technologies, on empowerment of the human
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:42.360]  mind, the positive side of the march towards the singularity, the negative side.
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:47.440]  We carry his films and books at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.120]  So you can find Angels Don't Play This Harp, the film and the book.
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:57.600]  We also have his book on Mind Control, Controlling the Human Mind.
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:04.040]  We have just all of them at InfowarsStore.com and they're all excellent if you want fact
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:06.400]  not fiction.
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:11.640]  Also at InfowarsStore.com you can find the Pro Pure Pro One and G2 filters that cut
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.240]  out the glyphosates, the fluoride, the heavy metals, you name it, unlike any other gravity
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:19.600]  fed stainless steel filter, annihilates the competition.
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:25.120]  Be the side-by-side comparisons at InfowarsStore.com and these units are less than leading competitor.
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:30.240]  That's why we carry exclusively Pro One and their G2.0 systems in stainless steel and
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:31.240]  in pitchers.
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:32.240]  They've got them all.
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:42.640]  You can also ask any questions or order over the phone, 888-253-3139, that's 888-253-3139.
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:48.120]  We have survival water filters like Livestraw, we have the great non-GMO, heirloom seeds,
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:52.640]  the widest selection of anywhere out there, all the major developers of them.
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:56.040]  We buy from them at the lowest price we're authorized to sell.
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:35:59.160]  They all make you sign contracts and not undercut the market.
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:05.260]  But you will have the certified lowest prices on seeds out there, period.
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:09.800]  This is what we believe in, selling high-quality products that empower humanity to promote
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:14.480]  our free speech, pro-liberty, aggressive platform.
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:21.680]  We're not like NPR, we're not like all these government-funded institutions, MSNBC with
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:22.680]  a stimulus money.
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:31.920]  We're funded by Free Will, Free Association, InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:35.120]  And don't forget, the nightly news just gets so good.
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:39.320]  It's 30 minutes of condensed powerful info, all night from the news ends, then there'll
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:45.920]  not be 10, 20, 30, an hour of live coverage or interviews or events or special reports.
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:53.120]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pacific, 6 o'clock Montana, Mountain Time,
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:54.640]  Tony Montana Time.
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:00.760]  It is all there with our great reporters myself and so much more, over 12 years up and running,
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:02.160]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.480]  When you're a member, 11 memberships for the price of one, check that out.
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:10.040]  Great to wake up friends and family, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:14.240]  And starting next week, we're going to be going live out of the studio either Monday
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:20.040]  or Tuesday, so get ready for that in the new studio and so much more.
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:22.720]  Thank you all for your support, all of you out there.
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:29.280]  All right, Dr. Begitz continuing with the reports I've seen of changing up what's happening,
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:33.720]  the federal government saying they're going to be over tribal lands and that they'll quote
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:34.720]  help the natives.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:38.080]  Well, I've heard that before, but they've already been getting screwed so bad by the
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:43.200]  state and the feds from your true expert position that I know really is about helping
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:48.960]  the native groups, but also Alaskans period, get the wealth out of the land for the people
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.440]  that actually develop it with their hands.
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:58.120]  What's really happening in Alaska and in a larger situation with the native nations across
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  North America?
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:05.760]  Well, here in Alaska, again, it was a unique experiment and I worked for two of the more
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:11.040]  radical tribes in Alaska that really were the leaders, the Ionic Native Corporation,
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.920]  the leader in the Native Land Claims Settlement Act along with the Alaska Federation of Natives
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:23.040]  and then Chiklun Village, which is one of the oldest established tribal governments
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:26.760]  here in terms of taking their authority and actually acting on it.
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:31.080]  And the problem has been the state of Alaska has failed to recognize tribes.
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  These are sovereign domestic nations under the federal codes.
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:39.360]  The history on this goes back to the revolutionary days, really.
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:44.240]  And when you look at what's happened here, the state fails to recognize which creates
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:48.880]  used disconnects between Native Americans and the state of Alaska.
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:54.480]  The feds have asserted jurisdiction over fishing game on federal lands.
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:58.360]  Natives really don't have control over the fishing game on their lands or the ability
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  to run their tribal courts and be properly recognized by the state.
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:07.600]  So from a perspective of Native Americans, yeah, the BIA and Department of Interior have
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:10.800]  screwed Natives over in Alaska and throughout the country.
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:15.400]  In fact, many of my friends refer to BIA not as a Bureau of Indian Affairs but as boss
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:17.080]  Indians around.
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:24.520]  But what has happened is sort of the default is if we can at least see the possibility
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:30.120]  of Natives being able to opt at their option into the federal jurisdiction.
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:33.120]  What happens then is they're able to run their courts properly.
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:37.960]  The state gets cut out of the process and the state's been very adversarial to Native
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:42.880]  Americans by opposing their sovereignty, their right to exist.
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:45.200]  They are the economic engines for this state.
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:48.560]  They represent the largest corporate structures now.
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:51.720]  They control 90% of all private land in Alaska.
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:57.600]  Only 1% of the land in the entire state is privately owned with Natives owning.
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:03.480]  So you're saying overall it's such a bad situation that the feds taking these land corporations,
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:09.120]  your dad set up away basically is better.
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:12.200]  For some people believe so within the Native community.
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:15.720]  What do you believe, I mean I know you don't want to speak for them but you're highly respected
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:18.800]  by your dad helping them so much.
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:20.960]  What do you really think, your personal opinion?
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:24.120]  I think we need to do some kind of a hybridized version.
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:27.280]  I agree, you need checks and balances on the two groups.
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:31.840]  That's exactly right because what's happening now as Interior is unreliable, I mean there's
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:37.440]  a trillion dollar lawsuits that were settled for billions because of the BIA's lack of
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:42.240]  management over Native land, trust lands, more authority needs to be vested with the
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:47.360]  tribal governments within these configurations and the state needs to be forced to recognize
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:49.800]  these tribes whether they like it or not.
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:53.760]  They're federally recognized, these people have a right to recognition by the state of
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:56.240]  Alaska and that needs to change.
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:00.720]  When you look at what's going on here, Natives are the leaders in many of the developments
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:04.560]  going on in Alaska where the federal government under the Obama administration stood in the
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:06.320]  way of development.
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.000]  Canada represents nearly 20% of the land mass of the United States, the largest coastal
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:15.020]  areas in the United States bigger than the east, west and Gulf Coast combined.
[1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:18.480]  We have mineral wealth that would set the budget straight.
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.200]  I know this, everywhere the Natives haven't been given control, it's a hellhole and they're
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:28.080]  all just basically the stereotype drinking Jack Daniels in a trailer with no electricity
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.840]  but where you go where the Natives have gotten control up in Minnesota and Oklahoma and other
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:38.000]  areas, some of the nicest areas in the state are Native controlled so the answer is give
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.960]  the Natives their wealth, stop treating them like crap and they'll produce wealth and actually
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:46.680]  give us something that's different than the state or the feds.
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:48.720]  That's what I like is more diversity.
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:55.480]  Yeah, absolutely and these people operate good organizations, they are good people and
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.560]  yeah there's a lot to learn in all of this because we become international in the fact
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:05.360]  of where Alaska sits and where our commodities flow, they flow to the Pacific Rim mostly
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:07.760]  to foreign buyers.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:12.160]  It's incredibly important to recognize not just the sovereignty of individual citizens
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:17.400]  within the country but to recognize the sovereignty of first people, they have the potential to
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:21.040]  develop governments that actually represent people and deliver services that's what they
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  want to do.
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:24.800]  Well I would rather the Natives have half the western land than the feds having it, at
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:26.760]  least they'll do something with it.
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:27.760]  Absolutely.
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  I mean come on.
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:29.760]  Absolutely.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:30.760]  They're responsible people.
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:32.840]  They care about the land more than anyone else.
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:34.880]  I mean this is their heritage.
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:41.040]  Let these people have the sovereignty they deserve, let them move forward just under
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:43.640]  the bus of the Interior Department.
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:46.280]  Let's find a hybridized way to accomplish this.
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:51.240]  I'm hopeful that my brother will continue, I mean he had strong rural support.
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:57.080]  He won every rural district against one of the most powerful senators in history, Ted
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:42:58.080]  Stevens.
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:02.800]  My brother won every rural district in Alaska when he ran against him six years ago.
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:07.240]  Because of the family's position and his position on Native American rights, I'm certain
[1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:14.480]  in the next six years he'll accomplish a great deal if he's allowed to serve again.
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:15.480]  All right.
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.200]  Now continuing, let's shift gears into brain shifts and I want to take calls.
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:23.600]  And then wildcard, what do you want to cover in the 30 minutes of the next hour?
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:24.600]  Just tell me now.
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:28.400]  There's a lot of issues out there you cover so much.
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:29.560]  What is front and center?
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:34.320]  I'd like to get into a little bit more on the land's issues and the resources here.
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:40.160]  Because Americans don't really fully recognize this state potentially offers the solutions
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.360]  that the country needs to alleviate our deficits, to create a growing, vibrant...
[1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:49.320]  Oh yeah, that's why the globalists don't want us getting into Alaska or getting into
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:54.080]  the West and use fake environmentalism to block it all off.
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:57.960]  And then meanwhile they're doing stuff in Mexico and China 10 times worse, we'll talk
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:01.560]  about that some in the next hour, a plan to get this country going again.
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:05.120]  People say, well, why are you pro oil or pro gas?
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:06.120]  Don't you want free energy?
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.560]  If they would let us develop all that instead of suppress it, sure.
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:14.920]  But we are on this economy and so we're talking about realism and we'll talk to somebody who
[1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:18.280]  knows about it more than anybody, Dr. Nick Baggett, shifting gears.
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:24.040]  I'm sure you saw last week Obama come out again and say we want this brain program.
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:29.160]  And announced what's been around for decades, a rolling out of brain chips, a rolling...
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:33.640]  And sure it could be great, the blind to see brain damage, the problem is they build back
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:35.160]  doors into everything.
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:38.880]  What is your take on the public rollout of DARPA and the brain chips?
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:43.280]  Well, we've been talking about this, as you know, for 18 years with you on the air and
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:44.760]  many, many others.
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:51.880]  The fact is they're masking the true intentions behind these so-called great, wonderful breakthroughs.
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:56.120]  And while they are, this is a double-edged sword and one that will stab us in the eye
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:59.320]  and not give us a clear vision, I can tell you.
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:03.360]  DARPA has been involved, you know, starting with just micro-circuits that would allow
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:08.440]  them to track special forces, congressional leadership, you know, the Mexican government
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:13.160]  even 200 of their top beer crafts were implanted with chips years ago so they could track all
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:14.400]  their movements.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.840]  These are much, much more sophisticated and they go back to the idea of controlled effects
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:24.360]  which came out of at least DARPA as well as the electromagnetic director of the Air Force.
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:32.560]  Back in June of 2000 and before there was an article published in Technology Horizons
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:37.280]  produced by the Air Force talking about this very thing and the idea of creating synthetic
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:41.640]  memory where you would, I mean, the good side is they're saying, well, we can knock out
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:47.280]  all this war trauma and sort of wipe the memories clean of foreign fighters, you know, coming
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:51.480]  back, you know, into the U.S. The problem is, what else do you wipe clean?
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:54.000]  It's total mind control.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.760]  This is the worst of the worst.
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:45:59.720]  The idea of creating synthetic memory, what's going to happen in courtrooms when people
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:04.080]  raise their right hand and swear that what they say is true when they can't distinguish
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:08.120]  the synthetic memory from the real memory.
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:13.520]  This is the big challenge for this republic is what is it going to do as they roll each
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:18.360]  of these things out and how much more can the government conceal when they can literally
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.600]  wipe and replace memory.
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:22.240]  This is where it's headed.
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.720]  This is where it's going.
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:29.720]  Beyond that is the idea of synthetic or synthetic telepathy, which are contracts that were let
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:34.880]  by DARPA to the University of California several years ago, you and I reported on this.
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:40.120]  These have moved forward to actually allow you to transfer signals, brain signals so
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:44.600]  you can actually read a person's thoughts at a distance and send them information at
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  a distance.
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:49.760]  Now, for communication with our own troops, some people may cease to merit in this.
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:53.960]  From the standpoint of foreign troops and intervention, imagine a foreign army all of
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:47:00.040]  a sudden having thoughts of God telling them what to do or what have you, these are the
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:03.840]  very kind of things that we've been talking about for over 18 years.
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:08.720]  And everything used on the military and deployed overseas will be deployed here first, the
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:11.720]  microwave guns, the tracking systems.
[1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:16.480]  This is already, I remember DARPA, it was like 14 years ago in the Baltimore Sun.
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:18.840]  And it was like a science fiction movie back then.
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:22.080]  It was like Twilight Zone music was playing almost when I read it on air.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.920]  They said DARPA is practicing with different wavelengths out of cell tower arrays to calm
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:28.160]  the public.
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:33.200]  And then I read that on air and it sounded crazy, but it was in the news as a test.
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:37.600]  How far advanced is this really from the patents and the research you've done?
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:42.040]  Obviously, if they're telling us about it now, how far along is this attack on free
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:43.040]  will?
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:47.560]  They've already engaged it, both in the private sector and the public sector.
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:50.760]  To change emotional states of the population is really easy.
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:55.480]  And you can even go back to the Big New Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages, when he was at Columbia
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:00.800]  University in the early 70s, he published a book where he talked about mind control.
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:02.080]  The Technotronic Era.
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.080]  Right.
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:05.080]  And you can look at that book.
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:08.320]  And you know, people don't remember, you know, he was National Security Advisor Jimmy Carter.
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:10.440]  He's one of the founders of the Trilateral Commission.
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:12.960]  He is a globalist of globalists.
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:16.880]  This guy, if you read that book today, you'd swear it was a history on what happened in
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:22.120]  terms of technology, society, and politics literally around the world, because everything
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:24.040]  he predicted came true.
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:31.280]  This area, you know, goes back decades, but where it is now is a very, very fine science.
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:36.640]  We've been able to replicate various functions of the brain, be able to do this synthetically
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:38.360]  through electronic circuits.
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:43.200]  And the resolution, if you will, the ability to do this at a finer and finer and finer level
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:45.960]  increases as our computer power increases.
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:52.600]  So when you think about this, to do what the brain does, say in 1980, no way, the technology
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:53.600]  wasn't there.
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:58.280]  To do it now with the advent and the emergence of supercomputers, you're going to be able
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:02.360]  to create machines that think like humans, that act like humans.
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.880]  You're going to be able to download your memory set.
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:05.880]  Let me ask you this.
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:11.080]  If they're 25 to 40 years ahead, depending on the technologies we know about in corporate
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:16.240]  and institutional redoubts, I see the Internet, Dr. Begich, with the billions of people that
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:17.360]  are interfacing.
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:23.480]  It can predict the future, almost 100% in mass movements, 97% they admit in individual
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:24.480]  movements.
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:25.920]  That's almost beyond human intelligence.
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:30.520]  In some respects, obviously ours is much more advanced than other ways to be able to think
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:35.600]  of new things, to have love, to tell what's good from bad, to enjoy a sunset.
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:41.560]  But is it the Internet interfacing with humans, in my view, a new life form and is already
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.040]  artificially intelligent?
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:44.640]  Yeah, I would say so.
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:49.720]  In fact, if you really look at it as it expands, it will never be 100%.
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:50.720]  That's the thing about this.
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:55.320]  It will never have 100% predictability because of the emotional factors and just the human
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:56.320]  factor.
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:49:57.320]  The butterfly factor.
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.720]  But we're going to become more and more reliant.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:04.600]  And that reliance is going to lead to judgments that are not necessarily the right ones because
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:06.880]  they won't have that human factor.
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.440]  And I mean, on one hand, things are expanding, but at the same time as they're expanding
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:17.040]  the secrecy syndrome within government is expanding as well.
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.880]  That's the root of the problem.
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:20.200]  Government cannot be trusted.
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:21.680]  My family's been in it.
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:24.160]  I've been exposed to it my entire life.
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:28.400]  The first advice that my brother would give you as a U.S. Senator is, don't trust any
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:30.400]  of them.
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:32.920]  And that's coming from a guy on the inside.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:37.880]  And the reality is, special interests continue to drive way too much of our public policy.
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:41.800]  And they're blinding themselves because they only care about their one issue.
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.560]  That's scientific smarts.
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  But not wisdom.
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:45.560]  How does it create ripples?
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:50.720]  I want to come back with Dr. Nick Baggage straight ahead and talk about future trends.
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:51.920]  How do we save humanity?
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:57.240]  Get your phone calls and then more on the resources of the United States and North America that
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:00.280]  could create an incredible new future.
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.080]  Clean water at home, clean water at the office, clean water on the go.
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.360]  The Berkey guy has a Berkey water filtration model for anywhere you are and one that fits
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:10.360]  any budget.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:13.480]  Thousands of satisfied customers can't be wrong.
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:21.000]  For free shipping within the U.S., go to goberkey.com or call 877-886-3653.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  Helping thousands prepare since 2005, goberkey.com.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:52:02.320]  Texas is facing a killer drought.
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:07.520]  For 50 years, projects which could have protected us from this were sabotaged by Wall Street
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:11.720]  profiteering and the Zero Growth Anti-Science Green Agenda.
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:14.360]  Today these projects will not be enough.
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:18.720]  We need a revolution in real science to take the lid off human progress.
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:23.560]  I'm Keisha Rogers, when you vote for me on May 27th in the Democratic runoff election
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:28.280]  for U.S. Senate, you will be voting to put our space program back to work to bring online
[1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:33.920]  thermonuclear fusion energy and discover how the sun influences atmospheric dynamics and
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:38.000]  climate so we can control these things for the benefit of mankind.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.320]  We must stop this fracking nonsense.
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:44.680]  Shell gas is not an economic boom, it's a backward strategy for doom.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:50.080]  Vote for me, Keisha Rogers, in the Democratic runoff on May 27th to reject Wall Street sabotage
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:53.960]  and ensure a fruitful and productive future for Texas and the nation.
[1:52:53.960 --> 1:52:56.200]  I'm Keisha Rogers and I authorize this message.
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:58.200]  Paid for by Keisha Rogers for U.S. Senate.
[1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:04.200]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:05.200]  forward hood situation?
[1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:08.200]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:09.200]  Here we go, folks.
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:10.200]  Have you seen it?
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:14.400]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news.
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:16.520]  Time for wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:20.040]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland
[1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:21.040]  security?
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:22.640]  Are sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets?
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:26.920]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[1:53:26.920 --> 1:53:29.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:35.600]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:37.920]  against the so-called rebels.
[1:53:37.920 --> 1:53:41.360]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:46.960]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:50.160]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:53.120]  Visit infowarsnews.com today.
[1:53:53.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:27.720]  When answers will show to we, we're the info war and I'm your host Alex Jim.
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:29.120]  This is the Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:35.560]  We're going to go right to your calls in the next segment, part of the next, then we'll
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:40.760]  get more into the incredible resources of North America locked up by the globalist to
[1:54:40.760 --> 1:54:44.640]  make all the other minerals and things around the world that they are mining in Africa and
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:47.720]  Australia worth even more.
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:51.440]  And why strategically are the globalists trying to keep the United States suppressed?
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:54.000]  There is undoubtedly going on.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:00.080]  But Kerry and Jim's first and Chad and Sue and Chris will get to all of you coming up
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.720]  and your different topics, wildcard topics to take Dr. Begich and other directions.
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:09.600]  But the five, six minutes we've got left in this segment, what are the big future trends?
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.840]  Positive, negative, where do you see the establishment at right now and their worldview?
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:16.040]  What do you expect to unfold?
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:19.960]  I think this idea of a mind effect certainly is a big one.
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:24.640]  We have the worldwide internet, which we talked about in the last segment, but they're actually
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:30.400]  predicting in a PBS special was the worldwide mind where every human mind was connected
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:33.240]  in the same way the internet is connected today.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:39.440]  Now fundamentally, I think we already are connected in some in one sense, but I don't
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:45.000]  think we need government or private sector connecting all the brains in the world and
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:46.560]  hacking them.
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:50.960]  The idea of creating synthetic memory, the idea of networking all the minds in the world,
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:56.040]  this is a trend that I think we need to very carefully look at and I think resists.
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.000]  I think the fact of the matter are there are some places that even though we can go there,
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:01.560]  we should not go there.
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  And this is one of them.
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:10.800]  The idea of trampling over free will, trampling over the mind and using mental disorders,
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.680]  traumatic stress syndrome, these kinds of things as the vehicle for doing that is fundamentally
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:16.680]  flawed.
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:21.280]  And it's again, it's a Trojan horse that enters our mind, a Trojan horse that we need
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.080]  to really recognize.
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:28.120]  And I don't think it needs to be an initiative that we should be spending a lot of time and
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  effort on.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:33.560]  I mean, figuring out how to protect people from these kinds of technologies is more fundamental
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:36.160]  as we're not the only country in the world developing.
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.160]  Exactly.
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:43.040]  They already six, seven years ago put passive MRI scanners in airports to, quote, scan brains.
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:45.240]  So this is way down the line.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:46.840]  They're just doing it.
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:51.960]  And how dare you, doctor, be so extreme as to say we shouldn't all have brain taps.
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:55.120]  Of course, the government needs to read our minds.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  That's freedom.
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.520]  You know, you know, I think we need the opposite.
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.640]  I think we need cameras in every government office to see what's going on.
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:07.600]  I think we need microphones in every government office to know what's going on because these
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:10.200]  people work for us.
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:12.520]  They think we work for them.
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:14.540]  This thing is upside down.
[1:57:14.540 --> 1:57:19.200]  You want to get accountability in classrooms, stick a camera in every classroom and give
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:23.240]  every parent the code to see what their teacher is doing every day.
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:25.880]  You want to see responsive government.
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:30.520]  Let's look at them, turn the cameras the other direction.
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:32.400]  That's what we need in the United States.
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:33.880]  That's what we need in the world.
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:35.640]  We need whistleblower mechanisms.
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:40.480]  We need ways to get the truth out and for it to be credibly dealt with.
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:45.040]  And you know, your show has been one of the few voices in America over all these years
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:50.920]  that have been able to do that and be consistently correct because time proves all.
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:54.280]  You know, we've been in this a long time, you and I, and a lot of others.
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.720]  And we're still standing because the facts speak for themselves.
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:02.400]  And what you report, what I report, is based on that evidence.
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:06.600]  I mean, the stuff we're talking about today, much of it was in the book, Controlling the
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:09.720]  Human Mind, that you carry there at that info wars.
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:15.440]  You know, this book is 250 source documents, most of it government and academic reports
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:20.320]  showing the dark and the bright side of this technology, but it's up to us as individuals
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:24.600]  to take and maintain control of our minds and our information.
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:29.320]  You know, the internet, internet providers think that they own the information.
[1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:30.320]  This is upside down.
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:31.320]  Oh, yeah.
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:33.320]  They're the real NSA.
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:34.320]  Back in 60 seconds.
[1:58:34.320 --> 1:58:37.320]  It's about our information, about our lives.
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:38.320]  It is.
[1:58:38.320 --> 1:58:39.320]  Stay there, doc.
[1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:40.320]  Back in 60 seconds.
[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:41.320]  Great point.
[1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:42.320]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:43.320]  Third hour.
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:50.280]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:55.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:58.040]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[1:58:58.040 --> 1:59:03.640]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:05.600]  It all comes down to one thing.
[1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:07.200]  We are what we eat.
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:11.880]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:16.120]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:18.680]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:23.560]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:24.880]  desperately needs.

[1:59:53.360 --> 2:00:05.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.120]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:21.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:25.880]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:30.880]  In the third hour, this is a short five-minute segment, an 18-minute segment, and a six-minute
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:31.880]  segment.
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:37.080]  We're going to your calls right now for Dr. Nick Baggitch.
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:38.800]  You guys all have questions and comments.
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:39.800]  He can comment on them.
[2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:42.080]  Jim in Maryland.
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:45.840]  You want to talk about the fact you're trying to get rid of our borders and then use the
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:49.880]  groups, I guess, as a political voting bloc, but I want to get Baggitch's take on that.
[2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:50.880]  Go ahead and make your point.
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:51.880]  Yeah.
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:53.520]  Hey, I just want to say something, Alex.
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:55.880]  So this country, you're done.
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:01:00.360]  The thing I don't understand is I grew up in this country, and you couldn't go to Japan
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:01.360]  and become Japanese.
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:05.920]  You couldn't go to China and be Chinese, but you can come to America and become an American.
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:07.760]  And all these people, we'll go back to what C.L.
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:10.280]  Bryant said about, you know, give somebody their comfort.
[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:12.600]  They don't want freedom, they want their comfort.
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:16.440]  And they're taking all these things from us, not letting Alaska use the resources there
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:18.440]  or the oils or whatever in this country.
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:23.040]  Why aren't we not back harder on these people?
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  Dr. Baggitch?
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:25.040]  Yeah.
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:31.120]  You know, this idea of no borders, you know, the fact is the cultures of the world are
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.280]  too different to erase borders.
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:40.000]  You know, we've got a couple hundred years to go before people are really on the same
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  page.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.320]  I just don't see that as a practical solution to anything.
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:48.400]  In fact, if you really, it's easy for someone to come in comparably into the United States,
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.360]  go look into what it takes to give up your U.S. citizenship, you know, if you ever wanted
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:53.440]  to do it.
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:55.680]  You can't without the government's permission.
[2:01:55.680 --> 2:01:59.120]  And now they're saying they'll still take your after-tax money, even if you do.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  They're kind of saying you can't.
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:07.160]  20% on your way out the door in capital gains of everything you loan, they will not let
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:10.200]  you leave for tax reasons, only for political reasons.
[2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:14.280]  And that way they can deny you entry in the future for those very political reasons that
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:17.440]  might cause you to rethink your citizenship.
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:22.920]  The fact is it's not, you know, the U.S. owns us in that sense.
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:23.920]  We're not.
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:28.360]  No, that's what I was saying in the last hour, is that I don't even, our family ranch, we
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.360]  don't really own that.
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:31.360]  No.
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  No.
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:36.360]  I have some property outside of tax jurisdictions here in Alaska.
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:39.200]  In fact, outside of our organized boroughs.
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:43.040]  So it's property I really own, you know, because I'm not taxed under every year.
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:44.640]  Well, that's so rare.
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:49.520]  It is so rare in Alaska is one of the few places where there are still unorganized regions
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:52.200]  of the state where you can actually achieve that.
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:57.280]  You know, and otherwise you're really just on the lifetime payment plan, because when
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:03:00.600]  you're done paying the bank, you're still paying the government for land that you're
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:01.600]  theoretically owned.
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:07.160]  And then they can raise the property tax where you can't pay it, it's so sick, caller great
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:08.160]  points.
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:09.160]  Thanks for holding.
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:10.360]  Carrie and Indiana, you're on the air.
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:11.360]  Go ahead.
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:12.360]  Thank you.
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:13.360]  Alex.
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:14.360]  Hey.
[2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:17.760]  I've been trying to reach you for about a year.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:19.520]  I've sent you about a hundred emails.
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:26.840]  Well, brother, you're on the air right now.
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:29.560]  This seems to always happen when somebody says they've been waiting a long time.
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:31.840]  I automatically know they're not going to talk.
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:32.840]  Sir, do you have something to say?
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:33.840]  Here, I'm here.
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:34.840]  Go ahead.
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:39.880]  You can look back through the emails, okay?
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:47.000]  We are all moving right now through a magnetic field and leaving a trail, a traceable trail,
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.360]  and have been for at least the last thousand years.
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:51.360]  I know that sounds wild.
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:52.360]  It sounds crazy.
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:55.760]  Well, no, no, no, I mean, you're talking to the guy that can answer that.
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.080]  I had, you know, a big former bank capital analyst on.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:03.440]  He said sunspots are what control economic cycles, because like the moon, it affects
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:04.440]  the brain.
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:06.560]  I'll hold you over as you can finish your comment caller.
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.320]  You say you've been waiting for years to get this out, but just say it.
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:12.320]  You don't have to like, people always call it and want to be screened on air.
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:15.640]  But what do you think about this talk of this magnetic field in the galaxy?
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:17.600]  Is that true?
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:22.440]  You have tremendous impact by these fields that are usually pretty subtle.
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:27.480]  I mean, the word lunatic comes from the lunar cycle, which was observed, you know, hundreds
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:32.240]  of years ago, because at the full moon, people recognize there was a change in behaviors.
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:38.560]  When you look at the sunspot cycle, it correlates to the economic cycles, it correlates to wars.
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:42.400]  It also correlates to major economic swings.
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:43.840]  That's what Harry Dent was saying.
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:44.840]  Yeah.
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:45.840]  And that's absolutely true.
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:48.640]  I mean, you can look historically at the record and you can make the correlations are
[2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:49.960]  really easy to make.
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:53.960]  The same thing is true when you look at global warming.
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:58.200]  It's actually, if you look at the sunspot cycle, it's parallel.
[2:04:58.200 --> 2:04:59.200]  Stay there, sir.
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:00.200]  I'm going to come back.
[2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:01.200]  I want you to finish.
[2:05:01.200 --> 2:05:05.800]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:09.880]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:13.960]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:18.360]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:20.360]  toxic chemicals within their homes.
[2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:23.760]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:27.760]  All over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:31.240]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:32.240]  to as well.
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:36.400]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:41.600]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  against.
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:46.680]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[2:05:46.680 --> 2:05:51.080]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:53.200]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:06:00.280]  All available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533-139.
[2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:03.720]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[2:06:03.720 --> 2:06:06.160]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:11.280]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:14.840]  other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:19.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:26.520]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful
[2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:31.480]  organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:37.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.360]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:44.800]  Super male vitality by Info Wars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:45.800]  dose.
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.880]  At a limited time, we are offering 15% of super male vitality at infowarslife.com to
[2:06:51.880 --> 2:06:54.320]  introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:07:00.240]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality at infowarslife.com.
[2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:04.280]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:09.400]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:13.440]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:17.800]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:23.120]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:29.520]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:34.040]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[2:07:34.040 --> 2:07:36.760]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:41.080]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:43.800]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:48.480]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:51.600]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:56.360]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[2:07:56.360 --> 2:08:12.040]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:27.840]  We are listening to an infowars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:31.800]  Okay if you just joined us, we're taking calls, wildcard calls, there's some different
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:35.960]  issues from Sue and Chad and Chris and Kerry and that's it for the calls.
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:41.960]  We're talking about some more solutions, a really important solution that's very
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:47.560]  verifiable to absolutely make the United States but also the rest of the world incredibly
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:49.060]  wealthy.
[2:08:49.060 --> 2:08:52.680]  So that's coming up, dealing with energy in just a few minutes after these calls with
[2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:58.280]  Dr. Nick Begich, a scientist, best-selling author, one of the main land experts up in
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:01.720]  Alaska and consults with native tribes all over the United States, his brother obviously
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:06.720]  U.S. under his dad, a famous congressman who got a lot of reforms in for Native Americans
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:08.920]  in Alaska but also in other areas.
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:14.800]  And he joins us right now but the caller said, Alex, I'm trying to hold you for a year and
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:16.760]  people just joined us, I'm recapping it.
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:20.600]  It's the magnetic waves we're going through in space the last thousand years, it's different.
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:27.320]  He didn't finish his point, he just kept pausing and I said no, we had Harry Denon, top analyst
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:32.120]  saying that sunspot cycles with war's economy, we're going out of one of the peaks right
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:36.120]  now, it's supposed to bring us down, we got the chart on screen for TV viewers and Begich
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:37.800]  is like, well of course that's a big part of it.
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:44.160]  This is known by police departments, the lunar cycle, it's just known by hospitals, it's
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:50.160]  a reality because you know the moon changes the tides, changes hormones, really affects
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.400]  women more in some studies I've seen.
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:57.320]  So finishing up with that, caller, what is your point though or a specific question for
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:02.480]  Begich because he's a perfect guest to have on with the question, what specifically are
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:05.560]  you talking about an ion field?
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:07.920]  What are you getting at sir?
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:15.920]  Okay, in short, we are all moving through a magnetic field on an atom by atom basis.
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:20.640]  It's not wrapping around the earth, we're moving through it point by point, atom by
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:26.920]  by atom and we have been for a thousand years and with the right software and the right
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:32.800]  equipment, you can go back and you can see what really happened and hear what really
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:33.800]  happened.
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:38.360]  That's what I'm saying, that's why I'm writing you, that's why I definitely didn't want to
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:43.160]  talk to you online, I'm scared to death, but I'm telling you that.
[2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:48.160]  I mean what are you an electro, I mean you're some type of electrical engineer or physicist
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:53.920]  because that's the argument is that you can hear echoes of everything throughout time
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:11:01.320]  and space and read energy fields like electric currents that have already passed through
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:07.480]  or radio telescopes, I mean are you specifically working say for DARPA in research of this
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:11.080]  because I know they're looking at that or are you theoretically coming up with this
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:14.400]  in your mind and it's so exciting that you're freaking out?
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.160]  No, it explains everything, it explains everything.
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:22.800]  I asked you sir, are you a scientist specifically that has equations or tests showing what you're
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:23.800]  saying?
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.080]  I will send me some information, I appreciate your call.
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:35.720]  Dr. Nick Beggis, that's an interesting topic he brought up and so bring it up to speed
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:38.200]  with what you know.
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:42.760]  This whole idea of being able to go back and read energy fields, I think that is an area
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:48.400]  that's certainly expanding in research and people's interest, you think about how information
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:53.640]  is transmitted through wireless and reconfigured in television sets as an example.
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:12:00.800]  The idea of capturing that information long after it's passed, yeah absolutely, I would
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:04.360]  disagree with the caller in this sense, it's not a thousand years, it's for eternity.
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:11.160]  We are in an electromagnetic soup produced by all kinds of natural and now man-made phenomena.
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:16.440]  Radio frequency energy alone is 200 million times more now in the last 100 years because
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:21.960]  of what man's introduced on the planet earth versus what nature normally was making available
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:23.000]  to us.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:27.760]  But the difference between nature and man is man can create a situation where they can
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:32.400]  direct and control that information which gets back to that earlier subject of manipulating
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:35.360]  the human brain and human mind and human emotions.
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:38.920]  This is where the science is going and this is a very dangerous area.
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:46.560]  Exactly, if sunspots control wars and irrational exuberance and everything and increase them,
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:49.200]  then imagine what artificial systems are doing.
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:54.120]  Oh yeah, and this idea of the cell phone towers or any other electromagnetic system
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:12:57.120]  being used is extremely well known.
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:03.120]  We've been reporting on it since the first major articles, the one the mind has no firewalls,
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:06.160]  1998 perimeters, US Army War College.
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:10.600]  Great document, everything in it is proving itself out, it's taken from an earlier Russian
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:11.600]  report.
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:18.080]  I know one of the best, in fact, the top biophysicist in Russia, Alex Kaverrainen and
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.560]  his ideas on this perfectly correlate with what the caller is suggesting in the sense
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:30.240]  that we can manipulate human beings through electromagnetic field.
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:32.160]  We just lost his Skype.
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:34.960]  Adam's molecules and eventually body.
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:41.160]  All right, your Skype came back in and again, none of this technology is bad enough itself,
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:44.960]  but it's that the technocrats are clearly anti-human.
[2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:50.600]  When I look at federalization, globalization of curriculum, and they literally teach two
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:57.920]  plus two equals five, that is an attempt to really screw kids up and to make them dysfunctional.
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:01.120]  And for me, that's really a real benchmark.
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:05.620]  It shows that the ruling elite are really bad people.
[2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:09.800]  And there's a mix of good people in the system as well, but the higher up you get, the more
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:14.320]  psychopathic, kleptocratic, disconnected from humanity they are.
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:16.640]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:17.640]  I agree 100%.
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:22.600]  I mean, the thing is, is we don't need to teach kids what to think.
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:27.720]  We need to teach them how to think, math, reading, basic skills, and then give them
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:33.680]  the tools to use their mind independent of the propaganda being packed in it and organized
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:35.800]  curriculum from around the country.
[2:14:35.800 --> 2:14:36.800]  Exactly.
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:37.800]  I look at textbooks now.
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:40.800]  They are designed to not work and screw people up.
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:43.520]  And then it turns out we have the documents that that's on purpose.
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:47.320]  That type of elite wants to screw people up.
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:49.720]  People who want factory work and slaves.
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:53.880]  People who want people to lay down in the street and give up.
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.440]  People who don't want us to think for ourselves.
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:00.160]  You know, that's the whole essence of what we are as human beings.
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:04.720]  We are independent souls created in the image of a creator.
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:06.160]  That means a lot.
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:11.520]  That means every one of us has incredible potency as individuals when we activate the
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.000]  mind to be controlled by ourselves.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.920]  This is the essence that they resist the most.
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:21.520]  All the mind control work that the government did, the thing they found out that scared
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:26.440]  the heck out of them is when they realized that every single human being had this innate
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:27.680]  potential.
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:33.120]  And the way to suppress that potential is to keep people in an environment of fear, confusion,
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:34.120]  and worry.
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  And feeling weak.
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:36.360]  Feeling hopeless.
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:37.360]  And insecure.
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:38.360]  That's what Madison Avenue does.
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:42.880]  I had Bruce Fine, top constitutional lawyer, former head lawyer for the FCC on who got
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:44.520]  rid of the fairness doctrine.
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:48.080]  And he said, look Alex, what you've got to understand is when they attack us, and I've
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:54.080]  always known this, but when they try to suppress us, that causes innovation.
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:59.640]  And I was realizing the enemy attacking us and doing this mind control, that's what my
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.280]  dad has always said, but it's only clicking now how right these men are that are older
[2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:06.600]  than me, that it's going to go in ways they don't know.
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:08.480]  It's going to trigger us to be even greater.
[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:12.080]  Now for the general public, it's going to annihilate them and hurt a lot of people, and
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:13.280]  we don't like that.
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:19.600]  But for some of us, it's going to trigger the type of historical, physical, but also
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:24.200]  cultural mutations that the establishment's not going to be able to deal with.
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:26.320]  Oh, that's exactly it.
[2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:31.360]  We did a mind effects close conference on this in Dallas some years ago with the best
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:32.360]  in the world.
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:37.240]  And what they said is we are on the edge of the next evolution of the human mind, where
[2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:42.200]  we're going to have these anomalous capabilities and the elite, the new world order, they are
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:45.000]  not going to be able to touch us.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  That's coming.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.560]  That's the real revolution, and that's what they're fighting against.
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:52.680]  That's what mind control is really about, is shutting down our capacity to reach our
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:53.680]  higher capacities.
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:57.640]  Well, I've interviewed General Stubble behind the head of men who stare at goats, they made
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.200]  a joke out of it.
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:03.680]  But on record, what's been declassified is the problem was they would boost all these
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:07.200]  people and get them to this higher level, and then they automatically wanted to fight
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:08.200]  the system.
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:09.200]  I mean, that's the issue.
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:12.800]  You boost somebody like they're going to boost their own people to fight us.
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:17.120]  Once they boost them, they're going to be at our level or higher and be more human and
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:19.160]  not want to hurt people.
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:20.160]  That's exactly right.
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.280]  And I think this is, again, when you start to look at these programs now, drifting towards
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:25.680]  how do you wipe out memory?
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:28.800]  How do you really start to refine what the feed is?
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:30.280]  And that's really what's going on.
[2:17:30.280 --> 2:17:32.240]  It's a control of the feed.
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:37.160]  And to try and suppress these higher-ordered capacities at the same time as exploit them.
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:39.800]  And that's the challenge for DARPA.
[2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:45.200]  And it's really, we need to let go of fear and worry, be confident human beings, recognize
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:46.200]  what we are.
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:47.800]  We live eternally.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:50.080]  This is a stop between short interviews.
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:54.840]  We need to move forward as sovereign individuals, doing the things that we believe are right
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:17:57.600]  and true to the extent that we each individually can.
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:17:59.320]  That's what changes the world.
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:01.360]  That's why talk radio is powerful.
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.880]  It reminds us that we are not in this alone.
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:06.240]  We are in this together.
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:07.240]  We can make a difference.
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:08.240]  Well, powerful interview.
[2:18:08.240 --> 2:18:09.240]  Amazing.
[2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:10.240]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:12.080]  It's so important.
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:18.520]  We have this clip of this physicist, Snead, and a seed.
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:19.520]  And what's his full name?
[2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:20.520]  I forget it.
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:21.520]  That's right.
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:22.520]  Richard Sead.
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:24.920]  And this was on the Discovery Channel.
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:28.320]  And this is the attitude of Ray Kurzweil and so many others.
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:31.400]  And they're really smart men, and I admire much of their work and their inventions.
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:38.480]  But the compendium of the futurists they put on TV that they make the head of Google technology
[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:42.000]  and future programs, they have this attitude that you're not even people.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  We're going to become gods.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  We're going to brush you aside.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:49.880]  Well, I don't think they're ever going to become even superhuman or advance to the next
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:52.720]  level while having an attitude of shutting off other people.
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:57.080]  I mean, you reap what you sow, it's a universal law, karma, whatever you want to call it.
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:03.240]  I don't know how these guys are so smart, then they have this real anti-human attitude
[2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:05.760]  of me, me, me, mine, mine, mine.
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:07.360]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:14.880]  We are going to become gods, period, if you don't like it, get off.
[2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:15.880]  You don't have to contribute.
[2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:16.880]  You don't have to participate.
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:26.320]  And if you're going to interfere with me becoming God, I'm going to have big trouble,
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:29.520]  then we'll have warfare.
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:30.520]  So there's the attitude.
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:31.840]  They've seized the future.
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:33.160]  They're deciding what to do.
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:34.800]  We don't even count.
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:36.680]  That's the end of my free will.
[2:19:36.680 --> 2:19:41.280]  Don't they know that that is at a fundamental level, a universal crime in the universe?
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:46.440]  You know, I think there's, ego is so big on the part of some of these players.
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:50.080]  And that's what I see as I meet many, many people in leadership.
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:53.720]  They either have a very humble heart or just the opposite.
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:59.320]  And you know, I think eventually this all catches up, and I think we're in that phase
[2:19:59.320 --> 2:20:00.320]  of history.
[2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:04.840]  You know, there's a lot of unrest in the country right now, in the world right now.
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:07.960]  That's actually feeding, I think, the changes that are coming too.
[2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:15.960]  And the necessity of another jump in human thinking and our ability to think is certainly
[2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:16.960]  fair.
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:19.560]  I mean, consider what we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis.
[2:20:19.560 --> 2:20:23.120]  As human beings, it's the inevitable next step.
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:27.640]  I think we're going to open the door to a lot of possibilities in the course of this,
[2:20:27.640 --> 2:20:29.520]  but it's going to be a rough road.
[2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:34.400]  These elitists that think it belongs to them, that's been the problem for at least a couple
[2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:39.880]  thousand years, suppressing the population so that we don't recognize what we truly
[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:40.880]  are.
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:47.760]  If we could just recognize and remember the gifts that we have within us and believe that
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:52.440]  we can manifest those gifts that come, and I believe that technology will lay the blueprint
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:56.680]  where our belief systems will change and we'll see these things naturally manifest in the
[2:20:56.680 --> 2:20:58.720]  minds of man.
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:02.840]  And instead of trying to suppress the general population where there's guaranteed individuals
[2:21:02.840 --> 2:21:07.560]  that would take us to the next level, I mean, the elite should see the entire population
[2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:12.120]  as a treasure trove instead of a detriment, and then the self-fulfilling prophecy that
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:16.760]  we're junk, they program us with junk so they can point at us and say, see, we're better
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:17.760]  than them.
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:18.760]  That's not elitist.
[2:21:18.760 --> 2:21:22.480]  That's not what a real elite would think.
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:23.960]  It just makes no sense.
[2:21:23.960 --> 2:21:31.440]  Well, again, as they fail to recognize the value of each human being, some countries
[2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:36.320]  don't put any value on humankind, and what we're seeing is more and more of that drifting
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:42.880]  into Western governments to the point where we're just numbers on a tax record.
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:48.120]  You know, we're chattel on so many levels, but that is not who we are.
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:49.760]  We are way more than that.
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:55.200]  We are powerful individuals capable of creating change within our neighborhoods and our communities.
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:21:56.480]  Do what you can.
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:21:59.560]  Don't take on some impossible task as individuals.
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:03.320]  Take on the one that you absolutely know you can do, whether it's these issues or other
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:05.840]  issues, and that's how change happens.
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:11.160]  Through people's feet to the fire, confront the issues, provide the information.
[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:17.080]  That's the only way we're going to see the mindset change from this defeatist attitude.
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:22.560]  We need to rise up out of the ashes of our apathy, claim our birthright, and change the
[2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:23.560]  world.
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:25.040]  That's what we're each called to do.
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:29.520]  That's what we're here to do, and we can do it in every way and every which way with
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:32.360]  every small and large thing that each of us engage in.
[2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:33.920]  We don't have to wait for a group to form.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:37.280]  That's right, and if you read the three or four books written by Brzezinski on this,
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:41.520]  who is one of the top global strategists, he's in the top five that we know of, that's
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:46.520]  all they talk about openly knowing the public doesn't read their books is, the human potential
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:47.520]  is too powerful.
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:50.720]  They're going to take over, and then we won't control the future and the life extension
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:51.720]  technologies.
[2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:53.720]  Hurry, let's dumb them all down.
[2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:58.840]  Obviously, these are not the people to lead us, that they would act like this.
[2:22:58.840 --> 2:22:59.840]  Absolutely.
[2:22:59.840 --> 2:23:02.560]  And again, good leaders keep getting taken out.
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:07.680]  They either die in plane crashes, they get taken out in political scandal.
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:09.360]  This is the way it's done.
[2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:12.880]  You either play ball, or they try and bury you.
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:14.200]  This is the way it happens.
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:18.200]  Here in Alaska, they're going to spend probably $20 million on a Senate race.
[2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:22.640]  There's only a couple hundred thousand votes that are going to decide that race here.
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:27.120]  There's only 700,000 people even live in this state, but they're going to spend $20 million.
[2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:28.360]  You know where that money's coming from?
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:32.960]  It's not coming from citizens who live here, it's coming from big multinational special
[2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:35.080]  interests that want to drive the truck.
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:37.040]  They don't want to control politics.
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:38.360]  They want to own senators.
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:39.600]  They want to own representatives.
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:43.120]  They want to own this country and own the very soul of the nation.
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:45.160]  That's what needs to be stripped away.
[2:23:45.160 --> 2:23:46.800]  Don't listen to the media ads.
[2:23:46.800 --> 2:23:48.440]  Don't listen to the garbage.
[2:23:48.440 --> 2:23:50.080]  Dig into who these people are.
[2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:54.240]  Make your decisions based on real records and the things that are important to you.
[2:23:54.240 --> 2:23:58.520]  Whether you support the R's or the D's or the independents, find at least people that
[2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:01.720]  you can believe in and do something for them.
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:06.360]  That's the only way anything ever changes, and then hope they rotate out before they
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:12.120]  get corrupted because unfortunately over time, that's inevitable with so many politicians.
[2:24:12.120 --> 2:24:16.440]  They value the power more than they value the opportunity to serve.
[2:24:16.440 --> 2:24:21.840]  Well, and the elite know how to scare you slowly, and then basically you get support
[2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:25.680]  and safety from joining one of the combines.
[2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:27.800]  That's what's happening on so many levels.
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:28.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:30.960]  Let's go ahead and go to Chad in Tennessee.
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:31.960]  Thanks for holding.
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:34.160]  You're on the air with Dr. Nick Baggich of EarthPulse.com.
[2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:35.160]  Hey, Alex.
[2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:36.160]  How are you doing today?
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:37.160]  Good.
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:38.160]  Thank you for calling.
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:39.160]  Good.
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:40.160]  Hey, yes.
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:41.160]  First, I'm called.
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:43.160]  I've been with you for about six months now, and I tell you what, I've enjoyed every episode
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:49.600]  that you put out, and I want to thank you and the other patriots that do what you do.
[2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:54.920]  And, you know, it's a shame I posted a comment on Facebook a couple of weeks ago about how
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:25:00.600]  the United States has fallen under tyranny once again, you know, after almost 200 and
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:01.600]  some odd years ago.
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:03.600]  And I got called a fool for this.
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:06.960]  Well, there's a lot of weak-minded people that are scared, so they just said that to
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:07.960]  make them feel big.
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:11.760]  They also have on record bots that respond now.
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:16.080]  They already have the CIA, already has major publications writing fake news with computers.
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:19.120]  So, sir, don't listen, don't even listen to the bots.
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.440]  They're getting rid of comments on most big news sites, because usually the comments are
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:24.440]  pro-liberty.
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:28.280]  So, they're trying to create a synthetic, artificial group think.
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:30.760]  Dr. Beggart, do you want to comment on that?
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:32.280]  That's exactly it.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:34.680]  You know, it, again, is about manipulation.
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:40.520]  So, you know, screening out and controlling the dialogue is what all that is about.
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:44.120]  I mean, it's the whole nature of our society right now.
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:47.800]  It's control the dialogue, control the debate, control the discussion.
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:52.120]  And every way that technology can support that, that's what's happening.
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:56.520]  The idea that people are giving up their private information through Internet, through all
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:00.600]  the electronic forms of information, that's our digital doorway.
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:02.520]  That's a doorway to our home.
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:04.600]  That's what should be protected.
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:07.040]  We should own all of that information, not private industry.
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:11.200]  Yeah, I'm thinking we're going to start going to people's doors and not going to go on.
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:13.200]  Mind if we come in and put cameras in your bathroom and watch you?
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:14.440]  They're going to, like, get off my porch.
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:15.960]  We're going to say, hey, we apologize.
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:20.160]  It's for TV to illustrate that the NSA and corporations are watching everything you do.
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:23.240]  Why are you mad at me but not them when I'm being honest?
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:24.240]  Right.
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:25.240]  That's exactly right.
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:28.720]  And I wouldn't, I would not, you know, I mean, I've taken a lot of criticism, believe
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:30.560]  me, and I know Alex has too.
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:34.480]  You know, the fact is we all take a lot of criticism when you're doing what you believe
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:40.000]  in, do it with respectfully, do it kindly, do it with an honest heart.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.400]  And if you're wrong somewhere along the line, admit it and move on.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:47.160]  Don't be humble, but, but exactly don't you get empowered actually when the establishment
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:48.160]  attacks you.
[2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:49.160]  It means you're doing good.
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:52.680]  I mean, when you know you're doing the right thing, people need to stop worrying about
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:53.680]  it.
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:55.320]  You know, getting made fun of or attacked.
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:56.680]  That's what life's all about.
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:26:59.960]  Hey, you know, it's, it's, you know, being raised in a political family, get pretty
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:00.960]  thick skin.
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:06.840]  I could care less what they say if I'm speaking my truth and all of us can do the same.
[2:27:06.840 --> 2:27:07.840]  Don't be in fear.
[2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:08.840]  That's where they want you.
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:10.520]  That's when everything shuts down.
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:15.600]  Know what you are, who you are and take that forward into the world around you.
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:20.360]  Your sphere of influence, maybe your friends, maybe your family, maybe bigger than that.
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  Exercise it.
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:22.360]  Do something.
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:23.680]  All of us are doing a little bit.
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:25.040]  It adds up in the long run.
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:29.000]  You know, this, the country is not lost or we would, we wouldn't be doing this.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  I would give it up.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Listen, I'm just some average guy from Texas and I've had a big effect and, and I've got
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.320]  my problems, but I'm real.
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:38.320]  So it's had an effect.
[2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:41.800]  I know you got to go soon, I'm going to come back and do five minutes on the big resource
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:46.720]  issue and, and really how to supercharge this country and the world just using Alaska by
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:49.760]  itself on record as the model with Dr. Nick baggage.
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:51.000]  We got two minutes to break though.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:52.600]  Let's jam in a few more calls.
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:55.000]  Chris and Nevada, you're on the air with Dr. Nick baggage.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  Go ahead.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  Go ahead.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  Okay.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  Chris is gone.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.040]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina.
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:04.360]  Jay, you're on the air.
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:05.360]  Go ahead.
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:06.360]  Good afternoon.
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:12.200]  Alex, Dr. I'm Jay Morrow from a great dogwood state in North Carolina.
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:17.560]  Try contacting you a couple of days ago by contact form.
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:21.800]  I want to touch on basically what the doctor was talking about as far as consciousness
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  being upgraded.
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.960]  I'm just going to hit it on the, on the head like a, you know, hit it on the head like
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:31.800]  a nail being hit with a hammer.
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:40.160]  Basically right now there exists some technology that has been used for, I say, the early 90s
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:49.560]  and it has basically been used to elevate those beneath the scenes behind closed doors.
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:55.520]  But now it's a point where it needs to be known that this technology exists that can
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:29:00.160]  reverse the DNA manipulation that the government and the powers that be have been.
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:03.360]  Well, I know there's a lot of suppressed technology, but there's also a lot of people
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:05.440]  out there claiming they have things that they don't.
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:09.920]  I'm not saying you're doing that, but specifically, what is this?
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:15.440]  Basically I have found myself to become a targeted individual after being discharged
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:21.920]  from the United States Navy 2011 with all types of harassment secret agents showing
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:22.920]  up.
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:24.240]  Oh, there's no doubt they're harassing veterans.
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:27.240]  I mean, that's in the news today up on info wars.com.
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:31.280]  I mean, they publicly admit that, so I'm going to come back and get Dr. Begich's take on
[2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:32.280]  that.
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:33.280]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:37.760]  And then we're going to get into some of the solutions just on a resource-based front.
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:38.760]  Okay.
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  With Dr. Nick Begich of earthpulse.com, his books and videos are all available at infowarstore.com
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:46.960]  or follow the links at infowars.com.
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:47.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:29:47.960 --> 2:29:48.960]  Stay with us.
[2:29:48.960 --> 2:29:49.960]  It's the live Friday edition.
[2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:51.200]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:53.640]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.640 --> 2:30:01.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:02.800]  In the near future.
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:10.040]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security, alert, this is homeland
[2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:14.440]  security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operation.
[2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:20.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.640]  Prime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:25.240]  This is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[2:30:25.240 --> 2:30:28.560]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars.
[2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:32.640]  I don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theory.
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:34.640]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:36.640]  They are never going to stop.
[2:30:36.640 --> 2:30:41.640]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[2:30:48.640 --> 2:30:49.640]  Imperatives.
[2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:56.640]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[2:30:56.640 --> 2:31:00.640]  Electrally it's begun, you can fail it.
[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:04.640]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:08.640]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:12.640]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:15.640]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:20.640]  Trends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:22.640]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:26.640]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:31.640]  Hue filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[2:31:31.640 --> 2:31:37.640]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:41.640]  It is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:45.640]  Our responsibility to protect our families, the establishment is not going to do it.
[2:31:45.640 --> 2:31:48.640]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water.

[2:32:03.640 --> 2:32:07.640]  The latest in preparedness is now here, an electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution
[2:32:07.640 --> 2:32:11.640]  that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:16.640]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:21.640]  The new info wars life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family
[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:26.640]  and it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:31.640]  The info wars life silver bullet silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2 ounce bottle
[2:32:31.640 --> 2:32:34.640]  and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:39.640]  This is not a low grade formula, we are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers
[2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:45.640]  in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[2:32:45.640 --> 2:32:49.640]  within a base of the ionized water for your preparedness storage.

[2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:14.640]  For those who can hear me I say do not despair.
[2:33:14.640 --> 2:33:18.640]  The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:21.640]  The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:25.640]  The hate of men will pass and dictators die
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:29.640]  and the power they took from the people will return to the people
[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:33.640]  and so long as men die liberty will never perish.
[2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:39.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:45.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:49.640]  There's a couple of articles that's from Charlie Chaplin's famous speech
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:53.640]  at the end of the dictator where he lampooned Adolf Hitler.
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:57.640]  Hitler reportedly had a hit put out on him but it didn't come to fruition.
[2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:02.640]  Leaked document reveals Marine Corps Urban Training Center based on U.S. town
[2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:04.640]  where they trained to take on the American people.
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:08.640]  Another article, police now armed for war against returning veterans.
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:12.640]  In fact I'm going to be covering that some on the Sunday show
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:19.640]  with our returning reporters, Sergeant Joe Biggs, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:23.640]  and David Knight who just got back from an Army training facility
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:25.640]  which looked like it was set up for torture.
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:27.640]  That's what Biggs had seen in Afghanistan.
[2:34:27.640 --> 2:34:29.640]  He would deliver people for torture.
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:31.640]  Really a serious hardcore issue.
[2:34:31.640 --> 2:34:34.640]  Obviously war turns people into countries into monsters.
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:39.640]  Dr. Begich, in closing here, spend about five minutes
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:43.640]  on what you tried to get into earlier about freeing up federal lands,
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:47.640]  freeing up lands for natives, freeing up lands for states.
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:51.640]  The amount of minerals alone that can be easily and cleanly
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:55.640]  from what I've seen extracted from Alaska but is not being allowed.
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:34:58.640]  A, why do you think it's being suppressed?
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:01.640]  And then B, break down what this could do for our country.
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:06.640]  And I know we'll get emails or comments by different alternative energy websites going,
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:09.640]  Alex, we thought you were for alternative energy and you're a horrible person.
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:11.640]  Look, they're not letting us get those systems.
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:12.640]  We're trying to develop them.
[2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:14.640]  We're trying to deploy them.
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:18.640]  Everything the government pushes is kind of a patch or an act like they're doing it
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:20.640]  to actually control the industry.
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.640]  But we are based on minerals.
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:26.640]  We are based on oil and gas and all these other things we have.
[2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:29.640]  And this could be a boom for our country.
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:31.640]  So talk about it as a leading expert.
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:36.640]  Well, first of all, we're not going to convert from oil based energy overnight.
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:38.640]  It's going to take decades.
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:40.640]  So these things are going to move forward.
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:44.640]  The United States has increased its oil and gas production dramatically
[2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:48.640]  from fracking and now it's going to be happening here in Alaska
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:51.640]  to the point where in a few years we're going to be a net exporter.
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:57.640]  Energy imports used to be about 50% of our trade deficit with the other half pretty much China.
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:02.640]  That's changing because of energy production locally within the U.S.
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:07.640]  But taking it from the minerals perspective, you know, Alaska has a project
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:11.640]  that's the Red Dog Mine, which is actually a native owned property
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:14.640]  and a joint venture of private industry.
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:17.640]  It produces 6% of the zinc concentrate in the world.
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.640]  We have one of the 10 top silver mines in Southeast Alaska.
[2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:24.640]  But we also have major finds of rare earth minerals,
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:28.640]  which are presently primarily controlled by the Chinese, but not in Alaska.
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:33.640]  We have resources that are being drilled out and found throughout Southeast Alaska
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:37.640]  and some of the interior locations that could make America free
[2:36:37.640 --> 2:36:42.640]  in terms of rare earth, something we absolutely need to maintain competitiveness globally.
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:46.640]  We have no railroad link to Alaska to the rest of the United States.
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:50.640]  So we could hook up to the Trans-Canadian Railroad
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.640]  and start moving these bulk commodities out of Alaska for value added in the United States.
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:00.640]  We need the railroad links established to get these minerals to market.
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:02.640]  We can't just use ports.
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:08.640]  We have some of the largest mining projects in the country coming online in the next 10 years up here.
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:10.640]  We have the Donlan Creek Mine.
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:17.640]  We have the biggest one was Pebble, which has recently been sort of slowed down dramatically.
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:21.640]  The American pulled out, that's a half a trillion dollar mine,
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:25.640]  and they still don't know the perimeters of it, and that's gold and molybdenum.
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:28.640]  Again, important minerals going forward.
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:32.640]  But Alaska has every strategic mineral in mineable quantities
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:37.640]  and strategically large quantities, world class sizes here in Alaska,
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:40.640]  and they are not being developed for lack of infrastructure.
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:43.640]  They're talking about, we need roads to the wilderness.
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:47.640]  We need roads to the mining areas, and we need infrastructure built
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:49.640]  in the same way that we built the Western United States.
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:53.640]  That kind of initiative would not only create domestic jobs,
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:56.640]  but actual jobs that result in private industry developments
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:00.640]  and the export of value added minerals.
[2:38:00.640 --> 2:38:03.640]  This is where we can gain our independence again.
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.640]  We have trillions and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas,
[2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:13.640]  not including the other forms of hydrocarbons, frozen methane on the North Slope.
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:16.640]  We have enough to run the country on energy.
[2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:20.640]  In coal alone, we have 51% of all the known resources in the United States
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:24.640]  and 25% of the world's coal resources.
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:30.640]  We have enough coal to run the energy needs of the U.S. for two millennium, 2,000 years.
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:33.640]  Let me stop you right there, because you're giving the solution.
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:37.640]  I've researched it. What you're seeing is all publicly available.
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:40.640]  Your brother's a U.S. senator. You've managed massive amounts of land there.
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:45.640]  Dad, a congressman, you know what you're talking about, but it's the same thing.
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:48.640]  America can't have jobs. We can't have factories.
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:51.640]  We can't even have service jobs.
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:55.640]  It's agenda 21, same thing in Western Europe and the U.S.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:57.640]  We're not allowed to develop.
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:00.640]  We're only allowed to have government or corporate institutional jobs
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.640]  to capture us and enslave us under the UNESCO treaty.
[2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:11.640]  My issue is, why does the elite want to shut down the United States and Western Europe?
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:16.640]  Why is the elite putting in policies where the West is committing suicide
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:18.640]  and not having children?
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:25.640]  Why does the elite themselves, pretty racist people, want to destroy the West?
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:27.640]  Well, I think there's really two reasons.
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:30.640]  One is the biggest money is being made in the developing world.
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.640]  I mean, think about a developed stock. It's selling at $100 and it jumps to $110.
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:39.640]  You make 10% on it. Think of a penny stock going from a penny to a dollar.
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:42.640]  That's the third world. That's where they want the money.
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:46.640]  So they want to shut down development here because they already totally have enslaved the third world.
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:51.640]  Right. And then if you look at it, they look at the U.S. mineral resource and base
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:55.640]  as a safety deposit box because they can leave this stuff undevelopable.
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:39:59.640]  They exploit everyone else in the world until they get thrown out or nationalized
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:03.640]  and then pull back into the United States and develop those resources
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:06.640]  at the point in which we're dumbed down and numbed down.
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:07.640]  And then they can continue to...
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:11.640]  I was told that by a high-level elitist. I've never heard that before except from you.
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:13.640]  Were you given that from your high-level sources?
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:16.640]  You know, that's the reality. I mean, just look at how it unfolds.
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:18.640]  Yeah, that's what everyone sees.
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:22.640]  If you really look at the bigger picture, it's just a shift in the market.
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:26.640]  They're going to go and exploit where they make the biggest margins
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:30.640]  and the least regulations where they can corrupt government that's openly corrupt.
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:34.640]  I mean, every one of these governments, even our own government, think about it.
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:37.640]  We have a government that takes money around the world
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:40.640]  and pallets and plane loads to bribe people.
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.640]  It's well-known. Kidnap people, torture people, invade your mail, kick down your doors.
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:51.640]  You don't even know people like this unless you're listening to this broadcast in prison.
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:55.640]  You know, the fact of the matter is this is a criminal government
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:01.640]  and they've done everything that the elite wants to restrict us, restrain us, and keep us down
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:03.640]  because we can make the difference.
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:08.640]  We can make the difference in being the light that our founding fathers expected of us.
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:10.640]  Not to be a dominant force in the world,
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:14.640]  but to be a light where people want to emulate what we have here, what we do here
[2:41:14.640 --> 2:41:19.640]  in their own self-interest, not imposed upon them by some external force.
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:23.640]  They quantify this. One shipment was 12 billion, another 30 something million to Iraq
[2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:27.640]  and they use it not just to borrow from local officials, but to borrow from military
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:31.640]  where they would give a sergeant 100 grand or somebody else a million in general
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:36.640]  and then say, by the way, you stole that money, you better do what we say and ship these drugs back.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:42.640]  This is a corrupting. So instead of building something to rise in society that raises the whole society,
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.640]  if you're part of the criminal gang, you get ahead.
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:52.640]  And it creates dark ages, folks. We need to be going the opposite direction.
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:56.640]  Let me ask you this. Are we turning the tide?
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:42:00.640]  I know there's a big awakening. Is it enough? What does your gut tell you the timeline is?
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:03.640]  What's going to happen? You're probably one of the smartest guys in general knowledge.
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:05.640]  Dr. Begich, what do you see happening?
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:09.640]  I think the tide is rising. I don't think it takes 51%.
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:12.640]  The American Revolution started with 6% of the people.
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:17.640]  They say we're in favor of that when it began. And thank God there was that 6%.
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:23.640]  Today, with the ability to communicate globally, all of us, even in this broadcast right now,
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:29.640]  we can make a bigger difference if only 1% of us wake up and begin to act in what we believe to be right and true.
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:33.640]  It doesn't take a mass. It takes a few.
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:39.640]  There is way more engaged right now than is necessary to create the next revolution,
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:43.640]  the next evolution in human thinking. That's what's going on right now.
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:46.640]  The tide will turn. We're not going to give up the fight.
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:52.640]  There are too many of us in it for too long, and there's too many of us coming up and being from behind.
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:55.640]  And I think that's the fifth column is the fifth column of freedom.
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:43:02.640]  It's those of us that still engage this process and refuse to lay down in front of the tank and get run over.
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:04.640]  We're going to take control of those tanks again.
[2:43:04.640 --> 2:43:11.640]  We're going to take control of this country and all of our countries because corruption is what needs to be snuffed out.
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:18.640]  The elite needs to be recognized for who they are and what they are and recognized that the change has to come.
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:22.640]  And it is coming. I believe the tide is turning. Just keep in the fight.
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  Don't give up even in the worst circumstances.
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:30.640]  Those are the things that give us the scar tissue to continue and the strength to carry on.
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:35.640]  Well, that's right. Beautifully said. Again, we carry most of your books and videos.
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:38.640]  Those can also find them on your site, which I'll give people.
[2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:44.640]  Are you working on anything new? What do you focus on this day over at EarthPulse.com, Dr. Nick Baggage?
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:50.640]  Well, we're working on a few things. A few of our electronic devices are coming out in the next few years.
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:57.640]  We've got some really interesting things for mineral and vitamin deficiencies, diagnoses.
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:04.640]  We have some great things coming in the field of health, which is an area that I'm very interested in, because strong bodies, strong minds.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:07.640]  And I want to work with you on that. I want to work with you on that.
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:12.640]  You bet. In fact, I'm hoping to get down to Austin at some point and spend a little time with you personally.
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:15.640]  And I'm hoping to get down there sometime this fall.
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:18.640]  Come on down. You're welcome. We'll pay for your hotel, my friend.
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:23.640]  All right. Well, bottom line, look at Obama, a false messiah, but it doesn't work anymore.
[2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:28.640]  People wake up to these puppets faster and faster. And, you know, I can play into the public's dumbed down.
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:34.640]  Congress has as low as a 6% approval rating now. That's really got to worry the establishment.
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:38.640]  Oh, I think so too. You know, you're talking about the establishment.
[2:44:38.640 --> 2:44:41.640]  You know, I ought to leave on one point. It's a Federal Reserve.
[2:44:41.640 --> 2:44:45.640]  And, you know, my brother's the only Democrat that signed on to audit the Federal Reserve.
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:51.640]  And when Bernanke called him and screamed at him over it, he said, hey, you internally audit yourself all the time.
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:54.640]  What are you worried about? They're worried. People are looking.
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.640]  It's not just about what's happening in the open media. People are paying.
[2:44:59.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  By the way, it's great your brother did that. Tell folks.
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.640]  I remember seeing that briefly in the news. Give us the inside scoop on that Federal Reserve situation.
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:10.640]  Well, you know, he doesn't trust them for good reason. They're not trustworthy.
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:15.640]  There's 300 banks or a private organization. They haven't been externally audited.
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:17.640]  They need to be held accountable.
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:21.640]  They are jeopardizing everything in this country.
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:27.640]  And in an outside institution with no audit and over 100 years, it's time.
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:34.640]  It's time for review of what's going on. It's time for transparency both within the government and with these quasi-government.
[2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:38.640]  And your brother got yelled at by outgoing head Bernanke. I didn't know about that.
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:42.640]  Oh, it was a big one. I mean, he got into a big fight with Obama.
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:47.640]  Obama called him on the phone over gun rights. You know, Mark favors gun ownership.
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:50.640]  He doesn't believe we need any more laws to restrict gun ownership.
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:53.640]  He's one of the few Democrats that do before he ever ran.
[2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:58.640]  He told the Democratic leadership, you're wrong. You're wrong on development of Alaskan oil.
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:03.640]  You're wrong on gun control. You're wrong on net neutrality. You're flat wrong.
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:08.640]  And it takes a different view. You know, Mark votes more with Republicans than any other senator.
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:14.640]  And the reason he does is because sometimes everybody has to recognize the other guy is right.
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:20.640]  And even if you disagree with some of Mark's politics, the fact of the matter is he does what he believes in.
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:23.640]  He's willing to do the fight. He's willing to take it on.
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:29.640]  It's for veterans, which was the last caller. He's on the Veterans Affairs Committee holding their feet to the fire.
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:34.640]  And I can tell you, go look at the tapes of him and committees and you're going to see him all over those guys
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:42.640]  because veterans represent a major portion of our population and people who kept this country safe for the last 200 years.
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:46.640]  It's a different way of looking at politics. It's not all black and white.
[2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:52.640]  We need a politics that goes back to the fundamentals of recognizing that it's human beings we represent.
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:56.640]  It's the people we represent and we can disagree vehemently about how to get to the solutions,
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:01.640]  but we need real solutions by a more cooperative and responsive government.
[2:47:01.640 --> 2:47:06.640]  Absolutely. Thank you for all the time, Dr. Nick Baggage. Look forward to having you in studio as soon as you want to come.
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:11.640]  Thank you for having me and I just, God bless you, Alex, and bless your listening audience.
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:13.640]  You too. What a great guy. What a fabulous guy.
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:17.640]  I tell you, I read all that stuff in his books in the 90s and in the 2000s.
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:20.640]  You will learn more in those books now than has even come out.
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:24.640]  And it's just, it's insane the amount of stuff that's going on.
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:32.640]  The admitted documents on human manipulation to suppress us.
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:38.640]  I mean, I'm the type of guy, if I see a lady walking outside, an old lady or a man, whatever, they fall down and hurt themselves.
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:43.640]  I don't laugh at that. And then I'll be around somebody and somebody will fall down and get hurt and people laugh.
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:48.640]  And I look at that person, I go, man, you're really a jerk.
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:52.640]  I just don't get off on people failing.
[2:47:52.640 --> 2:47:56.640]  Now, what I don't like is strong people trying to suppress me.
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:00.640]  I like seeing thugs fall.
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:02.640]  But that's normal instincts, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:05.640]  And the globalists do not have our interest at heart.
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:12.640]  So anything they do is going to be bad.
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:14.640]  Makes me so angry.
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:21.640]  I talk about Warren Buffett constantly because he's the archetype of a guy that is the biggest recipient of U.S. taxpayer money alive.
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:22.640]  Individually.
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:23.640]  Look it up.
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:25.640]  McClassy newspaper is one of the sources.
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:30.640]  And then he's on TV every time I turn it on, lecturing on how taxes aren't high enough.
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:38.640]  When he's an economist and knows full well, you cut taxes and tax money increases going in.
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:41.640]  And that tax cuts is what would get this economy going.
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:43.640]  They don't want it to get going.
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:46.640]  They want to shut it down.
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:50.640]  I told the story going to my uncle's funeral.
[2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:53.640]  I stopped with my son.
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:57.640]  I didn't take my daughters at Lubies in Waco.
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:02.640]  It's the place I stopped many times going to see family in East Texas.
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:04.640]  And it was nothing but old women.
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:07.640]  It was age 65 to about 85 or 90.
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:10.640]  And it was a big line of these old women.
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:13.640]  It's all nothing but old women coming in there to eat lunch.
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:20.640]  I remember going to Lubies' cafeteria as I was a little kid in Dallas.
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:25.640]  And none of those women could buy hardly any food, even though it wasn't that expensive.
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:30.640]  And they were all upset and they were all trying to just live.
[2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:33.640]  It'd be one thing if we didn't have the resources that was going on,
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:36.640]  but the globalists have done that by screwing this economy over.
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:38.640]  And it's only the beginning of the poverty.
[2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:39.640]  And it made me mad.
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:46.640]  And I just know most of those old women watch TV and think Obama really wanted to get them free healthcare.
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:57.640]  I mean, it's the betrayal of weak people just really makes me feel angry.
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:00.640]  And maybe I was already emotional going to my uncle's funeral,
[2:50:00.640 --> 2:50:06.640]  but I just fundamentally got so upset.
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:11.640]  When I see cops pulling over some poor woman with three kids in the back, writing them tickets,
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:15.640]  the woman can't afford all the inspection and crap, the country going on.
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:16.640]  And I know they're going to write them tickets.
[2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:17.640]  It's going to ruin that woman's life.
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:19.640]  And she won't even have a car to get to work.
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:20.640]  And she'll go on welfare.
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:21.640]  And that's what they want.
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:22.640]  Not the cops.
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:24.640]  They're just there writing the ticket.
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:30.640]  It's just such an evil system.
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:32.640]  And I'm just not part of it.
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:37.640]  I got my own problems, but I'll tell you something right now.
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:39.640]  I'm not going to screw little people.
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:42.640]  It's never going to happen.
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:45.640]  It's the day I ever even think like that.
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:48.640]  It's the day that I don't need to be on the face of this planet.
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:51.640]  I don't enjoy hurting people.
[2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:53.640]  And our owners do.
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:50:55.640]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:00.640]  A couple phone calls and some key news straight ahead.

[2:51:29.640 --> 2:51:31.640]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric,
[2:51:31.640 --> 2:51:34.640]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:37.640]  and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest,
[2:51:37.640 --> 2:51:39.640]  forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[2:51:39.640 --> 2:51:41.640]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating
[2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:43.640]  a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:45.640]  to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[2:51:45.640 --> 2:51:47.640]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book

[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:29.640]  And we need your support. I have the best supplements out there.
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:32.640]  They've blown my socks off. You've heard the Ray reviews,
[2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:36.640]  the Super Mill Vitality, the fluoride shield, the survival shield,
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:39.640]  the lung cleanse, all of it in FallWarsLife.com.
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:42.640]  We've got a big sale going right now on multiple items.

[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:11.640]  because if I'm going to lay my life on the line and go all out in this,
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:14.640]  I want it to really win. I'm all in.
[2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:17.640]  I mean, I'm swinging for the fences here and I'm weak.
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:20.640]  I do the best I can. Thanks for putting up with me.
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:22.640]  I'm trying hard, though.
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:25.640]  And we need your support and to spread the word and to pray for us,
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:28.640]  because the enemy does all sorts of stuff behind the scenes,
[2:55:28.640 --> 2:55:30.640]  and we know it's because we're effective,
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:34.640]  and we appreciate the enemy letting us know we're hurting them.
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:37.640]  But we also appreciate you giving us the energy we need
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:40.640]  to rise up and strangle the enemy.
[2:55:40.640 --> 2:55:43.640]  I mean, believe me, folks, we need to be energized.
[2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:46.640]  We've been energized, but I can see we can go to the next level.
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:49.640]  And I promise you, I commit to you.
[2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:51.640]  Cross my heart.
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:55.640]  Like George Straits says, that I pledge to you to do all I can
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:55:58.640]  to make all your dreams come true of freedom,
[2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:00.640]  because my dreams are tied to your dreams.
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:03.640]  We're in this ship together, Spaceship Earth,
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:05.640]  and I'm committed to you.
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:08.640]  I'm committed to my family. I am committed to being a good person.
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:10.640]  I am committed to standing against evil.
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:12.640]  I am committed to not being a coward.
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:14.640]  I am committed to seeing this through.
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:18.640]  And if you will just commit to this, we will win.
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:22.640]  And it's the animating contest that separates us from the animals,
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:24.640]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:26.640]  I believe in humanity. I believe in you.
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:29.640]  You believe in us, and we will defeat the globalist.
[2:56:29.640 --> 2:56:32.640]  I want to thank all our friends and real media out there as well.
[2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:35.640]  I salute you and thank you for all you've done.
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:38.640]  Steve in Texas, thanks for holding AP Hill Military Topic.
[2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:42.640]  We'll have those guys on Sunday in studio. Go ahead.
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:45.640]  Okay, real quick, Alex. I'll try to make this real fast.
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:48.640]  There's a couple of projects just outside of AP Hill,
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:52.640]  one of the facilities that's nearby, a four-pick it actually.
[2:56:52.640 --> 2:56:55.640]  And there's a couple things I saw or noticed that they're doing.
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:57:00.640]  One is they're building another thing that looks very similar to the AP Hill
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:03.640]  training facility. It's an $8.8 million construction project.
[2:57:03.640 --> 2:57:08.640]  They're going to have buildings, alleys, athletic fields and all that.
[2:57:08.640 --> 2:57:13.640]  Another project that they're working on that I just found some articles on here.
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:19.640]  It's a $461 million training facility for U.S. depth diplomat.
[2:57:19.640 --> 2:57:25.640]  Yeah, they're just building facilities everywhere for the domestic takeover.
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:29.640]  Yeah, I mean, I thought it was very interesting that they've spent that much money
[2:57:29.640 --> 2:57:31.640]  to train government officials.
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:37.640]  Well, they just need to take more old ladies' houses and then they can do it.
[2:57:37.640 --> 2:57:39.640]  I appreciate your call. Great points. We'll look into it.
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:41.640]  David and Alaska, go ahead.
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:43.640]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[2:57:43.640 --> 2:57:44.640]  Good, sir.
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:47.640]  Hey, I've been waiting to get some information over to you here for a while.
[2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:50.640]  Number one, first and foremost, I'm a Marine Corps veteran.
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:56.640]  I'm also a certified anti-terror combat tactics instructor from our good friends over at DHS.
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:04.640]  Number two, and second most importantly, I am an oath keeper and I have been since the IETS.
[2:58:04.640 --> 2:58:09.640]  It came to my attention that you guys were kind of chit-chatting and touching on some information
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:15.640]  about a mount, what we refer to as Mount Training Facility over at Camp June.
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:16.640]  Yes.
[2:58:16.640 --> 2:58:22.640]  Yeah, well, I just wanted to kind of call and give you guys some information on there about that facility.
[2:58:22.640 --> 2:58:26.640]  The facility has been built to mock a very specific town.
[2:58:26.640 --> 2:58:29.640]  It's in the northeastern portion of the United States.
[2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:32.640]  It's complete with running water and electricity.
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:35.640]  Tell you what, I'm going to use some overdrive. Stay there. Don't hang up.
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:37.640]  I'm going to come right back to David.
[2:58:37.640 --> 2:58:43.640]  We're going to have Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs in studio this Sunday, four to six, with David Knight talking about
[2:58:43.640 --> 2:58:46.640]  the secret armies being built for war with us.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:59:13.640]  Stay there, sir. We'll come right back to you.
[2:59:17.640 --> 2:59:22.640]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:27.640]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[2:59:27.640 --> 2:59:32.640]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:36.640]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[2:59:36.640 --> 2:59:43.640]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[2:59:43.640 --> 2:59:50.640]  Available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[2:59:50.640 --> 2:59:54.640]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[2:59:54.640 --> 3:00:22.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:35.640]  The caller is talking about a key article that we're going to cover more on the Sunday show coming up this weekend,
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:41.640]  four to six p.m. Leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center based on U.S. Town.
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:48.640]  They admit their training for taking over the U.S., Northcom, the Army, the Marines, with the soldiers and Marines,
[3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:51.640]  but then they don't want us to be at these camps and training facilities.
[3:00:51.640 --> 3:00:56.640]  They shot video when they did this in major cities like Oakland and San Francisco before,
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:00:58.640]  and then Hebron, Maryland, small towns.
[3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:01.640]  What particular town is this base modeled after?
[3:01:01.640 --> 3:01:08.640]  We've got a lot of this classified, restricted document here in the article, but go ahead and tell us.
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:17.640]  Well, I can't really say too much information on it because I actually have a 946-page document that's sitting inside of my house right now.
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:24.640]  That kind of details a lot of this, but I was up here in Alaska when we had the whole Arctic Shield and DHS came in,
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:30.640]  and in the last week, man, there's been so many things going on up here with friends that work on base,
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:38.640]  and they have 22 hangers, and they're reporting four and flyovers, almost three and four a month as opposed to three and four a year.
[3:01:38.640 --> 3:01:42.640]  Things have really kind of ramped up over here, but with this Marine Corps Town,
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:50.640]  we're specifically talking about a coordinate, I can give you the 8-digit grid coordinate for it, or the 10-digit, rather,
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:56.640]  but it's a 63-building town that takes up over 1,000 acres.
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:02:00.640]  It's complete with a high school that has a gymnasium and a football field and soccer fields,
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:04.640]  and there's a big dirt road that runs all the way around the outside of this town.
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:09.640]  There's waterways that can be utilized for rubber watercraft training.
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:13.640]  We've got an article out about the Marine Corps Base at Camp Lejeune.
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:18.640]  You're saying there's another town that it's built after or another secret training facility?
[3:02:18.640 --> 3:02:28.640]  We're talking about something, if you're referring to what's referred to as combat town, it's going to be a very similar one to that,
[3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:30.640]  and I think that's the one that you're referring to.
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:35.640]  Let me ask you as a Marine, because I've been to the drills that are public where they admit it's for Americans, that's in the news.
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:39.640]  They're trying to be secretive about these facilities and our facility.
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:43.640]  Are they honest with you when you're training that it's for domestic operations?
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:47.640]  Here's what they're training for, and here's what they tell us when we're talking about counterinsurgency.
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:57.640]  Now, mind you, they're training American personnel, American agents, DHS agents for counterinsurgency operations.
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:04.640]  So to be clear, the Marines are training DHS agents to take on the American people?
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:07.640]  I wouldn't say they're training them to take on the American people.
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:16.640]  They're training them for anti-tear, quote, quote now, use this briefly or loosely quote, anti-tear encounter insurgency operations.
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:20.640]  Sure, but when I've been to these drills, they're practicing killing guys and cowboy hats and John Deere caps.
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:25.640]  I mean, are they saying it's the Muslim, radical Muslims, or are they saying it's for the Tea Party?
[3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:35.640]  Let me use an excerpt from a DHS file that was leaked from you guys to the oathkeepers up here in Alaska during Arctic Shield.
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:39.640]  Be quote, unquote, Americans against socialist tyranny.
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:41.640]  Let's use that term.
[3:03:41.640 --> 3:03:42.640]  Okay.
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:48.640]  There's the organization that they labeled Americans against socialist tyranny.
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:49.640]  Do you remember that?
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:51.640]  Yes, I remember that document.
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:58.640]  And again, no, I know they're training to take on people that don't want to go along with the end of America.
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:12.640]  But this whole facility here, this whole facility is very, very closely stylized after a specific town that within the last two years had a pretty major incident inside of this town.
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:20.640]  And like I said, I'm not going to say this word because there's a couple of things you just don't want to say over the phone and kind of catch a computer's keyword.
[3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:23.640]  Believe me, buddy, they're recording this.
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:26.640]  Anyways, no, no, I hear you.
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:27.640]  Look, this is all going on.
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:28.640]  We've got 30 seconds left.
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:29.640]  Let me ask you this.
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:31.640]  Are the Marines doing this training?
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:33.640]  Are they clicking to what's going on?
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.640]  We're definitely, our eyebrows are going up and we're looking side to side like this can't be happening.
[3:04:39.640 --> 3:04:41.640]  Well, look, it's foreign collaborators took over.
[3:04:41.640 --> 3:04:44.640]  So we've got to be honest about how bad it is.
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:46.640]  Like going to the doctor and you learn you got brain cancer.
[3:04:46.640 --> 3:04:50.640]  I mean, we are screwed, but not as screwed if we wake up and say no.
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:51.640]  God bless you.
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:53.640]  Everybody needs to speak out, folks, or it's over.
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:55.640]  We got to admit that it's a foreign enemy.
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:04:56.640]  See you back this Sunday.
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:57.640]  Sorry to other callers.
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:05:17.640]  Great job, crew.
