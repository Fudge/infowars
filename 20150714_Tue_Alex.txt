[00:00.000 --> 00:13.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.240 --> 00:37.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.960 --> 00:45.200]  it's already Tuesday the 14th day of July 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones Paul Joseph
[00:45.200 --> 00:50.200]  Watson is back from his investigation in Europe back in London he's going to be
[00:50.200 --> 00:58.720]  joining us on several huge topics the fake ISIS beheading videos that have
[00:58.720 --> 01:05.560]  been revealed the situation in Greece this member of the Russian Parliament or
[01:05.560 --> 01:09.960]  Duma high-level coming out breaking down that the negotiations are already going
[01:09.960 --> 01:14.520]  on with the Russian military and the oligarchs to remove Putin and break up
[01:14.520 --> 01:20.620]  Russia and they're talking about that happening by August or September Larry
[01:20.620 --> 01:27.880]  Elder syndicated radio host best-selling author will be joining us to break down
[01:27.880 --> 01:32.640]  the race hype that's being pushed across the country and I got to say
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.080]  something the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups say they're
[01:37.080 --> 01:43.040]  gonna go to Charleston this weekend nearby the church where nine people were
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.240]  killed and I do believe the people were killed there the the the perpetrator
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.280]  looks like he might have been wound up he was on an amnesic drug I said look
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.440]  for that if he's on an amnesic it may be staged and sure enough he was on one
[01:57.440 --> 02:02.000]  of the most powerful amnesics there is similar what Sirhan Sirhan was on what
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.520]  they admit he was drugged up to then believe he had shot RFK but side issue
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.600]  I don't know I'm gonna send any reporters but I'm tempted to the problem is
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.000]  it's a good thing the Klan doesn't show up most the time they say they are but a
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.040]  bunch of other rabble will you know it's one thing if you want to be a white
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.280]  supremacist or want to be a white separatist and that's your worldview I
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.400]  don't agree with it but I can respect your view and understand it just like the
[02:29.400 --> 02:36.680]  black separatist of the nation of Islam but when you want to go gloat over dead
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.120]  people it's just beyond the pale and disgusting now now liberals will say
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.320]  when I criticize them that it's censorship no saying I disagree with
[02:45.320 --> 02:48.760]  them doing this is not censorship stopping them from doing it would be
[02:48.760 --> 02:55.080]  censorship but that said people should go get in their face under the first
[02:55.080 --> 03:04.120]  amendment it's like these people that go to dead veterans funerals and then say
[03:04.120 --> 03:15.160]  you deserve to die because God hates fags to use that slang term and to say
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.880]  you died because the military is cursed now as if it's their issue or as if it's
[03:19.880 --> 03:26.360]  their fault even according to your perspective I mean it's trolling at the
[03:26.360 --> 03:34.480]  highest levels and it's despicable and just feels like bad luck I mean the
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.080]  God fear inside of me just cringes watching people do this type of stuff
[03:40.080 --> 03:46.360]  go to somebody's funeral that's done nothing to you and then add some other
[03:46.360 --> 03:50.840]  issue to it it's almost like those groups are paid to do that
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.560]  Couglas clan plans to rally at South Carolina Statehouse and then to March
[03:57.560 --> 04:02.600]  NAACP commenced South Carolina Confederate flag removal and the clans
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.760]  idiocy makes the other idiocy of people actually thinking that the Confederate
[04:08.760 --> 04:16.320]  flag is evil and a symbol of slavery it makes that look legitimate and that's
[04:16.320 --> 04:24.040]  how this is done so we'll be breaking all of that down coming up today Robert
[04:24.040 --> 04:29.760]  Tosh Plumlee will be joining us the current black ops contractor who's
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.200]  testified before Congress many times one of the most famous whistleblowers who's
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.960]  alive and yes how can he still be flying C-130s for the CIA and others because he
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.520]  never blew the whistle on something illegal he's a hero and a lot of folks
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.280]  the government supporting so he's back from some recent missions he'll be
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.400]  joining us via video Skype he was the first one to expose the Benghazi
[04:53.400 --> 04:57.400]  Stinger missiles and more and now even Congress is covering it he wants to talk
[04:57.400 --> 05:04.200]  about it on Monday Obama's Defense Secretary said that the Pentagon's ban
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.840]  on transgendered individuals is outdated and the administration has ordered a
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.000]  study to end the practice at a time when our troops have learned from
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.200]  experience that the most important qualification for service members should
[05:18.200 --> 05:23.120]  be whether they are able and willing to do their job our officers and enlisted
[05:23.120 --> 05:27.560]  personnel are faced with certain rules that tell them the opposite the Defense
[05:27.560 --> 05:33.480]  Secretary said in December Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said anyone
[05:33.480 --> 05:37.960]  who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve adding that
[05:37.960 --> 05:43.120]  times change it is also supported by the former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagle
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.760]  contrast all those statements of inclusiveness with soldiers at Fort

[08:36.240 --> 08:40.800]  today and we're gonna be going live right into the fourth hour most stations
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.480]  carry just the first three hours for years I did four hours and a lot of
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.360]  stations still carry the fourth hour that's a rear of the first hour or some
[08:50.360 --> 08:56.120]  stations carry the second third and fourth hour it varies but I am looking
[08:56.120 --> 09:02.000]  at bringing back I will announce here on air sometime this year the fourth hour
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.400]  but making the fourth hour an intense news broadcast with a fourth hour round
[09:09.400 --> 09:17.040]  table discussion where more than 50 news articles will be covered every day boom
[09:17.040 --> 09:22.000]  boom boom throw the topic out get a quick comment from the people on the
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.520]  panel take a call go to the next story but I've been thinking about that for
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.760]  the last year I've been quietly getting the reporters ready for it they didn't
[09:31.760 --> 09:37.040]  even know I've had them guest hosting and things like that and I just do want
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.440]  to announce to our affiliates here the next few weeks that we're gonna be
[09:39.440 --> 09:42.760]  sending you a date and the and of course the satellite up links and the rest of
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.960]  it the GCN feed also our own satellite feed that we have on the same system so
[09:47.960 --> 09:54.800]  that you can pick up that fourth hour of the radio TV transmission and that will
[09:54.800 --> 10:00.360]  be hosted by yours truly most days I'll always be hosting the first three hours
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.560]  but many days it will be hosted by the round table so we're very very excited
[10:07.560 --> 10:12.160]  talk about throwing the reporters and anchors into the deep end of syndicated
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.080]  radio you know they're a little nervous doing the news every night but I've had
[10:17.080 --> 10:22.920]  them in here on the radio show so trial by fire I'll be the training wheels and
[10:22.920 --> 10:28.480]  be in here the first few months every day until they've gotten accustomed to it
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.200]  and then some days that fourth hour will be hosted by the crew and what made me
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.360]  think about it was I'm a guest occasionally on the Howard Stern show
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.840]  which I like doing is it reaches so many people and then I'm a more frequent
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.520]  guest on their after show round table and their news shows and some of those
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.200]  are in the aggregate just as popular at least segments of them are as the
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.960]  Howard Stern program itself that is minute by minute they have as many
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.680]  listeners and so there's so much news we end up not getting to so much news that
[11:01.680 --> 11:07.040]  breaks during the very end of the show that I think that having having a
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.200]  round table in here every day and to have guest round tables to have go folks
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.720]  that come in to co-host with us who aren't even the reporters so that is
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.480]  going to be coming up by the end of the year we're going to be hiring a couple
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.480]  more reporters and anchors and camera people and video editors that takes
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.920]  money I never got into this and I'm a capitalist and free market I'm gonna
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.040]  shame to make money I mean if I rate you know write a fiction book that makes a
[11:36.040 --> 11:39.240]  billion dollars so be it nothing wrong with that that's what makes the world
[11:39.240 --> 11:45.800]  go around that's what innovates but I never set out to have this syndicated
[11:45.800 --> 11:50.720]  radio broadcast to just make money I needed money to fund it but enemies
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.720]  tried to take me down people tried to set me up dirty tricks were launched over
[11:54.720 --> 11:58.120]  and over again by government corporations individuals to try to stop us
[11:58.120 --> 12:01.800]  they would always try to say you just want to make money so I said you know
[12:01.800 --> 12:07.840]  what let me show you make money I'll double triple quadruple tenfold now our
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.080]  profits what they were just 15 years ago and then I will put almost all of it
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.840]  back in to the operation because I have a love affair with the truth a love
[12:17.840 --> 12:21.600]  affair with standing up to tyrants when they come after our children our guns
[12:21.600 --> 12:27.760]  our health our sovereignty and I'm going to show you what I can do because big
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.680]  fish eat little fish and I've had a lot of fish try to eat me and now good luck
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.920]  doing it because we have become quite large and are in the center of the
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.320]  zeitgeist and everybody in the establishment knows it much of the
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.760]  public now knows it and I'm not here bragging it's a great responsibility but
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.240]  it comes to hardcore real politic when it comes to hardcore talking about the
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.040]  issues info wars calm this syndicated radio slash TV transmission is the
[12:59.040 --> 13:05.200]  heart of the resistance and so I'm not going to sit back and lose this fight
[13:05.200 --> 13:11.120]  later and wish I hadn't put on all the sale I could like a sailing ship I'm
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.880]  going to put up every sale I can I am going to get going as fast as I can to
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.200]  make this run at the globalist and I'm not backing down and I'm trusting in one
[13:20.200 --> 13:27.920]  thing alone the Lord above and part of the Lord above our creator is that he
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.440]  good people have been created and they have the spirit of liberty in their
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.920]  hearts as well and when I say I count on God I count on God's supporters God's
[13:37.920 --> 13:43.480]  followers God's worshipers to understand what we're facing and to support this
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.920]  broadcast and to pray for us and I know you do that and so I want to salute all
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.960]  of you out there and yes ladies and gentlemen people can say before I get
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.200]  into all this news and tell you about the guests that are coming up that why are
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.440]  you getting more and more religious well it's been said many times there are no
[14:01.440 --> 14:09.400]  atheists and foxholes and when you read about babies wrapped in gold foil being
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.440]  shipped out of China by the thousands every month and being turned into powder
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.560]  for women mainly to eat it believing it makes them look younger and nobody
[14:18.560 --> 14:21.880]  seems to care when you look at hundreds of millions of abortions every year
[14:21.880 --> 14:25.280]  worldwide when you look at the globalist poisoning our food and water
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.080]  supplied by design and forcing Gardasil shots on young girls all over the
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.240]  planet when you look at our government funding ISIS and al-Qaeda when you look
[14:34.240 --> 14:42.220]  at the borders wide open and El Chapo now we learn had his wife move here to
[14:42.220 --> 14:47.560]  have her baby so he'd have an anchor baby the billionaire drug dealer even
[14:47.560 --> 14:55.320]  lives off US taxpayers I mean it's a joke and so that's why I'm committed to
[14:55.320 --> 15:01.760]  fight as hard as I can the British special forces slogan for the special
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.880]  air services the model of special forces worldwide I mean they were the
[15:05.880 --> 15:14.240]  first to do it SAS is fortune favors the bold well I'm here to tell you I in the
[15:14.240 --> 15:17.840]  face of them coming after our guns coming after our health coming after
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.880]  everything fortune favors the bold what is our fortune what made our fortune
[15:22.880 --> 15:28.480]  what made the prosperity and the freedom our forebears didn't back down they
[15:28.480 --> 15:33.160]  refused to be downtrodden a lot of them came from indentured servitude slavery
[15:33.160 --> 15:39.040]  you name it but they persevered to the point we're at and our ancestors aren't
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.960]  losers whether you're black whether you're white whether Hispanic or Asian
[15:42.960 --> 15:48.320]  all peoples of the earth have incredible histories of incredible adversity and
[15:48.320 --> 15:51.520]  overcoming it and that's why we're here today the fact that your parents and
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.480]  their grandparents and their great great great great grandparents were able to
[15:54.480 --> 15:58.720]  have children and have them survive and pass that torch forward and the fact
[15:58.720 --> 16:04.480]  that we're alive today as a species and dominant on this planet is because we're
[16:04.480 --> 16:10.000]  winners and I'm sick of people telling us we're not winners you are a winner you
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.520]  are special consciousness is incredible an incredible God made you whether you
[16:15.520 --> 16:21.360]  believe in God or not look around you reality is fantastic 12 dimensions
[16:21.360 --> 16:24.600]  they've discovered scientists believe there's probably life in other dimensions
[16:24.600 --> 16:30.720]  what do you think all this is we only see a very narrow spectrum of light just in
[16:30.720 --> 16:37.080]  the light spectrum of this dimension the eye has not seen the ear is not heard
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.120]  what God the universe whatever you want to call it has in store for us and we're
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.840]  not gonna let the globalist wall off reality put us in a matrix to control us
[16:46.840 --> 16:53.680]  dumb us down and then phase us out like we're a horse and buggy whip in 1920 and
[16:53.680 --> 16:58.360]  the factories are closing because nobody buys buggies and buggy whips and horses
[16:58.360 --> 17:04.800]  anymore we are the innovators we are the great creation we are in the image of the
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.480]  great creator we are special we are powerful and that's why the fallen one
[17:10.480 --> 17:17.080]  on this planet wants to bring us down and the reason I get more and more spiritual
[17:17.080 --> 17:22.240]  is because I realized that's where the real fight is and I realized that that's
[17:22.240 --> 17:27.560]  the only way we're gonna beat the enemy is with a force greater and more powerful
[17:27.560 --> 17:32.560]  and stronger you are not gonna beat something from the same energy level
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.720]  you're gonna have to go above it you're gonna have to go around it and the
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.480]  enemy knows that that's why they had to make us godless first they had to take
[17:40.480 --> 17:45.040]  over the churches I mean the most evil doctrines you can imagine are taught in
[17:45.040 --> 17:50.640]  these churches now across the board and I'm no Pharisee or Sadducee up here
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.440]  claiming I've got all the answers I know I can see evil I know I can see it
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.800]  growing I know the devil has captured the church in the world from the Catholic

[22:05.440 --> 22:08.720]  commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pick pocketed ten
[22:08.720 --> 22:11.720]  years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after
[22:11.720 --> 22:15.120]  government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a
[22:15.120 --> 22:18.880]  built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.000]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.400]  credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[22:27.400 --> 22:31.800]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID stronghold to share
[22:31.800 --> 22:35.480]  my inventions and blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of
[22:35.480 --> 22:39.520]  misconceptions out there today about RFID I encourage everyone to get informed

[24:10.920 --> 24:30.600]  and broadcast obviously we're 24 minutes into this transmission I went off on a
[24:30.600 --> 24:37.200]  rant about the state of the world basically evil is people and ideas and
[24:37.200 --> 24:45.680]  systems that cheat God's system the world's biological system our spiritual
[24:45.680 --> 24:52.080]  system and basically contaminate things with what I'd call galactic mental
[24:52.080 --> 24:58.160]  illness not treating others as you want to be treated not realizing that
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.720]  everything you do ends up coming back on to you and that's just my gut level
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.760]  philosophy and the globalists are cheating all of that believing they're
[25:07.760 --> 25:12.140]  going to transcend humanity and become gods there's no way you're going to
[25:12.140 --> 25:19.640]  transcend anything without going through the steps God has set up for us and just
[25:19.640 --> 25:24.440]  common sense says that we have more information than the world's ever had
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.280]  more of it at our fingertips and people have never been as ignorant that's an
[25:28.280 --> 25:34.360]  example of not appreciating things I mean my parents were middle-class growing
[25:34.360 --> 25:41.560]  up and I mean if I had a pair of cowboy boots that wore out they'd always buy
[25:41.560 --> 25:47.240]  something a couple sizes too big and tell me to wear you know big socks so that I
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.320]  could keep the boots a couple years and the heels wore out they went and got
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.600]  them repaired and then we would go give them to somebody who was younger than
[25:53.600 --> 26:00.560]  me when they were too small and I got maybe two pairs of shoes a year I remember
[26:00.560 --> 26:04.760]  all the other kids in my neighborhood got two pairs of shoes a year when my
[26:04.760 --> 26:10.720]  dad was a kid he got one pair of shoes a year and now my kids are great kids are
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.640]  sweet but I catch myself just at the mall yeah let's just go get some shoes
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.520]  and I'm looking in their closet they go like ten pairs of shoes and then they
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.520]  could never seem to find their shoes or they don't like their shoes it's not
[26:22.520 --> 26:28.760]  their bad kids they're decadent like me compared to my predecessor because they
[26:28.760 --> 26:36.840]  have been in such abundance so I made the decision to try to institute things
[26:36.840 --> 26:42.120]  where no these are your two pairs of shoes and they get put back here and we
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.680]  hang your clothes here we appreciate these we keep them clean and you're
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.800]  going yeah that's common sense how you raise a kid I know I know but if you
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.960]  look at society everyone just throws their kid a Nintendo handheld or a game
[26:56.960 --> 27:02.800]  boy or the more modern systems on the smartphone and I go to a restaurant and
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.240]  every child I mean almost every child like I've shot videos of it on my iPhone
[27:07.240 --> 27:10.720]  speak of the devil and meant to do a whole piece on it there's a whole bunch
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.320]  of them on my phone I should give it to Buckley haven't pulled off and it's just
[27:14.320 --> 27:20.760]  videos of kids looking at the screen and never talking to their parents and then
[27:20.760 --> 27:23.520]  I'll kind of walk behind them and get a shot from behind because I don't want to
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.960]  show kids faces on TV but the answer is just blur their faces out and I can just
[27:27.960 --> 27:31.480]  show the parents talking to each other they're the last generation I guess to
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.680]  do that and the kids aren't talking there on their phones and now adults are
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.400]  doing this and look I know I'm stating the obvious it's obvious that no one
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.800]  should drink tap water because glyphosate is in 99% of every municipal water
[27:47.800 --> 27:56.920]  supply source FDA EPA look it up for yourself glyphosate grows pancreatic
[27:56.920 --> 28:09.760]  cancer kidney cancer bladder cancer urinary tract cancer and it's in 99% of
[28:09.760 --> 28:19.000]  the water supplies EPA.gov and in very dangerous levels in major cities but
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.520]  rural areas it's even worse it's being spread on the crops and I know we all
[28:25.520 --> 28:31.280]  know that but I still catch myself I'll be up at 3 in the morning going to the
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.840]  bathroom I walk over I forgot to bring a bottle of water up and I'll just because
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.080]  I put purified water in a bottle of bottle water use it as a container I'll
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.560]  just catch myself at the sink just drinking tap water and at 3 a.m. I
[28:45.560 --> 28:49.240]  just go I don't care I wanted I don't want to go downstairs and I'm just like
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.240]  I need to be disciplined and it's fun to be disciplined I've been getting more
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.960]  disciplined in little increments and I enjoy being disciplined and sure you can
[28:58.960 --> 29:04.840]  get too disciplined and become completely OCD but those of us that are the
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.920]  opposite of OCD we need to start trying to become more OCD and try to become a
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.560]  little more neurotic about putting our clothes up putting our toothbrush up
[29:15.560 --> 29:20.160]  doing that because if we can't do that we're not gonna tell our kids no you
[29:20.160 --> 29:23.360]  can't have television we're gonna go play a board game or we're gonna go paint
[29:23.360 --> 29:29.240]  we're gonna go for a walk at night outside the full moon's out we're gonna
[29:29.240 --> 29:37.960]  go hunt rabbits with a spotlight or you just go out at night for fun and have
[29:37.960 --> 29:43.960]  the privatized that are following you trying to catch you anyways the whole
[29:43.960 --> 29:50.720]  point is that life is such an adventure stay with us we're on the March the
[29:50.720 --> 30:00.480]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network with all the flag
[30:00.480 --> 30:04.040]  hating and PC mindset here in the United States it makes you wonder how the rest
[30:04.040 --> 30:07.280]  of the world is doing let's look at Spain they have just ended freedom of

[30:18.120 --> 30:21.680]  considered an act of terrorism Snowden like whistleblowing is now being defined
[30:21.680 --> 30:25.200]  as an act of terrorism visiting our consulting terrorist websites a
[30:25.200 --> 30:28.640]  satirical comment against the royal family hassling elected government
[30:28.640 --> 30:32.280]  officials protests in a spontaneous way outside parliament showing lack of
[30:32.280 --> 30:36.120]  respect to officers occupying squatting or refusing to leave an office all
[30:36.120 --> 30:40.520]  against the law and could get anywhere from a 100 euro fine up to 30,000 euros

[35:52.080 --> 36:03.960]  revenue coming in through June so far is 2 trillion 446 billion 920 million a
[36:03.960 --> 36:11.080]  record level but still the feds run a 313 billion dollar deficit they will
[36:11.080 --> 36:14.720]  spend any amount of money that we bring in because the bankers want us in
[36:14.720 --> 36:21.960]  solvent to take us over continuing ladies and gentlemen 10 horribly violent
[36:21.960 --> 36:24.960]  crimes that were committed by illegal immigrants just recently a michael
[36:24.960 --> 36:30.480]  schneider article at info wars dot com we're gonna get some of those globalist
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.200]  assault on tax competition rouses opposition global governments being
[36:35.200 --> 36:39.840]  formed the new american alex neumann breaks it down and there is massive
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.000]  pressure to force governments around the world to unify taxes that above 80
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.760]  percent federal alone that's why in france the average person pays over 90
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.440]  percent in taxes some people over 100 percent to impoverish them that's a
[36:55.440 --> 37:01.920]  Forbes headline by the way 101 percent in france so we're gonna be getting into
[37:01.920 --> 37:07.040]  that obama ready is a transgender military if that won't break up the
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.800]  military nothing will now they're gonna have studies and now they're gonna have
[37:10.800 --> 37:16.120]  a fund to help people transition men who are in the military to I guess be women
[37:16.120 --> 37:23.480]  or be something else and my issue is they've already lowered the size of the
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.720]  pack in the marines and the army so that the average female recruit can carry
[37:27.720 --> 37:33.560]  it I'm not I can't carry a 65 pound pack 30 miles in one day I probably might
[37:33.560 --> 37:37.760]  have been able to do it when I was 20 and I ran six miles every other day and
[37:37.760 --> 37:43.600]  could bench press 360 pounds squat 600 pounds you know do deadlifts with 400
[37:43.600 --> 37:46.160]  pounds and I'm not saying I was the biggest guy around or the toughest but
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.520]  I mean I could skin a buck run a trot line and I couldn't go do that right
[37:51.520 --> 37:55.720]  off the bat that's what more of the advanced courses do boot camp doesn't do
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.240]  that but then that's what you do later and I mean just the average woman can't
[37:59.240 --> 38:02.840]  do that it's just statistically there's not many men that can do it
[38:02.840 --> 38:11.040]  proficiently but hey we'll just make that pack 20 pounds pumpkin think you can do
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.000]  that now Obama readies a how about I get to have a baby how about all women get
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.640]  arrested because they're discriminating against me because the fact that they
[38:19.640 --> 38:22.800]  can have a baby makes me feel bad that I can't because they tell boys and girls
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.920]  the word boys and girls is hurtful so you got to be a purple penguin by the way
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.120]  they're now calling to take a Confederate general off one of these
[38:32.120 --> 38:36.600]  murals they put on the side of a mountain and I told you next will be get
[38:36.600 --> 38:42.120]  rid of Mount Mount Rushmore new articles out taxpayers have now spent 3.5
[38:42.120 --> 38:46.280]  million to fund why lesbians are three times fatter than average women

[38:51.200 --> 38:54.840]  months for getting five of his friends to give campaign donations that I believe
[38:54.840 --> 38:58.160]  were legal if you read the law Hillary can take money from foreign dictators
[38:58.160 --> 39:03.480]  though and the judge said he believes he's mentally ill because he believes
[39:03.480 --> 39:08.580]  he's being persecuted by the government and so there you go yes go to psych
[39:08.580 --> 39:12.920]  aval and he's been told under probation don't do interviews by the way that's a
[39:12.920 --> 39:17.120]  little inside baseball by the way I knew when DeSousa was gonna be indicted two
[39:17.120 --> 39:23.760]  days before it happened because a little bird that was in Hollywood with the
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.400]  folks that were editing his next movie was there and they were just shocked by
[39:28.400 --> 39:34.120]  it and they had feds following the crew around as
[39:34.120 --> 39:42.440]  harassment I mean it gets old and believe me when you're sitting there with
[39:42.440 --> 39:45.200]  your kids at a restaurant having dinner and you look up and a guy's taking
[39:45.200 --> 39:48.720]  photos of you and smiles at you and sticks their chin out at you you're
[39:48.720 --> 39:53.440]  just like man this government's really screwed up like not only is the Fed
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.140]  doing it they're trying to intimidate you because they're Democratic Party
[39:57.140 --> 40:05.360]  sicko operatives and they hate anybody who isn't left of Mao Zedong here it is

[43:00.880 --> 43:05.120]  know everything it exactly does I'm not a chemist I'm not a doctor I'm not a
[43:05.120 --> 43:08.880]  biologist I'm not a it's just it's well known you can go read all the medical
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.200]  literature about saw palmetto but that's just one of the ingredients of
[43:13.200 --> 43:24.520]  vitamin D zinc selenium copper magnesium chromium moly denium plant
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.760]  sterol saw palmetto berry powder and lycopene they say all our experts even
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.520]  more important the saw palmetto and it all fuses together in the digestive
[43:33.520 --> 43:40.560]  tract to have a upload of it is what the experts tell me info wars life calm now
[43:40.560 --> 43:47.480]  joining us joining us from London England is Paul Joseph Watson with a
[43:47.480 --> 43:54.200]  breakdown of two bombshell articles he's put out in the last 24 hours US when
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.760]  they say US globalists and control the US because they're running us in the
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.240]  ground as well with economic war while they consolidate power outside the
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.480]  nation state US conspiring with Russian oligarchs to overthrow Putin says
[44:07.480 --> 44:11.040]  Duma member well when I heard him speak for 25 minutes that's how long the
[44:11.040 --> 44:16.120]  speech is or the interview everything he says is actually open source true so
[44:16.120 --> 44:21.760]  see I don't just believe this guy and then it continues who is behind the
[44:21.760 --> 44:25.800]  stage to ISIS beheading video bizarre footage reportedly released by Russian
[44:25.800 --> 44:32.640]  hackers and if they did stage the video of the video they deserve Oscars
[44:32.640 --> 44:38.640]  because it looks exactly like the original background I remember saying
[44:38.640 --> 44:43.320]  that very beheading had to be staged not saying ISIS and killing people because
[44:43.320 --> 44:50.240]  it was it was it was cinematic it looked more real than reality it was it was so
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.880]  so well done you it looked like something Stanley Kubrick would come out with I mean
[44:55.880 --> 45:02.280]  it looked too real more real than real and then now you have it filmed from a
[45:02.280 --> 45:07.880]  distance that an ambassador's age shot that's exactly how they do it and you
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.920]  can see them in there producing it and we know you know set they don't have an
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.720]  army of seven foot guys chopping five foot people's heads off marching them by
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.200]  the beach I mean it's or with perfect sand dunes and a background that you know
[45:21.200 --> 45:27.240]  isn't real because there's something about fake film cinema that looks like
[45:27.240 --> 45:30.640]  magic you know what I mean and we should do a whole piece where we show the
[45:30.640 --> 45:34.800]  beheadings well then they censor us we're just so still shots of it to break it
[45:34.800 --> 45:39.720]  down so Paul Watson will go over that as well and his latest article where they
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.920]  may move to pull down Mount Rushmore next but before we go any further Paul
[45:44.920 --> 45:50.640]  which one of these do you want to tackle first well let's start with the Mount
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.040]  Rushmore thing because that's the one that came out this morning so basically
[45:54.040 --> 46:00.160]  this is the NAACP in Atlanta they're now literally calling for this stone
[46:00.160 --> 46:06.680]  mountain monument which is the largest bass relief structure sculpture in the
[46:06.680 --> 46:12.040]  world this is iconic and historic it's bigger than a football field it's bigger
[46:12.040 --> 46:16.880]  than Mount Rushmore it took decades and decades to complete it wasn't even
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.680]  completed until 1972 because they kept having to go back to complete it so
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.000]  they're now literally calling for it to be sandblasted off the face of this
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.120]  mountain in the name of political correct this sounds like the Taliban
[46:31.120 --> 46:36.400]  blowing up Buddhist idols well exactly Alex I've been saying for months that
[46:36.400 --> 46:41.600]  so-called progressives are moving ideologically closer to ISIS terrorists
[46:41.600 --> 46:45.880]  because for a year ISIS have been destroying historical statues and
[46:45.880 --> 46:51.040]  monuments that quote offend their radical ideology which is now exactly
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.200]  what's happening with leftists you know there was a video about a week ago where
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.360]  they did a man on the street thing this media organization and they said you
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.120]  know Washington DC it's named after George Washington he owned slaves should
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.720]  we rename Washington DC and the majority of the people who of course also think
[47:10.720 --> 47:14.560]  that Beyonce should have the right to ban the First Amendment because of
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.880]  racism said yes we should change the name of Washington DC and call it black
[47:19.880 --> 47:25.600]  city or mixed race city and all these other ridiculous terms so it's actually
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.360]  getting to that level of course we had a CNN discussion last month in the light
[47:30.360 --> 47:34.120]  of this Charleston shooting where they said you know when do we get to the
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.720]  point where we call for the removal of statues of Thomas Jefferson and Don
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.960]  Lemon and this other host on CNN we're having a rational sober debate about
[47:42.960 --> 47:48.800]  actually yanking down Jefferson statues and monuments in Washington DC so now
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.960]  they're talking about doing the same in Georgia and of course Memphis City
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.600]  Council as you reported just voted to dig up the dead body of the Confederate
[47:58.600 --> 48:03.120]  general Nathan Bedford Forest remove it move it to a different location and
[48:03.120 --> 48:09.760]  sell off his statue to the highest bidder so again we make the point this is the
[48:09.760 --> 48:14.280]  translation of the social justice warrior mental illness that's been raging on
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.120]  social media for years and years now it's actually translating into law and
[48:19.120 --> 48:25.120]  physical action because politics is downstream from culture so whatever they
[48:25.120 --> 48:29.240]  set up the cultural narrative to be which after this Charleston shooting is
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.920]  you know any representation of the Confederate flag is racist and evil
[48:33.920 --> 48:39.640]  they're now translating that into actual council votes legislature votes and
[48:39.640 --> 48:45.840]  laws which will physically remove from the pages of history this iconic art
[48:45.840 --> 48:50.400]  whatever you think about it just as ISIS terrorists are doing across the
[48:50.400 --> 48:57.040]  Middle East well I agree with you Paul Watson you want to get into the Russia
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.920]  situation or get into the ISIS situation we'll get get into the ISIS
[49:02.920 --> 49:06.680]  situation one more thing on that though you know you can go through that
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.600]  throughout the world every single country had slavery you know the Chinese
[49:11.600 --> 49:17.120]  had slaves in fact Chinese slaves built the terracotta army which is this much
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.480]  celebrated you know life-size figures of these terracotta warriors that was the
[49:21.480 --> 49:27.400]  Aztec temples were built by the underclass slaves as slavery's in the Bible I mean
[49:27.400 --> 49:33.480]  Abraham had slaves that's just what went on so usually it was a rich guy a
[49:33.480 --> 49:37.240]  rich guy that could pay for an armored house and everybody lived in the walls
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.560]  there they just I mean I'm not defending slavery it's just an institution that
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.800]  went on but but again guilt is a powerful manipulator sorry yeah you know
[49:46.800 --> 49:50.440]  the Egyptians use slaves to build the pyramids though we're gonna destroy the
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.280]  pyramids I think we should yeah the cotton economy was built on slavery are
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.120]  we going to ban cotton iPhones are made by slaves in China should we ban
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.480]  iPhones they only target these these bastions of so-called white Western
[50:05.480 --> 50:08.400]  culture because that's what they're currently trying to overturn they're
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.520]  targeting Robert E. Lee because he was the common Donna West Point his grandfather
[50:12.520 --> 50:16.480]  and his grandfather was the right-hand manager was washing on his father and
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.160]  he was probably one of the greatest field generals ever they think he was
[50:20.160 --> 50:23.400]  better than Napoleon we're not defending Napoleon it was just he was a
[50:23.400 --> 50:27.480]  master military person and Stonewall Jackson was probably even better than
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.040]  Lee and the South's military it was like one of the best in history I mean
[50:32.040 --> 50:38.040]  that's just a fact now there's even a story out of England where they're
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.120]  talking about banning any representation of chains or shackles
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.120]  they're having a celebration because this area in England called the black
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.840]  country created these chains back in the 18th century now they're saying any
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.920]  representation of chains is racist and must be it's about them controlling
[50:54.920 --> 51:00.520]  reality being able to man whatever they want pure totalitarian cult so I asked
[51:00.520 --> 51:05.040]  my buddy mark where does the name ghost gun come from you know the ghost ar-15
[51:05.040 --> 51:09.760]  80% rifle gets ghost what's a ghost and he says duh they killed ghosts I said
[51:09.760 --> 51:13.320]  really goes he's yeah said matter of fact they're guaranteed to kill ghosts

[51:18.280 --> 51:22.720]  way so they just appropriately named them ghost guns and I said okay that's a

[54:55.720 --> 55:02.520]  transgender military harp to be transferred to civilian control it's all
[55:02.520 --> 55:06.520]  coming up Paul I want to shift gears out of political correctness in the time we
[55:06.520 --> 55:12.360]  have but briefly why do you think it's getting so over the top now I mean
[55:12.360 --> 55:17.920]  clearly it's not a mental illness by the social engineers if they can ban
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.960]  symbols and ban speech they have control and they've ended the most key
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.080]  component of freedom that's that's exactly it they they've become emboldened
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.040]  since this Charleston shoot Charleston shooting and now that they're just
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.280]  going hell for lead lever with this hysteria I mean we had an article
[55:36.280 --> 55:40.120]  yesterday about the no-flagging challenge this is literally people
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.600]  violating private property rights going into people's homes tearing down
[55:44.600 --> 55:49.240]  Confederate flags and putting it up on Vine and YouTube now we're getting
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.800]  reports of people being threatened at gunpoint for having Confederate flags
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.280]  flying from their house so if you think about it is it really a great idea for
[56:00.280 --> 56:04.680]  people to go and violate private property attack private property in
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.320]  southern states where these people are going to be armed they're going to have
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.040]  guns they're going to end up getting shot is that really a great idea but now
[56:12.040 --> 56:17.160]  actually people threatening people at gunpoint for having Confederate flags on
[56:17.160 --> 56:21.760]  their own property not even trying to confront people just having them attached
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.600]  to their house we're now getting reports of that so again if they if they want to
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.880]  gin up this racial confrontation that's exactly what they're going to get it's
[56:30.880 --> 56:37.640]  just going to end in more bloodshed well we know that whether this shooting in
[56:37.640 --> 56:42.400]  Charleston was completely staged or completely real this whole race war
[56:42.400 --> 56:47.040]  atmosphere contributed to this mentally ill person who got his gun illegally he
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.120]  got it through the instant check but for some reason that didn't stop him but
[56:52.120 --> 56:57.280]  regardless it sets a precedent where anybody can commit a crime cloaked in
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.280]  its image and then you ban it I mean this is just mindless but they're
[57:02.280 --> 57:08.200]  certainly turning the heat up right now Paul well yeah and the funny thing is
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.840]  it's the Streisand effect isn't it the past three weeks I've never seen more
[57:12.840 --> 57:17.920]  Confederate flags than in my entire life so in the name of banning it it's just
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.520]  become more apparent again emboldening white supremacists who might be
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.280]  inspired to go out and violently attack people emboldening extreme leftists on
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.000]  the other side you know the black lives matter people who were now getting
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.480]  reports of threatening people at gunpoint for having the Confederate flag so this
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.640]  is not having the effect of harmony and positive race relations it's having the
[57:41.640 --> 57:46.360]  exact opposite well I'll be honest with you it almost it almost makes me want to
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.120]  stick one on my car just because they're trying to ban it I mean I've never
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.480]  been into the rebel flag never had it never family had never had it but at
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.960]  the same time they're trying to ban it and it was an honorable flag when it was
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.640]  made and just the idea of banning history because people get freaked out
[58:03.640 --> 58:07.720]  about it it's just crazy I almost want to just have therapy with them and walk
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.000]  around with a big we should send our reporters downtown with battle flags and
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.680]  ask folks their opinion of it and just get the ignorance because it's crazy
[58:17.680 --> 58:23.320]  Paul again sales are exploding just like gun sales explode when they try to ban
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.240]  them it has the same effect every time it's backfiring now we're gonna come back
[58:27.240 --> 58:30.000]  and just have five minutes with you before Larry Elder I want to get into the
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.120]  Russia situation and this new video that reports to show them staging one of the
[58:35.120 --> 58:39.640]  ISIS beheadings the videos are clearly stage but is this video of the staging
[58:39.640 --> 58:48.040]  real or is it a fake to stay with us visit GCN Live.com today
[58:49.040 --> 58:53.200]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as

[58:56.880 --> 59:02.040]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[59:02.040 --> 59:06.720]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[59:06.720 --> 59:11.480]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.560]  lot of great reporters we'll start having them sometimes not in studio with

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.240]  tomorrow Joe Biggs, Jakari Jax and others gonna be on the ground covering it but
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.720]  right now let's go back to Paul Watson Paul Watson finishing up with this
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:03.000]  latest video who is behind the staged ISIS beheading video was your article
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.080]  what do you think's going on well this was released over the weekend by a
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.080]  pro-russian hacktivist group which is based in Ukraine called Cyber Burkut
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.720]  and obviously as you've seen from the video it shows a film set with a scene
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.200]  that's made to look like desert scenery two professional cameras recording it a
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.680]  lighting rig it all looks very professional so they claim that it was
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.480]  hacked from an aide to John McCain hacked from his quote electronic device
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.760]  during a recent trip to Ukraine that prompted McCain to come out last night
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.600]  and stay on Twitter another nutty conspiracy theory from Russian
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.000]  internet trolls I'm very proud to be target of America's enemies so the
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.480]  speculation is you know was this created by a conspiracy theorist to create
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.320]  buzz on the internet was it produced by the Russian hackers themselves which
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.320]  seems like the most likely explanation or is it taken from some kind of
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.920]  theatrical production or movie we know that a film out of Turkey depicted a
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.640]  nice is heading so it could be one of those three it seems more likely to be
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:10.320]  an attempt to embarrass John McCain because in this tweet he also talks
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.080]  about oh they doctored photos of me meeting with ISIS leaders there was
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.560]  some speculation about that when he met with Syrian rebels but by the way he
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.440]  defended those visits against Senator Paul three years ago and two years ago
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.640]  and admitted it and said I'm proud of it you should meet with him too so he's
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.600]  been caught in a big lie I wasn't aware that he did that Paul wow I mean he
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.600]  responded but I hadn't read your article yet because it just came out that is huge
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.120]  do you have it in the article because my memory serves McCain admitted he met
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:50.080]  with him no we've got the photo in the article where he's meeting with Abdel
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.320]  Hakeem Bell Hatch who was the guy they empowered on to overthrow Gaddafi in
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.840]  Libya he's now the leader of ISIS in Libya and McCain was pictured with
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.920]  Lindsey Graham presenting him with an award so yes he has been pictured with
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.080]  actual ISIS leaders he also met with those Syrian rebels who later defected
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.240]  to Jabhat al-Nuzra and these other jihadist groups who were almost as
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.480]  barbarous as ISIS so again yeah that smacks of desperation he's been he has
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.200]  to draw attention to that when it's been proven that he has met with ISIS leaders
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.400]  like Bell Hatch so it's very interesting that he would even mention that in this
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.960]  context but Paul if you go back to when that happened three years ago he
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.120]  defended it on the news and said of course I'm listening to rebels you know
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.880]  I've got courage to go in there and do this so he's on record admitting it and
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.080]  defending it and now I just saw his tweet saying he didn't meet with him he is
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.880]  incredibly arrogant no he's being caught in a flat out lie once again but it
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.720]  doesn't seem to have bothered him in the past but again the question is if this
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.200]  was a fake why would they be off filming it in the background if it was a top
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.000]  secret operation why would they allow that footage to even exist in the first
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.080]  place which is why people are saying this is an attempt by the Russians to
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.600]  frame McCain to frame the US in general as being behind ISIS which we don't need
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.040]  the conspiracy theories to prove that because we know you know they were
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.520]  trained in Jordan many of America's top allies are funding them have been
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.840]  funding them those mysterious airdrops of weapons from the US always end up in
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.560]  ISIS so those are the real facts that prove that well all I'm saying is I've
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.840]  seen one of the beheadings where it was in the desert and looked fake and it
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.440]  looks like the same background so whoever staged this and it is staged did a
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.600]  really good job of what I've seen in the fake beheading videos and we know some
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.440]  of the beheading videos we've seen have been cinematically shot pointing
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.400]  towards the fact they're staged thank you Paul Watson great job more of your
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.720]  articles on prisonplanet.com last week after the courageous vote of the Greek
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.360]  people to not accept a bailout from the EU World Bank regime UKIP leader Nigel
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.880]  Farage urged Greek Prime Minister Alex Tsipras to throw off the shackles of EU
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.920]  domination and embrace the hard path towards his country's independence and
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:20.560]  democracy but sir you cannot have your cake and eat it they will give you
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.400]  no more these people they can't afford to if they give you more they'll have to
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.560]  get other eurozone members more so your moment has come and frankly if you've
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.120]  got the courage you should lead the Greek people out of the eurozone with your
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.840]  head held high get back your democracy get back control of your country give
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.640]  your people give your people the leadership and the hope that they crave
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.920]  Greek comedians this is Rambos quantified the rollercoaster ride of the
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.180]  Greek people's vote of no and the leadership's vote of yes when he said
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:58.000]  Greece is the only country where no really does mean yes John bound for

[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.720]  news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've been

[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:30.040]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:36.120]  Larry Elder is a best-selling author syndicated radio host and a
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  really smart fella Larry Elder.com is one of his websites he joins us for the
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.120]  next 40 minutes or so then David Knight will join us from our situation room
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.840]  with some breaking news and some analysis and then we've got CIA whistleblower
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:59.160]  on Benghazi with breaking information Tosh Plumlee joining us in the third
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.360]  hour look at this story out of Breitbart Mexican drug lord El Chapo they got
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.000]  tweeting at Donald Trump saying I'm gonna get you told his wife to give birth to
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.360]  anchor babies in the US so they'd be US citizens and could be paid for so isn't
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:23.600]  that just special it doesn't illustrate everything that Donald Trump is saying
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.320]  you cannot make this type of stuff up I mean I can't go to Mexico with a woman
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.640]  my wife or whoever and just have a baby for free they laugh at me and then have
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:41.440]  the baby get welfare but because Obama says America has racism in its DNA well
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.160]  we want to show we're not so we're gonna pay for it all I mean it's a joke and
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.280]  then Donald Trump is saying things that are true and the media acts like he's
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.200]  saying incredibly insane things and that's what Larry Elder is here to talk
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.840]  with us about but now the NAACP wants Stone Mountain Confederate generals
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:10.000]  Sam blasted off Mount Rushmore so so they want that blasted off what's next
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.240]  Mount Rushmore well I said it before Rush Limbaugh and I said it before and
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.120]  I'm not bragging I'm just I don't say this up as hyperbole and I said it before
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.520]  Lewis Farrakhan on record a week before I said are they gonna ban the American
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:30.480]  flag because it flew over indigenous servants slaves you name it every flag
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.560]  more than 200 years old flew over slaves I mean the Bible the Old Testament
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.800]  everybody had slaves black Africans had slaves people in the Middle East had
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.120]  slaves I'm not defending and I have no connection to it most white people that
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.240]  have come here came here after slavery they're great grandparents did I mean
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:52.800]  it's just it's this crazy guilt that I'll be honest I grew up with some of it
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.840]  which I guess since we were close to some bad stuff in the past it was good to
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.160]  like be aware of it but now jumping the shark don't have brown bags in Seattle
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.120]  and the name mom and dad is hurtful so get rid of it on government documents
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.440]  and boys and girls at public schools can't be called that because some people
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:17.360]  aren't boys or girls so your purple penguins and and and telling a minority
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.360]  you know good job they tell the faculty don't do that it's condescending it's
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.880]  turning us into mentally ill basket cases but still worse it's causing a
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.920]  backlash and making people that weren't racist then project the political
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.960]  correctness on to people not understanding it's the political class
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.520]  engaging in this that's my view on it we're gonna get Larry elders take on it
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.480]  now but I tell you Larry I see this stuff going on on the news and I can't
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:53.360]  even believe it it's so ridiculous it's like satire it it's like a Monty
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:12:00.600]  Python episode I mean does the control crazy left realize how whacked out they
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.640]  are I mean they're running things they must know what they're doing what's
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.960]  happening here no no they don't realize it and Alex thank you very much for
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.040]  having me on 95% of black voters voted for Barack Obama and the black
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.760]  economic condition is worse off than when Obama took office black income is
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.880]  down black net worth has down about a third over the last few years the so
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.320]  called wealth gap between whites and blacks is the widest has been in 25
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.640]  years I don't know what more Obama could have done to the black economy other
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.680]  than take a baseball back to it and still he is celebrated by black voters I
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:41.000]  don't get it the primary problem in America is not police officers going
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.640]  after black people's not the Confederate flag it is the implosion of the black
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.680]  family back in 1955 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock now Alex
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.040]  the number is over 70% I didn't say this Obama said it you grow up without a dad
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.640]  you're five times more likely to be poor nine times more likely to drop out of
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.400]  school 20 times more likely to end up in jail do the math why are we talking
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.680]  about that how do we go from nine innocent worshipers in Charleston being
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.440]  murdered by this guy to a discussion about the Confederate flag it is just
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:18.200]  bizarre and in 1963 Alex four black kids were bombed in Birmingham and that
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:23.120]  time George Wallace was the governor of Georgia the one is the segregation now
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.440]  segregation forever the chief cop was a guy that sacked waterholes and dogs on
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.640]  black people the Klan was so virulent they called Birmingham bombing ham
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.400]  because there were two or three bombings just that very week fast forward to now
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.040]  the South Carolina governor is a woman of Indian descent one of the two
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.280]  senators is a black person and we're still talking about racism in America
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.820]  give me a break this is not your grandfather's America for crying out
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:55.800]  loud and I guess the controlled left uses race to manipulate people and to
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.200]  divert off the real issues and so they're desperate to I guess reassert it
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.560]  on a new generation to create more division I mean what are they trying to
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.920]  do that's exactly what they're trying to do they can't talk about economic growth
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.600]  because this recovery has been the worst one arguably we've ever had certainly
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.040]  the worst one since the Second World War so let's divert attention let's talk
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.480]  about racism let's talk about Rachel Dolezal let's talk about the Confederate
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.520]  flag let's talk about anything other than the damage the left has done to the
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.680]  black family to the inner cities the black income Alex I wrote a book called
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.160]  Dear Father Dear Son and I urge your listeners to just read the reviews
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.160]  before you decide to buy the book it's about my father who did not know his
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.560]  biological father no I've read the book I couldn't put it down I read it a couple
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.920]  years ago when it came out thank you he grew up in the Jim Crow south and he got
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.040]  kicked out of the house by his mother when he was 13 years old never to return
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.320]  and my father was a Republican and he believed that the biggest thing that
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.240]  happened negatively to black America was a welfare state and my father told my
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.200]  brothers and me don't listen to other people talk about how horrible the
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.240]  country is because it's substantially different than it was when I grew up
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.280]  hard work wins you got a life which you put into it and why you can't control the
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.240]  outcome you are 100% in control of your effort and before you bitch and moan and
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.280]  whine about what the man has done to you go to the mirror look into the mirror and
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.200]  find out whether or not you could have done something to have altered the
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.840]  outcome that's what my dad told my brothers and me that's what I believe now
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.120]  but but Obama has convinced black people that that they're victims and that
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.760]  those guys over there the Tea Party or Republicans black Republicans they're
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.640]  victimizers and by the way we're the rescuers were they in that we're there
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.640]  in the white hat on the white horse we're gonna come in and we're gonna give
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:35.240]  you social justice never mind economic growth never mind the implosion of the
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.880]  black family never mind the implosion of black home equity never mind black
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.040]  home ownership down never mind any of the other metrics I just now gave you
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.680]  let's call America inherently racist say it's in our DNA and give this black
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.840]  people to pull that lever 95% for us and by the way Alex if racism is in our
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.640]  DNA how do you go from 1960 according to Gallup
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.640]  60% of Americans said they would never vote for a black president no matter how
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.440]  qualified Obama of course gets elected in 2008 gets reelected in 2012 despite
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.200]  a lousy economic recovery and unpopularity of Obamacare in 1955 only
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.960]  4% of blacks of whites and blacks in America said that they approved of black
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.720]  white marriages and now 87% of Americans approve of black white marriages so if
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.200]  it's in our DNA how do those things change it's nonsense Obama got a higher
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:28.400]  percentage of the white vote than John Kerry did the Kerry wine about being
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.480]  affected by racism because he didn't get the majority of white votes it's
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.000]  outrageous what the left has done to convince black people that that they are
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.640]  victim that racism remains a major problem in America when it is not and by
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.400]  the way pull the lever for the left wing party because we're gonna fight social
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:48.320]  justice on your behalf it is outrageous my problem is there's no doubt the
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.360]  Republicans have a better platform and better more Americana ideas that will
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.920]  make us a successful country and what made us so great and they're the party
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.560]  that helped in slavery they're the party that passes civil rights act it is an
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.560]  inverted reality that we see here but the Republican leadership now goes
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:12.200]  along with the Democrats and never really calls Obama out on what they're
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.520]  doing and so until that happens I don't think this country has a prayer
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.320]  because I grew up in Dallas Texas and you know going to high school there I
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.440]  mean probably a third of the high school or more was black and most you know my
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.160]  friends and sports and stuff were black there was some racism back and forth but
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.880]  that was mainly between hillbillies and who were racist and black folks that were
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.720]  racist but it but it wasn't anything like it is now where you're just bombarded
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:44.480]  with it I mean it is just insane yeah the Republican Party interesting that
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.400]  Eric Holder said that America when it comes to race is a nation of cowards I
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.280]  would say Republican Party when it comes to race is a party of cowards instead of
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.720]  saying what I just now said it's oh I'm once March with Martin Luther King 50
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.880]  years ago I care I care what you ought to be talking about is the damage the left
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.680]  has done to the black middle class the damage things like race-based preferences
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.320]  they've done they've created a higher dropout rate among black students they
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.240]  get in under race-based preferences they ought to be talking about the damage
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.560]  done to the city through urban renewal and through forced busing they ought to
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.240]  be talking about these lousy government schools where 50% of blacks drop out of
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.920]  school and those who graduate cannot read writing computer grade level instead
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.080]  we're talking about what the white man has done in the Confederate flag and
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.680]  nonsense it has nothing whatever to do with the current plight of the black
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.600]  middle class well I think you've really hit the nail on the head there when you
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.560]  talk about they've taken our basic freedoms they've taken our economic
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.000]  future they've taken our jobs and then all they give us is identity politics
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.520]  that's why they're now drilling down into saying transgender don't say dad and
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.240]  mom don't say husband and wife don't say boy or girl they're doing this with a
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:59.080]  straight face to just kill any identity that isn't just worshiping the state and
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.840]  that is why Alex Trump is resonating and if I were Trump I'd broaden the
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.680]  argument he has not made the argument that illegal aliens pose a threat to job
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.120]  prospects of people living in the inner city a friend of mine is named Peter
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.520]  Kerson now he sits on the US Civil Rights Commission he's black and he said
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.120]  that all three sectors of the Commission are moderates conservatives and liberals
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.520]  agreed to a letter they sent to Marshall fudge a woman who's on the
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.280]  congressional black caucus caucus and said what's going on why aren't you
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.480]  stopping these porous borders you're threatening the jobs and the promotions
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.280]  of inner-city people most of whom are black people and he said he hasn't even
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.200]  heard back so what Donald Trump should be talking about in addition to talking
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.240]  about the illegality is the threat that illegal aliens pose the job prospects
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.400]  of people living in the inner city sure and nothing against the people pouring
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.120]  across wanting a better life but here's the bottom line a lot of more criminals
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.280]  fleeing justice and that's a fact but more importantly they are colonizing the
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.800]  former black areas and pushing the blacks out and taking the jobs that's why
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.560]  the unemployment doubled when the day comes where the world changes forever

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:18.080]  Jones syndicated radio host best-selling author Larry Elder is our guest till
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.280]  about 40 after this is a short second we'll be back with us in the next
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:27.720]  segment elder statement calm Larry elder calm are his websites Larry I want to
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.680]  get into the Donald Trump phenomenon because the mainstream media wouldn't
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.760]  be saying his name thousands of times a day and misrepresenting what he's
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.680]  saying if they didn't have a plan I think it is to distract from the other
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.920]  Republican candidates thinking that Trump isn't serious is going to drop out
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.480]  later that's just what my guts saying but regardless he's saying things that
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.120]  are true so he has to be defended but I know he's a really smart guy he doesn't
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:25:00.080]  seem to defend himself very well in the way he's responding to a lot of this but
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.360]  you were getting into black unemployment that as you were just saying has
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.800]  doubled the last seven years and there's incredible friction between the immigrant
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.240]  community that's mainly Hispanic and blacks that's that's in local news where
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.040]  do you see all this going well I disagree I think Donald Trump has been
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.320]  defending himself just fine by not apologizing but not backing down the way
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.200]  Republicans normally do recall when Todd Aiken said legitimate rape all he was
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:30.120]  saying is some women in fact lie about rape not not very many do but about 10
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.080]  percent apparently do all of a sudden rents previous dumped on him and Todd
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.840]  Aiken got destroyed in the election Donald Trump has not backed down he's not
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.880]  afraid of being called a bigot and I interviewed Jamil Shaw senior the
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.640]  father of the of the young man who was murdered here in South Central Los
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.720]  Angeles a young man who was bound to go to college and an illegal alien had
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.760]  just gotten out of prison and assumed that the red that Jamil Shaw the second
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.320]  was wearing was an indication of a gang membership when in fact Shaw was not a
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.840]  member of a gang and he got blown away and Donald Trump has brought out Jamil
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.440]  Shaw senior to talk about all of this and to humanize this this is very
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.000]  important sure well I want to be clear I mean I think he has done well not
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.120]  apologizing I just there's so many factoids things you were mentioning
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.520]  that I mean I guess if he had your brain on these issues it'd be better that's
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.600]  all I'm saying is that his brain and his wealth no no I hear you but you're an
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:30.920]  expert on this is what I'm saying and that he just sure he's not apologizing
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.080]  that's 101 don't do that I agree with you he's doing a pretty good job it's just
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.160]  that they're misrepresenting him and I don't think he's been attacking them for
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.440]  their lives he just kind of arrogantly which I guess is a good thing just
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.680]  ignores them and says I don't apologize well that's true but it but it's early
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.320]  he'll get sharper he'll get better he'll get more factoids he'll sharpen up his
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.920]  arguments along the way assuming he stays in and so far it's been pretty
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.120]  darn impressive I was one of those Alex who thought he was never gonna get in
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.280]  every four years he comes out makes a big display about running and then he
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.680]  doesn't run and I also didn't think he had as much money as he says he has
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.600]  apparently he does have 9 million apparently he can sell fund there's
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.080]  never been a candidate like this with this kind of message this kind of name
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.800]  recognition and that kind of bankroll and so this could be this could get
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.920]  various so you think he's serious well it does show the other you know 10 or 11
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.520]  candidates why aren't they getting hardcore on anchor babies I mean El
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:30.440]  Chapo the billionaire drug dealer is on record telling his wife to come up here
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.360]  and have anchor babies we have to pay for billionaire drug dealers kids now I
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.400]  mean this is ridiculous he's also on record threatening Donald Trump for
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:43.400]  crying out loud and this issue is a very important issue for people in living in
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.200]  the inner city and I think once more black people realize he's talking to
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.560]  them and talking about their economic interest it'll be fascinating to see
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.120]  what kind of black support this Republican guy gets well I mean I would
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.440]  certainly rather Donald Trump than a Hillary Clinton in there but in your
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.080]  gut and I really respect your opinion on this you don't think he's some type of
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.880]  ringer just getting political attention for his overall empire oh I think it's
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:10.880]  all of the above I think that Donald Trump feels the worst thing that'll
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.320]  happen is his name recognition will be even higher and maybe he'll make even
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.320]  more money but I don't think he anticipated the fallout I don't think he
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:23.560]  anticipated that ESPN and NASCAR and Univision and NBC would dump him and
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.760]  other people are also thinking about dumping him he may even lose clients in
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.600]  his in his condos who knows but I think overall what Donald Trump feels is the
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.720]  worst that'll happen is my brand will be even bigger but maybe I'll make some
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  noise maybe I'll make something happen and and let's not discount the
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:44.400]  possibility that he's sincere he thinks the country's going to hell in the hand
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.320]  basket he thinks our foreign policy is weak he thinks our deals with the
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.360]  various other countries are weak and he thinks the country's going down and he
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.920]  thinks he as a business person can do something about it I applaud the idea of
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.960]  him going off the grid for this time and spending his time and his energy and
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.040]  his money trying to make the country better as opposed to making more money
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.360]  why aren't people applauding that I guess I have to say I applaud him because
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.240]  he is getting persecuted down he's not backing down and he's not gonna do the
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:15.680]  mis-american thing he's gonna focus on the campaign again though Larry does it
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.960]  this show the other Republicans what they should have been doing the whole
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.320]  time it most certainly does the other Republicans are wusses and that's one
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.000]  of the things that that pisses people off I mean how do we get Obamacare
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.320]  shoved down our throat how did that happen Obamacare unpopular and not a
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.080]  single Republican vote and you guys couldn't figure out a way legislatively
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.320]  of stopping this thing Larry older Larry older comms stay there I want to come
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.400]  back and get your take on how how do we reverse Obamacare how do we control the
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.160]  border how do we stop the hemorrhaging of our sovereignty straight ahead and what
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.600]  is he most worried about with Obama and Obama's last year and a half we're on
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:57.680]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.440]  on Monday Obama's Defense Secretary said that the Pentagon's ban on
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.880]  transgendered individuals is outdated and the administration has ordered a
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.000]  study to end the practice at a time when our troops have learned from
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.240]  experience that the most important qualification for service members should
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:23.120]  be whether they are able and willing to do their job our officers and enlisted
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.560]  personnel are faced with certain rules that tell them the opposite the Defense
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:33.480]  Secretary said in December Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said anyone
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.960]  who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve adding that
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:43.120]  times change it is also supported by the former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.760]  contrast all those statements of inclusiveness with soldiers at Fort

[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:30.160]  of the info war. Final segment with Larry elders and a radio host best-selling
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.800]  author David Knight's got an analysis on all of this that ties together with the
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.320]  national Susan being ordered by a Democrat judge to attend psychiatric
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.360]  counseling for his mental illness the judge is now diagnosing from the bench
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.920]  that he thinks the government's too big and bad that's now a mental illness
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.480]  that's right out of the Soviet Union right out of the Soviet Union so that's
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:02.040]  coming up in a moment again Larry Elder has been breaking down how we're having
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.280]  our basic rights being removed but they're being replaced with infighting
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:15.040]  and obsessing over what color somebody is or where they're from and then the
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:21.040]  sensitivity to it becomes just a ball and chain but what I was getting at here
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.600]  is that what they do with political correctness on black and white relations
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:32.240]  or with the open borders or with kids can't call themselves boys or girls but
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.320]  purple penguins because it's hurtful we talk about this and it doesn't sound
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:43.280]  like reality it sounds like mentally ill cult leaders run the country and so if
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.640]  it's already gotten this bad and they want to kick Donald Trump off the air
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:54.440]  with his TV shows because he said we got a bunch of criminals coming up here to
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.200]  escape justice and they shouldn't be getting their babies paid for I mean
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:05.080]  nobody else allows this and so it is a upside downing of reality what comes
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:10.800]  next Larry Elder and and how do we overturn this how do we defeat this
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.320]  system when the public schools don't teach reading and writing anymore they
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:23.080]  just teach bizarro basket casing of of don't be a boy and girl boys are in the
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:28.480]  girls bathroom girls are in the boys you know you're a purple penguin let's
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:35.160]  learn about your white guilt all day on MTV I mean it's just crazy Donald Trump
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:40.200]  use a term silent majority what people need to do is stand up and defend the
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.680]  values and the freedom that made this country great we need more people like
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.760]  you speaking out I mean it is insane and Donald Trump had the cash used to not
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:53.840]  once not twice but three times when he was in Phoenix a call Al Sharpton a con
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  man who has done that what are the public figure has honestly and accurately
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.960]  called Al Sharpton a con man other than Donald Trump and Donald Trump gets dumped
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.720]  by NBC but MSNBC one of NBC subsidiaries has given Al Sharpton perhaps the most
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:12.960]  notorious anti-Semitic race hustler in America his nightly show for an hour
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:20.120]  Scotty beam me up it's insane you're quoting the late Congressman Jim
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.520]  Travacan I mean it really is time to be beamed up Scotty I mean this is what do
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.640]  you expect next out of this lunacy next thing he's gonna push for gun for
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.120]  further gun control every time something happened like what happened in
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.360]  Charleston South Carolina Obama talks about more gun control now Bill and
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.840]  Roof did not stand up there after communing with these nine innocent
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.960]  worshipers and pull out a Confederate flag and shoot people he pulled out of
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.120]  38 we ought to be talking about whether or not somebody in that church with a
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.040]  concealed carry permit might have minimized the damage we ought to be
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.520]  talking about what's going on in Chicago sure Washington DC two cities with
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.000]  very stringent gun control laws very high per capita murder rate most of the
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.960]  people being killed are black people we're not talking about that though we're
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.600]  talking about the Confederate flag and Donald Trump it is crazy well look I
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:10.840]  don't want to pull up Han Solo here on folks Larry Elder but if I was a senator
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.640]  especially a black senator in the south where there are some crazy racist white
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.760]  people and I'm gonna be given a sermon there's gonna be one of these up
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.520]  underneath the pulpit 357 Magnum you know it's only six shots but I'm a good
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:29.280]  aim with it and I'll be able to defend myself I mean in this day and age we
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.920]  know more guns mean less crime we know these killers whether they be on drugs
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:38.120]  or be racist or whatever only hit people they think are gonna be disarmed
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.480]  isn't it time to start making areas hard targets I mean when ISIS tried to
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:48.040]  attack in Garland outside Dallas it was an off-duty cop took those guys out
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:52.520]  before they could kill anybody I mean isn't that the answer that he pulls
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.360]  that gun out somebody pulls a gun out and blows him away and maybe only two
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.800]  people would have been dead him and maybe the first person he shot I mean
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.400]  isn't that the answer isn't it gun-free zones and an anti-gun culture really what
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.080]  ended up killing these people that that is the answer or at least that that even
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.640]  the odds a little bit for the good guys there are now 40 states that allow
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:18.800]  citizens to carry concealed weapons on a shell issue basis and if it returns us
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.520]  to the so-called Wild Wild West why hasn't at least one of those states
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.000]  repealed it they haven't and speaking of racism obviously this guy was a racist
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.200]  but to act like he's some sort of tip of the spear back in 1969 another white
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.040]  guy named Charlie Manson wanted to start a race war and he had a family and he
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.320]  got seven white people killed over two nights we didn't talk about how much
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.400]  racism there is in America we said Charlie Manson is a racist nutcase and
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.760]  so is this guy so let's not act as if some sort of movement on the part of
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.280]  white people to mow down black people this is a deviant individual who acted
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.720]  in a in evovicious way and we ought not assume that therefore this reflects the
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.800]  racism in America's DNA and therefore a show that were not quote curative
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.280]  racism we're never gonna be cured of racism 10% of the American people Alex
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.840]  believed Elvis is still alive 8% believes if you send him a letter he's gonna get
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.600]  it that's a lot of people in America but you can't act you can't you can't
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.920]  look for Nirvana we're never gonna have Nirvana well I mean he also this this
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.280]  roof guy like to wear black outfits does that mean anybody that's into wearing
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.120]  black like Johnny Cash is a racist I mean it's just crazy you also had a gold
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.920]  t-shirt on and he also had the flags of Rhodesia in South Africa should we ban
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:30.080]  those as well for crying out loud it wasn't the Confederate flag that made
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.600]  him do what he did he's an evil degenerate and should be regarded as
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.920]  such the same way we regarded Charlie Manson well notice both of them were on
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.080]  hard drugs both of them were on hard drugs both of them wanted to start a
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.720]  race war and both of them thought by doing this they would start one they
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.000]  were both crazy they're both insane we assumed man's it was insane and a
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  deviant but we're acting like Dylan roof represents some sort of movement in
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.160]  America when in fact he doesn't sure in fact can we put Dylan roof and Charlie
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.840]  Manson pictures of them up on screen as soon as you can you look at both of them
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:04.280]  they have that crazy look in their eye they sure do and Mike again in 69 we
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.840]  said Charlie Manson was a was a hateful deviant why are we saying the same
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.360]  thing about Dylan roof all these years later after he had an election of a
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.520]  black president and the reelection of a black president I mean I look at Charlie
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:20.040]  Manson and I just see I mean look at them they've got the same crazy look in
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:25.880]  their eye and they were both on hard drugs and in Manson's case he at least
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.760]  had a following a Dylan roof in his racist manifesto complained that he
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.440]  couldn't even get anybody to follow him he said the Klan wouldn't even follow him
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.120]  that's the extent to which racism has reduced as a problem here in America and
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.160]  let's just say it the Democrats that were the party of the Klan are very upset
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.320]  that their race politics might be in trouble so they're trying to reignite it
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.160]  and Larry in closing I want you to comment on this and whatever else is on
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.300]  your radar I've been asking the questions but my concern is you see the
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.000]  knockout game and those are isolated but it is happening a lot around the
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.840]  country you do see racial attacks against whites and the people doing it
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.200]  really think they're doing a good job because the media has told them you know
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.200]  all white people hate you and they're the reason you're unemployed and they got
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.200]  a bunch of young kids hoodlums I mean if you see them the same folks that are
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.080]  robbing people in their own neighborhood out doing this and when it
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.800]  happens the media is even scared to admit it's a racial attack by racist
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.160]  blacks against whites because MSNBC and other con men like Al Sharpton have
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.200]  legitimized it so so if whites are going to be collectively blamed which we
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.880]  know is a fraud for bad white people doing stuff then then then what about this
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.040]  push by the new black Panthers and others to say hey don't mug and thug in
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.920]  your own neighborhood go do it to whitey I'm really concerned with this new
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.960]  thing pull down Confederate flags out of people's backyards I'm afraid there's
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.320]  going to be a flash point here and that the Democratic Party really is playing
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.840]  with fire and I think they're trying to start a civil war and that's what
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.200]  George Soros does in other countries and George Soros is funding all the
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:01.040]  anti-cop stuff what do you think's going on well facts don't matter the fact is
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.640]  that over the last 30 or 40 years police shootings against blacks are down
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:09.840]  about 75% police shootings against whites have flatlined and in 2012 the
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:13.960]  last year the CDC has numbers about 140 blacks were killed by cops over two
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.280]  and a half times that many whites were killed by cops the fact is that there's
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.680]  a study that came out University of Washington black and white cops are
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.760]  more reluctant to pull the trigger against a black suspect than the white
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:27.000]  suspect probably because they feel there's going to be a raft of grief and
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.240]  over the last 10 years about a thousand blacks have been killed by cops about
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.600]  2,000 whites have been killed by cops last year 6,000 black people were killed
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.960]  mostly by other black people Chicago alone about 40 per month most of those
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.880]  are unsolved most of those are by and against other black people and you
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.160]  mentioned violent interracial crime there's about a half million to two
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.640]  three quarters of a million violent interracial acts of crime black white
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.200]  every year that's murder attempted murder manslaughter rape assault with a
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.440]  deadly weapon 75% are black perpetrator and white victim only 15% the other way
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.280]  around and I think because I've read the police reports I've seen the news
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.840]  articles the people say I did it like that guy up in Michigan because they
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:11.000]  were white they somehow think like the Klan goes out and kills some black
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.040]  person and hangs them because they deserve it it literally is like Klan
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.760]  ideology the Democrats are trying to project on the black people it's sick
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.960]  well that's what they're trying to do as I mentioned before the Democratic
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.480]  Party has to make black people feel like victims otherwise how do you justify
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.640]  going in that voting booth and pulling that lever 95% for one particular party
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.920]  you have to malign the Republican Party have to call it public and party
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.360]  racist has to say that they're trying to as Debbie Washington Schultz once said
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.040]  roll back the clock to Jim Crow and convince black people that the man's
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.840]  out to get you otherwise you can't scare people into voting 95% for one
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.040]  party let's not talk about the facts let's not talk about the family let's
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.720]  not talk about what Obama has done to the black middle class let's talk about
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.080]  racism and social justice that's what they're all about because they can't
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.600]  talk about economic growth because they have no story well it's really sad
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:03.200]  because up until Obama got elected I saw a lot of racial harmony people coming
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.920]  together it was just really refreshing and now I've never seen it so energized
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:12.640]  in my whole life not not growing up in the you know early 70s and stuff in the
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.440]  80s and it's just it's so cold-blooded and I could just see the Democratic
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.080]  Party spin doctors the PR firms in their meetings going we've doubled
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.320]  unemployment people are waking up they're upset we're not delivering just
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.800]  create vulcanization it's how the British controlled India with just a few
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.240]  thousand troops was playing different religious groups off against each other
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.480]  and they've just cold-bloodily done this to us Larry and I'm really concerned
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:45.800]  now that they're gonna put Hillary in and it's gonna be not oh you're racist if
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.800]  you don't want Obamacare it's gonna be your your sexist if you don't support
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:54.560]  whatever she's doing and you know it's just so insulting that I would love to
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.040]  have a female president if she agreed with basic freedom I don't care it's a
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.560]  woman or a man you know I like a lot of stuff Margaret Thatcher did it's so
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.880]  insulting to be told I don't like Obama because he's part African or that I don't
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.480]  like Hillary because she's a woman I don't like Hillary because she's an
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.000]  absolute criminal monster it is it is insulting but I gotta tell you I once
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.600]  interviewed coace in Fume one of the few so-called black leaders I was able to
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.440]  get on my program and I said mr. in Fume as between the presence of white
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.920]  racism or the absence of black fathers which poses a bigger threat to the black
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.160]  community and to his credit without missing the beat Alex he said the
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.440]  absence of black fathers so some people are getting it and I noticed that young
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.560]  blacks are far more less likely than older blacks to self-identify as
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.560]  Democrats they're not identifying as Republicans but they're identifying as
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.720]  independence because they see what's happening to their economic future they
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.400]  have no job the black teenage unemployment is up and people coming out of
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.880]  college can't get work and and the saddle with a lot of debt that's right a
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.040]  lot of young people are beginning to rethink their assumptions and so that's
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.480]  probably the only silver lining I can think of to eight years of president
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.360]  Obama and if the Republicans would line up with a more libertarian mindset and
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.720]  would promote things then they would support them but the Republicans are
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:08.040]  so bad at the leadership that I get while young people don't want to be
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:11.320]  involved with them as well Larry Elder thank you so much for the time Larry
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  Elder.com folks can find your books your essays your radio and TV shows

[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.400]  weeks but we're not going to start pre-order until next week to make sure
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.960]  after it's already manufactured then it's got to be tested three times and so

[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.360]  situation room I'm here in the war room at info wars headquarters David Knight
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.480]  Alex I wanted to talk about what's going on with the nation to Susan of course
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.560]  you've mentioned this earlier we have the article up on info wars.com from WND
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:57.960]  Jerome Corsi the fact that this is raw political persecution like we've seen
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:02.760]  before in the Soviet Union or East Germany this is a democratic judge
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.240]  ordering psychological counseling for the nation to Susan and an additional to
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.000]  continue his community service for another four years now and by the way
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.680]  that's super expensive yes yes and this is a situation Alex where the judge has
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:21.320]  overruled the recommendations of two licensed psychological counselors and
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:26.160]  this is Reagan's former top speechwriter and a member of the administration and
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.440]  one of the most successful documentary filmmakers of all time exactly because
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:35.800]  he's a threat to this kind of mindless witch hunts that we see coming on right
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.320]  now throughout everything that touches on the south I mean Alex we've even had
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.360]  Atticus Finch now being reinvented as a Ku Klux Klan racist the guy who was in
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.480]  to kill a mockingbird that goes up against the racist and everybody he's
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:55.320]  now a racist I didn't know that he's now a racist that's the the book that is now
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.600]  being released of course the original author Harper Lee's now 89 years old
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:03.400]  her lawyer claims that she found a manuscript a lot of people said it
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.960]  looks like a fan fiction so I don't know if this is authentic or not or this is
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.360]  just an effort to make a quick buck and to tap into the zeitgeist of the of the
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:17.760]  culture right now to go after yeah this is a race-baiting orgy yes exactly it's
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:23.480]  absolutely insane and of course we cannot have any white men who are role
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.120]  models especially if they're southern we have to that's why he has to be gotten
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.420]  rid of this is racism against Southerners and listen to what the judge said to
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:37.720]  Alex he says I'm not singling out Mr. De Souza to pick on him a requirement for
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:41.080]  psychological counseling often comes up in my hearings in cases where I find it
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.760]  hard to understand why someone did what they did what did he do he didn't fill
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.960]  out some paperwork there wasn't any criminal intent there wasn't anything
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:54.440]  psychological about donating money to somebody he formed a pack that raised
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:59.240]  $30,000 and didn't fill out the right paperwork just like the Texas attorney
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.560]  general who's now about to be indicted so they nail him on a technicality and
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.400]  then what they do is they try to pretend that he is psychologically disturbed
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:11.120]  somehow so they can keep their hooks into him for a long time this is raw
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:16.240]  political manipulation going after their political opponents creating a crime
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.360]  where there is none and yet look at what happened in this article I talked
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.880]  about last Friday when I was on the radio about Eric Holder as Matiabi with
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:28.680]  Rolling Stones pointed out he'd never sent anyone to jail for financial crimes
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.960]  and yet we had large banks that were manipulating the LIBOR exchange they were
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:39.080]  laundering money for drug cartels and terrorist El Chapo that's everybody is
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:43.520]  talking about who just escaped from prison he was head of the Sinaloa cartel
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.600]  and he would they were making videos of them chopping people's heads off with
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.920]  chainsaws and yet Eric Holder couldn't find anything to send this guy to jail
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:57.000]  for it couldn't find anything to send the HSBC people who were laundering money
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.480]  for him they even gave the Sinaloa cartel El Chapo their own private window to do
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:08.080]  cash deposits and withdrawals that's how criminal this organization is and Obama
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:13.400]  said some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street in some cases some
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.880]  of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street wasn't illegal in other words they
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:21.720]  try to make every excuse they can and Matiabi pointed out he said yes some of
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.040]  it wasn't illegal but a huge amount of it was. Here's the deal, Wachovia and
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:31.720]  Wells Fargo got caught running the drug aircraft and owning them and leasing them
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:37.200]  and Holder now sits over the Big Wall Street firm that if they certify what
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.800]  your banker group is doing never gets overturned by the Justice Department
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.880]  because it's the payoff door yes where they go in and out yes and of course
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:49.840]  that's the headline Eric Holder comes in out of the cold back into Wall Street
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:53.480]  we can put that back up on screen powerful photo of him walking off
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.520]  Air Force One for the last time why Eric Holder new job is an insult to the
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:01.880]  American public even Salon that's connected to the White House I don't
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:05.000]  know what they're doing telling the truth says it's a bad thing I mean this is
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.160]  so naked that Dinesh just says no criminal record didn't even have speeding
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.760]  tickets you know you really nailed it Alex a year ago when you did the
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.040]  interviews with Dinesh D'Souza one of the videos that you put up this is the
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:21.640]  title Dinesh D'Souza sentenced to brainwashing camp that's precisely
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:27.400]  what this is this is so over the top and yet you've got Eric Holder who made
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.640]  two and a half million dollars from this law firm representing the big banks
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:37.000]  that he refused to prosecute they even kept his office vacant for him Alex he
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.880]  never really left their employee did he well that's right and and to be clear
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.720]  the reason I said that a year ago on July 14th well I mean today's yesterday
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:53.360]  was the 14th the reason I said that a year ago was because in the prison he
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:59.520]  was in the the the minimum security facility that he was in it was basically
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.760]  just all psychological counseling all day long imagine nine months in there
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.200]  being basically brainwashed yeah yeah exactly and now they're going to continue
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.080]  that even over the recommendations of professional counselors like I said if
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:17.560]  they want to go after somebody you know we see this this kind of like the
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:21.840]  French Revolution the way they're going after every single vestige of a
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.400]  symbolism after the going after every cultural icon of course Disney for the
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.960]  longest time did not allow Song of the South to be sold they said it looked like
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.600]  it was racist because it was about a former slave look Aesop's fables were
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.240]  written by a former slave the real story here is that a slave like Aesop's a
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.840]  slave like Uncle Remus and of course Uncle Remus wasn't a real person it was
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:48.160]  a collection of multiple older slaves that this man had met on plantations
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.040]  when he worked on the plantations himself he put together the stories he
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.640]  told what their names were and that's a story that should be celebrated exactly
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.240]  it's empowering and they wanted band that's what's so crazy is that they
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.680]  want to be able to take down even good things because they know they can do
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:10.320]  that they can ban anything they want anytime they want and that's what we're
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:14.400]  seeing right now they're flushing African-American culture down the memory
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:18.760]  hole just like they are all southern culture and yet the real story here Alex
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:23.720]  as you point out is a slave who transcends his masters we don't know who
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.840]  the master we should ban the movie Spartacus because it's about a slave
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:31.720]  exactly exactly and yet we have the Southern Poverty Law Center Morris
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.240]  D's the founder of them actually worked for George Wallace and the rabid
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.600]  segregation days he actually defended the Klan who were burning buses of
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.240]  protesters who were beating protesters he made enough profit off of that it was
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.960]  equivalent to what the median family income of four was in those days and
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.840]  then Morris D's founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center set out the entire
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:55.480]  civil rights movement about a decade later he was brought back in because he
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.840]  had become a mass marketing direct marketer expert they brought him in for
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.560]  the McGovern campaign then he took that list of people that he got from McGovern
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:07.480]  and started the Southern Poverty Law Center if you want to get somebody who's
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.240]  connected to the Klan if you want to get somebody who is rabidly racist it's
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:17.320]  Morris D's it's not Atticus Finch and that's what's crazy is that the
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:24.120]  Democratic Party was racist was the founder of the Klan they couldn't beat
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:29.480]  Republicans because all these vets were coming back in the South and refusing to
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.400]  be part of the the the oppression that was that was indeed happening in some
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.760]  areas like my dad's dad he flipped being a Republican ran for County
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:42.280]  Government 1 the family wasn't upset with him but he was the first person you
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.560]  know because I mean Texas was Democrat to do that but that was everywhere they
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.480]  came back and they said we're ending this this is over and Eisenhower led that
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:55.520]  movement the Republicans have led that movement and then they flip it and turn
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:01.640]  around and say that the that the NRA is the Klan again it's an inversion of
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:07.000]  reality David well the troubling thing to Alex is that of course the SPLC has
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.080]  been doing this the Southern Poverty Law Center has been doing this for a very
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.840]  long time flipping reality but now we see this going viral going across the
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:18.200]  entire country it's like watching the two minutes of hate from 1984 where
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:21.600]  everybody just screams at Goldstein because they have to have an enemy and
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.960]  that's what this is this is an irrational purging it's an ethnic cleansing
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.600]  don't be mad at the foreign bankers looting you don't be mad at the
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.320]  fluoride in the water don't be mad at all the stuff happening to us just

[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:31.880]  Texas Alex Jones David Knight I noticed there in the studio you've got a stack
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.560]  of other items you wanted to mention got Tosh Plumlee joining us in the next
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:41.320]  segment with more info on Benghazi but first get into those other points from
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.280]  the situation room well Alex you know when we're talking about the coming
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:50.160]  after cultural icons even like Song of the South like Tequila Mockingbird those
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:56.080]  were works of fiction that were essentially uniting fiction I mean they
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.560]  were uplifting they brought black and white together they treated people as
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.720]  human I mean they talk about Atticus Finch many people said well you know he
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:07.680]  was paternalistic he was some kind of a white messiah look no that's why it's
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:10.720]  bad because he takes care of his kids you don't know what happened to his wife
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.480]  that's right he's a strong guy that does the right thing and there was lots of
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.880]  people like that that's that's based on real type characters yeah he's a good
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:23.320]  lawyer all and then so they can't even allow that now and let me tell you if
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.200]  you get in trouble you want a lawyer like Atticus Finch you want somebody who's
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.560]  going to be a messiah figure who's gonna go to bat to you no matter the kinds of
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.600]  pressure that he has to sell you down the river so he's become something of a
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.400]  patron saint to a lot of lawyers as well as to the general population but Alex
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:45.960]  when we look at the way they're coming after people selectively going after
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:52.160]  Dinesh to Suza in this virulent way and yet letting major crimes go unpunished
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.640]  nobody got any personal fines at any of these major banks nobody did any jail
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.600]  time any of these major banks they were laundering billions of dollars and now
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.480]  he goes to work for the big bank lobbying firm yeah that's the former
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.960]  attorney general who got caught running the false flag of fast and furious it
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:13.240]  really is insane but when you go back and look at this and and Rob do has a
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:17.680]  news break where he's talking about the new law that took effect yesterday in
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.920]  Spain massive censorship of freedom of speech and here's one of the things be
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.360]  careful with royal jokes they say any satirical comment against the Spanish
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:32.840]  royal family is now a crime against the crown we're headed back into a medieval
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:38.440]  kind of authoritarian rule and that's precisely why Dinesh to Suza is there
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.840]  they don't call it that but if you're going to send somebody to do hard time
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.120]  because they didn't fill out some paperwork properly there wasn't anything
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.880]  criminal there wasn't anything insane about what he did unless of course like
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.680]  the old joke in the Soviet Union they put you in insane asylums if you go
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.120]  against the government because of course you are insane if you criticize the
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.400]  government that's the kind of government we have now in the Obama
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.840]  administration blatant in your face criminal actions where they go after
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.040]  massive political movements just like they went after the Tea Party people
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:16.160]  using the IRS Nixon was impeached for that when he did it to a few of his
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.880]  political enemies just a couple of the close-knit people that were in the
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.640]  Democrat Party when they burglarized their office now everybody is being
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.660]  burglarized by the NSA everybody is being targeted by the IRS and nothing
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:34.400]  happens evil has basically burrowed out the bottom the bottom's now fallen out
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.080]  the sky's the limit I was reading that article on info wars.com this morning
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.880]  10 things that show there's a major police state I don't have it in front of
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:47.200]  me but I think that was the headline and it's just incredible you can't even
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.960]  criticize the government or the police Spanish are famous for having outdoor
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.200]  parties and meeting together in the town squares that's banned well Alex you
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:04.400]  can get a 30,000 year euro dollar you can get 30,000 euro fine if you take
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:09.080]  pictures of security personnel and put it on a social media page that's how
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.120]  draconian these laws are 30,000 euro fine for taking pictures of security
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:19.040]  personnel and that's because Spain is going into full financial collapse under
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:24.600]  the EU dictatorship and they know that they've got 40% unemployment I mean it's
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.200]  just amazing. And then the same time you've got David Cameron in the UK saying
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.720]  we need outlaw encryption is being repeated by the current FBI director
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:36.960]  because we're all going into economic hard times and we're all going to get
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:42.920]  the jackboot in the face to keep us under control. That's right it's just
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.840]  mind-blowing to realize they're getting ready for a global depression they're
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:52.480]  preparing the population for the screws to be put into us it's unprecedented
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:58.880]  Jade Helm starts tomorrow. We're going to be covering that big time.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.360]  Russian Parliament member Yagivne Fedorov claims that Russian Arlegarks are in
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:06.640]  negotiations with top American corporations and the White House to
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:09.960]  foment an astroturf revolution that will lead to the ouster of President
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:13.200]  Vladimir Putin and the collapse of the Russian Federation within two years.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:17.040]  They're conducting a negotiation process with the Russian elites for the extradition
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:20.640]  of Putin. We know the objective is the destruction of the Russian Federation.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:24.480]  After August through the winter I think by the drop of living standards they
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.040]  will be able to bring out several hundred thousand people into the streets
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.920]  simply because with the help of the government they will severely crash
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:32.840]  people's living standards and this would be especially felt after winter.
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.280]  Fedorov added that spring 2016 could be the time period in which the coup is
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:41.760]  initiated. He also identified John F. Teff the United States ambassador to Russia
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.680]  as being the figurehead behind the conspiracy. Also Russian hackers have
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.160]  released what looks to be a staged ISIS beheading video that the hackers
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:53.480]  claim they got off a John McCain staffer while he was in the country. To read more

[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:30.200]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:37.880]  I have a major blind spot and I talk about it a lot but not enough obviously
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.720]  because we need to stay focused on it we all have this blind spot. Those of us
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.120]  that know about globalism the new world order how the world really works we tend
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:52.280]  to then just get conditioned to accept this stuff going on around us because
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:56.680]  we already know about it as if knowing about it gives us power over it no we
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.240]  have to know about it let me bring in Leigh Ann thanks
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:02.920]  we have to know about it come on up here with me we have to know about it she's
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:05.480]  going to be hosting the show by the way the first 20 minutes or 30 minutes the
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.520]  next hour in overdrive thank you Leigh Ann
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:16.280]  we get to the point of
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:23.080]  just not being shocked anymore when now in multiple European countries
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:26.760]  they are making employees at companies get implantable microchips
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.760]  as the condition of working at the companies
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.680]  or it's in the news yesterday and today major governments
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:38.600]  including the EU admitting that Gardasil is killing and hurting people
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:43.800]  the HPV shot and of course we knew that 10 years ago so why should we talk about
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.720]  it now because folks are now ready to listen
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:54.440]  and I knew about this yesterday didn't cover it
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.600]  and I didn't cover it today and when Leigh Ann walked in during the last
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:05.240]  break and said why aren't you covering this she goes I'm happy to come on
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:08.680]  because I want to get her and others used to being on live because they're really smart
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:11.400]  folks why not
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:16.840]  why do you want me to cover parallel construction that we had with the IRS
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:20.200]  agent a treasury agent discussion where they
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.560]  frame people and train folks out of frame people that was the interview on the
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:26.680]  nightly news last night we're going to re-air it and overdrive then Leigh Ann
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.720]  and Jakari we're going to comment she goes I'd like to talk about her you
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:33.560]  should talk about Planned Parenthood she's like I didn't
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.920]  know they were selling body parts of babies and she like had tears in her
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:41.400]  eyes which is a normal human response and then I got a sinking feeling
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.760]  because I have that blind spot
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.120]  that I've been talking for 20 years about how they sell the baby parts
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.000]  these women go in these abortuaries and they they pay $300 on average and it's
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.800]  been the same price
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:02.520]  since you know I was 18 years old to get an abortion
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:05.080]  I know because I had a girlfriend I didn't want her to have the abortion she
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.360]  didn't tell me she didn't tell me she was pregnant and afterwards she told me
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.360]  she said but don't worry it was only $300 and my mom paid
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:17.560]  and then I learned about the price the last few years it's still $300
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:20.920]  and regardless of what you say about abortion it's a dehumanizing act and
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:24.680]  the reason they don't want to end third trimester partial birth even though the
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:29.240]  babies could be just cesarean and and and saved and and sold for hundreds of
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.320]  thousands to adopters they can get more for their hearts and lungs and
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.720]  livers
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.920]  because you can put them into children and then they'll rapidly grow
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:46.040]  and these women could be if there was a market in this where you grow a baby
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:49.480]  up to nine months kill the day before it's delivered you could get $200,000
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.440]  conservatively for the heart the liver the lungs
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:57.560]  the kidneys I mean one kidney can be 50 grand
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:02.280]  there's two kidneys a liver the heart you get 50 60 grand for a heart
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:07.240]  you get a hundred grand for a liver we're talking 300 400 500 grand but let's
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:10.760]  just say 200 grand for you 200 grand for the abortion wearing
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.960]  100 grand for the broker women that are into abortion
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.840]  in fact these pro-abortion folks that tell us they're Satanist and they love the
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:19.880]  devil they have it on video and that they love killing babies
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:23.560]  well you why'd you pay 300 I mean you could have got
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.800]  hundreds of thousands so create a market in it
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.520]  and I'm being cynical right now because it hurts my heart to talk about it
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.880]  so being cynical and sick with satires a way to kind of
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.080]  have gallows humor here but here's the headline and she's going to play the
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:44.280]  video with jacari some clips of it after we play that other report and
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.200]  they're welcome to the hole next hour if they want
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.040]  some stations still carry the fourth hour I quit doing it for a few years but
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:53.080]  it's still there you're going to overdrive sometimes we're going to bring
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.320]  the whole fourth hour back but it's going to be a news blitz
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.200]  fast-paced analysis magazine shows type fourth hour
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.240]  where I'm there most of the time at some of the time I'm not it's just too
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:11.480]  valuable an hour the stations want it we're going to do it the time is special
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.200]  I'm going to talk plumbly it's just that she walked in totally freaked out going
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.080]  there's video it's in mainstream news they admit it what what
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:24.920]  they sell the baby parts with tears in her eyes that's a normal response
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.440]  yes that's why they like to get them
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:33.640]  as in one piece and the truth is some of these facilities keep them alive
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:39.240]  on a respirator while they chop them up because it takes a while to gut one and
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.880]  to not see you don't want to hurt the the the the arteries you got to cut them
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:47.960]  just right for the surgeons all the organs have got to be prepared just right
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:52.200]  has to be done lovingly delicately and if you're wearing a black tipped hat and
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.560]  had green skin it'd be the most horrifying movie ever
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.640]  wouldn't be a funny witch anymore where they're flying monkeys going I'll get
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:03.720]  you if she was slicing open the baby
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:08.760]  but because it's all cute and funny and a doctor does it it's nice
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:12.360]  but this has been known forever
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.200]  this has been known forever
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:21.480]  and it's just now come out
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:26.440]  but this is what they do now I apologize to Tosh for talking over him I
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:31.240]  appreciate him coming on he is Tosh Plumlee
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:36.120]  is undoubtedly other than Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon papers or
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.520]  somebody like Snowden the biggest whistleblower in
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.440]  modern history he blew the whistle in the 60s he blew it in the 70s
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:48.040]  blew it in the 80s he's one of the top people in the church hearings in Iran
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:51.000]  Contra and because he blew the whistle on
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.840]  criminal activity he didn't lose his job he still was a contractor and is
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:58.920]  still a contractor flying C-130s he supplied Fidel Castro when he
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.320]  was still CIA and he's been death-threaded he's
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.760]  been subpoenaed he's been harassed he's been everything to bring you the
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:11.000]  information and he's got more but he is irritated
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.840]  that stuff that's now come out in Congress and come out on Fox News
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:20.360]  though a bit whitewashed was said here in 2013 and in 2014
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.480]  Colonel Schaefer also said similar things and gotten a lot of trouble
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.320]  so it's important remember what these men went through to expose what Benghazi
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.120]  really was believe me when he's on the government's
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:32.840]  listening but he has a lot of supporters in the government as well the
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:35.560]  government's made up of good and bad people
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.760]  that's why all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.520]  men and women do nothing as as many of our founding fathers said in
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:46.040]  different ways so i want to play a couple minute clip
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.200]  of Tosh breaking down the Benghazi info
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:53.800]  years ago here that's now household information
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.720]  then we'll get the latest from Tosh Plumley here it is again in your own
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:01.240]  words what happened at Benghazi because my intel
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.920]  is from multiple sources they killed the ambassador and his
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:09.560]  crew because they were saying no to giving missiles to al-Qaeda
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:12.920]  they were not only saying no to giving missiles to al-Qaeda that was the second
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:17.320]  deal we were giving a high impact weapon to the Syrian rebels
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:21.560]  but then that group was some of the al-Qaeda members and so on like that
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.560]  would still for those weapons and use them against our people
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.240]  the story about someone doing a film that made the people go
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:35.960]  radical and go crazy over there was a cover story who's to cover a top secret
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.720]  ongoing operation of arms shipment to the Syrian rebels
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.120]  period before our president commander-in-chief
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:49.800]  decided that we needed to arm the Syrian i am not a conspiracy person
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:53.960]  this information that i got comes from multiple sources
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:58.440]  which it was a very serious situation that was rapidly developing over there
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.360]  by which the state department and other agencies
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.560]  refused or did not get back to them in time because they were concerned to how
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:12.280]  that was going to look politically it would be a political bombshell
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.360]  if it was revealed that u.s weapons at that point in time
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.120]  were being given to factions in the middle east
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.040]  through turkey jordan it would also expose methods and procedures
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:28.920]  it would also expose our cia safe houses that were operating in jordan
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.960]  and other places pakistan and turkey and saudi arabia
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:37.640]  it would expose those operations that were
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.720]  involved it would expose our politicians on both sides of the aisle
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:46.200]  that was involved in a corporate gain the information that i had about missiles
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  um going to the wrong places came two years ago
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:53.960]  it was i think he even talked about on your on your show alex talked about
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:58.520]  here first with you yes yes right and uh and uh at that point i started
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.520]  getting a little heat uh politicians did not some people did not
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:07.480]  want to hear this it was not uh with the administration it was not the policy
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:10.920]  of the administration at that point in time um
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:14.520]  they always see a force gun was talking again
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:18.440]  about things he knew absolutely nothing about well but all the year later
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:22.760]  it was confirmed another thing that was confirmed around that time was the
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:28.200]  training bases that was inside uh jordan um and was also safe houses and
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:32.680]  turkey and jordan uh were us weapons and also russian
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.920]  weapons were being stored in these safe houses and they were also had training
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:41.080]  sites at various places located in Syria jordan and turkey
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.480]  now where did that information come from that information didn't come from our
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.080]  intelligence it came from nato intelligence and other sources including
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.240]  the french all right that's tosh plumley uh we're
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.960]  going to skip this network break because this is so important but no other
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:59.960]  breaks can be skipped so that he gets more time
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:02.760]  that was uh two and a half years ago and then a year ago
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:07.480]  now all of this is starting to come out and tosh is irritated that
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:12.120]  fox news others ignored what he was saying when it first came out now
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:17.240]  they're covering it and now we know hillary was taking money
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:21.240]  from these foreign governments at this very time
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:25.320]  to her clinton foundation when she headed up the state department
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:30.200]  and allowed all this to happen so unbelievable criminal activity extremely
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:33.080]  naked tosh thank you for your courage thank you for
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.880]  coming on i know you've had disinformation campaigns
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:39.240]  launched against you a lot of harassment just department threats
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.760]  since you've been on we've had a lot of escalation as well
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:47.640]  uh for covering this issue but the good news is the info is out so
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:52.440]  go ahead don't pause you've got the floor well okay uh let me clear up a
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:56.520]  couple of things i am totally retired now not indebted to any kind of
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:59.720]  government agency or something like that so that was just the last year or so
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.320]  then yeah right just uh last couple of years
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.480]  and then i sort of got back involved through friends
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:10.440]  through associates uh that knew that these things were going on
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:13.480]  illy blacks uh some of them were getting tired of
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:18.040]  being uh labeled that these were intelligence failures
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:21.560]  that was uh bringing these things to to light
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:25.640]  they were not intelligence failures they were totally political failures
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.320]  uh a lot of us pilots a lot of us ops on the ground
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:34.120]  um we stay in touch with each other a couple of my friends got transferred
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:37.720]  over to uh there are still military active got transferred over to nato
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:42.680]  intelligence and uh and then that's how i sort of got
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:47.240]  back involved in this and um become an investigative reporter if that's
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:52.120]  what you want to call it so uh at the time two years ago when we
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:56.120]  were talking about this um these were allegations
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:00.920]  um and these were mostly labeled by this administration and the state
[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:05.800]  department as being conspiracy oriented uh politically out to grind
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.880]  someone down or something like that that was not the case so
[02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:14.360]  what i started doing was uh as you know started pulling all this
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:19.080]  information together that gets buried by mainstream media scattered out there
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:22.520]  to where the average person cannot even find it
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.920]  uh even if they're looking for it or they know where to go to find it
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:31.240]  so i started uh facebook using that facebook as a tool
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:35.880]  not as a gossip rag but as a tool to bring all this information together
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:39.960]  about Benghazi and other illegal activities uh
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:44.280]  in reference to international gun running uh that was going on
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:48.920]  within our government um there are some damn good people inside our government
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:53.320]  as you mentioned earlier uh and then also there's some very bad eggs uh
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:57.880]  so i've been privileged if that's the right word to use
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:01.560]  to watch this thing unfold for over 40 years
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:07.320]  i've been in and out of ops i've been chest ties i've been shot at i've been
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:11.240]  anyway but it's not about me it's about the operations
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:16.520]  the operations that we get involved with the operations of how they become
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:21.400]  infiltrated by political interest uh how we are not allowed to do our
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:25.080]  particular jobs uh and upholding the constitution
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:30.840]  and protecting our destination because of infiltration with political
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:35.000]  agendas uh so i don't want to ramble and all that kind of stuff the reason you're
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.840]  not rambling i mean break it down all right the reason i got back and
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:43.000]  started touching got back involved on this and trying to stay focused
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.600]  on the Benghazi thing there's so much corruption
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:50.520]  going on out there within this government within this administration
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.400]  within the state department within the doj so much corruption based on
[02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:59.800]  political interest that uh it's appalling to me
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:03.880]  and i believe as an american citizen is my responsibility and it also is a
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:08.040]  past military cia operative uh dating all the way back to the
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:13.240]  cuban era all the way up to now um uh taking the shots taking the hits
[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:16.920]  taking the discrediting taking all the other stuff i believe is my
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.800]  responsibility to say okay talk about what you know
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:25.560]  and bring it all together into one place and let's get it out there so
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:28.760]  anyway that's where i focused back on Benghazi
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:31.960]  two years ago this information was available to mainstream media
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:36.200]  mainstream media is totally controlled by the man if you want to call it the man
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:41.800]  by our political interest uh we do not have uh investigative reporters we
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.800]  have a few uh that work the the beats but they are
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:50.360]  controlled by political interest and also senior editors
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:53.240]  and they cannot get their particular stories
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:58.600]  forward that's the same case and and this deal with Benghazi
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:03.880]  good investigative reporters have this story they have had this story for years
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:10.520]  but they're blocked because of state department because of stone vaulting
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.960]  because they can't get their uh information
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:17.160]  even though it's highly vetted from many many different uh
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:21.400]  creditable sources they can't get it past the gatekeepers that are now in
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:25.080]  mainstream media and i'm talking about all the major networks
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:30.040]  and all that so now the good thing about the internet
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.040]  is that now we and those people that really want
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:37.400]  you know whistleblowers i'm not crazy about that term
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:41.560]  truths uh people trying to get their stories out the only place that they can
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:44.920]  get them out is on programs like yours alex and other programs
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.920]  hagman and hagman and i won't name them all but there's a bunch of them
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:53.480]  coast to coast uh anyway and i've been on all of them
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.600]  and i but i've been consistent in what i'm saying
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.040]  in other words we have a government now that is
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:05.320]  a we and they we have an environment in this country that is now a we and they
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.640]  situation we have been desensitized to where
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.640]  we accept whatever they tell us they manipulate them
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.320]  news media they manipulate the reports and i don't want to get on the soap box
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.840]  and start ranting and off on all this kind of stuff these are established
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:25.560]  facts anybody can check them out now the reason that uh i've zeroed in and
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.920]  try to stay focused on been gossy is because on your program
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.160]  you're the first person on the program you and coast to coast
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.440]  were the first persons that actually took this broadcast
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:40.120]  of where we went out and we said exactly what was going on
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.200]  we named stinger missiles missing we named
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.200]  the annex we named weapons coming off of the
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.920]  kadafi stockpiles in libya being transferred into radical groups
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.600]  we made statements that this administration knew about it
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:01.080]  the u.s. state department knew about it the cia knew about it
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:05.240]  the military intelligence operatives out of the pelican they knew about it
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:08.920]  that does not mean that these people condoned it they knew about it
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.160]  but their hands were tied in some cases pensions were involved
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.960]  irs jumping all and so we are the only ones crazy enough to put out the truth
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.200]  so they used us you through these conduits to tell the truth because they
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.640]  were so disgusted well that's what happened with me in
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:30.520]  mexico uh when a friend of mine uh marco news covered it
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:35.400]  um i was contacted by a task force that was working inside mexico telling me
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:38.840]  they didn't that i would not believe what was going on in mexico as far as
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.520]  weapons shipments going into the mexican army and be filtered into
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:49.560]  uh my buddy Joaquin guzman elchopo carl quintero and all this kind of stuff
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:52.840]  otherwise all i witnessed was a dog and pony show that came out of the state
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:55.800]  department and the u.s. government you know i should have mentioned that we'll
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:00.280]  get back into vengazi but promise me you'll talk about elchopo because
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:07.720]  as you just said you know him i know uh yeah i know well
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:10.840]  i can tell you a lot of funny stories about that oh i know this is very dangerous
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.200]  information i you haven't told a lot of it but you better just say it all i don't
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:17.800]  want to come in after us but listen let let's just get into all this now let's
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.600]  go ahead and get into the you were upset about the fact
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:23.480]  that they're now covering some of vengazi but not all of it get into it
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:28.600]  well okay uh the vengasi thing came to me from a
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:32.760]  nato source that had worked to mexico beat back in 209 208
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:37.320]  209 and 210 the house of death and uh and the
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.960]  whole fast and furious program they also got shoved under the rug
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.040]  so those sources eventually went to drone school
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:50.440]  up in nevada and then got transferred over to a nato outfit over in europe
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:55.000]  uh as a result of that some of the c 130 pilots that i i didn't fly these runs i
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.840]  flown earlier runs for the government but in this
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:01.880]  particular case i was more of an investigative reporter at least that's
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:06.280]  what i was passing myself off as and they were in turn passing this
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:09.480]  information back to me they were flabbergasted about how
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:13.320]  openly this information was going about refueling
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.240]  c 130 is packed with arms and ammunition going to the middle east and as you said
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:21.880]  it was the state department with its export power that was giving the cover
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:25.080]  and the authorization for things that were clearly illegal
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.960]  and now we know hillary was being paid by foreign governments directly for it
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:35.160]  this is pure espionage well exactly and uh you covered it on on your program
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:39.160]  alex where we i was i i looked straight in the camera like i'm
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:45.400]  looking right now and told you this uh you know and uh so okay then
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:49.640]  then it comes out i'm going to get subpoenaed and so i said one statement
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.160]  to them back that and i think it was grassy or doubly i can't remember i mean
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:57.000]  i thought to me they're all the same but uh and i don't mean that negative or
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.440]  derogatory that's under grassy the boat whoever you know
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:09.480]  whatever they are um um anyway so i um i was contacted
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:14.360]  had this information put it out there that uh
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:17.960]  biggest thing was ambassador stevens found out about the misson stinger
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:21.240]  missiles uh do you have a clip there about mccain
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.480]  saying that uh all the fakes flying all that
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.360]  tell you what stay there we got to go to break our guest

[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:44.360]  and then el choppo that we talked about on this broadcast two plus years ago

[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:03.160]  last week after the courageous vote of the greek people to not accept a bailout
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:06.840]  from the e u world bank regime u-kip leader nigel ferrage
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.840]  urged greek prime minister alex syphrus to throw off the shackles of e u
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:14.920]  domination and embrace the hard path towards his country's independence
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:19.800]  and democracy but sir you cannot have your cake and eat it

[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:33.720]  you should lead the greek people out of the eurozone

[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:50.120]  greek comedians this is wrong quantified the rollercoaster ride of the greek
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:53.320]  people's vote of no and the leadership's vote of yes when he said
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:57.160]  greece is the only country where no really does mean yes

[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.640]  have been vetting some of the information uh to confirm it
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:48.280]  uh just before we uh went on break we were i was talking about the
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:53.560]  statement that senator mccain had made in reference to stinger missiles
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.040]  uh and first i want to qualify something i have absolutely no axe to grind
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.000]  with senator mccain and i have absolutely no
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.800]  axe to grind with with uh uh hillary clinton

[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.960]  take shots at uh sitting military people
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.440]  generals kernels that know this information and that's the reason that
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:23.480]  they have come out and contacted me uh they can't come out and some of them
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:27.320]  have by the way but they've lost their jobs they've had iris attack them they've
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.760]  they've gone through the gamut they've paid some dues and so like that but
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:35.320]  anyway i'm back to what the statement was about the stinger missiles i was
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:38.920]  privy to information about stinger missiles being
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:43.240]  rerouted into ices hands through the direct commercial sales program that
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:47.320]  was monitored out of the u.s state department also known as the blue
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:51.560]  lantern report uh bill conroy of narco news that wrote
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:54.760]  an extensive article about the direct commercial sales program
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:58.040]  and how it works i pulled all this information out together
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:01.320]  put it in one place put it out on facebook page for any
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:04.920]  young cub reporters so that they could go out and investigate to invent the
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.640]  information for themselves what we run into was the fact that there was 400
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:13.480]  stinger missiles missing that were shipped in c 130 through the direct
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:18.280]  commercial sales program to the middle east they were stored in places like
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:23.240]  gutter jordan and turkey and also some of them in pakistan
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:27.480]  and also some of them in uh and other bunkers in libya
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:32.200]  those places uh they said was overrun but that's not true
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:36.600]  those weapons were also being assimilated to radical groups out of the syrian
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:42.680]  deal i devised 11 questions asking those questions of asking questions about
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.600]  that so anyway get back to the pigs fly
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:51.000]  article one of the reporters and i think you have the clip of that i don't know
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.520]  if you've got time to play it or what but that's on my facebook page and it's
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:58.120]  about uh john mccain was being asked about the four about the stinger
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:03.240]  missiles the reporter said 1500 he made a mistake there there was 1500
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.000]  weapons and now the 1500 weapons that came from the direct commercial
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.920]  sales program monitored by the blue lantern report
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.840]  over overseeing by the u.s state department
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:19.800]  there was 400 stinger missiles in there ambassador stevens knew about this and
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.840]  he had a deal worked out was working a deal now this is military intel very
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:28.680]  sensitive information at that point in time which i've already
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:32.520]  discussed two years ago uh and it was put on ice
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:36.120]  but anyway he had to obtain information and he had a conduit
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:40.360]  to where he could buy back those stinger missiles for $50,000 a piece
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:46.040]  to a radical group uh working in libya i went all over through this all two
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:49.480]  years ago and end up having the department of
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.800]  justice threatening me with a subpoena and all they wanted was to me to tell
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:56.520]  them where and how i received that information
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:00.040]  they were not interested in investigating that information
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.880]  so i went one step further and i said okay
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:09.400]  so i talked about bengasi i talked about the um
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.520]  ambassador uh approaching the u.s state department to buy back some of those
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:19.240]  weapons especially the stingers shortly after that we got a helicopter shot
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:21.560]  down they didn't admit it but it was with a stinger
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:25.640]  missile we also okay mccain made a statement
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:29.080]  oh yeah where are you getting this information oh it's erroneous information
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:33.000]  i know these people they're good people
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.240]  you know and now he says it's a conspiracy theory he never met with
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:40.440]  members of isis but he's on video giving an award
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.120]  with lindsay graham to the current head of isis
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.960]  he simply controlled like a lot of the other people he sold his soul to the
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:52.040]  damn devil and that's as simple as that i have nothing against mccain
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:56.040]  but for him to sit there and make a statement when pigs fly
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:00.840]  and then two weeks later those missiles were marching on bat
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:05.000]  bagdad and they were photographed in the back of a brand new pickup truck with
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.480]  an american made 50 caliber machine gun point and skyward at a helicopter
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:14.120]  now that's a fact now mccain says oh yeah plumbly says
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:18.040]  when it pick when pigs fly in the sun uh rises in the
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:22.440]  west uh and he knows these people and they're good people
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.480]  all i know is that our american forces someday will be facing those stinger
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:30.520]  missiles and helicopters and it's already happened
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:35.560]  now i don't want to get all you know all excited
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.520]  we just watched those against what this administration once done they labeled
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:44.120]  it as conspiracy i am not a conspiracy freak as they
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.600]  like to say i'm stating a fact these facts that i'm telling
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:53.800]  to right on this camera right now came from the pentagon the us pentagon
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:57.560]  through military sources that were active in that region
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:01.320]  they reached out to me because they knew i would have the
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.280]  stuff in under my armpit to go on camera and say hey this is what they told me
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:09.560]  this is what you can vet this is where you can go to vet it
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:13.320]  and this is who you can talk to all right so i did that i went into a
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.720]  warehouse in mexico i saw where the mexican army was getting u.s weapons
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:22.600]  and they were passing those weapons to uh uh to the uh
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.720]  all right that happened that's a fact well let's now come out that the cia was
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:32.440]  involved with seno loa nl chopo and let's talk about chopo now
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:35.960]  all right well okay we got the missile situation straightened out anyway
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:40.120]  ambassador steven's two weeks later he was dead along with his crew
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:44.360]  all right now let's talk about and that was done why from your sources
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:47.800]  so again because he was getting ready to blow the whistle on the facts that
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:51.880]  these weapons 1500 of them was coming from c 130
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.400]  sure authorized by the direct commercial sales program which is
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:59.160]  monitored by the state department or supposed to be monitored by the state
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:03.480]  department circumnavigated congress and sent those weapons to libya
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:07.240]  and then uh hillary pulled events fostered on him and everybody else
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.600]  now now now let's expand before we get into el chopo and the other stuff
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:13.000]  here on record to congress with and the rest of it
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.880]  with robert tosh plumley his facebook is robert tosh plumley
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.720]  so that's the proper facebook for him you can log in there and read it all
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.320]  uh but robert and robert i would recommend you make it public because
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:28.920]  you've got it where people got to be a member or logged in to get it i would
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.680]  make it an open website to ever administers that
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:36.040]  you will get a tax and stuff on there but who cares i would just go ahead and
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:40.680]  open up for everybody but we've also mirrored the intel
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:44.840]  i talked my website i mean my facebook page was open up to everybody i
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:49.320]  thought it used to be it's on login now but but we'll check it it's no big deal
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:52.520]  we'll also mirror the latest info and info wars dot com but
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:57.560]  expanding on that you were there in the late 50s i mean you're a famous guy for
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:00.360]  folks that are informed for people that don't people don't know who
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:03.560]  you know chuck yeager is is an example i've used
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:07.080]  they don't know who uh you know anybody important was
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.120]  or is because chuck yeager is alive but i mean you're a famous guy in class time
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.200]  operations you're in i've said does it's more like hundreds of books
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.960]  you were there flying arms into fiddle castro that's been declassified when he
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:24.520]  was a cia operative uh you have just been involved in all of it
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:29.000]  you blown the whistle major times three times uh it's amazing just retired a
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.080]  few years ago that said government from my
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:38.040]  view really has gotten more reckless uh and more out of control i'm not
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  lionizing government of the past but the recklessness
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.720]  to give thousands of high impact weapons thousands of missiles
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:49.960]  400 500 stingers uh other heat seeking missiles
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:54.040]  and i got this from colonel shaffer by the way uh pretty soon as well i ran all
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:56.920]  this buying from you and he said yeah that's what we're getting and then he
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:02.520]  got called in and chewed out uh that all the rebels 99 percent are al-qaeda
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.040]  ices is just their new name our government's funding them to destabilize
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:09.240]  the whole middle east i can't think of a time where our
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:13.560]  government funded radical hardcore jihadis to overthrow our allies in
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.960]  egypt to butcher every christian they can find to blow up churches in syria
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:24.760]  to attack our own troops in iraq i mean this is really a policy shift to do
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.920]  to do it so naked i mean they've done some bad stuff before but
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.800]  this is america really being the bad guy so i want to ask you
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:38.040]  why did hillary and mccain and obama and the people above them
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:41.080]  think they could get away with this i mean i guess they are but
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:45.800]  it makes it even crazier tosh that it's come out now
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:48.920]  and it's even admitted and so is fast and furious other things
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.280]  and nobody gets in trouble what does that say tosh
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:56.040]  well all right here's here's the problem we american citizens have been
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:59.560]  desensitized to the point to where we don't expect
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:03.480]  anymore coming out from our government because we've been desensitized to the
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:06.600]  point to where we simply say among ourselves
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.760]  there's nothing we can do about it so we are split
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:14.680]  diversions are a run rampart every time something gets ready to
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:17.720]  pop open it's going to be earth shattering a
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:21.640]  an illegal operation that they're involved with something else comes up
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:24.040]  they call them false flags whatever they want to call them
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:28.840]  you know conspiracies and and all that so then if this goes off into that
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:32.200]  it's all in what someone does with their peepee or whatever there's something
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.640]  something else comes up that takes the the focus
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:39.480]  especially from a young generation away from the actual
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:42.360]  illegal acts that this administration is doing
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:47.160]  bottom line it's all about international gun running
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:54.280]  because guns is more profitable than drugs we've had guns and drugs drugs and
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:57.320]  guns international gun running has been alive and
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:01.080]  well and i've posted this a thousand times on my facebook page
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:05.080]  i've looked at people straight in the eye and say hey you asked me why
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:09.320]  what were it's all about international gun running
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.480]  we have an operation we had it in the 50s we run guns to cuba
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:16.440]  we run guns to fidel Castro before he was dead
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:20.840]  we did that i was i've been all part of that upwards
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:24.120]  the only reason that i ever started talking in the first place was
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:27.960]  to check my butt get the information out there before the fact put as much
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:31.560]  sunshine as i possibly can on it and then let them come take their best
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:34.520]  shot at me which has happened many times and
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:38.760]  thank the good lord i've survived up until whatever but anyway that's not
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.600]  it's not about me it's about the operation so it's an international gun
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:46.040]  running now the the stinger missiles the death of
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.920]  Benghazi the death of brian terry the border patrol guy all this fast and
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.000]  furious all this stuff gets pushed to the back pages
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.800]  by mainstream media and also like i said good reporters that do have the
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:02.440]  story that all do work for the mainstream media
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:07.080]  they cannot get their stories vetted and pass their senior editors
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:10.440]  that are on the take with various administrations politically
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:13.880]  so it's a political thing which now the people
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.400]  us our american citizens have been desensitized to the point
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:21.160]  that we don't expect anymore from our government other than
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:26.040]  corruption uh and we get a new senator in there and he talks and he's going to
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.240]  do this he's going to do that we get a new congressman in there he's going to
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:32.680]  do this he's going to do that but he gets in with that environment
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  there's not a damn thing he can do sure let me expand on this you i know
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.520]  where gary webbing knew him and i was going to work with him on a new website
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:44.440]  he was coming on the show um he he told friends and family people are
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:47.720]  breaking to my house i'm getting followed by feds or pi's
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:50.840]  uh and then they killed him shot him twice in the head and then had folks say
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:55.240]  committed suicide stole his motorcycle everything else and he had a new book
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:58.920]  coming out was going to prove everything uh but of course that guy killed
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:01.960]  it came out later and it's in the film kill the messenger
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:05.480]  that i found nauseating because it was like watching reality even look like
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:10.840]  gary webb uh kill the messenger and in kill the
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.440]  messenger it breaks down the government drug
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.600]  dealing all of it and it turns out that the editor of the la
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:22.920]  times that killed the story that ran stories demonizing web
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:26.760]  was cia so that just shows you but how do these guys
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:32.200]  sit there in the cia and destroy a good reporter that tells the truth
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:36.920]  how do they rationalize all this bringing drugs into america and all this
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:40.920]  crap i mean because the people i've known that were in the cia were
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:45.640]  incredibly patriotic mr america types same thing with the fbi but
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:49.560]  at the top of the fbi it's holder i mean it's just such a
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.720]  parallax view what do you think's going on well that's that's what i've been
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.920]  saying in other words infiltration oh it just takes years to infiltrate
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:04.600]  pocket people into these strategic positions if you notice uh i are not
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:07.560]  just this obama administration but other administrations
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:11.400]  have taken their cronies cronies and neptadism and put these people that are
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.920]  not qualified and put them in very strategic positions
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:19.400]  to where they can control those that want to do something for instance
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:26.360]  um when i was active uh i got a lot of heat

[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:37.000]  and i'm super bad well posh plumber he's a very credible whistleblower and
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.440]  investigative journalist i gotta look him up in the iran contra
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:44.280]  hearings you look him up in the church hearings
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.640]  just retired in the last few years i know when i first had him on he was
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:51.720]  on a phone on a c-130 getting ready to launch as soon as they were done with
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.200]  the call but he's now retired and it's just
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:59.880]  frustrating to watch them kill the ambassador and give the weapons to al-qaeda
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:02.840]  so they can go overthrow regimes and honor enemies
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:07.400]  i mean it's just to see our government doing evil illegal stuff
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.160]  is sickening so you got cut off by the break sir you were getting into
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:14.760]  the points about all this we haven't gotten into el chop choppo yet
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:17.880]  he's big on the news right now can we talk about that drug war and
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:23.320]  what you know about that in mexico well okay well i know about that it was uh
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:27.240]  before he was even captured and they were looking for him and
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:31.640]  and the task force that i was talking about back when brian terry was killed
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:35.400]  um and the fast and furious situation with holder
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:40.040]  was a cutout person for that you know in order to protect the administration
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:44.840]  from their illegal acts and so on again okay what i do know about that is the
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.600]  weapons again it's all the whole thing that we're talking about
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.920]  is based on international gun running period it doesn't matter where's the
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:56.760]  middle east or to mexico now as far as guzman is concerned
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:00.760]  choppo i mean my gosh he's he's been sitting out here in carl quintero
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:05.640]  running around down there i mean jeez it's predictable exactly what was
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:11.320]  what was going on um the cia basically protects these people
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:15.400]  they've got too much to lose now there's good people in cia and they know this
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:19.240]  but they can't come out so they use nominees like myself and others like
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:22.840]  the colonel that you mentioned earlier these people if they're still engaged
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:26.360]  and active in military ops or border patrol or whatever
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:30.760]  they can't talk others if they talk they jeopardize their pension and they get
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:34.280]  irs all over them and then they get diverted into a thousand
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:37.640]  different things where they've got to stand up and waste all their time
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:41.720]  defending themselves through character assassination and i know first hand about
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:45.480]  character assassination they don't kill you so much nowadays as much as they go
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:49.320]  out and use the media mainstream media to character assassinate you
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.160]  and use paid programmer people to go out and let me just throw this out as it's
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:56.840]  happening to me and i don't mind that i expect it because the message gets out
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:00.280]  but they now have a local radio or i live but also i wanted all over the
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.720]  country because they know local media is more trusted now
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:08.200]  than than than dominant media people know it's lying so when msnbc or cnn
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:11.720]  lies about me everybody loves me so they're basically have a talking
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:16.280]  point we've now confirmed going out to all the local stations
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:22.040]  to misrepresent what i have to say well alex is glad the sandy hook kids died
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:26.440]  or or or or alex thinks there's martial law this summer and watch it not
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:29.640]  happen he'll be discredited that's the new talking point
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:34.200]  and they are assassinating me right now with people that don't know who i am
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:36.840]  so they'll just remember that's the guy
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:40.840]  that likes to kill children i mean it's sick to watch it happen
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:45.720]  well welcome to the club alex i mean that's the price that you have to pay
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.680]  both of us have to pay all of us type have to pay
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:51.960]  if we're going to get the truth about what this is what this uh corrupt
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:56.440]  government uh is doing all this look we are
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:01.080]  witnessing a dog and pony show launched
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:05.640]  programmed and produced out of washington dc the ivory towers of those
[02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:09.640]  sacred halls there you know and they honestly think they're so
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:13.080]  arrogant that they honestly think that they have the american people
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:18.200]  desensitize to such a degree that there's not a damn thing we can do about it
[02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:22.280]  we can sit here and talk about it but then we get labeled as conspiracy
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:26.280]  we can sit here and bring it up and fed it up from a thousand different sources
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:30.680]  but the character assassination is there very uh
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:34.040]  i've had some a lot of good friends that's paid the ultimate price
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:37.560]  let's talk about that back in 60 seconds but there's a way around this there's a
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:40.360]  there's a certain point where the corruption gets so big it's got to fall

[03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:10.280]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:16.200]  and the gcn radio network an incredible article from rt and i'm
[03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:21.160]  well aware of this 238 thousand u.s veterans died waiting for healthcare
[03:00:21.160 --> 03:00:25.480]  leaked document document also shows poor record keeping at the agency
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:29.080]  now their job is to not give them treatment and the documents come from
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:33.400]  the va itself this is confirmed they now have computers telling folks who do
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:37.320]  not give treatment to i mean this is sick and it's
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:42.120]  going to get worse this is anyways robert tosh plumley
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:45.240]  his facebook's robert tosh plumley we've got to have him back again for a full
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:48.280]  hour soon to take your calls a true hero
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:52.280]  because in a world of cowards men that just are men or become heroes
[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:56.520]  and uh you've got the last five minutes here get into the friends you
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:00.440]  had that have lost their lives pay the ultimate price tell the truth
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:04.040]  and then i wanted to just mention that there comes a point in the graph
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:09.480]  where corruption gets so bad that it ends up falling in on itself because
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:13.800]  things just stop working and just start crumbling and i think we're going to
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:17.640]  that point so don't get too pessimistic the arrogance of
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:22.120]  tyrants always begets their fall go ahead
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.760]  i agree with you the sleeping giant is waking up i find that out of my travels
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:29.400]  now you know we're getting a little scattered out there where you asked me
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:34.520]  about carl okay cia had memos good good ci people had memos
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:39.480]  that this was predictable as much as hell even before you got arrested
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:43.560]  this has been a planned program here's the main reason there's two drug
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:47.240]  lords out there that they say we are requesting
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:51.960]  extradition on them we have talked about it but we have not filed formal papers
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:55.160]  to mexico the reason that we have not filed formal
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:58.920]  papers to mexico for these two drug lords extradition
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:02.680]  is because if they come back and talk to a federal judge they would tell
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:07.720]  where campaign contributions went to this country and were in how they bought
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:11.400]  military weapons from the direct commercial sales program
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:17.000]  and how they had inside information even before our intelligence operatives
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.800]  got it so what i'm basically saying here and i'm
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:22.360]  going to try to sum it up fast because i know we're
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:26.360]  short on time by the way tosh that was a year after we broke it
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:29.960]  even in the chicago tribune in the alpaso times that the number two of the
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:34.520]  senola gang was extradited to chicago he went and told the judge
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:39.000]  i'm national security agent gave his code he was actually actually an agent
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:44.200]  of the cia and they they were leasing i mean that was in the news
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:48.200]  that look they covered that one up that's a lower level than what i'm talking
[03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:50.840]  about i'm talking about and i specifically look straight in the
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:53.560]  caravan and say it that was that you know
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:57.240]  whatever carl quintero i know the guy
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:02:59.800]  choppo
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:06.040]  cannot afford to make formal requests all we can do sir your skype broke up when
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:09.960]  you started talking about el choppo did you say you know el choppo
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:13.800]  i i know all those guys in one form or another
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:16.920]  put it that way and they know me in one form or another
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:21.240]  and we have a standoff since agreement we don't we don't get into each other's
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:23.880]  ballpark and i'm not getting in their ballpark
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:27.240]  and they're not getting in mind we're playing a tit for tat out here
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:31.080]  now what i was getting ready to say maybe i'm gone i'm out of school again
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:34.760]  i stepped over the line again but here's the point
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:39.640]  those men cannot be brought to this country and i'll sum it up just as tight
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:43.480]  as i can because if we put them in front of a federal
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:46.840]  judge it will be put on the record that they have made
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:51.160]  campaign contributions into political parties in this country
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:54.680]  and they have bought weapons through the open direct commercial sales
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:58.280]  and finance their cartel with us made weapons
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:03.160]  that was almost broken and the iron i'm not the iron constable in fast and
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:08.280]  furious and zambana also in chicago tried to talk to a federal
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:12.600]  judge and they put a gag order around and mainstream media did not cover it
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:17.080]  now that's how it's played these guys it was predictable
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:20.520]  and i'm not trying to rant and get up on the soapbox here i'm just trying to tell
[03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:25.160]  you a straight fact eyeball to eyeball to you alex on this program
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:30.680]  this was predictable it was known about the cia had information
[03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:34.920]  that this all was an ongoing operation and they have let those guys
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:39.960]  out because they cannot afford to file formal papers to mexico
[03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:43.720]  the mainstream media reports this they say
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:49.800]  mexico does not cooperate with us we have not made a formal request for
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:54.120]  either one of those incredible it's a cia drug running gun running operation

[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:33.880]  and welcome back to the special overdrive hour here i'm leon macadoo helming
[03:08:33.880 --> 03:08:37.800]  this ship coming up later in the show jacari jackson will be joining me to
[03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:44.200]  talk about a shock video a top planned parenthood director admits on film
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:48.440]  to selling hearts livers and skulls of dead babies it's
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:52.040]  absolutely repugnant that's coming up later in the show
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:55.560]  but first we wanted to get to this interview that we did on the info wars
[03:08:55.560 --> 03:08:59.800]  nightly news we thought this was very important to show you because
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:03.320]  this affects every american that is out there
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:07.720]  basically you have federal agencies that are circumventing
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:11.800]  the laws they are illegally obtaining information
[03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:15.640]  using it to frame people prop up these fake cases
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:18.840]  and there's also evidence that they are trained
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:23.320]  to lie under oath about where they're getting this information
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:27.160]  uh in order to protect their sources and of course these are
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:30.680]  you know information that they're getting from fusion centers and things
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:35.720]  like that and um also really important to introduce a new
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:39.000]  term called parallel construction and parallel
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:43.480]  construction is basically the term where federal law enforcement agencies
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:47.080]  are teaching their agents to fabricate evidence and commit
[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:50.520]  perjury if that's necessary in order to protect
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:54.840]  and conceal the illegal sources of their investigations
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:59.560]  so incredibly important information here um i was speaking with former irs
[03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:02.360]  special agent joe banister and attorney
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:06.040]  robert burnhoft and attorney burnhoft is the one that is
[03:10:06.040 --> 03:10:11.080]  spearheading this jaw-dropping uh case against the irs and department of
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:14.280]  justice a huge misconduct lawsuit so here's
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:16.760]  that report
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:24.920]  now we're all well aware of rampant misconduct within our federal agencies
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:28.120]  just off the top of my head i can think of uh the irs
[03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:31.960]  targeting conservative groups and then destroying any evidence of that
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:34.840]  destroying the servers after they were subpoenaed
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:38.760]  we've got the department of justice being complicit in shipping guns across the
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:42.600]  border operation fast and furious um former attorney general
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:45.800]  eric holder was held in contempt of congress
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:50.040]  and you know nothing ever happened to him now he's at a cushy job at a law firm
[03:10:50.040 --> 03:10:53.560]  so these are just a few of the examples of how
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:57.480]  our federal agencies are really dealing with their own set of rules
[03:10:57.480 --> 03:11:02.680]  now joining me in studio former irs special agent joe banister and attorney
[03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:06.200]  robert burnhoft now gentlemen you really have kind of
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:10.440]  discovered evidence of kind of some secret police
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:14.520]  activities here legitimately we are dealing with
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:18.120]  agencies on operating under their own set of rules
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:22.440]  yeah that's right lian uh it is a sort of american secret police using
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:27.400]  uh illegally obtained secret evidence against american citizens and then
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:30.680]  lying and concealing the fact that they've done it
[03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:34.360]  um what's happening and uh we have a case in atlanta georgia
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:37.240]  where we filed a federal civil rights complaint
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:40.600]  alleging that it's the first such case of its kind in the country and federal
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:45.320]  court on joe's helping assist with his experience as a former special agent
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:49.000]  decoding some of the reports and and putting his fine eye on it
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:52.840]  but here's what's happening um it's taken a turn for the worse
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:56.280]  in addition to the things you've described um federal law enforcement
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:00.600]  agents are now able to tap into a super double secret database
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:04.520]  of illegally obtained materials foreign intel
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:08.520]  illegally obtained wiretaps unconstitutionally obtained statements
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:12.600]  from confidential informants in this whole pandora's box
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:16.360]  of illegal material they're able to tap into it
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:20.360]  and then use it to start investigations against american citizens
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:24.680]  uh it gets worse from there they are then officially trained and we've brought
[03:12:24.680 --> 03:12:28.920]  with us to the studio today an actual page from the internal revenue manual
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:34.120]  where irs special agents are actually trained on how to fabricate
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:39.240]  uh what they call parallelly construct an alternative
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:43.640]  origin of the investigation and source so that they can conceal the fact
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:46.520]  that they've tapped into the illegal pandora's box
[03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:50.440]  and then finally they're authorized and trained to commit perjury
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:55.560]  to file false affidavits and even to lie to federal judges and juries
[03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:59.160]  if called upon to keep the whole program a secret wow
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:03.480]  so all things that if you or i were to conduct ourselves this way we'd be
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:07.720]  serving years lifetime in prison and these are
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:11.640]  they're basically being trained and how to operate under this
[03:13:11.640 --> 03:13:14.520]  different sort of jurisdiction here so tell me a little bit what is this
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:18.120]  parallel construction yes the parallel construction aspect
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:22.520]  it's an actual official program and it's present in all of the
[03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:26.840]  federal law enforcement agencies uh Reuters was able to find a document
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:30.840]  from 2004 which demonstrates that irs special
[03:13:30.840 --> 03:13:34.520]  agents particularly were trained in parallel construction
[03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:37.960]  and what it means is if i'm a special agent like joe used to be
[03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:42.120]  rather than just do the hard investigative work to detect
[03:13:42.120 --> 03:13:47.480]  criminal activity i can tap into what's called the osedeft fusion center
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:51.640]  at an undisclosed location on the east coast and they will feed me data that
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:56.280]  they think is relevant let's say to my atlanta area of jurisdiction
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:13:59.560]  this is all illegally and unconstitutionally obtained information
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:03.240]  i started an investigation now i'm trained that i can never reveal where i
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:06.840]  got that information from so i have to fabricate
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:12.040]  an alternative scenario for example um Reuters used an example let's say that
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:15.320]  there's a tip that there's a semi truck driving through texas
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:19.080]  and uh there's a foreign wire tap obtained illegally
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:21.800]  uh that suggests there's drugs on that semi truck
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:25.720]  well the state troopers will stop that truck but afterwards they have to lie
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:29.080]  about the fact that they got that illegal tip and so they'll create an
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:32.280]  alternative reality such as oh there was a broken
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:36.280]  tail light or oh we saw the driver swerve across the white
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:39.160]  line or the median line and so there are these special
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:43.400]  agents are being trained to lie and deceive and conceal
[03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:46.680]  i've been doing this for a long time i've done a number of misconduct cases
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:50.200]  i've never seen anything quite like this it's shocking
[03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:53.560]  right and and a lot of people might say well who cares you know they're catching
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:56.360]  terrorists they're catching these criminals that are shipping drugs across
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:14:59.080]  the border things like that but we're actually
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:03.240]  hearing now they're using this in the civil asset forfeiture cases
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:07.160]  so just your average american could be targeted with this
[03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:10.520]  and they don't even know how or why they were tipped off or why they got pulled
[03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:13.320]  over and we have cases where there was a young man on
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:18.360]  a train who had 12 000 dollars taken from him on the spot because he had cash
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:22.040]  and that was his money but you know the cop decided that he
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:25.400]  obtained it illegally so now he has to go to the process and
[03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:28.280]  you know show how he came across that cash and all of that so
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:32.440]  this does affect an average american so this is important it's not just oh well
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.120]  who cares they're terrorists it always starts with the best
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:40.520]  stated intentions uh the organized crime drug enforcement task force which
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:43.560]  joe used to be affiliated with as a special agent
[03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:47.720]  it started off to get the really bad guys uh uh syndicated
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:51.480]  narco terrorists violent international drug gangs
[03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:55.000]  and so that's how the special operations division parallel construction
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:58.840]  program started but immediately they expanded it to organized crime and
[03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:00.840]  money laundering and now we know from our
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:03.960]  Atlanta federal civil rights suit that we investigated for five years before we
[03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:07.400]  brought the suit that they're targeting ordinary americans who are not
[03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:10.920]  even accused of being organized crime figures they have no involvement with
[03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:14.760]  money laundering uh jerry marshall at a junior ran a successful drywall
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:18.200]  company it's it's just they tell us one thing
[03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:21.560]  they get everybody on board okay we're going to go after the really bad guys
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:24.680]  dangerous individuals right and then they use that pandora's box
[03:16:24.680 --> 03:16:28.120]  information and they can go after any american with this material and they'll
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:31.320]  lie about it right well i know just for myself personally
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:35.320]  you know years ago when i heard of of them going and scanning your emails and
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:38.600]  things it was to find pedophiles and you think oh well that's great i don't want
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:42.360]  anyone you know child passing along child born stuff but it's not
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:45.560]  it goes so much deeper than that and you're right they're always kind of
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:50.360]  saying it's for to catch the ultimate bad guy but it's really for the average
[03:16:50.360 --> 03:16:54.280]  american and um so now this osedef fusion
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:58.040]  center organized crime drug enforcement task force so this is
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:01.480]  fusion centers i mean these are all across the united states now set up after
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:07.400]  9 11 is this a specific one or yes this is a specific
[03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:12.280]  fusion center where drug enforcement administration dea
[03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:15.800]  and their special operations division i know there's a lot of
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:20.120]  acronyms sod they have a special secret location where they have the
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:23.720]  dice database in the compass software computer system
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:27.640]  and this is a special database that is used for parallel construction
[03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:31.640]  it's the nexus of all of the materials that are then leaked out
[03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:34.280]  into all cities and districts throughout the country
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:38.120]  and this is what iris agents and fbi agents are tapping into
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:42.360]  um it's notable that uh as reuters reported last year
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:47.320]  there was a case where a high-level policymaker at the department of justice
[03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:51.560]  actually made a secret uh visit to a federal district court
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:56.040]  judges chambers two days before trial started showed him some
[03:17:56.040 --> 03:17:59.800]  sod parallel construction evidence from pandora's box
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:04.920]  and got the judge to sign a secret order barring the defense lawyers or the
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:09.080]  prosecutor from seeing the material this came out on appeal where the third
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:12.840]  circuit court of appeals discovered this they were shocked and horrified
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:16.760]  and they issued a notice that this had to be briefed but the idea
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:21.240]  that an executive branch official from from department of justice
[03:18:21.240 --> 03:18:24.440]  would violate federal law and go into a judge's chambers
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:29.720]  ex parte that's a federal crime and get the judge to sign a secret order in an
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:33.160]  open domestic case when the visa courts were established foreign
[03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:36.520]  intelligence surveillance at court secret courts they said don't worry
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:39.240]  about the secret court proceedings these are terrorists
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:43.640]  well that sounds like fiza to me and even in fiza the government puts a public
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:46.280]  notice out that they're going to use secret evidence
[03:18:46.280 --> 03:18:49.880]  so terrorists and fiza courts can have more rights than american citizens
[03:18:49.880 --> 03:18:54.200]  right now as as to how this is being operated on the ground
[03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:58.440]  okay now we're going to cut this right here we'll have a little bit more after
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:02.440]  the news but joe i wanted to ask you why is this
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:06.200]  why is it so important that we understand that there are irs agents
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:10.040]  utilizing this and this particular document you said is no longer in their
[03:19:10.040 --> 03:19:14.440]  manual well as most americans probably know the irs is a
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:19.000]  is an information gathering agency and they want to know everything about you
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:23.240]  so that they can you know tax it tax you not only maybe what you've
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:29.320]  paid on your tax return but much much more the problem is that this kind of a
[03:19:29.320 --> 03:19:34.520]  of a of a procedure it's actually geared towards
[03:19:34.520 --> 03:19:39.240]  taking down a great deal of people and using the fact that most
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:43.160]  cases plead out and never get to trial where some of this stuff would be
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:46.520]  discovered and most americans are going to be in that boat
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:50.680]  right like wow i'm facing you know x number of decades in prison
[03:19:50.680 --> 03:19:55.160]  x hundred thousands of fines uh they're giving me a great deal
[03:19:55.160 --> 03:19:59.240]  and so it enables them because of the existing plea bargaining system
[03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:02.440]  i'm not saying you don't plea bargain but the fact that it's so prevalent
[03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:06.280]  to actually help them to cover this up wow and so you know
[03:20:06.280 --> 03:20:10.360]  working at the irs and now in the last century back in 1999
[03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:15.320]  i'm just i was floored back then and seeing what i was seeing and now i just
[03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:18.840]  i hope that enough americans are going to be like okay
[03:20:18.840 --> 03:20:23.080]  we all got to get going on this and put a stop to this this is nasty stuff
[03:20:23.080 --> 03:20:26.520]  right absolutely and we we've heard of stories where
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:29.400]  people will actually take the plea because it's they don't have the money
[03:20:29.400 --> 03:20:32.600]  to fight the case and so maybe they're not even guilty but they'll just accept
[03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:36.600]  the plea deal you're telling me that they are committing
[03:20:36.600 --> 03:20:40.520]  perjury under oath yes but originally of course they
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:43.800]  said they wouldn't do that when Reuters reporters contacted
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:48.200]  department justice and daa people uh they said oh wait a minute now
[03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:51.720]  if it doesn't plead out we'll dismiss before trial
[03:20:51.720 --> 03:20:56.040]  we would never have our special agents take the stand swear to tell the truth
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:20:59.480]  and then commit perjury before a jury we would just dismiss it
[03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:03.320]  that turns out to be a lie and we know that because of our investigation into
[03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:06.040]  the marsh led a case in northern district of georgia
[03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:09.960]  and we filed a complaint there in early may we'll get to discovery in a couple
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:12.120]  months we'll be able to depose all these people
[03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:15.960]  but during this trial an ice and custom special agent
[03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:19.000]  and an irs special agent committed streaming perjury
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.800]  regarding the source and the origin of the investigation
[03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:24.600]  and we can prove that through about a hundred thousand pages of documents that
[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:27.480]  we've diced together so this is in speculation these aren't
[03:21:27.480 --> 03:21:31.960]  allegations we can prove exactly where they got the information from
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:36.040]  and how they committed perjury to conceal it so again the government says
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:39.240]  well maybe you have questions about what we're doing here
[03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:43.720]  but but be sure we would never go into a trial setting before an article three
[03:21:43.720 --> 03:21:48.040]  federal district court judge before a jury with a man or woman's liberty on
[03:21:48.040 --> 03:21:51.400]  the line we would never commit perjury to protect
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:55.400]  osa def sod parallel construction information and they're lying about that
[03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:58.760]  as well because they do it they do it every day of the week
[03:21:58.760 --> 03:22:03.640]  and they did it in the marsh led a case and then so in that case
[03:22:03.640 --> 03:22:09.560]  let's see who are we there are many agencies ice irs fbi agents prosecutors
[03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:13.960]  and a sitting federal judge yes the one of the former prosecutors
[03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:18.120]  justin anand was then made a united states magistrate judge
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:21.480]  it turns out that all the people that conspired
[03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:24.760]  to try and destroy jerry marsh led his father's family and the company
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:29.720]  built over 20 30 years they were all promoted it's it's just perverse
[03:22:29.720 --> 03:22:33.800]  wow ice special agent sellers got a cherry job in dc and international
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:37.640]  operations ira special agent in charge andre martin he was
[03:22:37.640 --> 03:22:41.000]  promoted he is in district of columbia with a nice
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:45.880]  excellent job up there former prosecutor anand was made a us magistrate judge
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:49.960]  everybody did well by conspiring to violate the marsh led his rights
[03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:54.200]  and they all did well for keeping the secret and that's what it was about
[03:22:54.200 --> 03:22:57.400]  they lied they fabricated evidence they committed perjury
[03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:01.640]  to keep secret the origin of the false information against jerry
[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:04.840]  and can you explain to me a little bit about of the marsh led a case just so we
[03:23:04.840 --> 03:23:08.360]  can see how anyone could see their selves in the situation
[03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:12.760]  yes jerry owns a drywall company and he was secretly
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:16.520]  investigated for about five years in seven years after the
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:19.400]  investigation started he was indicted on tax charges
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:23.000]  they were trumped up there were no tax violations i'm a criminal tax lawyer i
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:27.160]  know criminal tax case and so it started in 1999 it didn't
[03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:32.360]  end until 2012 we came in after the trial got all the convictions reversed
[03:23:32.360 --> 03:23:36.360]  on appeal and then the government decided to retry the whole case
[03:23:36.360 --> 03:23:39.880]  so we filed another motion alleging outrageous government misconduct the
[03:23:39.880 --> 03:23:43.640]  judge finally dismissed the case in september 12 of 2012
[03:23:43.640 --> 03:23:47.800]  just about a couple of years ago um and i've talked to jerry over the years and
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:51.800]  he's a rational reasonable person but he told me i i just
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:55.400]  people need to know what they did to me and my family so it doesn't happen to
[03:23:55.400 --> 03:23:58.760]  other people file the suit and so that's what brings us
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:02.440]  here today wow and joe is this something that you've
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:07.800]  come across before people being kind of taken to the cleaners uh in this and
[03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:11.720]  just getting it drawn out year after year so that finally they'll just
[03:24:11.720 --> 03:24:15.320]  you know they won't have the money or the wherewithal to be able to continue on
[03:24:15.320 --> 03:24:20.760]  unfortunately the um they were called stats you know short for statistics
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:24.520]  in the government and the better your stats the better budget you would get
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:29.400]  you know the next year uh the more promotions it's really all based on
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:34.360]  stats and so uh if you have tools like this uh
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:38.600]  as illegal as they might be and they raise your stats
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:42.280]  you're looking pretty and you're getting more promotions and transfers and
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:45.800]  and you're just looking really good to the government bureaucracy
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:49.880]  so i did see that and it's continuing it's just that now they're getting even
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:53.320]  more brazen before it might well we'll do some
[03:24:53.320 --> 03:24:58.360]  mostly legal stuff or you know we'll do things according to uh to hoile
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:02.200]  but now they're taking bedrock principles like
[03:25:02.200 --> 03:25:05.880]  telling the truth on the witness stand and you know what
[03:25:05.880 --> 03:25:09.720]  it's bad it used to be bedrock but we don't really need that anymore because
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:13.080]  look at the stats we can get and look at look how many people we get to plead
[03:25:13.080 --> 03:25:17.160]  out and no one will ever know it's a great system and
[03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:20.520]  that's what the i believe the thought process is there and they just they lose
[03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:25.160]  touch with the real world where those of us
[03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:28.120]  who get under investigation as i've been and
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:31.720]  bob helped me you know actually have the resources to
[03:25:31.720 --> 03:25:36.680]  to be acquitted as i deserved but most americans don't have those resources
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:40.760]  and it is just unconscionable but all those americans
[03:25:40.760 --> 03:25:44.840]  before they get fingered with this stuff we need to all join together
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:49.640]  in clean house right and and most people might not even be aware that these
[03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:53.560]  hyperprograms exist to be able to have their attorney say
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:57.080]  how did you come across this you know evidence where you
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:00.600]  how did you build your case and all of that so kind of like that don't ask
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:04.120]  don't tell if they don't ask well then they're not technically lying about it
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:08.520]  or withholding any information well so what specifically
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:11.560]  can people do right now i mean this is huge and so you're saying this is
[03:26:11.560 --> 03:26:16.920]  probably the first case of its kind it's going to really expose this activity
[03:26:16.920 --> 03:26:22.120]  what do we where do we go from here this case to our knowledge is the first
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:25.640]  case in the country that alleges this type of a perjury
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:29.160]  fabrication of evidence all pursuant to the parallel construction issue
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:33.400]  we suspect there are hundreds if not thousands of others but as you say lian
[03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:36.920]  if the defendants and the defense lawyers don't even know
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:40.680]  that this exists or could exist they don't even know what questions to ask
[03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:44.040]  and defense lawyers are telling me well now that we know about parallel
[03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:47.720]  construction we kind of know what questions to ask but we have no idea
[03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:51.960]  in our case if it was used so we sent a letter to the prosecution saying
[03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:56.280]  gosh guys did you violate the constitution laws the united states and use
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:00.600]  the pandora's box osedef fusion center materials against my client
[03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:03.800]  and you could imagine the prosecutor sends the letter back and says gosh no
[03:27:03.800 --> 03:27:08.120]  yeah well where do you go from there what process do they have to compel
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:11.400]  on oath representations and statements about that
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:14.680]  and even if you compelled on oath is evidenced by the marshal at a
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:18.520]  trial in 2007 if you could call it a trial they lie on oath
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:23.000]  right so this is deeply troubling what i would ask people to do
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.360]  is just to stay abreast of the developments in this area
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:31.480]  go back and read the Reuters articles from 2014 and august from august 5 to
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:35.640]  about august 29th they're relatively short they're concise
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:38.840]  they also have published the internal revenue manual section that trains the
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:43.320]  irs agents to do it and keep track of the marshal at a case the marshal at us
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:47.400]  could use some support in this they've been fighting this fight for 15 years
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:51.080]  and just people dropping them a line and saying we support your efforts would be
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:54.840]  helpful absolutely you agree with that any
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:27:57.560]  closing words for the average american out there
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:00.760]  well you know the info warriors know what they're doing when it comes to
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:03.240]  spreading the word about things and so you can
[03:28:03.240 --> 03:28:07.400]  you know we've used a lot of acronyms and this is all new
[03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:10.680]  i've heard alex talk about this a number of times day at night many of the
[03:28:10.680 --> 03:28:14.760]  people here so the the concept is not new maybe some
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:18.520]  of the details are but these people were wronged the
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:22.200]  marshal at us and they are there's a lot more that have been wrong that
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:26.680]  that don't have the resources so if you have a friend or a relative who's an
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:30.360]  attorney mention the word parallel construction
[03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:35.000]  and have them watch this this news show and you know start to spread the word
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:39.480]  and i think the word will spread fast yeah especially in dc
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:43.160]  yes well a lot of people didn't even know civil asset forfeiture
[03:28:43.160 --> 03:28:47.240]  existed in that program or even edward snowden and everything that he revealed
[03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:50.760]  so that was just a couple of years ago we had no access to that information and
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:55.800]  we have been conspiracy theorists for years and now it's you know here we
[03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:58.840]  here we have proof we have evidence and so hopefully
[03:28:58.840 --> 03:29:03.080]  this can be the beginning of dismantling all of that misconduct
[03:29:03.080 --> 03:29:06.200]  that's rampant right now in our federal government
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:09.480]  was both hopeful and grateful for the opportunity to talk about it tonight
[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:15.080]  yeah ups we remarked about how uh pieces you get more pieces to the puzzle
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:19.000]  like oh yeah now i see how this fits here and
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:23.480]  so we just you know bob's doing an amazing job in uh putting a lot more
[03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:26.760]  puzzle pieces into the puzzle right and that's really what it's all about is
[03:29:26.760 --> 03:29:30.200]  just shining the light and even if it's just little pieces now we have
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:33.400]  a new piece of the puzzle so thank you guys so much

[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:38.440]  uh jacarie you know i wanted to get you in here because we have
[03:33:38.440 --> 03:33:42.280]  some breaking news a really disgusting video
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:45.480]  uh is making the rounds now on the internet if you want to check out the
[03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:49.640]  article it's up on info wars dot com adan salazar has
[03:33:49.640 --> 03:33:53.800]  wrote it it's called caught on tape planned parenthood doctor admits to
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:59.080]  selling aborted baby body parts it's um
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:03.400]  it's quite the headline but it's also quite true adan told me about this
[03:34:03.400 --> 03:34:07.080]  article a little bit earlier in the day when he was you know compiling
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:11.160]  of his uh his statements here and when he first told me about it this
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:15.320]  even before i saw the video i just couldn't believe that this was actually
[03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:18.680]  happening in true because you know of course we know uh
[03:34:18.680 --> 03:34:22.920]  was the abortionist kermit you know he was caught doing all kinds of things his
[03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:26.840]  age came out and spoke out against those type of incidents and you'd like to
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:31.160]  think that this is just a one-off type of deal but as we see with this article
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:34.440]  and some of the things we've seen before it's not the case these things
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:37.400]  continue to happen and it's horrific as they are it sounds like
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:40.120]  something out of a horror movie but these are things that are happening
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:43.880]  right here in the united states of america right and that's exactly how i
[03:34:43.880 --> 03:34:48.600]  felt when i saw this video i just it was unbelievable to me and it did make me
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:51.720]  tear up i got a big lump in my stomach
[03:34:51.720 --> 03:34:54.440]  uh but let me just kind of tell you a little bit about it's a hidden camera
[03:34:54.440 --> 03:34:57.400]  video it's coming out of los angeles and it
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:01.880]  features the senior director of medical services there at plan parenthood so
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:05.560]  this is not just some rogue planned parenthood worker
[03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:09.560]  this is like a top down directive here it's dr debora
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:14.040]  uh nuka tola might not be saying that right but anyway so she is caught on
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:17.080]  camera uh discussing the practice of selling
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:21.800]  these body parts of aborted babies this is in blatant violation of federal law
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:26.040]  and this is part one of a three-part documentary series that's coming from
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:30.280]  the center for medical progress so they've got this undercover footage
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:34.440]  and here you're gonna you're going to uh you'll be able to view that video if you
[03:35:34.440 --> 03:35:39.480]  go to info wars dot com adan has the video embedded in his article
[03:35:39.480 --> 03:35:42.760]  so you can watch that in full there it's got subtitles as well
[03:35:42.760 --> 03:35:47.320]  um but the senior director is explaining to a male and female couple
[03:35:47.320 --> 03:35:50.840]  overlaunch how the procedure goes down and and which
[03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:55.400]  human organs are most popular and when you watch this video they
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:00.040]  explain it so calmly um the the senior director does
[03:36:00.040 --> 03:36:03.800]  and it's almost like they're talking about harvesting chickens or cows or
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:06.200]  something to that regard talking about all the organs
[03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:09.800]  of the liver and the heart and all these other things it's just so calm and
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:13.960]  like she's you know done it before and it's a very disturbing
[03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:19.320]  disgusting video right well let's go ahead and play some of that now
[03:36:20.840 --> 03:36:24.520]  now a story we guarantee most of you have never heard before
[03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:28.200]  big money is being made from the sale of fetal body parts
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:31.640]  even the most ardent so this is a choice advocates like planned parenthesis video
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:35.400]  from 2000 actually they started the film with it right there
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:39.720]  it seems inappropriate totally inappropriate where there is wrong doing
[03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:43.400]  it should be prosecuted and should be brought to justice
[03:36:43.400 --> 03:36:47.080]  so that those are clips from 2000 on the news and here
[03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:50.120]  this is actually now undercover planned parenthed
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:54.280]  admitting it so obviously you might find some of the content disturbing
[03:36:54.280 --> 03:36:57.400]  attack parties these days because they're looking for specific notes
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:00.360]  maybe to just say i was like wow i i even know
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:06.040]  good for them yes i'm the first time to see people wanted long time
[03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:09.640]  and then but like i said always as many attack livers
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:13.480]  yeah livers
[03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:23.240]  okay let's uh let's pause that video right there and just
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:26.440]  so that's what you were describing jacari so here she's talking about people
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:30.120]  they want livers and they want it fully intact hearts because they
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:32.840]  need all the notes for the hearts and she's like
[03:37:32.840 --> 03:37:37.320]  shoving salad in her mouth and drinking her wine and it totally reminds me of
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:40.040]  that scene out of silence of the lambs when
[03:37:40.040 --> 03:37:44.360]  doctor lector is talking about eating the guy with like fava beans and the
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:47.960]  kianti i mean this is that's what that lady reminds me of just
[03:37:47.960 --> 03:37:52.600]  discussing this absolutely it's um quite you know like
[03:37:52.600 --> 03:37:55.720]  said disturbing to see such a thing but um
[03:37:55.720 --> 03:38:00.440]  it lets the the temperament of how calmly these people can describe some
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:02.840]  these things and to all these people who say that a
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:07.080]  aborted or a child in the womb isn't a person well you can hear
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:10.840]  in this clip this woman talking about how you can clearly identify the heart
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:14.440]  the liver the lungs all these vital body parts
[03:38:14.440 --> 03:38:17.800]  but you know you can identify that as human body parts but they want to say
[03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:22.040]  that the child is not a human being right exactly and this is the big
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:25.640]  deal with these late term abortions i mean there's like big money for
[03:38:25.640 --> 03:38:29.560]  for them in this i mean here she doesn't really talk about some of those
[03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:32.840]  those prices you know they might not get that much for it but the hospitals
[03:38:32.840 --> 03:38:36.680]  themselves that are dealing in these transplants and things they are making
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:39.320]  hundreds of thousands of dollars off of this
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:43.000]  so the the video goes on you hear them talking we'll go ahead and play it but
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:46.840]  they're they're describing how this is in total violation of federal law
[03:38:46.840 --> 03:38:50.280]  it's against the law here in america to sell human body parts
[03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:53.720]  but then they're kind of discussing how they're getting around that so go
[03:38:53.720 --> 03:38:57.080]  ahead and play that
[03:38:57.080 --> 03:39:00.520]  so the commercial trafficking body parts from an aborted baby punishable by up
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:05.640]  to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 500 thousand dollars
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:09.080]  now this is an actual order form where you can order
[03:39:09.080 --> 03:39:11.960]  they're showing an order form you can say what type of tissue would you like to
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.720]  order what's the you know what age
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:21.160]  and now they're sort of talking about how they uh go undercover they're posing
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.680]  as a fetal tissue procurement company
[03:39:24.680 --> 03:39:28.280]  so i'm the medical director for the national office for all right
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:32.280]  so i say okay what are your what are you looking to supply today
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:36.360]  preparing to get a part long liver
[03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:42.200]  so in the fact that they're so nonchalant you can uh
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:45.480]  you basically know that this isn't the first time she's had this conversation
[03:39:45.480 --> 03:39:51.800]  with people provider has had patients want to donate their tissue and they absolutely want to
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:55.720]  they just want to do it in a way that is not perceived as
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:39:58.920]  this clinic is selling tissue this clinic is making money and off the desk
[03:39:58.920 --> 03:40:05.320]  okay so um when when you are or you believe is
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:13.080]  determine what that what that is voluntary yes so that it doesn't
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:19.880]  raise raising the question of this is this is what it's about this is the
[03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:23.560]  what what price would you
[03:40:23.560 --> 03:40:27.640]  so right now they're explaining the process i would say it's probably
[03:40:27.640 --> 03:40:30.520]  anywhere for thirty two hundred dollars depending on
[03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:34.200]  so what do you want to know the thirty two a hundred dollar price or that's
[03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:38.040]  per specimen that we're talking about right yeah yes the thirty two a hundred
[03:40:38.040 --> 03:40:41.400]  dollar price or that's per specimen that we're talking about right yeah
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:45.800]  yes how much of a difference can actually make if you if you know
[03:40:45.800 --> 03:40:49.400]  what kind of what's expected or what we need versus it makes a huge difference
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:52.920]  i i'd say a lot of a lot of people want liver
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:56.520]  and for that reason
[03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:03.880]  maybe we can pause it right there and talk about how
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:08.360]  she has a pretty much a a hot list you know a lot of people want the liver
[03:41:08.360 --> 03:41:11.240]  they want the heart you know and what exactly they're going to do with these
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:13.640]  things we don't know but it's you know quite
[03:41:13.640 --> 03:41:16.360]  disgusting to just to see them so nonchalantly
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:19.800]  talk about these things as if you know it's just like a part of a chicken or
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:25.080]  harvested cow right and and she talks now she's
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:29.880]  going to go on to say you know how they go about procuring these organs
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:33.000]  because here we're talking about a tiny little baby
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:36.920]  and so she's talking about the procedure and how they have to
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:40.520]  use a certain type of force that method so they can get
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:44.760]  the heart along the liver without crushing that part so they want to be
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:50.440]  sure they can you know get it all out without damaging these
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:53.480]  they don't they don't want to damage the tissue of the baby you know they
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:57.320]  they're quite adamant about that they want it in the most pristine
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:01.640]  condition so anybody who would view this and and see how
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:05.320]  they try to profit off of your your child your
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:09.240]  aborted child so it's not just you know they take it and
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:13.400]  whatever people think the disposal method for it is no they are
[03:42:13.400 --> 03:42:17.320]  repurposing your child to sell it to very strange people
[03:42:17.320 --> 03:42:21.000]  right and she's also now talking about how they circumvent
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:24.120]  that there's that little gray area where they're like well you know it's
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:28.040]  against the law to to sell mutilated dead baby parts
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:31.400]  essentially and and so now she's going to kind of get in to
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:36.600]  say how they get around that and and you know as long as they didn't intentionally
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:40.840]  in quotes let's go ahead and roll dollar price or that's per specimen that we're
[03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:43.720]  talking about right yeah yes how much of a difference can
[03:42:43.720 --> 03:42:48.520]  actually make if you if you know what kind of what's expected or what we need
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:51.000]  versus it makes a huge difference i i'd say a lot of
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.560]  a lot of people want liver
[03:42:53.640 --> 03:42:57.240]  and for that reason
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:01.080]  lots of providers put this case under ultrasound ads
[03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:05.400]  so they'll know where they're putting their forceps
[03:43:07.480 --> 03:43:11.160]  take some big notes of that line
[03:43:11.160 --> 03:43:14.920]  the head is basically the biggest part most of the other stuff can come out of
[03:43:14.920 --> 03:43:18.440]  time right it's very rare to have an update so getting
[03:43:18.440 --> 03:43:22.040]  the head is difficult but to bring them to bring the body cavity out
[03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:24.440]  contact them all that so then you just kind of pop this
[03:43:24.440 --> 03:43:27.400]  in of where you put the forceps
[03:43:27.400 --> 03:43:31.560]  you try to intentionally put them below the thorax so that you know
[03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:34.280]  we've been very good at getting parts on liver
[03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:39.160]  so this is you know she's basically giving the play by play of how they go
[03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:43.720]  about um procuring harvesting she's not her first
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:47.320]  rodeo here with this i mean this is just disgusting and the thing that's
[03:43:47.320 --> 03:43:51.000]  really shocking is that you know most of the time they will
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  save the best for last and this is the first little clip we're getting out of
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:58.280]  this upcoming documentary this is so there's other clips that we don't even
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:01.720]  know what is about to be hitting yeah and we've seen
[03:44:01.720 --> 03:44:05.000]  things going on in other parts of the world like we have this article right
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:08.120]  here from the business insider a british man was caught trying to
[03:44:08.120 --> 03:44:11.640]  smuggle a roasted baby fetus into thailand
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:18.520]  and you know that defies words in and of itself but i think
[03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:21.480]  here in the states we always like to pride ourselves well
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:24.920]  maybe that's happening in the rest of the world but that can never happen here
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:28.280]  it's happening here right and it has been happening here because as you can
[03:44:28.280 --> 03:44:30.360]  see it's you know it's like a farmer talking to
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:32.600]  somebody at the at the bait shop you know they
[03:44:32.600 --> 03:44:35.400]  they know exactly what they're doing how they're going about it
[03:44:35.400 --> 03:44:39.960]  and it's very sad to see that this goes on and kudos to the people that film the
[03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:42.200]  thing because i really don't understand how
[03:44:42.200 --> 03:44:44.760]  you can sit there with a straight face but you know they they did what they had
[03:44:44.760 --> 03:44:48.200]  to do to get the video out right absolutely and there's another story
[03:44:48.200 --> 03:44:52.600]  out of the daily mail thousands of pills filled with powdered human baby
[03:44:52.600 --> 03:44:55.800]  flesh discovered by customs officials in south korea
[03:44:55.800 --> 03:45:02.600]  so i mean the this is prize these organs are like prized
[03:45:02.600 --> 03:45:05.880]  but they people maybe think that these are like the youth elixir or something
[03:45:05.880 --> 03:45:10.680]  that it's going to give them stamina and vigor who knows always always those
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:14.120]  uh urban legend kind of deals you know eat the flesh of the babies and that
[03:45:14.120 --> 03:45:18.040]  you'll live forever and all types of bizarre things i think it was
[03:45:18.040 --> 03:45:20.360]  david who did a report i'm just going off the top of my head
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:23.640]  talking about them using uh fetuses to was it heat hospitals
[03:45:23.640 --> 03:45:26.440]  yes that came out last year that they were using their
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:30.120]  aborted fetuses to heat hospitals in the uk and canada
[03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:34.200]  i believe so yeah i mean this is going on every it's disgusting
[03:45:34.200 --> 03:45:38.120]  and here this lady is so nonchalant describing exactly
[03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:42.840]  how this happens and like we said you know this is a senior director of medical
[03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:47.080]  services so she's not just some rogue agent there who's
[03:45:47.080 --> 03:45:51.400]  making a little money on the side this is going on across the country
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:54.840]  so no wonder they don't want to they don't want to take out the
[03:45:54.840 --> 03:45:59.480]  the partial birth abortions well i think you'll often run into when you
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:02.120]  you know talk to somebody about plant parenthood and you talk about the
[03:46:02.120 --> 03:46:07.080]  abortions and they say well abortions is only a small part of what we do well
[03:46:07.080 --> 03:46:10.040]  i'm like well when people go out there and rally against you they're not
[03:46:10.040 --> 03:46:13.240]  protesting the fact that you give out free pins and lollipops at the front
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:16.840]  desk they're protesting the fact that you have abortions and now we see what
[03:46:16.840 --> 03:46:21.160]  these abortions are turning into they're starting turning into a meat market
[03:46:21.160 --> 03:46:25.080]  where they are literally selling body parts of dead children
[03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:28.920]  right and then it's like you see stuff like this and you wonder how
[03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:32.760]  that the one girl that was saying you know she was so proud of herself oh i
[03:46:32.760 --> 03:46:36.280]  kill my kids that we had at that abortion protest
[03:46:36.280 --> 03:46:40.200]  and you there these are people that are self-proclaimed
[03:46:40.200 --> 03:46:43.640]  communists because they want to save the underdog and the
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:47.880]  the underclass and here it's like who's the the most that yeah that's a very good
[03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:51.320]  point because they always oftentimes these abortion clinics will be they'll
[03:46:51.320 --> 03:46:55.240]  be located in low-income neighborhoods they have many minorities who go there
[03:46:55.240 --> 03:46:57.800]  and use their facilities you know other races as well
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:01.240]  but you know it's always you know we're here to help you we're here to help you
[03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:04.280]  do whatever you have to do so they'll bring these people in charge of much
[03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:06.760]  like three hundred dollars or something around that
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:10.600]  price tag to have the baby aborted but then they'll turn around and sell the
[03:47:10.600 --> 03:47:15.000]  aborted fetus for as much as they can get
[03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:19.080]  but yeah let's go ahead and play some more of this repugnant clip
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:24.440]  I'm going to crush that part, I'm going to basically crush below, I'm going to crush above, then I'm going to see if I get an L attack
[03:47:24.440 --> 03:47:29.720]  and with the cowbarium in general some people will actually try to change the
[03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:34.200]  presentation so that's not a vertex but it's a vertex presentation
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:37.960]  you never have enough dilation because unless you have real huge
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:43.240]  mass dilation to deliver an attack to cowbarium so if you do it starting
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:46.840]  in the breech presentation there's dilation that happens as the case goes on
[03:47:46.840 --> 03:47:50.440]  and often at the last you can evacuate it and toss it
[03:47:50.440 --> 03:47:54.600]  I mean there are certainly steps that can be taken so they can convert to breech
[03:47:54.600 --> 03:47:58.120]  for example at the start of it yeah totally dangerous for the for the mom
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:02.760]  to have a breech birth women can die during childbirth
[03:48:02.760 --> 03:48:06.120]  but here they're talking about how they flip it around so they can pull it out
[03:48:06.120 --> 03:48:11.480]  to get that fully intact head because the cowbarium is just so important
[03:48:11.480 --> 03:48:15.640]  and I definitely encourage everybody who's listening to this to go to infowars.com
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:18.920]  and watch these videos for yourself because you can hear it you know it's a
[03:48:18.920 --> 03:48:22.440]  little distorted but if you watch the video you can see it along with the
[03:48:22.440 --> 03:48:27.400]  subtitles and see everything that's going on yeah so definitely go to that it says
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:31.400]  caught on tape Planned Parenthood doctor admits to selling aborted
[03:48:31.400 --> 03:48:36.760]  baby body parts and that's on infowars.com the article by Adon Salazar
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:41.240]  yes be sure to tweet that out shared on facebook because people don't believe
[03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:44.440]  this kind of thing is happening and this is just
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:47.960]  more fuel when you try to have a conversation with people about this
[03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:52.600]  this is why this is so shocking so repulsive because I mean
[03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:55.720]  people see the stuff that we've put out you know like when we had the abortion
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:48:58.520]  rally or that lady who was running around the Texas Capitol talking about
[03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:02.440]  hell satan and they think it's you know we cherry picked that stuff this stuff
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.120]  happens a lot and I'm not saying everybody who's pro-abortioned is you
[03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:12.200]  know into selling babies but it's not a once in a blue moon kind of deal
[03:49:12.200 --> 03:49:16.120]  you have some very odd characters the freaks come out at night when you start
[03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:19.720]  to talk about abortion whether it's people who want to sell babies people who
[03:49:19.720 --> 03:49:24.680]  enjoy the act of killing their babies you know these people who you know love
[03:49:24.680 --> 03:49:29.320]  worshiping satan and they kill babies it's all type of weird degenerates come
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:32.360]  out to support abortion right and even if you're not
[03:49:32.360 --> 03:49:35.560]  you know you're not for it and you think oh well i'm just i'm just going to go
[03:49:35.560 --> 03:49:39.160]  have an abortion and this isn't going to happen to me you don't know
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:42.920]  what's happening to that fetus that that comes out i mean
[03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:47.000]  you don't know what they're doing and it's so even if you're not for it it's
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:51.240]  happening anyway and you really have no say in what happens
[03:49:51.240 --> 03:49:55.080]  oh nor would they even admit it if it's not caught on tape here
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:49:58.920]  right yeah exactly what you said if we did not have this clip you know it never
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:01.720]  happened like what's your proof of it so that's
[03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:05.000]  the way they keep going about these things and you know i said kudos to the
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:09.240]  people who shot this video to help explain to people exactly what's going on
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:12.760]  yeah absolutely like we said be sure to share this
