[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.880]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.880 --> 00:26.880]  Texas Alex Jones I hate to say it but it's true I wish we were wrong we told
[00:26.880 --> 00:32.680]  you so not only did we have the top secret USA article three weeks ago in
[00:32.680 --> 00:38.360]  the Washington Post admitting that there are 854,000 private spies with the
[00:38.360 --> 00:43.240]  highest security clearance the government issues but there are millions of
[00:43.240 --> 00:48.320]  other sub spies in that stratum and they privatize the government to make
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.040]  hundreds of billions of dollars a year the Pentagon the private spy
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.920]  corporations they're taking over our society and they're having a coming out
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.440]  party in the media today at a big hacker conference they've been having over the
[01:04.440 --> 01:10.320]  weekend saying we are private corporations we are slash government
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.240]  agents and we are spying on everything you buy everything you sell everything you
[01:15.240 --> 01:22.880]  do on the internet we are infraguard we are top secret USA and they're saying
[01:22.880 --> 01:32.120]  that private groups with NSA clearances are the ones that were tracking the
[01:32.120 --> 01:39.280]  military in live time when this private gave WikiLeaks the information both the
[01:39.280 --> 01:46.120]  helicopter slaughter footage and more and it's in Forbes today it is in the
[01:46.120 --> 01:53.320]  AFP the headlines are stealthy government contractor monitors US internet
[01:53.320 --> 02:00.320]  providers worked with WikiLeaks here's another one elite US cyber team courts
[02:00.320 --> 02:05.280]  hackers to fight terrorist and in these articles they admit everything but
[02:05.280 --> 02:11.040]  spin it like these guys are John Wayne and they say yes we're tracking all your
[02:11.040 --> 02:18.000]  IPs everything you do in real time now I remembered last night and this morning
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.640]  researching this this article by William Sapphire November 14th 2002 New
[02:26.640 --> 02:35.920]  York Times titled you are a suspect and it goes into the total information
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.080]  awareness network that Congress then said was illegal so they just completely
[02:40.080 --> 02:46.640]  privatized it and that's all this is this is infraguard this is Homeland
[02:46.640 --> 02:54.000]  Security and no doubt this is the exact type of group that was able to get into
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.440]  our YouTube account and delete the Obama deception this is the group that is in
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.520]  there when we have the number one search term as we successfully did on
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.640]  Friday thanks to the listeners food the ultimate secret it it was the top thing
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.400]  for about two hours and they totally removed that it was non-searchable in
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.440]  the top million searches they just completely removed it this is the type
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.160]  of group that when my video food the ultimate secret exposed got 200,000
[03:23.160 --> 03:27.480]  views on Friday and was the number one video on YouTube they just removed it
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.040]  out of the front page out of the number one video area of news and politics
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.960]  videos with 10,000 views were listed in there but mine with hundreds of
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.720]  thousands in one day was knocked out it's still there but it only got 65,000
[03:41.720 --> 03:46.760]  views after they removed it Friday evening it would be up to a million
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.680]  right now they're everywhere and they admit in the Cybersecurity Act they're
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.560]  going to recruit millions of high school students a year and give them
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.600]  security clearances I'm not making this up this is in the legislation that's
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.640]  passed the Senate Committee and it's passed the full house to where the
[04:05.640 --> 04:08.840]  federal government gives them jobs right out of high school they're trained to
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.360]  spies this is East Germany they're young they're dumb they're on power trips
[04:13.360 --> 04:18.880]  they like a little high security badges they are converting giant portions of
[04:18.880 --> 04:23.240]  the economy over to surveillance and control and they work for the large
[04:23.240 --> 04:29.760]  central banks that have hijacked this nation this is so illegal this is so
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.680]  criminal and and a microcosm of this is all over the country red light cameras
[04:34.680 --> 04:39.240]  being run by Lockheed Martin and others no police officer involved no jury they
[04:39.240 --> 04:42.600]  just give you tickets that's how that's being defeated in court it's illegal
[04:42.600 --> 04:47.000]  that's how the military industrial complex is absorbing they get the money
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.280]  from the police training they get the money from the surveillance cameras
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.640]  they're putting up this is the Pentagon dominating the United States with the
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.920]  help of private corporate spies it's all coming up and a lot more straight ahead

[08:13.320 --> 08:20.560]  coming up in the next hour Steve Kemp and Sandy Jacobs will be joining us
[08:20.560 --> 08:25.120]  they're part of the Golden Gate Minutemen and they've been shooting
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.640]  amazing videos in the last few months of congressman Stark and others saying
[08:29.640 --> 08:36.040]  there's no border problem and showing the illegal alien supporters beating up
[08:36.040 --> 08:43.400]  peaceful pro sovereignty anti-open border demonstrators and the
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.960]  assaulters actually being arrested and going to jail their newest video is a
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.480]  from a few days ago it's congressman Stark again at a town hall saying the
[08:53.480 --> 08:57.600]  federal government can quote do whatever it wants to individuals and that
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.240]  you have no rights and we're going to be playing that and interviewing them
[09:01.240 --> 09:05.800]  coming up in the next hour we are simulcasting the syndicated radio
[09:05.800 --> 09:13.120]  broadcast at prisonplanet.tv so that is coming up today in the second hour into
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.240]  the third hour we will of course have open phones in the second and third
[09:17.240 --> 09:23.160]  hour today I also want to get into this headline out of East St. Louis layoffs
[09:23.160 --> 09:29.240]  to gut East St. Louis police force criminals run wild and this is out of
[09:29.240 --> 09:35.240]  St. Louis today and of course that integrates in with other reports across
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.200]  the country of major police layoffs and the police announcing we're not going
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.920]  to respond to things like armed robbery and grand theft auto that's like calling
[09:43.920 --> 09:49.200]  the fire department and they say we only go out and set fires we don't we don't
[09:49.200 --> 09:53.520]  respond to fires and the police are being fully converted to revenue
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.600]  generators people to write tickets and raise money and this is the way it's
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.440]  been really for a long time there's a lot of good officers that want to be
[10:02.440 --> 10:07.360]  involved in helping the public and I do see officers more and more changing
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.840]  people's tires helping old ladies something I saw 20 30 years ago
[10:11.840 --> 10:16.320]  routinely and I hadn't seen for decades I'm now seeing everywhere and so I think
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.520]  really you're seeing the wheat from the chaff being separated here you're
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.120]  seeing a lot of officers regardless of what directives they've been given out
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.480]  there being public servants that's why we admire true police officers true
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.880]  peace officers it's why we admire firefighters they put themselves on the
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.600]  line to protect the public when somebody's getting shot or mugged or
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.520]  killed or robbed the police run in when everybody else runs out when a
[10:42.520 --> 10:47.000]  building's on fire everybody else runs out the firemen and women they run in
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.160]  and that's what we need in this country but more and more through the
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.640]  federalization of law enforcement they're saying no you were to generate
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.120]  revenue and you are not to protect the people in the Southwest you are to let
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.840]  the illegal aliens go when they commit crimes so we'll be talking about that
[11:07.840 --> 11:15.120]  important information Admiral Mullen says u.s. has Iran strike plan another
[11:15.120 --> 11:23.040]  headline u.s. admits existence of Iran attack plan Israel fears Turks could pass
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.320]  its secret to Iran so now you're that's from Reuters now you're seeing Israel and
[11:27.320 --> 11:32.920]  Turkey that small divide getting wider and wider after the flotilla attack on
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.760]  the Turkish flag ship with the blockade Iran's augment energy calls for TV
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.600]  debate with Obama yeah that's not gonna happen Mullen says that they do have a
[11:45.600 --> 11:52.600]  viable again attack plan for Iran very very serious information as we escalate
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.160]  towards a possible confrontation that could lead to World War three that is
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.640]  coming up today as well and I've got a lot of other medical news police state
[12:02.640 --> 12:09.240]  news Arizona sheriff Babu says our own government has become our enemy he's
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.880]  finally telling it like it is as he said Obama is bordering on treason and he's
[12:13.880 --> 12:17.840]  clearly engaged in treason but we'll be going over that cyber news service
[12:17.840 --> 12:27.240]  report as well coming up here today but right now I want to get into a subject
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.080]  that is just paramount of paramount importance and I want people to
[12:33.080 --> 12:40.320]  understand out there I want viewers to understand out there that this is so
[12:40.320 --> 12:49.040]  extreme so naked in its tyranny and its illegality that it boggles the mind that
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.320]  this is being done out in the open remember just three and a half years
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.920]  ago bush was getting up at press conferences saying I promise we're
[12:57.920 --> 13:02.240]  not spying on American people without warrants and then just a month later it
[13:02.240 --> 13:07.080]  came out that the NSA had giant snooping hubs in every major telecommunications
[13:07.080 --> 13:12.520]  facility and then all communications are being run through these different forms
[13:12.520 --> 13:18.400]  of keyword software and that these different files and algorithms and
[13:18.400 --> 13:26.440]  relationship actuaries of how different groups of people interact with each
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.360]  other how corporations interact with each other to really be able to
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.760]  understand trends in society so the insiders literally have a crystal ball
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.880]  type effect to be able to manipulate and control society and it's an unfair trade
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.680]  advantage against competitors to the globalist whether it's private
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.720]  corporate or government and of course it's all completely illegal so they've
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.320]  gone from a decade ago torture being wrong to torture being good they've
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.200]  gone from a decade ago the UN and Dine Corps getting in trouble running
[14:00.200 --> 14:03.520]  child kidnapping rings to now it's just mainstream news and they don't get in
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.320]  trouble they've gone from a decade ago to denying that the NSA even existed or
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.480]  that echelon even existed I mean I've had newspapers make fun of me 15 years
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.200]  ago for talking about the NSA even existing oh that kook says the
[14:18.200 --> 14:22.000]  government's listening to us well that's ridiculous everybody knows that
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.240]  that's illegal to now it's just in your face but the new information that has
[14:29.240 --> 14:34.080]  come out has confirmed everything we already knew in our analysis and
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.720]  confirmed it's worse than what I had even said you know one of the popular
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.640]  Co and tell pro memes is to say that I exaggerate or that I'm a fear monger
[14:45.640 --> 14:49.680]  well if you think impending war with Iran isn't something to be concerned
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.240]  about fine I'm a fear monger if you think having offshore banks that have
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.000]  stolen tens of trillions of dollars and have now been given total power over the
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.520]  economy and the SEC cannot be investigated now completely run by these
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.120]  bankers if that doesn't scare you okay I'm a fear monger if you're not
[15:07.120 --> 15:13.080]  concerned about buys phenol a admittedly in printer ink and in almost
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.800]  every plastic that your food is contained in that you buy and the things
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.560]  that you're drinking out of and that you're becoming sterilized on record
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.400]  I mean they admit it but I'm still the fear monger no the truth is you've got
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.880]  a lot of people who got into denial about what's happening and so now that
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.200]  all of this stuff is just being admitted they can't come back to themselves and
[15:36.200 --> 15:43.200]  and own up to the fact that they were wrong and own up to the fact that we
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.520]  really are in trouble that we're facing a scientific tyranny they just can't do
[15:47.520 --> 15:55.920]  that they are too cowardly they are too afraid to be able to do that and it's
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.960]  just so sad because if people would just wake up and recognize the level of
[16:00.960 --> 16:06.000]  tyranny that we're living under and if we just came to our senses and admitted
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.400]  ourselves this is outrageously illegitimate outrageously criminal
[16:10.400 --> 16:17.200]  outrageously unconstitutional outrageously illegal it's off the charts
[16:17.200 --> 16:22.120]  the amount of stealing and thieving and corruption that's going on but because
[16:22.120 --> 16:27.560]  the system thinks that you're a bunch of passive cowards they'll come out in
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.840]  Bloomberg and go yeah every major insurance company is now taking people's
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.280]  insurance money and keeping it not giving it to them when they die to their
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.000]  families including veterans they'll now come right out and say yes the banks are
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.560]  stealing tens of trillions and no one's gonna get in trouble in fact they're
[16:44.560 --> 16:51.440]  gonna get more power on every front we are in the collapse the system has made
[16:51.440 --> 16:58.760]  the decision to loot everything and that they've been given the green light to go
[16:58.760 --> 17:03.320]  completely criminal and rogue the information that I'm going to cover
[17:03.320 --> 17:15.680]  after the break coming up here in a few minutes is so illegal is so criminal on
[17:15.680 --> 17:21.440]  its face it is worse than the East German Stasi up until this time in history
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.040]  the most authoritarian the most oppressive the most surveilled society
[17:27.040 --> 17:34.360]  in human history that is now completely eclipsed completely dwarfed by what's
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.360]  going on and the media is now selling you this just like when they knew you
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.160]  were scared of 9-11 they sold you torture and told you that yes in the
[17:42.160 --> 17:45.960]  Washington Post they talked to one of the CIA section chiefs and he said this

[35:52.200 --> 35:59.520]  UN model of control is where instead of having people voters that they listen to
[35:59.520 --> 36:05.240]  or republics that the governments follow they create stakeholders or groups
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.000]  that the government corporations find that then speak for the people and then
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.320]  governmental power is then given to them and in England even more so than the
[36:14.320 --> 36:22.200]  U.S. they've been converted over to this surveillance society and private groups
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.440]  have been given control over charity and they turn it into child grabbing for no
[36:27.440 --> 36:31.400]  reason we have a members of parliament on about that they have bounties on kids
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.520]  they make hundreds of thousands of pounds per child they take they're
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.440]  privatizing the spying they're privatizing everything but they take
[36:40.440 --> 36:44.560]  your government money and then they give it to the private corporate cronies
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.360]  which are almost always the cousins the daughters the sons the wives the husbands
[36:49.360 --> 36:55.760]  of the mayors of the members of parliament of the federal bureaucrats so
[36:55.760 --> 37:02.240]  it's also a way to transfer your wealth in payoffs publicly and at least on the
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.960]  surface legally but what is illegal about all of this in England and the
[37:07.960 --> 37:12.960]  United States is it violates due process surveillance laws the Magna Carta the
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.120]  Bill of Rights the Constitution and the same things being done in Japan the same
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.200]  things being done on the continent of Europe and so they now admit with top
[37:22.200 --> 37:30.320]  secret USA 854,000 private corporate spies and I pointed out that in the news
[37:30.320 --> 37:36.800]  reported four years ago that infregard has license to kill powers that during a
[37:36.800 --> 37:41.640]  collapse during an emergency these infregard operators have been given
[37:41.640 --> 37:47.960]  shoot-to-kill orders in quote protection of the infrastructure so long before the
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.680]  banks collapse society by design they had quietly created their private spy
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.800]  networks they had gone in and recruited over 50,000 preachers to teach Romans
[37:57.800 --> 38:03.920]  13 and with these scenarios of martial law is good go to the FEMA camp let them
[38:03.920 --> 38:07.760]  break your families up let them take your children remember five years ago we
[38:07.760 --> 38:11.520]  got those secret documents and then two years later mainstream news reported to
[38:11.520 --> 38:16.160]  search the term clergy response team that yes for martial law that's word for
[38:16.160 --> 38:21.560]  word and they interviewed the preachers and for gun confiscation that the
[38:21.560 --> 38:27.200]  pastors are now secretly working for FEMA and I've said it so many times how
[38:27.200 --> 38:34.560]  creepy is that how illegal is that how off the charts is that information to
[38:34.560 --> 38:41.800]  have corporate chiefs local officials private and government and corporate
[38:41.800 --> 38:48.200]  pastors all surveilling you all spying all on these power trips and that
[38:48.200 --> 38:51.720]  there's terrorist everywhere and then they get the federal training manuals
[38:51.720 --> 38:57.080]  and the terrorists are the American people Ron Paul supporters people that
[38:57.080 --> 39:00.240]  want to abolish the Federal Reserve people that want to kick this foreign
[39:00.240 --> 39:03.920]  corporate takeover out people that want to keep their second amendment do you
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.800]  understand this is a hundred percent diabolical there is no debate this is the
[39:09.800 --> 39:16.600]  greatest most organized scientific tyranny ever seen in history this makes
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.880]  the Nazis look like a joke at organization this makes and you ask how
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.560]  do they organize it that they're paying these people and then you read the
[39:25.560 --> 39:31.280]  cyber security act and it says millions of high school and college students as
[39:31.280 --> 39:37.200]  part of their national compulsory public service remember Rahm Emanuel saying
[39:37.200 --> 39:41.520]  you will be in boot camp three months a year and don't worry all of you don't
[39:41.520 --> 39:46.600]  have to serve overseas we need a civilian army just as big just as strong as
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.680]  our armed services as Obama said on the campaign trail and it's continuing what
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.800]  Bush was setting up and what Clinton was setting up this has all been going on
[39:55.800 --> 40:02.360]  since the time of the mid-1960s quietly expanding quietly acclimating you to
[40:02.360 --> 40:06.120]  accept military on the street quietly acclimating you for the threat fusion
[40:06.120 --> 40:12.400]  centers and federalization of police but the good news is this is so out in the
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.440]  open now that I was up here working pretty late last night and about 9 30 we
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.280]  went to eat and I took four of the guys to go eat and there were two police
[40:22.280 --> 40:28.400]  officers eating and when we were leaving the police officers were leaving they
[40:28.400 --> 40:31.360]  came up and struck up a conversation and I could tell they were being genuine and
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.760]  they said how are things going for you Alex they were two bike cops and they
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.000]  were just going on duty they you know we're eating before they went on duty
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.440]  and I said well it's going really bad we're reaching more people than ever but
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.640]  unfortunately it's all come true and it's really happening and they go no we
[40:47.640 --> 40:54.840]  hear you we know yeah we know we know this stuff's real so and I could tell
[40:54.840 --> 41:02.360]  they were genuine they looked freaked out and they looked intelligent you know
[41:02.360 --> 41:09.720]  they had an intelligent bearing and demeanor it's just so sad that this has
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.520]  happened and it's so horrible what we're gonna go through I mean you think we're
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.720]  living under tyranny now folks we've seen nothing and the police are just there
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.000]  to remove wrecked cars and to stop drunks you know the average cop they're
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.040]  hiring private corporate mercenaries to be the physical enforcers and the
[41:26.040 --> 41:36.320]  technocratic technotronic technocracy enforcers and it's a nightmare I mean
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.120]  before they bring this country down which we're now going into all the
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.720]  financial news now admits we're in a depression that there was no recovery you
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.520]  know they're now even dispensing with any of their previous lies on that front
[41:48.520 --> 41:54.960]  because people aren't buying it and we have criminals of the Bernie Madoff
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.840]  Ken Lake caliber running the system now let me get into the info the new info
[42:00.840 --> 42:07.920]  you've got the background now but let me now get into the new information which
[42:07.920 --> 42:13.680]  just confirms everything we already know and it's the public rollout of all of
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.720]  this tyranny just like they rolled out torture our preemptive war our secret
[42:18.720 --> 42:21.920]  arrest just like they're rolling out arresting peaceful demonstrators in
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.400]  Canada England and the United States and having plain clothes contractors grab
[42:26.400 --> 42:29.960]  you and put a bag over your head and throw you in a van in front of news
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.880]  cameras they're doing it to sell you that oh it's just normal vans pull up in
[42:34.880 --> 42:44.720]  bags go over your head so here is Forbes today stealthy government contractor
[42:44.720 --> 42:51.560]  monitors US internet providers worked with WikiLeaks and the article is
[42:51.560 --> 42:58.840]  tailored total scyop Andy Greenberg is who wrote this to just come out and make
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.760]  it sound like they're heroes and it says a semi-secret government contractor
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.680]  that calls itself project vigilant surfaced we've covered it before at
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.880]  the DEF CON security conference Sunday with a series of revelations that it
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.440]  monitors the traffic of 12 regional internet service providers the main
[43:17.440 --> 43:22.800]  hubs hands much of the information to federal agencies and encourages one of
[43:22.800 --> 43:27.320]  its volunteers researchers they always say that for you know these are spies for
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.400]  a membrane between them and the government of separation researcher
[43:31.400 --> 43:37.240]  Adrian Lamo or Lamo to inform the federal government about the alleged
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.480]  source of the controversial video of civilian deaths in iraq leaked a
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.000]  whistleblower site WikiLeaks in April and what does it say this private group
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.800]  created by the NSA and headed up by the former head of the NSA that's at the end
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.040]  of the article you know later they tell you that it says is tracking all of our
[43:55.040 --> 44:03.600]  IPs 250 million a day in the US live time everything you're doing everything
[44:03.600 --> 44:07.960]  you're doing total information awareness network that I read from earlier the
[44:07.960 --> 44:12.040]  New York Times told you about you are a suspect article by William Sapphire
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.120]  November 14 2002 and what they report when poinsett extra was told he couldn't
[44:17.120 --> 44:25.280]  do that was illegal they went and created private groups to do it 854,000
[44:25.280 --> 44:33.560]  security clearances just in this area alone highest level totally illegal and
[44:33.560 --> 44:36.520]  these are the type of people that were able to get into our YouTube account and
[44:36.520 --> 44:39.520]  take down the Obama deception these are the type of people that take our videos
[44:39.520 --> 44:43.520]  off the front page I mean YouTube last year admitted that they follow the
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.760]  orders of senator Lieberman's office this was in the news of what videos he
[44:47.760 --> 45:00.880]  says to take down and it goes on Uber says that Lamo later called him from
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.800]  the meeting regretting his decision to inform Manning oh it's like oh they're
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.840]  sad they reported on WikiLeaks total baloney I'm in a meeting with five guys
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.080]  and I didn't want to do this Uber says Lamo told him that at the time Uber says
[45:14.080 --> 45:23.040]  he responded you don't have any choices you've got to do this and so they spent
[45:23.040 --> 45:28.640]  it at this NSA run private hub had to report about the crimes of WikiLeaks
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.720]  and and they said I said you're going to be thrown in jail they're not going to
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.480]  throw you in jail Uber said give them everything you have as if oh he was
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.120]  spying on everybody with this NSA group and he was worried about the fact he'd
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.120]  been spying but he had to do it or he would get in trouble WikiLeaks didn't
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.600]  immediately respond to request for comment IDG reporter Robert McMillan
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.120]  confirmed Uber's relationship with Lamo who told McMillan that Mr. Uber was
[45:54.120 --> 45:58.640]  among a few others an instrumental voice in helping me come to my ultimate
[45:58.640 --> 46:02.880]  decision so buried in this article that they write kind of like a little novel
[46:02.880 --> 46:11.200]  piece like a public interest puff piece that oh by the way the NSA runs this
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.080]  Uber's WikiLeaks relation is one of the first public statements from a
[46:15.080 --> 46:20.760]  semi-secret project vigilant he says the 600 person volunteer organization
[46:20.760 --> 46:24.880]  functions as a government contractor bringing public and private sector
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.520]  security efforts its mission is to use a variety of intelligence gathering
[46:28.520 --> 46:33.320]  efforts they call themselves agents to help the government attribute hacking
[46:33.320 --> 46:38.640]  incidents oh sure bad actors do bad things you have to prove they did it
[46:38.640 --> 46:44.200]  says uber attribution is the hardest problem in computer security according
[46:44.200 --> 46:47.680]  to uber one of project vigilance manifold methods of a gathering
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.040]  intelligence includes collecting information from dozens of regional us
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.280]  internet service providers who give it to him uber declined to name those ISPs
[46:55.280 --> 46:58.520]  well there's 12 hubs but said that because the company's included provisions
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.680]  allowing them to share users internet activities with third parties in their
[47:02.680 --> 47:08.240]  end user license agreements vigilant was able to legally gather data from those
[47:08.240 --> 47:13.040]  internet carriers and use it to craft reports for federal agencies a vigilant
[47:13.040 --> 47:17.960]  press release says the organization tracks more than 250 million IP addresses
[47:17.960 --> 47:27.080]  a day it can develop portfolios on any name screen or name or IP address and see
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.520]  so they claim it's a private corporate thing but it's in as they funded and run
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.080]  and so it's racketeering because the government isn't allowed to do this
[47:35.080 --> 47:42.760]  without warrants but they got this new legal theory that they can do it and
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.680]  what does they had a Facebook call his users dumb efforts that trust him he
[47:46.680 --> 47:53.160]  now admits just everything's given to the government a vigilant press release
[47:53.160 --> 47:56.960]  says the organization tracks more than 250 million IP addresses a day it can
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.480]  develop portfolios on any name screen name or IP address we don't do any
[48:01.480 --> 48:07.680]  legal says uber if an ISP has a EU LA and let us monitor traffic we can work
[48:07.680 --> 48:13.840]  with them if they don't we can and all the major even sub ISPs then contract
[48:13.840 --> 48:17.800]  with major ISPs and so it all runs through that so they designed the
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.800]  infrastructure of the web where you have no privacy it's designed to surveil you
[48:21.800 --> 48:27.640]  and whether that massive data gathering violates privacy organization says it
[48:27.640 --> 48:30.880]  never looks at personal identifying information they just said name screen
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.640]  name IP address just though just how it identifies information isn't clear nor
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.160]  is how it scrubs its data mining for sensitive details ISP monitoring is
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.080]  just one form of vigilant of intelligence that vigilant employs says uber it
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.000]  also gathers a variety of open source intelligence and employs numerous
[48:50.000 --> 48:58.240]  agents around the world and then it goes into how they helped run the fake
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.000]  dis info about Ahmed Denizhi stealing the election help pump that on the web
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.520]  uber says he's speaking publicly about vigilant at DEF CON because he wants to
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.560]  recruit the conference breed of young skilled hackers by July 2011 the
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.520]  organization hopes to have more than 1,300 new employees the organization
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.200]  already has a big a few big names in its roster according to San Francisco
[49:22.200 --> 49:26.200]  examiner article last month its volunteer staff includes former NSA
[49:26.200 --> 49:32.760]  official Ira Winkler and Susan Gorman former security chief for the New York
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.880]  Stock Exchange and then they go on to talk about how this is part of
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.760]  infregard which is over infrastructure protection and they're given these
[49:42.760 --> 49:54.200]  high-level security clearances now here is AFP French news agency elite US
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.600]  cyber team courts hackers to fight terrorist folks this isn't 1,300 they're
[49:59.600 --> 50:03.360]  looking for this is just one front group they have literally thousands they
[50:03.360 --> 50:08.320]  said they want to recruit 2 million youth a year to work for the government
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.400]  that's the new economy it's not making cars it's not making computer chips it's
[50:13.400 --> 50:18.320]  not car dealerships it's oh you want jobs young people how about be spies and
[50:18.320 --> 50:23.720]  all these TV shows were spies are glorified and the CIA and CSI and all
[50:23.720 --> 50:31.360]  of this stuff and 24 this is what you are when you grow up this is this is what
[50:31.360 --> 50:34.880]  you're going to be a spy for the corporate New World Order when you grow
[50:34.880 --> 50:39.600]  up and they'll use these people to plant stuff on your computer which is in the
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.600]  sneak and peek they'll use this to frame you to spoof 5p's every dirty trick in

[53:02.840 --> 53:07.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[53:07.280 --> 53:11.280]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.240]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[53:19.240 --> 53:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[53:23.800 --> 53:27.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[53:27.800 --> 53:31.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[53:31.600 --> 53:35.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[53:35.240 --> 53:39.600]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[53:39.600 --> 53:42.760]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[53:42.760 --> 53:46.440]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[53:46.440 --> 53:51.240]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.480]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[53:55.480 --> 54:01.640]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[54:04.680 --> 54:10.480]  okay so it's totally illegal for the federal government to spy on you in
[54:10.480 --> 54:15.400]  real time to track everything you're doing but Google last Thursday was in
[54:15.400 --> 54:20.240]  wired magazine saying yes we work with the CIA and we're investing in a company
[54:20.240 --> 54:23.840]  that can predict the future and tracks all your web activity in real time
[54:23.840 --> 54:29.280]  that's just they're coming out and admitting they're doing it and that was
[54:29.280 --> 54:35.040]  their quote to be able to see the future predict the future now to get around
[54:35.040 --> 54:41.160]  this it's still illegal in regard you have the field former high-level NSA
[54:41.160 --> 54:46.600]  officials and others they go they create in regard they go and they create
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.520]  these other organizations and then they go out and call your info and then quote
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.320]  give it to the government and it's also and then you have government contracts
[54:54.320 --> 55:00.680]  going back to those groups and so there is that incentive to hyper threat and
[55:00.680 --> 55:05.440]  remember all of this is for you the American people now here's the Forbes
[55:05.440 --> 55:10.360]  article uber who formerly founded a private sector group called InfraGuard
[55:10.360 --> 55:13.520]  which the government then gave the highest level security clearances to and
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.640]  licensed to kill powers remember that that was in the progressive and other
[55:17.640 --> 55:22.040]  newspapers uber who formerly founded a private sector group called InfraGuard
[55:22.040 --> 55:26.200]  that worked closely with the FBI comprises the organization's techniques
[55:26.200 --> 55:33.640]  with GhostNet the Chinese cyber espionage campaign and then it goes on to
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.360]  say the organization's recruiting former NSA officials that head up the
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.760]  organization and the former security chief of the New York Stock Exchange so
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.680]  this is just simply the private corporate takeover of the internet merging
[55:46.680 --> 55:54.320]  with the government and who are they spying on a member of the US military
[55:54.320 --> 56:02.480]  in a live time who reportedly sent the chopper massacre video and that's how
[56:02.480 --> 56:05.720]  they busted this source that went to WikiLeaks and I've been gauging this
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.040]  the last week and a half telling you I'm not sure about WikiLeaks but more and
[56:09.040 --> 56:15.560]  more I think they mean well they are good they may be being fed disinfo we
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.200]  know these battlefield reports themselves are used for propaganda and
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.120]  full of disinfo famous you know Vietnam battlefield reports about fake kill
[56:25.120 --> 56:31.720]  numbers you know just being one of thousands of examples and now that I've
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.800]  seen the media kind of shut down the WikiLeaks story and Mrs. Cheney and
[56:35.800 --> 56:41.440]  others now calling for the arrest of these people it really gets suspicious
[56:41.440 --> 56:47.880]  and I'm open-minded and we've talked to people we respect like Wayne Madsen and
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.560]  Webster Tarpley and John Young a cryptome and I think that you know they
[56:52.560 --> 56:56.160]  have a right to question I think it's always important to question but I have
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.400]  to say that more and more I think WikiLeaks is for real again that doesn't
[57:02.400 --> 57:06.320]  mean they're not fed disinfo from time to time but nobody's perfect we're all
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.600]  trying our best here but you know now they're explaining how they got this
[57:10.600 --> 57:14.400]  information and trying to spin it in the media as if it's a good thing this is a
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.400]  government this is a CIA who a month and a half ago told spy talk in the
[57:19.400 --> 57:24.520]  Washington Post that oh yeah we created fake bin Laden videos senior CIA
[57:24.520 --> 57:31.280]  official said and they're just converting our whole economy to a spy
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.600]  wonderland and they're the bosses of it and they get the private profits from it
[57:35.600 --> 57:42.520]  it is so diabolical I mean that's the only word it's so well thought out it's
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.640]  so long term what do you think these bankers 11 years ago and they got rid
[57:46.640 --> 57:51.400]  of Glass-Steagall with Ken Lay and others helping what do you think they
[57:51.400 --> 57:56.040]  were planning well we know bringing down society consolidating power taking
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.640]  over and what they were going to do was so illegal and so criminal that they had
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.440]  to control the SEC they had to control the internet they had to control the
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.400]  web so to dominate the search engine the NSA created Google best software out
[58:09.400 --> 58:15.400]  there they dominated the media gave them all the attention to dominate online
[58:15.400 --> 58:18.880]  video they bought up YouTube
[58:23.680 --> 58:29.400]  this is a corporate conquest and they know how to do corporate takeovers they've
[58:29.400 --> 58:32.880]  had a corporate takeover of government this isn't the government taking over
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.680]  the corporations this is select corporations taking over government who
[58:36.680 --> 58:44.480]  then takes over other corporations for them thank you for listening to GCN

[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:36.400]  border all things sovereignty we saw Friday legal aliens at a Yankees game
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.240]  take over the field run around with Mexican flags chanting Mexico Mexico see
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.760]  these illegal aliens most of them and I've seen the video shot by the Golden
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.760]  Gate men and others but I've shot the video myself in Austin of at these
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.800]  illegal alien rallies they're wearing Oslon shirts which means take over the
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.800]  US turning into a racial kingdom for Hispanics only it's kind of like white
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:05.640]  supremacists saying they want their own land plan of San Diego a plan to kill
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.520]  all whites you know we've got video of that and posted on the web a guy you
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.120]  know protesting the illegals protesting in Washington state in Seattle and the
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.600]  cops with the illegals beat the guy up and take him to jail you know that's in
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.360]  my film battle for the Republic and this is a quick segment we're to come back
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.800]  from the break pretty much for the balance of the hour some stations don't
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.360]  carry this first segment so I want to go to him then and we're going to cover the
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.400]  amazing videos they've been getting of the illegal alien supporters beating up
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.800]  peaceful pro-america demonstrators and the San Francisco police actually
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.720]  arrested the hooligans they've been charged with assault with a deadly
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.760]  weapon they've got video of course of congressmen start saying there's no
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.040]  problem with our border there's no problem in Arizona it's kind of like
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.800]  the video of senator Reed saying there are no illegal aliens working in
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:09.520]  construction in Nevada it turns out the Pew research firm says it's double that
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:16.560]  of Arizona in Nevada and that it's the highest average 36% of the construction
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.080]  workers in Nevada are legal aliens but for congressman Stark he just says there
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.920]  is no border problem and senator Reed says there are no illegals working in
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.920]  construction it's their arrogant hatred of the people and when you watch these
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.040]  start videos they've authorized us to place some clips of them coming up while
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.400]  they're on with us I've never seen such incredible arrogance and up at
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:44.720]  prisonplanet.com Paul Watson has a article written about this today
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:51.560]  Obama supporter Stark says feds can do anything that's a quote it's like that
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.280]  congressman out of Illinois a few months ago saying I don't want to hear
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.000]  about the Constitution I don't like the Constitution I don't care about it and
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.440]  he talks to his audiences like they're two I mean in fact I talk faster to my
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.360]  two-year-old daughter than he's like oh you remnant man you want some more guns
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.880]  to kill people he talks like Sesame Street and he's an arrogant sack of
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.920]  traitorous filth but in this latest video he says the federal government can
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.600]  do anything it wants and tell you anything it's unlimited power and why
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.000]  not they butchered the entire Bill of Rights of Constitution meanwhile Sheriff

[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:44.040]  serious there's a murder hit out on Sheriff Babu I mean this is the
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.360]  intimidation this is beat with America falling and the big corporations working
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.400]  with these illegals because they're pro globalization North American Union Steve
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:59.760]  Kemp Sandy Jacobs great to have you with us where to start tell us from on the
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.920]  ground in San Francisco what you're facing what you've witnessed and then
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.720]  let's get into this congressman Stark and who's who's got to win the arrogance
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.200]  award when he talks to everybody like they're two years old
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.100]  what part of the other Bay Day video all of it yeah I mean just the I mean just
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:22.120]  give us a report on whatever you think's most important oh well yeah well we have
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.820]  a few sanctuary cities around here at the San Francisco Oakland and Santa
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.800]  Jose and other cities around the Bay are close to sanctuary cities they're just
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.520]  not declared which means that they are essentially not asking illegal aliens or
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.760]  anybody that they stop or arrest or anything where they're from or what
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.960]  they're doing here so that's obviously wrong we've lost countless jobs around
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.760]  here there's you know gangs that opens a full of gangs at San Francisco San Jose
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.840]  it's a mess around here as far as the illegal immigration issue goes and most
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.640]  of the people around this area are just plain liberal and they're not they're
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.440]  not taken any alarm but what's going on it's a mess here and we would like that
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.960]  turned around I guess a lot of the country would as well we've got a foreign
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.160]  lobbying group people here waving foreign flags saying this is Auslan I
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.200]  know you some of the video you shot shows that and as Americans we're supposed
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.900]  to just take our American flag shirts off and bow down and say here's some
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:27.640]  free welfare and and and the illegals vote almost to a man to anti-second
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.240]  amendment and we're supposed to just roll over to this yeah and it's um you
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.720]  know it's it's you got to take a very flag all over the place and a common
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.160]  flag that was in San Francisco it's just it's successful around here and yeah
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.640]  we really need to change the problem you know no administration has done
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.280]  anything about it or much about it you talk about putting it the additional
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.280]  troops on the border all that's going to do I mean if you take 1200 troops he's
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.200]  divided by four which is basically the ship that they would be in you know I
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.080]  you end up with instead of 1200 or whatever you end up with 300 troops
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.680]  along that border any given time additional with the National Guard going
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.680]  down so it's it's really it's no attempt at all you could well Bush did this when
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.160]  he was trying to get amnesty it's for photo ops exactly six thousand wasn't
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.400]  even enough back then as I said in the last that's he starts no video we're
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.720]  taught we should be talking 25 thousand and you know starts as well how long
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.320]  and how high would you build with them and I said as long and as high as it
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.800]  takes I mean obviously well I mean it's not like we've got Japan or Switzerland
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.360]  bordering us this is one of the most corrupt failed states in the world with
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.840]  24 thousand dead in the last two years in the drug war alone and now they're
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.920]  shooting cops killing farmers putting hits out on police and the federal
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.320]  government comes in and says not only will we sue Arizona to block them from
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.840]  protecting themselves but now we're going to support the sanctuary cities I
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:08.080]  mean this is treason yeah it's just totally backwards and I know a sandy
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.160]  nine the rest of the men and other folks around are just like flabbergasted the
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.640]  what's going on I mean it's that it seems business as usual but yeah you're
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.500]  right exactly there they're going to the federal government is attacking the
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.200]  people who are trying to solve the problem and letting the people who are
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.680]  causing the problem get away with it well that's because they want a North
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.800]  American Union and their own SPP documents they said they'll use border
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.480]  crises to get what they want did you guys see the senator Kyle video where he
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:39.440]  met with Obama and Obama told him I like that crisis I want to keep it going
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:47.880]  to basically hold the people hostage to give me amnesty no I did not I think I
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.280]  think the one that you're talking about is yeah we're essentially you're saying
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.600]  that if we if we hear the borders right now we wouldn't be able to have any
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.480]  soul to get our amnesty through right yes and and what the senator took from
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.560]  that is we're being held hostage we're being blackmailed here yeah let's talk
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.160]  about congressman stark because watching the video he looks like an
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:17.160]  arrogant spoiled brat five-year-old and he's talking to everyone like your
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.720]  two-year-olds yeah yeah but then you want to take that one feeling well you
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.080]  know we've been doing this for four years and he's always throwing out some
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.520]  rude comment you know who you're gonna kill today like we don't even go down
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.200]  to the border we educate right here in our own backyard and I mean we have a
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.680]  member or two and they they don't even take guns with them you know I'm but
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.120]  that's all part of the of their hoax when it's the Mexican mafia and military
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.960]  killing people it's a bloodbath robbing the immigrants coming across the border
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.560]  and then they always throw out that minute men are killing people and they've
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.400]  got the new movie machete coming out that's all about minute men murdering
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:06.960]  Hispanic children yeah that's I mean it's obviously laughable I mean I don't
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.240]  even own the gun you know we're just concerned citizens is what it is and you
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.680]  know we took a stand and you know began calling ourselves minute men about four
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.600]  years ago and because it you know just so people know exactly what we stand for
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.480]  which is border security I've been kicked off about this problem since 1986 you
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.280]  know what the heck going on yeah well I mean they admit the California is going
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:35.160]  into a depression is a failed state as well is bankrupt and and I mean both
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:42.520]  of you Sandy first I mean how much more can California take up with 95% of the
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.320]  murder warrants out in LA County being for illegal aliens I mean I'm I guess
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.080]  you're just supposed to just give everything to the illegals well right
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.080]  now we are I mean that's the hypocrisy of our government and they're not even
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:01.600]  lifting the finger to stop it and depending on what city you're in it
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:09.800]  it gets even ten times worse it's just insane you know we've we've asked start
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.280]  for years about this and all they can say is you know like we asked them why
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.360]  aren't you stopping this why aren't you putting your votes towards it and he's
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.320]  like well where do you get the information that I'm not and it's like
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:30.040]  well it's right on your website you prefer immigration reform and giving them
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:35.800]  amnesty well that's what they do they always deny everything right our state
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:41.920]  cannot handle anymore of this as as is I mean those curies from broke but yet
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.920]  we're paying all their health care it makes no sense well I mean Mexico I'll
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.520]  say it again is a failed state the State Department even admits that are we
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.480]  supposed to just take the whole hundred million desperate people I mean I mean I
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:01.160]  I we're already going bankrupt I mean do these illegal alien supporters realize
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.760]  what they're doing I mean I saw the woman cussing at you on the video with
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.360]  the Oslon shirt I mean why would they want to make this a Hispanic only Oslon
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.720]  I mean it's so racist but then they call you racist yeah I mean that's the thing
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.000]  I mean you have to ask people okay if they say well it's okay you know people
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.480]  come to the border they're you know hard times they have to do they need to work
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:28.640]  and everything you know we sympathize with that obviously but you know we have
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.920]  to secure our own country and keep it secure because otherwise the United States
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.360]  of America is it's going to be flooded with people where we're with people draw
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.240]  the line is it a hundred million ten million illegals a year thirty hundred
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.960]  million what is it going to be people coming in from all over the world are
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.600]  we just gonna start welcoming you know planes and shiploads of people over here
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.480]  as illegal no that's not what the United States of America is about and then
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.360]  anchor babies pay for everything as we go bankrupt but again that's what the big
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.160]  mega banks want they want to bankrupt us so we go into receivership yeah yeah
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.320]  exactly and then the anchor baby thing is the whole other issue which you know
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.280]  that that law is totally misused I mean it was written during the after the
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.280]  Civil War for the children of place that they could stay in the country
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.040]  legally and it's been totally like a lot of our law just abused and used I mean
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.800]  it's not baby drop houses over here where people come over women come over just
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.840]  now babies so they'll be American citizens and not to mention the whole
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:35.000]  illegal thing oh yeah big foundations put ads in the Mexican newspaper saying
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.360]  come over have your baby here's how to do it yeah and you know another thing I
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.480]  wanted to mention about that too I you know they say that we need the workers
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.760]  over here the farm working that sort of thing okay fine so we come up with some
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.680]  kind of a program that allows them to come in and work and go back home but
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.080]  that's all baloney to all that does is drive the wages down to farm workers
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.920]  stay there both of you want to play these congressman start clips he says the
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:02.240]  federal government can do whatever it wants you worry but only because you're
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.840]  paying attention what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity

[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:30.400]  play the new clip in the next segment this is congressman Stark a few months
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.480]  ago saying there's no border problem in Arizona and arrogantly saying oh who
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.720]  you gonna shoot today just just saying basically you're murderers and there's
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.600]  no border problem and talking to them like their children this is the face of
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.960]  arrogance here it is have something to say yep what are you what who are you
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.800]  gonna kill today who we're gonna kill today yeah I just don't like to know
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.400]  well actually American citizens are being killed right now but that's what
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.880]  is going on that's right okay I want to know why the federal government is not
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.960]  doing anything or a lot more to seal our borders in this country so we're a
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.960]  solvent country again well we can't we can't get enough minute men armed we'd
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.400]  like to get all the minute men armed so that they could stop shooting it's not
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:22.600]  your job we're just citizens of the United States we're trying get we'll
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:27.880]  try and get you some more arms and get you down there to we don't want to go
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.080]  down there we want to help lives of normal lives we pay taxes we pay to have
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:37.120]  the government take care of our borders is that all is that all what the
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.680]  government should do well that's one of the things the government is supposed to
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.240]  do that's what the federal government is there for they said they were gonna do
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.240]  it or not well then we don't need the minute men that's correct we don't want
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:58.240]  well send the minute home that's a good idea what answer what answer you want to
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:02.800]  you don't want to what kind of answer would you like he asked the question
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.360]  look can I answer do you mind if I answer his question excuse me
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.160]  you'll get you through please do answer the question yeah what's your question
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.920]  the question is why is the federal government leaving our board borders
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:23.760]  for us for anybody to come in anywhere they work if you do anything about you
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:30.680]  would know that that's not the case our borders are quite secure thing okay our
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.960]  borders are quite secure total arrogance total contempt he talks to him like
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.200]  their child children oh you don't want to murder some people well that's good we
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.800]  don't need the minute men then and he talks to all his idiot constituents you
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.840]  know that are supporting him but most the people didn't support him they're not
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.400]  idiots going back to Steve Kemp and Sandy Jacobs guys I mean how do you it's
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.520]  it's horrible watching the video but what is it like to have him basically
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:02.360]  calling you murderers and then telling you there's no problem on the border well
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.800]  I mean he's he's been calling us names for years so that no longer bothers me
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.120]  but the other people who are just coming into light of all this they're
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:20.040]  offended and you know the first thing we need to do to do is secure the borders
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:25.920]  and why would we want to do anything after that until we have an actual exit
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.920]  entry exit program that literally works and is enforced because we can't even
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.080]  say oh according to them we can't even track who's here we don't know where they
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:41.440]  live well again they're arrogant because they're the ones engaged in treason
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.800]  they're the ones supporting this racist larika and quista and so they've got
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.720]  to put it back on you you're a racist you're a murderer who you gonna kill
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.680]  today lady you dare come ask me about the border who you gonna murder today it's
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.800]  like I don't want government-run health care oh you're a racist I don't want to
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.640]  turn my guns in oh you're a racist they're just cold bloodedly doing this
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:08.760]  they think they're gonna get away with it Steve your take on this well yeah it's
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.160]  it's ridiculous I mean you know be sitting in the meeting that particular
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.080]  meeting these place a clip from most of the people in there were essentially
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.720]  start supporters they go to the meeting they're pretty you know vanilla type
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.600]  meeting so I brought up that point and what happened was I believe the start
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.760]  was trying to make fun of me so the rest of his constituents and the audience
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.480]  would just laugh you don't go along with him but it backfired and people got
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:39.400]  really ticked off you know just like most people want border security wants
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.080]  this problem solved in an irrational way well stay there let's talk more about
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.920]  it when we come back I mean of course they got mad he's arrogantly treating
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:55.360]  everybody like their morons we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.920]  towards the end of this segment I'm gonna take a few calls specifically on the
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.720]  outrageous nature of the illegal aliens funded by the federal government and the
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.400]  big corporations saying take your American flag off your shirt send those
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.480]  kids home from school take that American flag down off the post office take
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:37.600]  it off that auto parts store this is Mexico go home pilgrims go back to
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:43.280]  Europe taking over baseball games screaming Mexico Mexico waving flags
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.920]  Mexico's collapsing there's death threats farmers being killed police being
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:55.200]  killed hits contracts have been put out and the media is running the hoax that
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.440]  men and men are out murdering people and they've got a big Robert Rodriguez movie
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.400]  coming out we got the script became national news a few months ago comes
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.760]  out in September machete and he claims he's edited the stuff out but in the
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.480]  script it's it's white people are all racist out murdering Hispanic children
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.640]  and crucifying priests and have to be killed and there's a le reconquista the
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.160]  we didn't cross the border across to us and the gringos die and I mean this is
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.720]  all government funded now going back to Steve and Sandy finishing up your
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.120]  comments about what he said with that there's no border problem similar to
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.880]  what Reed has said and then we'll get to the new video clip even more outrageous
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.040]  saying the feds can do anything they want and make you do anything in your
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.000]  individual life they want you are their slave but comments on the last video
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.080]  yeah on the last video you know he was I think taken by surprise that the people
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.960]  in the audience reacted the way they did to him they didn't go along with it and
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.400]  it did really and take them off and we were talking we're talking about an
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.960]  audience of mixed people out there they're Asian people and panic you know
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.520]  people from the Bay Area essentially which is a big melting pot here and a
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:09.040]  lot of people are picked off and it's essentially the the Hispanic Americans
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:12.160]  that you know naturalizer otherwise if people are born here they're really
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.800]  picked off of what's going on with the illegal immigration just like the rest
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.440]  of us and I'd like to add that illegal immigration just isn't from thousands
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.200]  borders all over the world it just so happens that we see more of it from
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:25.880]  thousands border because we have to happen to live in border yeah 80% of its
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.840]  are roughlys from Mexico and people see the standard of living going down they
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.440]  see the states going bankrupt and and that's the big hoax the media says all
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.160]  Hispanics when open borders I've seen polls of well over 70% want to control
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.680]  our borders they understand what's happening they they're Americans they
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.640]  don't want to run around with Mexican flags screaming LaRica on quista just
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.920]  like most white people don't want to join the Ku Klux Klan yeah and I'll say
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.040]  this too about the a lot of people in the country don't realize what it's like
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.040]  I mean they see the gardener they see the housekeeper and say okay you know
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.880]  that this that the other thing there's that you know harm with people when you
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:07.960]  go out some of these protest rallies in a place like San Francisco you really see
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.400]  what's going on out there you see people there in your face angry a
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:16.000]  not everything that they can call you racist all these names and whatnot and
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.600]  while wearing Oslon shirts and for folks that don't know what Oslon is tell
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:28.080]  them Oslon is they want that they're formed by government in here yeah it's
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.960]  a racial well LaRosa means for those in the race everything for those outside
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.040]  the race nothing I mean that's the slogan that's the big national group sorry
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:40.600]  make the other point you wanted to make the other point is about the the
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.920]  children they'll they go through or essentially the anchor babies under the
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.680]  14th amendment they are they're legal citizens they're born here you could say
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.640]  that they the first generation come in here and they work hard because they
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.360]  understand what it's like to be forward and eat things so they come in they do
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.040]  whatever they can to make a living that that is not necessarily true with their
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.320]  children so then what's going to happen on the next generation is you're going
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.200]  to have to have a whole new batch of people coming in your legal coming no
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.400]  that's already happening and and we see that with with with anybody getting
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.600]  decadent and the gangbanger culture so popular and we know what's what's
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.640]  happening right exactly the second generation is not going to follow the
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.120]  first then you got it import another generation to take care of these close
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.440]  jobs that America won't do I don't know what what the Americans are going to do
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.200]  because we don't have manufacturing left here we don't have this we don't have
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.280]  that anymore it's all being exported labor's being imported exported it's
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.160]  America I had better wake up that this country is on its way down I mean we're
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:42.000]  an idea where they call it that's viral right now I mean they're being indoctrinated in
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:50.600]  our schools to accept all this you know I mean Congressman Stark says you know we
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.000]  ask him these parties are fine he's all will not be unconstitutional parts as
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.920]  of it just like the Arizona law unconstitutional it's crazy why do these
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:08.680]  folks see themselves as being from Mexico and that why do they love flying
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:16.880]  Mexican flags I mean it's so elementary you've got Lulac and Moldev and you've
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:23.120]  got Metsha and La Raza all openly saying this is really Mexico why are they
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.600]  fleeing Mexico and then saying they want to live under the same tyranny what why
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.240]  are they so nationalistic well they hold no no allegiance to the United States
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:40.920]  for once and I mean I'm sure if you were in the position of Mexico you'd want
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.880]  all the freebies weren't we're handing out left to right we really do have a
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.440]  despicable government I think what Sheriff Babu says in cyber news service
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:55.280]  today quote our own government has become our enemy I mean that's really this
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:00.640]  that's what's happening and it's they need to get amnesty before the full
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.480]  depression arrives because then they know it's gonna be very hard to get it done
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.920]  and this the open borders have already irrevocably damaged the country the
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:16.520]  question is will it be allowed to fully destroy the nation yeah definitely okay
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.360]  now tell us about this next clip and again if people want to watch the full
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.200]  video they can go to Golden Gate Minutemen.org or the story on
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.240]  prisonplanet.com Obama supporter Stark feds can do anything I mean this is an
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.520]  amazing video tell us about this video we're about to play this video was
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.840]  shot at the last start panel meeting which was on Saturday four last and it
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.720]  was quite a different story from the other one a lot of us people showed up
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.760]  there who were really kicked off at start and what because the first video
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:48.600]  went viral on YouTube and the clip that you're gonna show right now is a woman
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.840]  that was sitting directly behind me and she just had some very you know very
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.400]  quick point at Stark and Stark basically said what he's about to say here it was
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.680]  it was amazing she's enlightened she's powerful she's informed she's got the
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.160]  spirit that will save this Republic and I salute this lady do we know her name
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.560]  yes Kimberly Kimberly's just wonderful and she lays it out this is slavery
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.600]  that's what collectivism is I'm not asking for free health care I'm not
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.040]  asking I want to be left alone but I've got to pay for the entire third world
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.480]  populations pouring in no and I have a right to say no to this I'm not their
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.800]  slave here it is meaning that health care is now a right rather than a
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.960]  privilege because of legislation that passed earlier this year but such a
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.960]  right is actually beyond the power of the federal government to confer and
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.560]  this is because let me finish because it's because it necessarily
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:48.400]  infringes the inalienable rights of other people and the reason I say this is
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.760]  because someone in order to get health care services those services have to be
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:57.440]  rendered by somebody else using their time their energy their knowledge and
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.600]  their labor and this means that if any of us want health care and we have a
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.160]  right to it then we can only have them we necessarily have the right to
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.040]  compel others to give us to provide those services or to pay for them for us
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.000]  and my question I have a two-part question and the first one is how can
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.120]  legislation such as this be constitutional when it seems to be in
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.680]  direct conflict with the 13th amendment which abolish slavery it's the first
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.920]  thing and the second thing is if this legislation is constitutional what
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.280]  limitations are there on the federal government's ability to tell us how to
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:55.520]  run our private lives? I think that there are very few constitutional limits that
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:04.200]  would prevent the federal government from rules that could affect your private
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  life now the basis for that would be how does it affect other people?
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.560]  So the Constitution specifically enumerates certain powers to the federal
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.240]  government and leaves the other all other authority to the states so so the
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:27.960]  Constitution or the people so the Constitution the Constitution is very
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:35.480]  limited in what it can do sir and it specifically prohibits slavery and when
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.640]  you tell somebody you have a right to get a service from another that's
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:43.600]  essentially saying you get to make that person do something for you and sir
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.920]  that is a form of slavery so my question is how can this law be
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:43:03.680]  constitutional but more importantly than not if they can do this what can't they?
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:24.280]  back it up 10 seconds I mean he looks like he's sitting on a commode right
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.520]  there and I and I hate to use childlike analogies but literally he's like a
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:35.560]  swollen big baby just full of arrogance and he can do most anything he wants the
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.520]  federal government is your God and we see more and more of them it's like that
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.960]  Congress went out of Illinois a few months ago saying I don't like the
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.880]  Constitution I don't care about the Constitution I'll do whatever I want and
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:51.840]  so they'll spawn you without warrants they'll raise taxes they'll make you pay
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:57.560]  for health care I mean this is what tyranny is let's let's play that part
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.760]  one more time and then get our guest who shot the video to comment on it here he
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.480]  is saying the federal government can do most anything it wants here and it is
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.160]  it is doing whatever it wants it is saying hey you're not going to stop
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.600]  illegal aliens that are out killing cops and citizens because they work for us
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.520]  the federal government they're our muscle to take over this country here it
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:28.120]  is the question that can do any answer that they can do anything the federal government yes can do
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:31.200]  most anything in this country
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:59.440]  just nods his head arrogantly he likes it he's like yes I do unbelievable man I
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.320]  tell you I mean I have never seen anything like that they're saying you're
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:10.680]  destroying America he goes yeah I am just totally smug enjoying what he's
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.800]  doing he can do anything he wants to you but the good news is these arrogant
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.720]  creatures are now right out in the open you know Hillary Clinton's daughter
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:23.960]  marries this Goldman Sachs guy whose daddy's in prison who's a crook with the
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:29.400]  Clintons and you got made-off and you got these kind of late types they're a bunch
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:35.160]  of thug crooks and if you stand up to them they say you're a racist well you
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.600]  know what or you want to murder people or or who you're gonna murder today
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.920]  imagine you get some people asking questions he says who you're gonna murder
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:50.720]  today incredible Steve Kemp Sandy Jacobs I mean what can you say about that dad
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:58.480]  you want to take it no go ahead yeah that's that was that that's that's a
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:03.320]  statement didn't go over to work with the audience I gotta say it's pretty
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.240]  amazing and he got called on it and it's out there now and I just would like to
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.080]  tell people who are listening to this if you're still behind your computer or
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.640]  behind your radio TV you need to get out there I mean it's just me with a
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.640]  camera and YouTube you've got the tools available to get this kind of
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.720]  information out there if there was not a camera at that meeting and I did not
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.880]  put it on YouTube it wouldn't be known and that's a good point you know I went
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.960]  to the State House for the Second Amendment meeting caught bribery going
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:36.080]  on made national news you know government is so corrupt that if you go
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.080]  anywhere they're just I mean a few months ago he says there is no border
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.960]  problem and it went nationwide he looks like a fool and it's a civil
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.280]  rating dropped you go to another meeting he says I can do whatever I want the
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:51.320]  government basically rules you and yes I'm destroying America I mean he just
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:58.120]  can't help it he can't help it and and if people just stand up and confront them
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.360]  I mean your video has conservatively with all the different versions out there
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.400]  probably been seen a million times this will be seen more than a million then it
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:09.200]  was aired on national news with millions seeing it you're just a few people
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:14.480]  taking action showing these slime bags for what they are people say well what's
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.360]  the solution to tyranny get out there and engage it and all of us working
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.360]  together just showing what these people are the average person in San Francisco
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.280]  doesn't know who their state rep is or their federal rep is or who their mayor
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.560]  is or doesn't know what their voting record is by just looking at these people
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.440]  everyone will then face the fact of what slime bags they are and it's game over
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.280]  more comments on that sure there you know I mean people just look at stark like
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:45.920]  well why waste my time calling them you know I mean I've seen what he does but
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:51.520]  you know what silence is consent and I'm not willing to consent anything he put
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.800]  forward because you know he'll just go along with getting everything like the
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:03.560]  287g program or he verify I mean our poor kids are just being laid in with
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:08.640]  debt and I'm not willing to consent well what are they gonna do you know I've
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.000]  got a big stack here from yesterday on the economy with mainstream news
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.320]  admitting there we never left the recession we're in a depression a big
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.640]  part of it is the illegal aliens and and the big banks together who are
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.760]  teamed up what are they gonna do when everything totally collapses that's a
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.080]  good point we don't know and we don't want to find out so that's why we're
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.440]  trying to stop all this stuff but they just it it reminds me when it reminds
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:38.160]  me of your in a car you're driving you got the pedal to the metal and you're
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.680]  heading for a brick wall which is what we were doing you know for the last
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:45.040]  decade or so you hit the wall you air bags off you realize you didn't get
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.280]  killed you jump back into another car and you floor it like it's crazy well
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:55.080]  more than that the airbag saves you then you yell racist racist racist at the
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.540]  airbag and then stab it and then you go get another car and stab the airbag
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:05.760]  before you crash into the next brick wall yeah it's really amazing I mean we
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.280]  we as citizens have got to do something stop this and it's it's it's to the point
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.280]  where it's not unstoppable but these people like stark are just so arrogant
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.920]  they've got control over everything or so they think and yeah we need to get out
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.280]  there and get on the streets I mean we've been doing this for years it's a
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:27.240]  minimal counter-protest and whatnot now with the tea party movement and a lot
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.280]  of other people starting in the civil recession crash people are waking up
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.720]  they're really saying you know what I've been hearing about this stuff for
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:37.840]  years it's I couldn't believe what I was hearing and they just sort of ignored it
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.000]  but now you can't it's in your face and you've got to get out there and do
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.480]  something I agree and we and we have a lot of great listeners in central
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.320]  California we have a few of great affiliates just south of you that one
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.000]  of them goes into San Francisco and I noticed another website up there not
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.520]  just Golden Gate Minutemen.org but the other one what what's the address how

[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.040]  in San Francisco where American school children including Hispanics can't wear
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.320]  American flags in school I mean that's that's how that's the mind control that's
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:31.840]  the tyranny and they're bringing in a third-world population to be there in
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.080]  forcers you need to get involved and help these people you need to get on the

[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.840]  bubble or we're going to lose the country let's talk to Barney in Texas
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.120]  you're on the air with our guests go ahead Barney thanks for taking my call
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:53.920]  Alex I'd like to talk about I call it illegal and exploitation my brother is
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:01.160]  the president of the man the California chapter Tim Donnelly in California so I've
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.320]  been following this since 2005 my wife is from Mexico and I work in Hispanic
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.840]  media here in Dallas Fort Worth so I have a lot to say and I think that they've
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:18.080]  effectively distracted us by using the race card on both sides to distract us
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.120]  from the fact that the federal government the Mexican government and
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.640]  corporate America are the true culprits and in this scenario I totally agree
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.280]  they're playing everybody off against each other they're trying to keep
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.400]  everyone divided and focused on the small issues rather than anyone really
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.600]  that complains about illegal immigration and and doesn't stand up to their
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.400]  government for allowing it I mean it's kind of ridiculous that we're supposed
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.080]  to be on a war on terror we spend hundreds of billions on defense and the
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.840]  drug war and we can't and we openly allow them to come here so my point is
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.240]  and I'm kind of I agree that we should have an amnesty here and we should close
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:57.600]  the border I think that we have a more obligation to make a decision as a
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.240]  government but should we have amnesty to people wearing LaRica
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:05.760]  Reconquista plan of Oslo on shirts taking over baseball games waving Mexican
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.040]  flags well I think that out of fifteen to twenty million illegal immigrants here
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:16.120]  I think I've I've known them for years many people and those are kind of I
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.040]  would say them I don't know how it is in California but in Texas that's the
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.080]  minority and those are just I agree it's it's not really it's not that it's bad
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.120]  but nothing like California I mean Texas is nothing like California but
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:33.280]  there's a lot of Reconquista stuff going on and you know my whole issue is the
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.840]  country is collapsing but I agree there are bigger issues like the CIA being
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:41.520]  caught shipping drugs in but let me get a comment from our guest on what you
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.840]  just said well we've got gang members here I mean I can't imagine giving them
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:57.200]  amnesty we've got rapists drunk drivers I just can't see adding these people to
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.320]  the pool well that's it Bush's last Bush's last amnesty said that felons
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.320]  would sign a card promising to be good in the future people who'd committed
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:11.880]  aggravated felonies did you guys see that no I did not know that was in the
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:16.840]  amnesty bill senator sessions exposed it Barney I want to have immigrants in
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.000]  this country and we do need new blood in this country but God bless you I agree
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.240]  that we do not need to be divided against each other we need to realize

[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  penalizes those that came in legally well it's a real slap in the face of the
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.960]  people are trying to do things the right way just to say well you know it's
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.640]  because somebody broke the law and came in here and been living here and they're

[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.320]  the right way there they're not feeling the border so we can't even start
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.200]  talking about anything until they feel the border that's what they need to do
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  but no I blanket amnesty no way that that should not happen well that's
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.200]  what's happening we're being told give us amnesty then we'll talk about the

[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.200]  they're spending millions on border security but they're not detailing and
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:50.080]  giving the people hey you know we're gonna waste this money over here just so

[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:47.320]  with what I was covering last night on the Sunday show during that three minute
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:51.440]  break Matt Ryan came to me he's linking to it up on info wars dot com right now
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:57.440]  headline dangerous ideas give me a document cam shot boys and it's on
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:07.040]  huffington post with a video and it big think with this individual calling for
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:14.440]  putting lithium in the water to make you behave yourself and they have video of
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:21.960]  it and I just put out the video food the ultimate secret exposed we've got to get
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:32.400]  that out to everybody and here's an ABC news article bioethicist and media
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:39.960]  historian Jacob M. Apple and he's in the New York Times calling for it and so big
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.440]  things talking about it and so is the huffington post and they're talking about
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:48.000]  it like it's good they're getting the public ready for lithium in the water
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.600]  which is an anti-psychotic I can't even continue here on air right now I'm so I
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:10:06.880]  mean they're just out in the open we're living in a nightmare I just can't
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:11.680]  believe it time will reveal whether lithium is indeed the next fluoride
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:15.200]  far more important is the revolutionary prospect of harnessing the common water
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:19.520]  supply to deliver life-saving and health enhancing therapies to the public at low
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:25.760]  cost we covered the other bioethicist just saying this on Sunday with Aaron
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:33.080]  Dyches article you guys print me that Aaron Dyches article it's bioethicist oh
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.320]  here it is here it is Oxford professor calls for drugging water supply and then
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.320]  he says they want to put Ritalin Prozac lithium in the water and then here's the
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:55.720]  bioethicist and medical historian for I I can't even I can't even deal with this
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.760]  anymore how do you URL on this article for some reason it chopped off is this
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:06.320]  the huffington poster is this ABC news okay because it says ABC news right there
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:15.120]  you just somehow get to rant and rave about this isn't even the proper
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.880]  response I'm dumbfounded at this point this week's New York Times magazine
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.040]  draws attention to an article in the British Medical Journal of Psychiatry
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:30.000]  that has been the talk of bioethical circles since May when researchers at
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.720]  Japan's Odie University reported that communities with increased levels of
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.360]  lithium in the drinking water suffered a significant lower incidence of suicide
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:44.600]  because their minds on mind numb zombies that the the Japanese data confirmed a
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:48.240]  previous study of drinking water in Texas that found a decreased incidence
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.960]  in both suicide and violent crime in counties with higher than average amounts
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:57.040]  of naturally occurring lithium like El Paso I would add and then they go on and
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:06.680]  propose it and that's that's that's the New York Times doing that it's the food
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:11.960]  it's the water they're already doing it just like they were already had private
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:18.840]  spy spying on you decades ago now they admit it I'm gonna try to collect
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:25.280]  myself here because I'm horrified I'm enraged I'm sick of these arrogant
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:31.240]  creatures these control freaks the scientific dictatorship it's it I just
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:34.400]  love my children so much they're so innocent they're so good and I have to
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.520]  go to so much trouble to try to keep them from drinking poison water and
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.640]  poison food and these bastards these criminal scumbags are just running
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.080]  rampant and you've got a drugged out population that can't get angry because
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.000]  they're on stinking drugs putting the water in the food like bicep phenol a
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.560]  sodium fluoride lithium all of it and the guys have found a video of this
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:07.280]  bioethicist and medical historian in the Huffington Post and the New York Times
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:17.520]  magazine promoting it I'd love to get Apple on this show and I just know when
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:22.080]  people grab this video off prisonplanet.tv from this live show when they
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.360]  put it on YouTube there's going to be these mindless zombies on lithium and
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:33.200]  prozac and bicep phenol a and and fluoride and mercury just giggling and
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.960]  laughing and lying about me and attacking me and I don't hate them I feel
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:41.360]  sorry for them they're just hateful brain damaged zombies and they're just
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.080]  gonna attack me and they're gonna say this guy isn't even real and they're
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.920]  gonna say bicep phenol a is good for you and that a radiating food is good and
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:54.000]  they're gonna say that the the silicone they're putting in most processed foods
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:01.600]  that admittedly gives you cancer is good why does this have to happen why can't
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:06.800]  we wake up almost everybody I know has got family who's young dying of cancer
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:11.400]  or getting cancer or they're getting macular degeneration from the sodium
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:14.720]  fluoride the mercury and the aspartame people are going blind all over the
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.560]  place it is diabetes is off the charts there's kids all over the place dying of
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.800]  cancer and I have to sit here and have ecoscience written by the White House
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:29.840]  science are talking about drug in your water I've got to read top bioethicist I
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:35.400]  mean imagine the New York Times promoting how good lithium is going to be in
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.280]  your water and the guy goes on to say if you don't like it you can just drink
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:45.560]  bottle water yeah with bicep phenol a I'm looking forward to the day when I
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  could sacrifice whatever specious liberty claim I might have in consuming
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.160]  natural tap water in order to help save the lives of my neighbors and fellow
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:15:01.160]  human beings that's a quote that this bioethicist says about that's like this
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:06.280]  other bioethicist the Oxford professor says it's cognitive boosting and it's
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:09.640]  like that CBS piece where they say mercury is good for your child and will
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.800]  improve them they mean it's an improvement to make you a brain damage zombie
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:18.120]  that serves them see it's all lawyers speak it's all little sick jokes where
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.520]  they think you're so dumb and already so drugged and so passive that they can
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.560]  come right out and say we're gonna drug your water supply when they're already
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:32.640]  doing it and we're gonna do it for your own good I'm just gonna take calls on the
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.440]  immigration issue until I settle down because I I almost dumped this desk over
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:39.160]  a minute ago almost through the microphone across the room almost ran
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.640]  outside and I almost started knocking on doors of other businesses saying look
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.200]  they're driving the water you that's a normal response it's like five years
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.760]  ago Google came out and said we're using the microphone on board your
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.480]  computer and the and the camera to watch and listen to you but it's okay
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.200]  because computers are doing it creating keyword data files imagine if
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:06.280]  somebody came to your door knocked on it and said I want to put cameras in your
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.840]  house washing you'd say get out of here you maniac but they come out they
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:16.600]  admit that it's 20 to 50 times depending on the system higher radiation in these
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:25.800]  naked body scanners then what they'd said and it's gonna cause cancer that's John
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.960]  Hopkins you name it reporting it suddenly all over the country they're
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:33.880]  turning up the brain scan systems on high and everybody's hair is falling out
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:36.920]  and they're getting cancer and they just admit it they're just killing us left
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:45.600]  and right that's all I think about I had nightmares about this last night and
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:49.840]  that's normal you got a bunch of sicko control freaks poison our water and
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:57.400]  killing us and I got family who I can't even get to stop drinking diet coke even
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:01.400]  though they know it's true they're so addicted they can't stop and people say
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:05.920]  well look at you you know you you look like you're a few pounds overweight what
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:10.320]  the hell does that have to do with it I know I've got problems I know I do
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:16.800]  unhealthy things I don't eat fast food unless I'm on a road trip and it's all
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:21.120]  there isn't some small town that always feels sick after I do I try to eat
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:25.520]  organic I try to help my children what does it have to do with me why when I
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.960]  warn you do you mentally ill people out there then say I'm bad I'm not talking
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:33.400]  I already I care about the people we've already woken up but I really care about
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:39.760]  those who won't listen to me they're drugging your water lithium is a toxic
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:45.040]  heavy metal that's also deadly and has serious health side effects it's a it's
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:59.160]  a hardcore chemical lobotomizer people wonder why the public's not more upset
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:03.840]  not more angry by trillions being stolen by criminal banks and the aerospace
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.280]  being closed so Chelsea's marrying the son of a criminal mob family whose dad's
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:13.000]  in prison for ripping off taxpayers a crook congressman and millions of
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.320]  dollars what six million dollars of tax money to pay for it let them eat cake as
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:21.240]  dr. Paul Craig Roberts latest article talks about I mean it's just it's too
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:26.800]  much a bunch of arrogant bug-eyed scum thinks they can drug our water and
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:34.040]  surveil us and militarize the police against us and train the police to take
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:37.440]  on the American people while the cops are having their water and their food
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:41.680]  poisoned too don't you understand that men and women we're all in this together
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.920]  this isn't about black and white air Hispanic or Christian or Jewish or
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:52.000]  German or Chinese this is about a scientific dictatorship that thinks
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.280]  you're so stupid they admit they're poisoning your butt and suddenly there's
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:01.480]  bioethicist all over the news every day new mainstream articles saying we want
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:06.160]  to put lithium in your water I got news for you we've already caught them doing
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:15.400]  it we've got to have a normal response to this but we're just comfortable drinking

[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:55.480]  scientist bioethicist promoting this and we wrote another article about this over
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.080]  the weekend Oxford professor calls for drugging water supply and I covered that
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:06.600]  on last night show a separate professor one of the top bioethicists from that
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:11.560]  prestigious university folks they're already doing it we've already caught
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:18.360]  them it's so incredible and that's why people are so passive you don't have a
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:22.240]  right to forcibly drug me because you say it's liberal and loving to keep me
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:25.600]  from being violent so I put up with the bankers raping me while you build up a

[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:39.040]  offset the fact that they've been made servile just like they are now the
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:45.560]  police chief in Fort Worth is promoting anabolic steroids testosterone for cops
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:52.080]  because they're so emasculated from the water they pretty much need it you
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.880]  understand they are drugging us to be submissive and then they tell the cops
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:03.880]  you got to take roids to offset it they're drugging us and jaren made the
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:06.760]  point that even if they claim this is moral you don't say everybody in the
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:09.880]  country's got to eat peanuts cuz it's gonna kill hundreds of thousands who
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:15.080]  have violent reactions to it but that's not even what this is about and the

[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.520]  record I've been covering this for close to a decade vaccines search the term
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.360]  vaccine to cure alcoholism vaccine to cure heroin addiction vaccine to cure
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:27.600]  nicotine addiction and it creates viral plagues viral virus attacks in the
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:37.800]  ports in the in uptake sites in the cells for endorphins and these drugs
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:44.120]  mimic different types of endorphins in the receptor sites and the viruses go
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:51.400]  in and literally selectively are tailored to eat brain cells and I've got
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:56.560]  mainstream US and British news in the last almost decade we've covered it
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:00.440]  countless times you can go read this for yourself how they're gonna give us
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:06.200]  shots that eat our brains I mean come on it's just body snatchers but there are
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.840]  own species coming and saying after you have the shot there's not gonna be any
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:17.080]  more pain after you've taken the lithium you're not gonna care anymore the carbon
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:21.360]  tax it's good we're gonna cut how many kids you can have we're creating a
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:27.120]  utopia Prince Charles is gonna save the earth savior of the earth kill us oh
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:38.160]  Prince Charles and they do it in the simpering soft voice they talk to us
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:47.240]  like we're children everything's gonna be okay very very soon and you know it's
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:53.800]  on record they found a bunch of weird RNA and a bunch of different virus
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.720]  fragments in all those big five vaccine makers with the H1N1 and I'll
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.480]  guarantee you it was in the London Telegraph yesterday a ten fold increase
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:11.280]  in violent seizures when the children take that stinking shot that's a violent
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.280]  autoimmune response with those viruses just wreak and havoc in there just
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:24.280]  savaging those brains I see exactly what they're doing oh god I pray to you to

[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:10.640]  today mainstream news where they're saying in England and the US don't give
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:15.600]  old people care training you to lower the standards of the economy the more
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:21.160]  care we give people the better the standards the more jobs let's go ahead
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:30.680]  and play this clip of this individual this bioethicist mr. Apple and remember
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:35.160]  bioethicists are the ones with the PhDs who tell the federal governments and the
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.320]  state governments on the bioethicist boards do we save this baby do we give
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.280]  treatment to this old woman they're the ones that are the high priest that give
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:48.200]  the orders to the doctors to the dentist to the nurses and these people the top
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:52.640]  ones the ones that get funding are for sterilization forced drugging forced
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:58.760]  abortion they are a group of monsters all pushing carbon taxes all pushing into
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:02.720]  the industrialized world this is a scientific dictatorship and they are
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.000]  some of the top high priest like Rahm Emanuel's brother is one of these people
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.760]  let's go ahead and play the club ask questions about whether or not any
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.200]  pharmaceutical or any products should be added to the drinking water you're
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:20.840]  really asking two sets of questions one is should any product that might be
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:24.000]  beneficial be added to the drinking water and secondly should the specific
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.120]  product be added the first question I think can be dismissed fairly easily
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:32.760]  people who oppose adding enhancement to the drinking water in the way people
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:36.840]  opposed adding fluoride to the drinking water half a century ago rely on the
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:40.880]  false premise of naturalism that because something occurs naturally it must be
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.920]  better now many things that occur naturally are better okay so we're gonna
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:50.240]  go through this so he this is how he sells it and that's the same thing at
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:58.400]  the other bioethicist at Oxford Julian salvash you am I pronouncing that right
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:06.820]  yeah Julian SAVULESCU he says well we got fluoride through and it's the
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:12.840]  test case now we need to put Riddlin Adderall and other drugs in the water
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:17.440]  so they're just gonna put hundreds of things in the water statins you name it
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:24.680]  because they're gonna medicate you this is a medical bioethical scientific
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.920]  dictatorship that says we're going to drug you and that's what these GMO foods
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.120]  are in every study it sterilizes or reduces fertility and all the rats and
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:38.200]  other mammals guinea pigs they tested on it increases cancer in all the studies
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:43.000]  you're being forced to medicate it it's hidden in the genetics of the plants the
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.240]  BP corn the BP cotton that's killing the livestock that eat it that humans are
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:53.320]  eating it's destroying their fertility it's on record you're already being drug
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:58.720]  to the food the water the air they're doing it don't you understand I'm not
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:02.960]  joking around here it's time for you to grow up and realize we've been telling
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:07.280]  you the truth we've done the research I could barely control myself the more I
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:12.800]  learned the more I confirm that we're 100% right I love my children and how
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:18.400]  dare you people think you can drug their water and drug their food and they know
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:22.040]  they force fluoridation on us so now they're coming with the drugs a hardcore
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:29.200]  anti-psychotic a heavy metal lithium super toxic that fries the brains of the
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:33.840]  middle patients they give it to and they're gonna put you on lithium whether
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:41.040]  you like it or not and they say you accepted fluorine a deadly chemical if
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:44.320]  they can get away with that the sky's the limit folks and they're not gonna stop
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:49.120]  don't you understand I'll tell you those people are waking up I talked to those
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.080]  two cops last night at like 11 and p.m. coming out of that restaurant before I
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:56.800]  went home and they they they look concerned they said no we know and I
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:59.280]  said you know they're drugging your water and they went yeah we've we've seen
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:03.120]  evidence of that I said well go to info wars.com we've got a top bioethicist
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.200]  promoting it right now and links to the studies this stuff's already been found
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.680]  in the water and they said we will they said we appreciate what you're doing and
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:14.400]  shook my hand they're not laughing anymore they know what's going on and
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:19.320]  they don't care of some little smart mouth they always send up some effeminate
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:26.680]  little hi I'm here I want to help you I'm I'm the boss I'm the control freak
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:34.120]  I say what goes in your water I decide your mental health I care about you this
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:38.800]  other bioethicist says put serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the water a
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:44.720]  psychotropic hallucinogen which on the label admits it massively increases
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:50.240]  suicide not just in humans but other animals that's scientific American last
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:59.960]  week everything they even now we got to have a debate about them we don't want
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:04.480]  lithium we don't which toxic no no shut up conspiracy theorist lithium is good
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:10.280]  and so is prozac take your flu shot mercury is good I have the newscast where
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:16.880]  they say mercury is good for you go back to him go back to him but that's
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.080]  correlational not causational pain is natural anesthetics or synthetic most
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.080]  it was again easier to paint listen but listen punk you don't get to decide what
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:33.120]  goes in my body you understand that you little smart mouth control freak who knows
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:36.560]  we'll get fun funding and grants and power because you're promoting what the
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.480]  globalist are already doing you understand that my body is mine scumbag my
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:47.320]  children are mine they deserve to leave their own life without some soft sack of
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:52.440]  garbage like you trying to drug them with deadly chemicals you piece of trash go
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:57.720]  back to him same logic there are many things that naturally occur in the
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:01.840]  drinking water that are beneficial in some parts of the country that don't
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:05.480]  occur in other parts of the country one of those items happens to be lithium
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:10.360]  people who oppose adding lithium to the drinking water and trace amounts don't
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:13.920]  go around advocating to strain the lithium from the drinking water in areas
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.800]  where it does exist the specifics of lithium are rather interesting I should
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:21.920]  add I'm not the first person oh yo you're not the first back at up 10 seconds
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:30.520]  please as we analyze this you're your folks you're drugged and mind control of
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:36.040]  you're not angry okay I'm this is normal response here getting upset people have
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.920]  pointed out in El Paso over the last 30 plus years in other cities that have it
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:43.080]  that you should filter your water and that you shouldn't drink it because it's
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:49.640]  toxic in fact pull up poison control search the term poison control or hazardous
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:55.040]  material sheet lithium I want to read to people I already have read it and know
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:42:01.480]  it but I want people to see it it is a toxic metal toxic metal I don't care if
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:05.280]  CBS News tells you mercury and lithium are good for your brain it isn't good
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.480]  for your brain just like all these early onset of neurological disorders we're
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:14.400]  now seeing oh it's normal now to get Alzheimer's at 25 30 they say no it
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:21.960]  isn't heavy metals fry your brain period period you like all the wrecked
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:25.840]  autistic children all over the place who have no future you like what you've
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:31.760]  done to people you're sickening eugenics extermination lovers you're the enemy of
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.280]  humanity go back to that slime bag
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:43.080]  ah other videos not play out I'm not the first person to propose this idea
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.320]  Peter Kramer floated this idea in the New York Times over a year ago the Brown
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.440]  University psychiatrist the author of listening to Prozac in areas where
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:55.160]  lithium in trace amounts is in the drinking water there seems to be a
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:59.640]  lower level of suicidality and in the Texas counties that were studied there's
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:04.080]  actually lower crime rate at pause and studies were repeated in Japan back it
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:08.800]  up another 20 I want people to hear that again this is so monumental humans are
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:12.160]  supposed to be focused in full of tectonic futility and energy and
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.840]  understanding you know when I privately write poetry it just flows out of me or
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:21.480]  when I'm oil painting or when I'm making a film or when I'm passionate about
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:25.680]  something or when I go hear a beautiful orchestra or when I watch my children
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:30.440]  innocent and good and full of life and future out playing in the backyard it's
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:34.560]  magic and yeah that's scary for some people to have a conscious powerful
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:39.440]  burning mind that Thomas Jefferson talked about and this guy is telling you
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:42.160]  he wants to put a heavy metal how good it'd be to put a heavy metal in your
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:47.840]  water it's so outrageous that these control freaks tell us they're gonna
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:51.800]  run our lives and congressman Stark says the feds can make you do anything they
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:56.200]  want and now they're taking over health care to force all of this on you all the
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:01.600]  stuff you've seen so far is only the testing of this stuff it's just so
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:07.520]  outrageous to look at this guy go back to him and trace amounts is in the
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.880]  drinking water there seems to be a lower level of suicidality and in the Texas
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.880]  counties that were studied there's actually lower crime rate the same
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:19.880]  studies were repeated in Japan completely different cultural you and they
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.080]  have the same result I should add that we're not talking about adding
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:27.320]  therapeutic levels of lithium to the drinking water it's worth noting that if
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:31.000]  you wanted to get a therapeutic level in the trace amounts that currently exist
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.280]  in the areas where there is already lithium you would have to drink several
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.680]  Olympic-sized swimming pools every minute that level of concern pause on that
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:44.160]  level of it pause just like sodium fluoride lithium is a cumulative poison
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:48.600]  and builds up in the organs and the bones and this guy he doesn't know it
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.360]  needs to grow up it's easier to sit around and put a tie on and be a control
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:56.360]  freak and sit there in bosses with his little lispy control freak voice but it
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:01.680]  didn't gonna work Jack you understand that one part per million of sodium
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:07.080]  fluoride reduces the IQ by at least 10 points in a child doubles their cancers
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:17.080]  of bone cancer this is so incredible this is so incredible just everything is
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:21.320]  lies and distortions go ahead to start playing it again here's the video so
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:26.120]  the reality is these are very low levels and there's no reason to think they're
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.160]  not safe in the areas they already are exist so why not get everybody back
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:31.480]  benefit
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:36.760]  okay it is the element it's the ionic form of the element unlike many
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.480]  pharmaceuticals which are complex compounds synthesized in laboratories
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:45.640]  lithium is simply an ion that occurs naturally in the environment I'm not a
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:48.640]  geologist I don't know exactly the process by which the lithium leaches
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:53.640]  into the water but it does and I think it's also worth noting that the mechanism
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:57.280]  by which the lithium works in the body is probably very different in the
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:01.760]  treatment of diseases like bipolar disorder or mood disorders mania being
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:07.080]  it is in the much lower levels where it seems to prevent suicidality and the
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.960]  theory is that very low or trace amounts of lithium enhance connectivity between
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:17.560]  neurons and doing that over the course of a lifetime a lifetime exposure that's
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:21.880]  like saying that Ritalin's good for kids and Prozac is good for kids and mercury
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:25.360]  is good remember they'll just sit here and tell you this is good and it's their
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.480]  choice and they're going to put it in your water because they know best and he
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:35.280]  says don't worry this isn't like what we give psychotics this is a smaller dose
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:41.800]  for you they're already drugging the food and water let me explain that again
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:46.160]  they're already drugging your food and water they're stealing the pension funds
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:50.120]  they're imploding the economy they're criminals they're drugging the troops with
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:54.000]  all sorts of drugs these are a bunch of control freaks I cannot say it any
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.920]  clearer let's go back to him here he is
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:02.520]  why stop it lithium and other enhancements like the first thing to
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:06.080]  point out is that fluoride which is widely available in the United States
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:11.240]  the search in general has determined that it is possibly the most cost-effective
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:14.880]  health intervention in the history of the United States that it saves hundreds of
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:18.320]  dollars if not thousands of dollars per person in dental care over the course of
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.560]  lifetimes and it's the reason why Americans tend to have very good teeth
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:25.000]  and if you go abroad to some countries people tend not to have as good teeth
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.480]  with the same other dental hygiene care because our fluoride protects our teeth
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:34.400]  and there is no evidence that that fluoride no credible evidence does any
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:38.000]  damage so this is an experiment that's been tried I think the other most
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.880]  interesting area to look at would be in basic nutrients added to the drinking
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:47.160]  water to protect specific populations a good example might be alcoholics who are
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.560]  at risk of certain neurogenetic disorders for example from lack of
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:54.440]  thiamine and adding a trace amount of thiamine to the drinking water if it could
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:58.280]  be done relatively cost-effectively might prevent alcoholics from developing
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:02.640]  what's called Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome the other benefit of this would be
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:05.880]  every emergency room that treats alcoholics wouldn't instantly have to
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:08.360]  treat them with biome because they would know these people who are exposed to
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.720]  biome not that different from adding vitamin A to rice
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:18.560]  okay there you go you can watch the video up at info wars.com we got a link
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:22.240]  over to big thank where you can see it right there we have to get out of our
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:25.400]  comfort zone they're gonna have these soft-spoken little creeps come out and
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:30.760]  put a bunch of spin there and you know here's the article Oxford professor
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:34.600]  calls for drugging water supply we're posting all of this up at info wars.com
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:39.640]  a separate professor and he says fluoridation is the tip of the enhancement
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:44.080]  iceberg it's an enhancement to brain damage you and give you cancer science
