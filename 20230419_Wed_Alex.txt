[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Intro Music
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the elite group that tries to rule the world.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  When the population gets too big to handle, the solution is, cut it down.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide, under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  This is being done by design.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  They kill you slowly over time.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  We must acknowledge that the genetic, COVID-19 genetic injections cause far more harm than good and provide zero benefit relative to risk.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  The death rates from this vaccine are, there's been more deaths in eight months than in all the billions of vaccines combined over the last 30 years.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  50% of the deaths occur within 48 hours, 80% within a week.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  In a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  Now, what is it about these vaccinations? You think that they're bad?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  This process has already been ongoing.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  To make matters worse, the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  But then it starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  It looks like Gulf War syndrome.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  It looks like every joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  This is in these shots they're going to give us?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]  It's in some of them, but the U.S. government has a trick up their sleeve.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  Which is?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  You're going to get the flu. Everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  Yes, it's startling, but it's over in a moment.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  That's it. It's all done.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  A new report tonight that early CDC coronavirus tests were probably contaminated.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  Why didn't they work initially? The Post reports the cross-contamination most likely occurred
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  because chemical mixtures were assembled into the kits within a lab space
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  that was also handling synthetic coronavirus material.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  A production firm in Luxembourg said that core parts of their tests had been contaminated with coronavirus.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  This was reported by The Telegraph.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  The best protection against COVID-19 could be by going up your nose.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  What nasal or mucosal vaccines do, they concentrate the immune protection in the upper airway.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  We do have a nasal spray vaccine for influenza virus, so-called flu mist,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  which has not exactly been a game changer.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  So I'm a little skeptical about how this nasal spray vaccine will work.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  April 19th, 2023 Global Transmission.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  Dr. Rima Labo, you talk about a whistleblower on the inside.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  And of course, her now deceased husband, General Stubblebine,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  they were the most hardcore on target with what happened decades before it unfolded.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  She will be joining us coming up today.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  We have so much other huge breaking news, but see the full report that you just saw part of
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  We'll have it added to the front page of InfoWars.com under the live show feed.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  Remember when Alex Jones warned Desi Ventura the government was planning mass killing with vaccines.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  So support InfoWars store. Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  I don't know. Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  Krill oil. What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  that will keep you alive. And I would urge everyone.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  Maybe you don't take vitamins. Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  But the day will come. Vitamin C and zinc. Absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  DNA force. Absolutely imperative. Mineral fusion. Absolutely.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  You have to have these products.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  It's Wednesday, April 19th, 2023.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  This, of course, is the day when the feds blew up Oklahoma City.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  And, of course, you know what they did in Waco.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  It's one of the times they like to make their moves.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  I hope they don't pull anything sick and evil on that scale today or ever again.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  Okay, this is a particularly jam-packed transmission.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  Dr. Rima Labo, who I've not had on in many years for some reason.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  She's an incredible lady.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  I know for a while she was out of the country and hard to get on.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  And just five, six years went by.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  She was the most accurate person out there predicting how they'd use vaccines for depopulation.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  And, of course, that's because her husband was the former head of the Army.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  They had a special operation before that.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  He had a defense intelligence agency.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  He was throughout the highest levels of the national security state.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  And he had a lot of information about what was going on that was obviously highly classified.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  But his wife is a top medical doctor who served royalty, heads of state, presidents, presidents' wives.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]  And I know who she obviously treated from my other sources, but she hasn't given up that information,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  obviously because of a doctor's oath and HIPAA and things like that.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  But she met with multiple globalists, and they openly talked about how they were going to release viruses as a scare.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  They have a pretext of a vaccine that sterilizes the public en masse.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  We now know the COVID shots.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  The mRNA are doing that.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  So she'll be joining us coming up.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  We booked her for an hour at 1 p.m., but I'm not sure that's enough time.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  So we're trying to get her on at 12.30.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  Today we have another medical doctor popping in to decipher this announcement by the FDA.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  FDA, monovalent Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized, pulled from the market.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  But that's because they want to make you, quote, take the new ones, admitting the old ones don't work.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  And, of course, the new ones don't work either.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  They've got even more on the way.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  So what a complete fraud.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  We'll be talking to a doctor.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  She'll be popping in.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  Dr. Stella Emanuel at the start of the next hour as well.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  In the meantime, people are really starting to get it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  I've got clips from Senate hearings yesterday with Rand Paul saying this is Stalinistic and that the CIA is running mass censorship and it's criminal and must stop.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  And then Tom Fenton is a really good lawyer at Judicial Watch.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  And there's an 11-minute report we're going to post to Infowars.com where he lays it all out with the documents.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  But you listen to this.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  We heard all this from Alex Jones.
[00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:17.231]  Five and a half, six years ago, seven years ago now, in 2016, because I could read the
[00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:21.771]  Defense Authorization Act like anybody else could, and Obama, before he left, set this
[00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:28.171]  up, and then Trump let the agency that it had called for be established, and that's
[00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.251]  the agency that coordinates this illegal activity against the American people.
[00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:36.331]  So very important information, and I know as an audience, a lot of you already knew
[00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:40.051]  about this, you didn't even know about it from me, but already know this, but the world's
[00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:45.211]  just now getting to this point where they understand it, so that's a big deal, and it
[00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.331]  ties into this that I want to play first.
[00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:54.811]  It's Hillary Clinton, an interview yesterday, and she says there's no way Trump will be
[00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.131]  allowed to be back in office.
[00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:00.531]  Just like they said in 2020, they said, we don't care what he does, what happens, it's
[00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:01.531]  not going to happen.
[00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.811]  You'll see a red mirage, it'll look like he won, but then there will be the mail-in
[00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:11.411]  votes, we will win, and they did that, and they used the red herring of the machines,
[00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.171]  and there was some hanky-panky going on there, some skullduggery, to divert off on the machines
[00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:21.411]  and satellites from Italy and all that baloney that was attached to it as a PSYOP, and I've
[00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:25.251]  been caught up in PSYOPs before, but I've learned how to recognize them.
[00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:28.291]  They did it the old-fashioned way with dead people and folks that had moved out of the
[00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:35.531]  districts voting, and culling the voting rolls and $400 million from Mark Zuckerberg
[00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:41.611]  and Facebook to do the data crunching to do that, and then they simply had armies of people,
[00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:48.811]  as the 2000 Mules film shows and documents, go to the key battleground states and sit
[00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.931]  there with 10, 20, 30, 40 ballots apiece and falsely sign them with the people's name and
[00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:55.891]  put them in the mail.
[00:10:55.891 --> 00:11:00.131]  My brother-in-law, who, by the way, is a scientist, a super-smart professional, he doesn't make
[00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:03.211]  stuff up, he thought it was illegal to be in a post office filling people, so he didn't
[00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:07.451]  tape it, but a day after the election, because we know what's going on for about a week,
[00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:09.411]  he was in the main Austin...
[00:11:09.647 --> 00:11:18.887]  Federal mail facility, you know, the post office, and saw a guy with dozens of ballots
[00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:23.207]  that he was signing different names to and taking pictures of each one.
[00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:28.567]  This is way before it came out, and months later, the videos of folks taking pictures
[00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:35.487]  of the ballots, putting them into the post office boxes, putting them into the mail drop
[00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.487]  boxes.
[00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:41.887]  But he saw the guy in the place doing it and described exactly what we know they then did.
[00:11:41.887 --> 00:11:47.407]  So I have family with his eyeballs, I mean, you know, a chemist, works for major companies,
[00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.407]  very professional.
[00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:56.447]  You know, to say he was very upset, very disturbed, and he saw it happen, and I kind of got mad
[00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:57.447]  at him.
[00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:58.447]  I said, why the hell didn't you video?
[00:11:58.447 --> 00:12:00.927]  And he said, well, I think it's probably illegal to film at a federal thing when somebody's
[00:12:00.927 --> 00:12:02.047]  doing their own documents.
[00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:08.527]  But he saw the guy filling out the names he had on the list onto the mail and putting
[00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:12.927]  it in, well, handing it over to the postal worker.
[00:12:12.927 --> 00:12:16.487]  And he sat there while he was mailing a package and watched this guy in front of him do this
[00:12:16.487 --> 00:12:19.407]  for 10 minutes.
[00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:20.727]  And so we know what they did.
[00:12:20.727 --> 00:12:22.807]  We know they covered up the windows of the facilities.
[00:12:22.807 --> 00:12:27.647]  They claimed pipes had broken in Atlanta.
[00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:32.247]  And so when Hillary says that they're going to make sure Trump doesn't get elected, you
[00:12:32.247 --> 00:12:33.247]  can believe her.
[00:12:33.247 --> 00:12:41.287]  And this whole Fox News dominion reached $787 million settlement.
[00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:46.727]  That's all just because they've got neocons and they've got Republicans in text messages
[00:12:46.727 --> 00:12:49.327]  saying we think this is all bull.
[00:12:49.327 --> 00:12:52.007]  Tell the other hosts they shouldn't be covering it.
[00:12:52.007 --> 00:12:54.327]  And then other producers saying, no, it's a really hot issue.
[00:12:54.327 --> 00:12:55.327]  There's some evidence of it.
[00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:56.327]  We're going to cover it.
[00:12:56.327 --> 00:12:57.967]  That's their opinion.
[00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:03.367]  So now they get to run around and say, Fox admits they lied because you have people in
[00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:05.807]  a news organization arguing and debating.
[00:13:05.807 --> 00:13:07.287]  What do you think they do on air?
[00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.327]  What do you think we do here?
[00:13:09.327 --> 00:13:14.767]  In lawsuits against me, they went, we have interviews with Paul Watson on your show disagreeing
[00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:16.287]  that Sandy Hook may have been staged.
[00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:18.207]  And I'm like, yeah, we're not a cult.
[00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:21.367]  Paul Watson disagreed with us even looking at that.
[00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.967]  And I think he was right in the end.
[00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:24.287]  But the point was, there was no order.
[00:13:24.287 --> 00:13:26.287]  Hey, you're going to go out and say this isn't real.
[00:13:26.287 --> 00:13:27.287]  The Internet didn't believe it.
[00:13:27.287 --> 00:13:28.287]  There were some anomalies.
[00:13:28.287 --> 00:13:31.087]  We covered it.
[00:13:31.087 --> 00:13:37.207]  But the issue is then they turn it all into this giant fiasco to go after everybody's
[00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:41.567]  free speech for simply questioning about a big event when we know so many events do turn
[00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:42.847]  out to be staged.
[00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:46.807]  And crisis actors are a real thing in many of these other events.
[00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:47.807]  And that's come out.
[00:13:47.807 --> 00:13:50.607]  And the public knows about that now.
[00:13:50.607 --> 00:13:53.047]  And the system doesn't want you to be able to ask questions.
[00:13:53.047 --> 00:13:59.567]  So now with this Dominion settlement and other lawsuits against Fox, they're saying
[00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:01.287]  the president did not question elections.
[00:14:01.287 --> 00:14:04.927]  I can sit here and play you a 30-minute compilation.
[00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:07.167]  We played many of these compilations.
[00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.167]  The short ones are two minutes.
[00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:09.527]  Most are four or five minutes.
[00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:18.007]  But I've seen a 30-minute compilation in the year 2000, in 2002, in 2004, in 2006, in 2008,
[00:14:18.007 --> 00:14:21.727]  in 2010, in 2012, right up till now.
[00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:27.567]  Right up to Trump being elected in 2016, saying these machines are fraudulent and naming the
[00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:31.127]  same companies that sued the Republicans and Fox.
[00:14:31.127 --> 00:14:33.127]  And we've got evidence of this.
[00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:34.127]  And there was some evidence.
[00:14:34.127 --> 00:14:36.647]  I mean, it looks like they did steal the election from Al Gore.
[00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:40.087]  That's two criminals battling each other in 2000.
[00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:44.727]  But we know that's gone on the past, but we know the ballots and dead people voting or
[00:14:44.727 --> 00:14:48.287]  people who moved out of the district, that's the surefire way to do it.
[00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:50.047]  And that's how they're doing it.
[00:14:50.047 --> 00:14:51.367]  There is stuff going on with machines.
[00:14:52.007 --> 00:14:56.487]  Look at Arizona in this gubernatorial election, where all the key Republican precincts in
[00:14:56.487 --> 00:15:02.847]  Maricopa County gave them two-inch short ballots that didn't read and didn't work.
[00:15:02.847 --> 00:15:03.847]  Only there.
[00:15:03.847 --> 00:15:06.607]  And then they can, quote, not count those.
[00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:10.667]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:13.967]  And Hillary is telling you that they're getting ready to steal it again.
[00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:16.287]  We'll go to break and come back with this clip.
[00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:19.047]  But that's not even the main way they're stealing it.
[00:15:19.047 --> 00:15:22.007]  That's the way they physically steal votes on the day of.
[00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:27.447]  But the bigger way is the AI, the algorithms, the censorship of news that has cover for
[00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:31.087]  the deep state, the Democratic Party, and establishment Republicans.
[00:15:31.087 --> 00:15:36.047]  And it flat out blocked communication from candidates that are patriots from the public.
[00:15:36.047 --> 00:15:37.047]  That's election meddling.
[00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:42.807]  What they blamed Russia for, they did in mass with the CIA running it now on record,
[00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:44.987]  censoring, controlling, surveilling.
[00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:46.987]  So they're caught red-handed.
[00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:50.227]  And now they want to set the precedent that you can't ever question an election again
[00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:53.307]  when the State Department runs around the world policing everybody else's elections.
[00:15:53.307 --> 00:16:00.107]  We'll be right back, InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today, Bandai video.
[00:16:00.107 --> 00:16:04.907]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.

[00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:25.867]  called 10-hour energy.
[00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:31.327]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids

[00:16:40.947 --> 00:16:44.307]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Alt is great, they're two different nootropics, they
[00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:49.707]  go good with this, but this is the king kong, this is the boss.
[00:16:49.707 --> 00:16:59.707]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWars.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:05.987]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:07.107]  the atmosphere.
[00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:09.827]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:17:09.867 --> 00:17:16.227]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:20.667]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:25.467]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:26.547]  dispose of it.
[00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:31.507]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[00:17:31.507 --> 00:17:34.987]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:41.507]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:17:41.507 --> 00:17:43.867]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:49.147]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:55.587]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:36.310]  Oh,
[00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:46.310]  all right so the deep state when Obama left office 2017 in January created
[00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.710]  this cybersecurity intelligence agency that coordinates with all the other
[00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.830]  intelligence agencies to steal elections and to do exactly what they
[00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:00.150]  claim the Russians were doing with no evidence and Tom Fenton's done an
[00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:05.190]  excellent job breaking that down we'll play some of that video coming up
[00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:11.790]  so has Ron Paul but first let's go ahead and play a clip of Hillary on Sky News
[00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.590]  yesterday saying one way or another Trump will not be reelected here it is
[00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:21.630]  America goes to the polls Donald Trump is running for president while under
[00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:28.030]  criminal indictment this the man who back in 2016 consistently clues you of
[00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:33.630]  law-breaking and actively encouraged chance of lock her up directed at you
[00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:39.470]  it's pretty ironic isn't it that he is now a former president that could face
[00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:45.390]  a jail term how does it make you feel well I always thought about him and if
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:51.590]  you follow him I think you can see it as well he accuses people of doing things
[00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:58.510]  he himself is doing it's a form of psychological projection and I always
[00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:04.790]  thought that his record in business in particular but then as we saw him in
[00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:10.390]  politics and government he was someone who cared nothing about rules he cared
[00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.710]  nothing about the law so he has been indicted and there may be others as well
[00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.270]  but he has said he's going to keep running and there's nothing in our
[00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:24.510]  current system of laws that would prevent him from running but even if he
[00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:29.310]  gets the Republican nomination he cannot in my view be reelected president
[00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:35.590]  why can't he be reelected because I think people I think people are more
[00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:42.350]  people are on to him and his behavior than they were before he has a hard core
[00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.830]  of support that is likely to help him win the Republican nomination but in a
[00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.030]  general election against President Biden I do not believe he can win so you don't
[00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.510]  think he can win do you think he's a bigger threat to Biden than DeSantis
[00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.590]  it's hard to tell I mean DeSantis is unproven nobody really outside of
[00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.630]  Florida knows very much about him and in Florida they're watching him do crazy
[00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.990]  things so I actually believe that President Biden will be reelected
[00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:13.550]  regardless of who the Republican nominee is hey that's what they want people like
[00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.430]  Fetterman and Biden that don't know what planet they're on so the criminals can
[00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:22.710]  operate in the background and blame the puppet later useful idiots so total
[00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.550]  projection she says Trump's projecting his criminality on the Democrats but he's
[00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.190]  the one that's a criminal and we all know the laundry list of real crimes that
[00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:36.270]  these monsters have committed but remember it's Hillary Clinton and it
[00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.070]  came out a year after the election that told the networks give Trump all the
[00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.430]  attention make sure he wins the nomination we believe he's the easiest
[00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:49.010]  to beat so instead of admitting she was wrong she's trying to make that
[00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:54.510]  fraudulent reality come true again remember the cover of Newsweek madam
[00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.670]  president they printed up 280,000 of them and had them being delivered to
[00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.310]  store shelves that's why we were able to get copies of them they were on the
[00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:10.150]  store shelves in some jurisdictions the day before the election
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:18.760]  Here's a clip, and I got a bunch of these powerful hearings yesterday, of Rand Paul
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:27.160]  pointing out that DHS on election, on shots, on everything, told children to spy on their
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]  parents.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]  Here it is.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.800]  In 2021, DHS even put out a video encouraging children to report their own family members
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.560]  to Facebook for disinformation.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.840]  If they challenge the U.S. government narratives on COVID-19, does that not sound like something
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]  out of 1984?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.400]  Does that not sound like something out of Stalin's Russia?
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.680]  That our government's trying to get our kids to report their parents?
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.480]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.400]  Can you imagine your agency's putting out a video to tell kids to report their parents
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.400]  if they say something like, well, maybe children don't need to be vaccinated?
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.040]  I still say that because it's the truth.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.160]  The risks for the vaccine are greater than the disease for COVID for children.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.880]  It's different for the elderly and those who are targeted disease, but that's an opinion
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.800]  based in fact, based on peer review papers.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.120]  But that's not the government shouldn't get involved with trying to censor and restrict
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.240]  my ability to say these things.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.520]  In reality, the most significant source of disinformation during the pandemic with the
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.840]  most influence and greatest impact on people's lives was the U.S. government.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.080]  The greatest purveyor of disinformation has been the U.S. government.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.000]  And all of that's true, you know, I wish Rand Paul wouldn't go with that statement he's had
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.560]  now for like two and a half years that, well, the vaccine shouldn't be given to children
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.360]  because the risk of it outweigh the benefits.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.960]  All the studies show no benefits.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.720]  And the same thing for old people, it erases your immune system.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.480]  It causes all sorts of autoimmune problems.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.280]  It doesn't protect you.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.840]  But he goes back to that statement of.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.080]  Maybe it helps the old people.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.280]  No, it doesn't, Senator Paul, but that's not why I was getting into this.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.920]  There's an 11 minute video.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:14.080]  I'm going to post to the front page of Infowars.com from Tom Fenton's Twitter.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.200]  Biden agency hiding records on censorship program targeting Americans as exposed by
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.960]  Elon Musk's Twitter files, there's an unholy conspiracy in the Biden administration to
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.280]  censor Americans in collusion with big tech.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.280]  He goes on to say, we cannot wait.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.880]  Until the next election to reverse this, they're going to steal the next election.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]  He's dead on.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]  He's sued.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880]  He's got the documents.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.560]  And now he's suing along with the attorney generals of Missouri and Louisiana, Mississippi,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.600]  to get the documents because we have the documents, many of them from the Twitter site.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.680]  But we know that the feds were calling the shots.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.920]  A lot of that's come out.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.760]  So this is illegal to have government with the Democratic Party colluding to manipulate
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.000]  elections, medical knowledge, all of it.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.240]  I mean, this is this is everything they're doing.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.160]  And they they want the children just like Hitler, one of the children of the communists
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.560]  with the children, because they're young and don't know they can be conned easier.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.320]  That's why they're organizing the children in these malice spy brigades, both online
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.920]  the real world to go after the adults.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.560]  This is the enemy battle plan.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.800]  This is defunding the police.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.240]  This is dissolving the border.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.560]  This is the takedown of the country.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.200]  We're going to break, come back to some of Tom Fenton and more of Senator Paul.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.480]  And then just so much more.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.080]  I meant to get to the shish that covered it some, but I've got to spend some time on this.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080]  Documents are out.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]  It's confirmed.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.400]  Pigs and cows are being given the MRNA shots since 2018.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.760]  Oh, before the whole covid hysteria.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.800]  That's what Bill Gates is mini me.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:55.040]  Now, she said in 2018 on C-SPAN in that hearing, we played so many times or that roundtable
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.320]  discussion with a bunch of the federal regulators of the agencies up there.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.360]  They said we need to have a virus out of China to blow up the system and just have MRNA come
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.520]  in where there's no more research or studies.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.160]  We just test on the public.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.720]  And what did Netanyahu say three months ago?
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.720]  I can play the clip again.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.160]  He said, Israel's one giant guinea pig.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.120]  We're so proud of the Israeli people.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.480]  Now drug companies from around the world can come here and we're going to mandate shots
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.320]  and with our medical ID, track them and see if it works or what it does to them or what
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.640]  the side effects are.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.000]  See, they've moved from denying all this to just publicly gaslighting you and saying you'll
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.960]  own nothing and like it.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960]  You'll eat bugs.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960]  You'll drink sewage water.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.960]  Well, of course, we're going to give you experimental shots.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.840]  Well, of course, we're Satan worshipers.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.680]  I mean, if Hitler was giving Jews four shots, it'd be big, right?
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.040]  But it's Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.640]  So it's liberal.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.640]  Wow.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]  That is sick.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.640]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.120]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.440]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.940]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.160]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.360]  So we've made our own.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.480]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.960]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.520]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.720]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.840]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.160]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.520]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.080]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080]  Red, white and blue.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]  24.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.320]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.120]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:54.160]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.680]  or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:09.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]  us.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.520]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.160]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.960]  and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]  It's really just incredible.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.160]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support and I want to encourage
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.720]  you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.840]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]  Keep doing it.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.080]  Most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.840]  and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.560]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.680]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]  will be over.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]  Please take action now.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.720]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.960]  drinking that.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.720]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.720]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour group.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.360]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.560]  that sells for twice the price and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.240]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]  two or three times.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.080]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.360]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.360]  leading competitor.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.720]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.480]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.520]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.600]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]  in stock.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.980]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.980]  That is a hellish future.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.960]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.960]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.880]  Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.400]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.320]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.920]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.840]  that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.440]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440]  copies.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.720]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet, to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.880]  signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies, and donate them to the library, or
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.520]  give them to the local school.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.520]  This is an Infowar.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.520]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:26.130]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:34.130]  Alright, I was about to get to Tom Fenton, laying out in 11 minutes how there's been a coup over our country and our elections.
[00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:42.130]  Hands down, it's not debated, it's totally illegal, it's everything they claim the Russians were doing, but the U.S. government was doing it, run by the globalists.
[00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.130]  I'll have to get to that coming up later.
[00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:50.130]  Don't forget that Arema Labo is going to be joining us at the bottom of the next hour, the ultimate whistleblower that predicted it all.
[00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:57.130]  She's got new groundbreaking intel on how they're planning to release new viruses in the next phase of the New World Order and how we can stop it.
[00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.130]  I cannot stress to you how important this is going to be.
[00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.130]  Everybody needs to tune in.
[00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:12.130]  Everybody needs to tell their email list, their text message friends, people, random folks in a 7-Eleven, hey, tune in to InfoWars.com forward slash show, Forbidden Info, coming up 1230 Central.
[00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:15.130]  Because we need this to go viral, okay?
[00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.130]  We need to get outside the choir.
[00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:24.130]  Yeah, we've got millions of listeners and viewers a day, and the clips go out and reach tens of millions a day, but we need people to hear this coming up.
[00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:34.130]  Okay, I said I was going to get to Tom Fenton, but they just told me during the break that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running against Biden,
[00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:40.130]  that's got the deep state very upset, is officially making his announcement in Boston.
[00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.130]  And so we're going to take you to that.
[00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.130]  Again, it was live a few minutes ago.
[00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.130]  We're backing it up to the start in the live feed.
[00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.130]  I'm going to air some of this.
[00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.130]  Here it is.
[00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.130]  Here it is.
[00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.130]  Thank you.
[00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.130]  Kennedy24.com.
[00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.130]  Thank you for having us.
[00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:39.130]  And thank you to all the people who worked so hard to make this a really great event.
[00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:46.130]  I wanted to do this event in Boston because this is a town that I have strong roots in.
[00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.130]  I graduated high school here.
[00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.130]  I went to college here.
[00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:58.130]  But more importantly, all of my Kennedy grandparents, Kennedy and Kissinger grandparents, landed here in 1848,
[00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:04.130]  leading the British Depression and the Potato Family back at home.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:09.130]  And they arrived here for the nation for 800 years.
[00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:13.130]  There was legalized oppression against Irish Catholics.
[00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.130]  They were not able to vote.
[00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:18.130]  Okay, we're going to leave this feed because Fox was carrying it.
[00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.130]  It had good audio.
[00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.130]  But then cut it.
[00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.130]  And RFK Jr. running for president is a big damn deal.
[00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.130]  He's already ahead of Biden in many polls.
[00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.130]  And so it should be on every channel in the country.
[00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.130]  But of course it's not.
[00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.130]  We're going with some amateur feed of the live feed.
[00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:39.130]  So once we get a HD feed with good audio, you better believe we'll be airing excerpts
[00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.130]  or large portions of the speech today or tomorrow.
[00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.130]  And it will be posted to Infowars.com.
[00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.130]  But this is more election meddling.
[00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:52.130]  RFK Jr., his father assassinated when he was winning primaries across the country
[00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:56.130]  after his brother, JFK, was murdered, is executed.
[00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.130]  And the witnesses all say that Sirhan Sirhan didn't shoot him.
[00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.130]  JFK operated behind him but shot him, what, seven times in the back.
[00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.130]  And RFK Jr. has talked about that and they call him a conspiracy theorist.
[00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.130]  It's his father.
[00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.130]  They murdered his namesake.
[00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.130]  Or he's the namesake.
[00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.130]  So this is a big deal.
[00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:20.130]  And, of course, it's not being carried anywhere.
[00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.130]  And we can't even get a good feed of it.
[00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.130]  So that is how disgusting all this is.
[00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.130]  But somebody will upload a good feed and we will get to that for you.
[00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.130]  All right.
[00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:34.130]  Let me get back to what I was already talking about here.
[00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.130]  It's an 11-minute video.
[00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.130]  It's been posted on the live show feed at Infowars.com.
[00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.130]  Again, the live show feed every day I write a headline for the front page of Infowars.
[00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:46.130]  And then four or five critical things each day under the live show feed,
[00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.130]  we'll put the live show feed on screen,
[00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.130]  will be posted under the live show feed that I think are particularly important.
[00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.130]  Today's live show feed at Infowars.com is titled,
[00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.130]  The Population Alert.
[00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.130]  Globalists Preparing to Release New Deadly Viruses.
[00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:03.130]  Whistleblower Dr. Rima Labo, who predicted the globalist COVID assault,
[00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.130]  joins Alex Jones to issue emergency warning.
[00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.130]  The Population Alert.
[00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.130]  Globalists Preparing to Release New Deadly Viruses.
[00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.130]  Whistleblower Dr. Rima Labo, who predicted the globalist COVID assault,
[00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.130]  joins Alex Jones to issue emergency warning.
[00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.130]  That's the feed you take every day,
[00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.130]  that you email, that you text message, that you share.
[00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:26.130]  And then under that, we're posting all the key videos
[00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.130]  that I'm particularly talking about.
[00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.130]  I'm going to have the Tom Fenton, or I'm told it's already posted,
[00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.130]  posted under that.
[00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.130]  Because I won't have time to air the whole 11 and a half minutes.
[00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.130]  But let's go ahead and get started with it.
[00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.130]  Here it is.
[00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.130]  Big censorship.
[00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.130]  The Biden administration is committed to it,
[00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.130]  and they've been promoting it,
[00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.130]  and aren't embarrassed about it.
[00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.130]  This censorship operation,
[00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.130]  run out of the Department of Homeland Security,
[00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.130]  which as I recall, and you should recall,
[00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.130]  was created to protect the homeland from terrorists, right?
[00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.130]  And to protect us from having planes thrown into buildings.
[00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.130]  Now it's being used to censor us
[00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.130]  for criticizing the way Biden got elected.
[00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.130]  One of the biggest abuses of our time
[00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.130]  is the use of the Justice Department,
[00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.130]  the Department of Homeland Security,
[00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.130]  the CIA, the State Department,
[00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.130]  the Defense Department,
[00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.130]  the White House,
[00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.130]  to collude with big tech to censor you.
[00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:28.130]  So Americans have been victimized by the millions
[00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.130]  by this collusion of censorship,
[00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.130]  this, as someone said, this big censorship,
[00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:37.130]  what is it, the censorship industrial complex,
[00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.130]  to target American citizens.
[00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.130]  And the censorship, obviously,
[00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:47.130]  most directly impacted the 2020 election,
[00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.130]  in the sense that it was designed
[00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.130]  to influence the 2020 election,
[00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:56.130]  by censoring information about Hunter Biden,
[00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.130]  and by suppressing the other candidate,
[00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.130]  President Trump.
[00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.130]  And then you had the censorship related to COVID,
[00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.130]  the vaccines, COVID origin,
[00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.130]  you have the censorship ongoing
[00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.130]  related to election integrity,
[00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.130]  and the disputes about elections,
[00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.130]  it's still happening.
[00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.130]  If I say the wrong thing here on YouTube,
[00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.130]  they'll take the damn video down.
[00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.130]  Pardon my language.
[00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.130]  So it's ongoing,
[00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.130]  and it's with the endorsement and support
[00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.130]  and pressure from the Biden administration.
[00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.130]  And Judicial Watch has been front and center
[00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.130]  in exposing and investigating this.
[00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.130]  Now, we've heard about the Twitter files
[00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:38.130]  where Elon Musk has allowed reporters
[00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.130]  to look at internal Twitter documents
[00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.130]  documenting some of this collusion
[00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.130]  with the federal government,
[00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.130]  that not only show collusion with the feds
[00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.130]  and some state officials,
[00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.130]  but also that the collusion includes
[00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.130]  Facebook and Google
[00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.130]  and these other social media platforms.
[00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.130]  And Judicial Watch has been trying
[00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.130]  to get the other side of the Twitter files
[00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.130]  by suing in federal court
[00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.130]  to say, well, Twitter says
[00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.130]  you've been telling them the censor,
[00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.130]  we want your documents,
[00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.130]  showing that you were telling
[00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.130]  Twitter and others to censor.
[00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.130]  And so accordingly, we've been suing,
[00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.130]  and most recently,
[00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.130]  we sued the Homeland Security Department,
[00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:18.130]  Department of Homeland Security,
[00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.130]  for records on their censorship meetings
[00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.130]  with big tech.
[00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.130]  And there's this specific agency
[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.130]  that was created, unfortunately,
[00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.130]  during the Trump administration
[00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.130]  in response to the Russia hoax,
[00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:35.130]  that tells you how poorly based it was,
[00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.130]  the Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency.
[00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.130]  So it was originally designed
[00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.130]  to stop the Russians and foreigners
[00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.130]  from, quote, interfering in our elections.
[00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.130]  Relatively speaking, a non-problem.
[00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.130]  Unless, of course,
[00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.130]  you're talking about the Chinese
[00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.130]  paying off the Bidens.
[00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.130]  Instead, it transmortified
[00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.130]  into a censorship board
[00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.130]  that went after anyone
[00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.130]  who said anything they didn't like
[00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.130]  about the election disputes at the time.
[00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.130]  And we've asked for documents
[00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.130]  about what it was up to,
[00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.130]  and we've been getting the runaround,
[00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.130]  an unlawful response,
[00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.130]  unlawful secrecy to our request.
[00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.130]  We asked for records and communications
[00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.130]  of its director,
[00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.130]  its former director,
[00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.130]  its former senior cybersecurity advisor,
[00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.130]  and its, I guess,
[00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.130]  another senior cybersecurity advisor.
[00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.130]  So this is the top leadership
[00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.130]  regarding the following topics.
[00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.130]  CISA has facilitated and hosted
[00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.130]  U.S. government industry meetings
[00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.130]  with Facebook, Meta,
[00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.130]  Twitter, Wikimedia Foundation,
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.130]  Pinterest, LinkedIn,
[00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.130]  concerning election security,
[00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.130]  election infrastructure,
[00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.130]  subsector government coordination
[00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:59.130]  council meetings.
[00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.130]  They decided to not perp walking,
[00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.130]  not put him in handcuffs,
[00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.130]  not do a mugshot,
[00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.130]  because they knew that
[00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:06.130]  that would help Trump.
[00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.130]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.130]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.130]  We learned today they wouldn't have it,
[00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.130]  so we've made our own.
[00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.130]  And it says political prisoner
[00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.130]  with an image of President Trump.
[00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.130]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.130]  It'll be shipping out to you
[00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.130]  in one week.
[00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.130]  Political prisoner with Trump
[00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.130]  on the front there
[00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.130]  in a mugshot jail background.
[00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.130]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.130]  It says InfoWars.com
[00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.130]  on the back of the shirt.
[00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.130]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.130]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.130]  It's a really nice navy blue,
[00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.130]  high-quality shirt,
[00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.130]  red, white, and blue.
[00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:41.130]  Alex Jones for president, 2024.
[00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.130]  It's a fun conversational piece
[00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.130]  and a limited edition shirt.
[00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.130]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:48.130]  So get your Alex Jones for president
[00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.130]  and Trump mugshot shirts
[00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.130]  at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.130]  or by calling toll-free

[00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.130]  It's time to show them
[00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.130]  what a real alpha male looks like

[00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.130]  testosterone over time.
[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.130]  With the incredible ingredients

[00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:59.130]  www.InfoWarsStore.com
[00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.130]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump
[00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:27.130]  two questions.
[00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.130]  I was so grateful because, you know,
[00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.130]  I truly was classically trained
[00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.130]  under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team
[00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.130]  and I really do credit that
[00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.130]  as to why I'm able to, you know,
[00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.130]  get these types of clips
[00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.130]  because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.130]  go where the story is,
[00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.130]  go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:47.130]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity,
[00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.130]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.130]  and helping the American people
[00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.130]  and I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.130]  really instilling that within me
[00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.130]  early on in my career.
[00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.130]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid
[00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.130]  is the third most deadly acid on earth
[00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.130]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.130]  This is a psychotic death cult, period.
[00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.130]  Case closed.
[00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.130]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.130]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze
[00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.130]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group
[00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.130]  that's been around about 15 years,
[00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.130]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.130]  They went out, hired engineers,
[00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.130]  reverse engineered the fancy
[00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.130]  best water filter system out there
[00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.130]  that sells for twice the price
[00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.130]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.130]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:34.130]  thousands of chemicals.
[00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.130]  But you can go pay two or three times,
[00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.130]  there's four or five other filters out there
[00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.130]  that are just as good.
[00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:41.130]  We sell the very best, highest grade
[00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.130]  water filtration system
[00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.130]  for half the price of a leading competitor
[00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.130]  and the media says we're bad
[00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.130]  and a cult for telling you
[00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.130]  you should filter your water.
[00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.130]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.130]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.130]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.130]  The point is,
[00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.130]  you can get the filters at
[00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.130]  infowarestore.com.
[00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:58.130]  They're discounted right now.
[00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.130]  Finally back in stock.
[00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.130]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:05.130]  on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.130]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:28.339]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:32.259]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in
[00:47:32.259 --> 00:47:33.259]  a town in New Orleans.
[00:47:33.259 --> 00:47:34.259]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:47:34.259 --> 00:47:35.259]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:47:35.259 --> 00:47:43.580]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.580]  Mexico.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:51.299]  We looked down a river and we seen the British come and there must have been a hundred of
[00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:52.299]  them beating on the drum.
[00:47:52.299 --> 00:47:53.299]  They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[00:47:53.299 --> 00:47:54.299]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[00:47:54.299 --> 00:47:55.299]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:47:55.299 --> 00:47:56.299]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:47:56.299 --> 00:47:57.299]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:57.299 --> 00:48:09.700]  We've gotten a cleaner feed, a clean feed of RFK Jr.'s historic announcement.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.339]  We'll get to more of that here in a moment.
[00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:15.379]  And again, I can't play this entire 11 and a half minute clip of Fenton.
[00:48:15.379 --> 00:48:16.379]  We're going to post it.
[00:48:16.379 --> 00:48:20.660]  It's been posted, jimfullwhores.com, the live show feed, but he explains Congress is having
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:27.180]  hearings but doing nothing about a totally illegal intelligence agency program to control
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:32.060]  manipulate elections and censor the American people and censor people that question for
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:37.460]  shots and people that promote alternative treatments or people that criticize the open
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.740]  border or the Afghan withdrawal.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.379]  I mean, this is just totally illegal on a scale of one to 10.
[00:48:43.379 --> 00:48:47.460]  It's a 10 and it's just there and it's normalized and they're doing it.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.339]  So let's play a few more minutes of this.
[00:48:52.339 --> 00:48:59.379]  Fenton is mortified into a censorship board that went after anyone who said anything they
[00:48:59.379 --> 00:49:05.620]  didn't like about the election disputes at the time.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.980]  And we've asked for documents about what it was up to and we've been getting the run around
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:16.339]  on unlawful, unlawful response, unlawful secrecy to our request.
[00:49:16.339 --> 00:49:23.819]  We asked for records and communications of its director, its former director, its former
[00:49:23.819 --> 00:49:31.980]  senior cyber security advisor, and it's, um, I guess another senior cyber security advisor.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:37.420]  So this is the top leadership regarding the following topics that has size that has facilitated
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:46.339]  and hosted us government industry meetings with Facebook, Metta, Twitter, Wikimedia Foundation,
[00:49:46.339 --> 00:49:54.220]  Pinterest, LinkedIn concerning election security, uh, election infrastructure, subsector government
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:00.740]  coordination, council meetings, boy, to describe it is to condemn it, isn't it?
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:06.220]  Election infrastructure, subcontractor, government coordinating council, joint MDM working group
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:11.940]  meetings and preparatory meetings with any employees of the DHS office of intelligence
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.899]  and analysis, the FBI, the office of director of national intelligence, the national security
[00:50:18.899 --> 00:50:27.339]  agency, the secret service concerning any of the aforementioned meetings or council meetings.
[00:50:27.339 --> 00:50:33.180]  So we know that size that has been working with both inside government agencies and outside
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.660]  groups to censor countless Americans and the Twitter threads, the Twitter file threads,
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:44.940]  which we detail in our press release, uh, really exposed this a December 16th tweet
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:50.859]  thread includes, um, disclosures in the Twitter files that reports also came from different
[00:50:50.859 --> 00:50:57.420]  agencies and they reference a, um, an employee recommending bouncing content.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.779]  This is a Twitter employee based on evidence from DHS, et cetera.
[00:51:01.779 --> 00:51:05.020]  And you can bet that was the size of the agency.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.580]  And then, uh, you had this FBI agent, Elvis Chan, who was doing all sorts of censorship
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:18.540]  activity for the FBI out of the San Francisco office talking about a foreign influence task
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.920]  force, which obviously would have included DHS.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.299]  Another tweet thread, uh, again, Twitter files thread shows that Twitter was quote more like
[00:51:28.299 --> 00:51:30.339]  a partner to government.
[00:51:30.339 --> 00:51:36.259]  With other tech firms meeting like Facebook and Google, it held a regular industry meeting
[00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:42.940]  with FBI and DHS and developed a formal system for receiving thousands of content reports
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:49.540]  from every corner of government emails from FBI, DHS, and other agencies often came with
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:54.600]  spreadsheets of hundreds or thousands of account names for review.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.540]  Often these would be deleted soon after.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.020]  So maybe the documents are still over in the government.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:06.660]  The same agencies, including DHS and this size of organization invites the same quote
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.380]  experts, left-wing censorship promoters funded by the same foundations, left-wingers.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.380]  Okay.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:16.940]  So you're definitely going to want to go to info wars.com and watch the second half of
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940]  this.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.420]  I'm going to move on now to RFK jr because the national media, and I went and checked
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:26.580]  her in the break and scrolled through the channels is not covering his major announcement
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.460]  when in many polls, he's neck and neck or ahead of Joe Biden and they're not carrying
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.460]  this.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.460]  So we're going to play some of it.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:33.960]  Here it is.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:43.200]  Well, maybe we're just not supposed to play this today.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:49.200]  ...Boston. His daughter, Rose Kennedy, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was my grandmother.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:58.200]  And she loved this country because she understood that this country, for the first time,
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:06.200]  had given her people the capacity and the opportunity to participate in their own political destiny.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:11.200]  And she loved every... she made her children take the Freedom Walk here in Boston.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.200]  She took them to Walden Pond on weekends.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:19.200]  She took them to Greaves Hill and Bunker Hill and the other major battles of the Revolution.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.200]  She wanted them to know their history and to love their country.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:32.200]  She made all of us, all 29 of her grandchildren, memorize Longfellow's poem.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:40.200]  So listen, my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere on the 18th of April in 75.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.200]  Hardly a man is now alive who remembers that fateful day and year.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:58.200]  And Paul Revere took off 242 years ago last night from the old North Church of the North End where she was born, my grandmother was born,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:07.200]  and he rode out to conquer to alert the countryside, and particularly the Minutemen,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:15.200]  that a British troop of 800 men was coming to confiscate their arsenal and their powder dump.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:28.200]  And those men met the British Army, the largest and most powerful empire in history, on the old North Bridge 242 years ago today.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:41.200]  And they drove them back, and they chased them in retreat through Concord, through Lexington, through Lincoln, through Arlington, into Cambridge, inflicting terrible casualties.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:48.200]  And that was the beginning of the American Revolution, but really the Revolution had started two years before.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:58.200]  And it started when the British had passed an oppressive law raising the taxes on tea in New England.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:06.200]  And this was a law that the British crown made in collusion with the British East India Company,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:14.200]  which the king owned shares in, his ministers owned shares in, and most of the aristocracy owned shares in.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:23.200]  And it was their plan to impose the tax on New England merchants, but exempt the British East India Company from the tax,
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:28.200]  so that they could undersell everybody and that they would make a profit for their shareholders.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.200]  That's the carbon tax now.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:43.200]  And of course, the Americans responded by dressing as Wampanoag Indians and boarding the British East India Company's ships and dumping the tea into the harbor.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.200]  And that's when the British sent that troop over here to quell the rebellion.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:53.200]  So that rebellion was in part against empire.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:56:05.200]  But the spirit of that rebellion was a fury that the colonists had against the merger, the corrupt merger of state and corporate power.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.200]  We're going to come back with more of this in the next hour.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.200]  The Dr. Stillman manual pops in with the big vaccine developments, the Dr. Remo Labo.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.200]  But this is great.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.200]  And I can't wait to air all the speech we're posting at Infowars.com.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200]  It's still live.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.200]  It's still ongoing.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]  We've gone back to the start.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:28.200]  And what he's explaining here is I'm launching the second American revolution right here in Boston with the first one started.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.200]  I'm doing it on the day where it started.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.200]  And we're fighting fascism.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.200]  Because the term fascism wasn't even around 250-something years ago.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.200]  But that's what fascism is.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.200]  That's what he's saying.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.200]  And I haven't seen the speech yet, but I'm predicting that's where he's about to go next.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.200]  This is powerful.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.200]  And you can tell the guy's for real.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.200]  And the system is attacking the living daylights out of him.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200]  They murdered his father.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.200]  They murdered his uncle.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:56.200]  And it's good to see good men standing up and going up against the system.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:01.200]  The rest of the Kennedy family, they're not supporting him because they're a captured family.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:10.200]  And the very Democratic Party that murdered JFK and RFK and MLK has a bunch of kept Kennedys.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.200]  They're a bunch of basically leftist miscreants in my view, most of them.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.200]  But it's good to know the firstborn son of RFK is not like that.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.200]  And so we really support him.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:29.200]  And we need to pray for him because they murdered his father when he was one of the primaries.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.200]  So this is a big deal.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.200]  They're trying to put Trump in jail.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:38.200]  And I'm telling you, if RFK starts winning, they're going to put bullets in him.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.200]  The man's got a lot of courage.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.200]  You've got to respect courage.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.200]  Hour number two is totally jam-packed.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.200]  Stay with us.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.990 --> 00:58:04.549]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:07.189]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:13.310]  So support him for worst or listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't
[00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:14.310]  know.
[00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.310]  I don't know.
[00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.910]  I don't know how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:22.669]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:58:22.669 --> 00:58:23.669]  Krill oil.
[00:58:23.669 --> 00:58:29.629]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[00:58:29.629 --> 00:58:31.229]  that will keep you alive.
[00:58:31.229 --> 00:58:35.149]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[00:58:35.149 --> 00:58:37.549]  supplements, but the day will come.
[00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:41.549]  Vitamin C and zinc absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.390]  Mineral fusion.
[00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.390]  Absolutely.
[00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:47.390]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:50.589]  You have to have these products.
[00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:54.549]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:58.669]  book that documents the globals in their own words planned for our future.
[00:58:58.669 --> 00:58:59.669]  That is a hellish future.
[00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:03.669]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:59:03.669 --> 00:59:07.669]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[00:59:08.669 --> 00:59:13.669]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:15.109]  we got run out.
[00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:17.669]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:59:17.669 --> 00:59:23.069]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowarswar.com.
[00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:26.990]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.029]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:32.549]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:36.109]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:37.109]  copies.
[00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:41.669]  And I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarswar.com and get a signed
[00:59:41.669 --> 00:59:46.109]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:47.109]  local school.
[00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:48.109]  This is an Infowar.
[00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:50.109]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:56.109]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:58.109]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:17.109]  Opposed attack on New England merchants, but exempt the British East India Company from
[01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:23.109]  attacks so that they could undersell everybody and that they would make a profit for their
[01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:24.109]  shareholders.
[01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:32.109]  So the revolution, and of course, the Americans responded by dressing as Wampanoag Indians
[01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:38.109]  and boarding the British East India Company's ships and dumping the tea into the harbor.
[01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:43.109]  And that's when the British sent that troop over here to quell the rebellion.
[01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:48.109]  So that rebellion was in part against empire.
[01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:56.109]  But the spirit of that rebellion was a fury that the colonists had against the merger,
[01:00:56.109 --> 01:01:00.109]  the corrupt merger of state and corporate power.
[01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:02.109]  I...
[01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:24.109]  I've come here today to announce my candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President
[01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:26.109]  of the United States.
[01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:51.109]  And my, my mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and over my, throughout
[01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:59.109]  my presidency will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that is threatening
[01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:00.109]  now...
[01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:15.109]  is threatening now to impose a new kind of corporate feudalism on our country, to commoditize
[01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:24.109]  our children, our Purple Mountain's majesty, to poison our children and our people with
[01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:29.109]  chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs, to strip mine our assets, to hollow out the middle
[01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:33.109]  class and keep us in a constant state of war.
[01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:49.109]  Now, I want to start by, first of all, I can't understand that sign language.
[01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:59.109]  I want to start by, by thanking my wife, Cheryl Hines.
[01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:09.109]  I would not be here without Cheryl.
[01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:17.109]  And I cannot describe in words what she has brought to my life, but she is the wisest
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:19.109]  person that I know.
[01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:22.109]  She's also one of the funniest people I know.
[01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:27.109]  And I think the American people get to know her, that they are going to be more excited
[01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:32.109]  about having a really funny First Lady in the White House than they are...
[01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:48.109]  I also want to thank all my family members who showed up today.
[01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:57.109]  My children, Bobby, Kik, Amaryllis, Connor, Kira, Finbar, Aiden, did I leave any out?
[01:03:58.109 --> 01:04:03.109]  I told them to wear name tags, and I can't see them from here.
[01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.109]  And Kat, and Kat.
[01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:10.109]  Notice the rest of the family's not there.
[01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:12.109]  Which is why you know he's good.
[01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:14.109]  My grandchildren, Zoe and Cassius.
[01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:16.109]  If the rest of the Kennedys were there, I wouldn't support him.
[01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:25.109]  My brother, Douglas, my sister, Courtney, my nephews, Beau and Billy Birdsell.
[01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:28.109]  So basically only his very immediate family showed up.
[01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:30.109]  There's hundreds of Kennedys.
[01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:34.109]  This is a powerful speech, very classic Americana.
[01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:35.109]  We'll have more of it coming up.
[01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:39.109]  We've got a very special guest to break down this big FDA announcement.
[01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.109]  We come back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:44.109]  Dr. Stella Emanuel and then Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:45.109]  Haven't been on in years.
[01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:47.109]  The ultimate whistleblower.
[01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:50.109]  She's got big intel coming up on the next globalist attack.
[01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:52.109]  And so much more.
[01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:54.109]  Everybody you know and people you don't know, tune in now.
[01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:55.109]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:57.109]  Fork slash show at MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:01.109]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:03.109]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:05.109]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.109]  We made it even stronger.
[01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:11.109]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:18.109]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:24.109]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:26.109]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:31.109]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:37.109]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:41.109]  It is the super fuel.
[01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:42.109]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.109]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:44.109]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:45.109]  They go good with this.
[01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:48.109]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:49.109]  This is the boss.
[01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:50.109]  Turbo Force.
[01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:51.109]  Back in stock.
[01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:52.109]  Discounted.
[01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:54.109]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:57.109]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:07.109]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:09.109]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:11.109]  All right.
[01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:15.109]  I appreciate her coming on on short notice for just a segment or so.
[01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:18.109]  We'll get her back for a full hour soon.
[01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:23.109]  And she's Dr. Stella Emanuel, a very successful medical doctor and one of the first people
[01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:27.109]  to be outspoken about what's really happening with COVID, how they were blocking therapeutics
[01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:31.109]  and her famous press conferences there in D.C., DrStellaMD.com.
[01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:33.109]  But I wanted to get her on to decipher this.
[01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:37.109]  And what she told my producer she thought was happening is what I thought, but I wanted
[01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:38.109]  to get a medical doctor on.
[01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:46.109]  FDA, Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines no longer authorize new protocols announced.
[01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:48.109]  But that's the monovalent.
[01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:50.109]  Now, what's really behind that?
[01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:52.109]  Here's the actual press release from the FDA.
[01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:54.109]  Coronavirus COVID-19 update.
[01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:59.109]  FDA authorizes changes to simplify use of biovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:06:59.109 --> 01:07:02.109]  So they're basically banning the original ones, saying you need the new ones.
[01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:04.109]  Admittedly, all those didn't work.
[01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:07.109]  Of course, the new ones don't work in the ways they say either.
[01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:11.109]  We also have the U.N. treaty to take over our national health care system.
[01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:17.109]  And confirmed, Big Agra has been putting mRNAs since 2018 mainly in pigs.
[01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:18.109]  We'll get her take on that.
[01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:20.109]  So I'm going to try to just go through these points quickly.
[01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:23.109]  Doctor, explain what you think is really happening here.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:37.960]  Doc, we're going to try to reconnect with you.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.520]  It seems we'll have more technical difficulties in one show than we have in two months.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.680]  It's just kind of when it rains, it pours.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.560]  Guys, without going through a big hour of trying to fix her Skype, just get her on the
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560]  telephone, please.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.560]  Thank you.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.120]  We'll be discussing that with her here in just a moment.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.560]  Let me go ahead and hit this information for you.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.680]  It's a story about Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.799]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:10.240]  Big ag panicking over bill to require labeling of gene-altering products.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:17.720]  And the big, thick article by Dr. Joseph Mercola goes through all the links and the admissions.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.040]  There's no law on this, so the reason we know what's going on is they're trying to
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:31.040]  pass laws to inject chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs, everything with all sorts of weird mRNA
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.440]  gene therapy that stays in the body, lives in the body, replicates the body.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.440]  Pork producers have been using customized mRNA-based vaccines on their herds since 2018.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.440]  There's no laws.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.120]  It's being done without telling the public.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.040]  All customized mRNA vaccines are untested.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:55.800]  Only the mRNA platform itself has been approved, and that's with the so-called COVID shots.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800]  That's an emergency authorization.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.200]  According to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, there are no current mRNA vaccines
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.040]  licensed for use in beef cattle in the United States.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.080]  However, lobbyists for the association claim to have double-vaccinated his own herd with
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.360]  mRNA vaccine against bovine respiratory disease.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:18.840]  Iowa State University began trailing an mRNA vaccine or trialing an mRNA vaccine against
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.760]  bovine respiratory virus on October 1st, 2021.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.120]  Missouri House Bill 1169 would require labeling of products that can alter your genes.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.480]  Big ag lobbyists strongly oppose it, and then it goes through all the links and all the
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.800]  documents that's been happening in pigs since 2018.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.200]  Last week, I reported that pork producers have been using customizable mRNA vaccines
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.519]  on their herds since 2018 without telling the public.
[01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:50.440]  The issue really only rose to the surface after Attorney Tom Renz started promoting
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.080]  new legislation in Missouri, House Bill 1169, which he helped write that would require labeling
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]  of mRNA vaccines.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.960]  And how did he learn about it?
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.160]  Because they're trying to pass laws saying they can do whatever they want unlimited.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.040]  All right, now we've got her on the phone.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.160]  So Doc, what's going on with them pulling the original COVID vaccines only two years
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.080]  after and then saying you need to quote, take the new ones that have already been out for
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080]  a year.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.360]  The word is they've got even more of these things coming out of the pipe as most of the
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.720]  world has stopped taking them and banned them in under 18.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  What's really happening, doctor?
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.960]  I think they just want a way for people to take more vaccines because the monovalent vaccine
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:33.800]  in the first place was built from the Wuhan strain, which was like way gone within like
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800]  a few months.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.599]  So the vaccine strain that even was in the monovalent did not work in the first place.
[01:10:39.599 --> 01:10:43.920]  So now they are putting a bivalent because they want to put the original Wuhan strain
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.640]  and the Omicron strain to make a more, I guess they want to say they're going to make a more
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]  effective vaccine.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.360]  In other words, they want to give us two mRNA strains.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.480]  I just think this is a way for them to get people to start to take vaccines because I
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.440]  guess everybody has the vaccine hesitancy now and many people that took the vaccine
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.440]  already got sick.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.680]  And we see a lot of patients that get COVID two, three, four times that took the vaccine.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.800]  So for them to continue to inject this mRNA in our system and continue to dumb down on
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.559]  our immune system, they have to find a way to get it acceptable.
[01:11:18.559 --> 01:11:22.559]  I think that's all because then they are actually putting it in childhood vaccines
[01:11:22.559 --> 01:11:23.559]  too.
[01:11:23.559 --> 01:11:28.200]  That, you know, they want to put it from six months above that regular childhood vaccines.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.120]  Not only is that, there was a speech where the Pfizer CEO said that they actually want
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:39.200]  to start turning all other vaccines like MMR, tetanus and all of our other vaccines into
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]  mRNA.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.200]  And of course, putting in our food.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.960]  So there's, there's a big push to make sure that we're all injected with this mRNA spike
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.920]  protein producing a gene that would destroy our immunity.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.160]  And I do believe that it's just really to prepare us for, for whatever they're going to be giving
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  us in the future.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.880]  Well, the former chief scientist, as you know, Dr. Michael Yidan at Pfizer, who just retired
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.000]  a year before this all happened, warned before they gave the shots that would cause all sorts
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.720]  of autoimmune diseases, but also that they never created a vaccine for a SARS type virus
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.920]  because it was known during an outbreak to cause massive mutations from the intel we've
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]  gotten.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.240]  That's actually what created so much sickness was turning the people that took the shots,
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.680]  not just into super spreaders or shatters, but that it caused virus mutations and caused
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.280]  the virus to evolve and become more pathogenic and more dangerous.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280]  Is that accurate?
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280]  Yes.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.120]  Especially when you produce a stockpile or a non-sterilizing vaccine, what you actually
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.320]  just do is produce more serious strains of the virus, you know what I'm saying?
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.600]  And I don't even want us to keep calling this thing a vaccine because it's not really
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.080]  a part of this COVID, it's just an operating system.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080]  It's a set of codes.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.840]  The Moderna CEO said that they were actually just introducing a code in your system to produce
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.559]  a spike protein, which does not make any sense since it is spike protein that gets you sick
[01:12:59.559 --> 01:13:00.559]  in the disease.
[01:13:00.559 --> 01:13:06.960]  So there's a lot more to this COVID vaccine thing than actually vaccines.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.720]  And they want somehow for everybody to take this mRNA gene therapy, it's gene therapy.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.440]  So now people are hesitant, they want a way to do it, so nobody should fall for it.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.000]  You didn't take monovalent, don't take bivalent or trivalent or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  It's just some jargon.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.360]  Let me ask you this, because my family's in farming with cows and a lot more, and you
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.840]  always give the limited amount, but you've got to sell cows, they make you vaccinate them.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.080]  Most people don't vaccinate their cattle.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.639]  It's well known in the cattle industry that when you give them a bunch of shots, they get
[01:13:34.639 --> 01:13:35.639]  sick and die.
[01:13:35.639 --> 01:13:39.559]  We've had all these bizarre die-offs, mainly in big herds that have been taking a lot of
[01:13:39.559 --> 01:13:40.559]  shots.
[01:13:40.559 --> 01:13:42.880]  I actually worked for a large animal vet off and on for about four years.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.559]  So I've actually sat there in the squeeze chutes and vaccinated tens of thousands of
[01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:51.760]  cattle literally myself, and only would do it, because again, to sell them, the vet that
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.320]  I worked for that was top of his class, and had been doing it for four years when I worked
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.240]  for him, thought that the things were terrible and didn't work, but that was old-fashioned
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240]  vaccines.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.320]  What do you make of the fact that we learn they've now been for four years secretly injecting
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.200]  pigs with mRNA systems?
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.160]  The issue is they want to get this operating system into everybody.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.760]  If they can get it through food, through cows, through injecting it in people, they want
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.519]  through shedding, which like I said, you were talking earlier about people that are shedding
[01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:22.360]  this operating system into other people around them.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.760]  I mean, I don't know why people have cows, but my cows are not vaccinated, so I just
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760]  leave them natural to graze.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760]  That's right.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.760]  You've got cows too.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  That's awesome.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760]  Yeah.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]  I have cows.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760]  Mine are not vaccinated.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.559]  So we just have to wake up, Alex.
[01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:42.280]  Humanity has to wake up and realize that this is not even a medical battle.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.400]  These things that they are doing is not medical.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  It doesn't follow any kind of science.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.320]  There are so many things about this job that does not follow science.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.040]  For example, people get sick of COVID and then they ask them to get the shot again.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.160]  That doesn't have to do with flu.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.120]  Pregnant women, usually they don't want you to, if you take MMR, mumps, measles, and rubella
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.600]  vaccine, don't hang around a pregnant woman because it can shed on them.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.880]  But there are pregnant women and children that don't even get sick from COVID.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880]  That's right.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]  We have the major studies.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.960]  The spike protein is very similar to prions that cause spongiform encephalopathy, and we're
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.360]  seeing an explosion in neurological disorders.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  Yes.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400]  Neurological disorders.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.400]  All kinds of disorders.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.400]  And one of the biggest things it causes, like I said, is endotheliitis.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.400]  That's inflammation in your blood vessels.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.760]  So whenever this inflammation occurs, and there's blood clotting, you're going to get a stroke
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.320]  or heart attack or whatever.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320]  It's like a perfect cure shot.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.760]  Well, I want to get you back on in-studio very soon so we can talk about ways to mitigate
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.760]  this, even if you haven't taken the shots, but to stop the shedding.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  DrStellaMD.com.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.200]  Thanks for the quick update.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.200]  God bless you.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.200]  All right.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.360]  Dr. Rima Lebo is on in 15 minutes, but I'm going to come back with some other critical
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360]  news first.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360]  Everybody needs to tune in now.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:13.800]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.440]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440]  So support InfoWars store.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.960]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.960]  I don't know.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.200]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:31.960]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960]  Krill oil.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.920]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.519]  that will keep you alive.
[01:16:40.519 --> 01:16:43.559]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins.
[01:16:43.559 --> 01:16:46.880]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.320]  Vitamin C and zinc.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.800]  Absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800]  Absolutely.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.800]  Mineral fusion.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.800]  Absolutely.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.680]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.320]  You have to have these products.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:05.600]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.720]  the atmosphere.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.880]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:15.880]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.040]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.320]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.120]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.240]  dispose of it.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.160]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.639]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:41.200]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.559]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:48.800]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.240]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.880]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.400]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.800]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.080]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.519]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.880]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.120]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.440]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.400]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.480]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.480]  support us.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.960]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.639]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[01:18:45.639 --> 01:18:48.720]  and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.120]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.240]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.240]  will be over.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.960]  Please take action now.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.720]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.519]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[01:19:09.519 --> 01:19:11.600]  and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.760]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.160]  many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.680]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.559]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:32.400]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.680]  and I thank you, but we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.840]  do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.200]  Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill, plus all of these are really great products
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.040]  that keep us on air, plus you're missing out on having these products.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:53.320]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsStore.com right
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.040]  now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:06.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.040]  www.infowars.com
[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:25.530]  I'm sick and tired of getting in my way. I'm sick and tired of everything I see, my lord. Nobody rides for free. Nobody rides for free.
[01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:30.530]  Nobody rides for free. I'm going to hit some huge Mayorkas news on the border and more.
[01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:34.530]  Some of his latest over-the-top brainwashing and gaslighting.
[01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:38.530]  Several of those clips in a moment, but first, nobody rides for free.
[01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:41.530]  We can't stay on air. We can't pay for the massive servers.
[01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:46.530]  We can't pay for all the software and all the infrastructure and the satellite uplinks without your support.
[01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:48.530]  We're changing the world together. Please support us.
[01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:52.530]  I saw a big story over the weekend. You probably saw it.
[01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:59.530]  You've got a company like Netflix that last time I checked was worth like $50 billion or something,
[01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:02.530]  and they couldn't livestream any new shows they tried to launch.
[01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:06.530]  They're trying to do events, and the whole thing crashed.
[01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:10.530]  And that's a company with tens of billions of extra dollars.
[01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:17.530]  We're a company with $25 million a year able to operate and run.
[01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:24.530]  To do that, we've got to sell $40, $50 million of product because 95% of our money comes in from direct sales to the public
[01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:27.530]  because they attack our sponsors and things over the years.
[01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:30.530]  Our sponsors, they get attacked. They get harassed. They get threatened.
[01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:33.530]  They leave us even though they get great responses.
[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:38.530]  So we went to the model decades ago of being self-funded, but we can't do that without your support.
[01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:44.530]  We have our own satellite uplinks, our own encoders, our own servers, our own systems
[01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.530]  because they took everything away from us.
[01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:50.530]  And thank God, we had a pretty good war chest when Trump got elected.
[01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:54.530]  That's why I did things like say, well, PrisonPlanet.tv has been a subscription for 15 years.
[01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:59.530]  I told the audience the truth in 2016-17, and I said, we got plenty of money.
[01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:04.530]  So this is free. That's free. We're hiring all these reporters.
[01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:08.530]  And then the censorship, the shutdowns, the lawsuits, all of it will try to crush us down.
[01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:11.530]  But thanks to your support, we are still here.
[01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:15.530]  And I want to hire more reporters. I want to send them around the country and the world again.
[01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:19.530]  I don't want to just stay on air, which we've stabilized or able to do right now.
[01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.530]  I want to be able to expand. So I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:26.530]  I want to thank you for your prayers, your word of mouth. It's an information war.
[01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:31.530]  And I want to encourage you to go to Infowarsstore.com and get the very best products.
[01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:35.530]  I can get supplements for 10% of what I get these for.
[01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:39.530]  But compounds are still so powerful. You get a pretty good response on those.
[01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:44.530]  The highest end, the cleanest, the very best formulas that top researchers develop for us,
[01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:47.530]  and a lot of these are clones of already best-selling products.
[01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:52.530]  You're not going to get A-plus, platinum-level quality products,
[01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:55.530]  five-star products for anywhere near these prices.
[01:22:55.530 --> 01:23:00.530]  TurboForce Plus is doing improved even better with a whole bunch of natural compounds
[01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:03.530]  for 10 hours of clean energy that kicks in at different points.
[01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:08.530]  Some hits quick, some hits in four or five hours, some hits in like six hours, eight hours.
[01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:13.530]  10 hours of clean energy, TurboForce Plus, now in a canister, stronger and even more product.
[01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.530]  Infowarsstore.com, back in stock.
[01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:19.530]  We got bone broth sold out for over two years because we couldn't get the ingredients.
[01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:24.530]  We got it reformulated even better, concentrated bone broth from chickens
[01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:28.530]  that does so much for your bones, your joints, your immune system.
[01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:33.530]  And everybody knows with chicken noodle soup that grandma actually cooks the bones down of a chicken.
[01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:36.530]  You get that essence, how good that is when you're sick or when you're tired.
[01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:43.530]  I mean, there's nothing like boiling a real chicken down and that broth off of that.
[01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:46.530]  One scoop of this is, there's no way to quantify it,
[01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:50.530]  but it's probably like 20 bowls of chicken soup without the calories.
[01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.530]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:55.530]  It's a special patented concentrate, and this formula tastes really, really good.
[01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.530]  The other one sometimes tastes good depending on what you mix it with.
[01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.530]  Each formula, it's a new batch, so it tastes different.
[01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:03.530]  But this new formula tastes amazing.
[01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:07.530]  Infowarsstore.com on ultimate bone broth, chaga mushroom, bee pollen.
[01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:12.530]  I mean, oh, organic turmeric, it's insanely good.
[01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:14.530]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.530]  We're selling out right now the first run of Diet Force,
[01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.530]  a bunch of natural compounds that help you lose weight naturally.
[01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:20.530]  It's so easy.
[01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.530]  Diet Force, infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:29.530]  1776 testosterone boost for your energy, your muscles, your body, your vitality, your libido.
[01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:31.530]  It's a copy or not a copy.
[01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:32.530]  We private label it from them.
[01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:38.530]  It's a private label of the top selling product out there in the country under another name,
[01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:43.530]  1776 testosterone boost at infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:45.530]  Also, PainMD from the same big company.
[01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:50.530]  This is a private label of an already top best selling natural pain relief system.
[01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:54.530]  If you have pain or have issues, I recommend you try PainMD today
[01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:58.530]  because a lot of people get used to other systems and your body builds a tolerance up.
[01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:00.530]  New systems like this are really good.
[01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:01.530]  It's amazing.
[01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:06.530]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:09.530]  Something I really want you to think about,
[01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:12.530]  and this is what I've been eating out of here, so this is not a full bottle,
[01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:14.530]  but I'm going to pour these out on the table here.
[01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:15.530]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:17.530]  Ultimate krill oil.
[01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:20.530]  We have to really look and work with top companies
[01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:23.530]  that are already some of the top krill producers to get their highest quality.
[01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:25.530]  This is beyond the grade A.
[01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:28.530]  It's kind of like beef where you have the different ratings.
[01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:29.530]  Well, this was beef.
[01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:33.530]  It's that super rated beef that you get at the steakhouses
[01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:38.530]  where the steak is $100, and where if it was just regular grade, it would be $20.
[01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:48.530]  These babies, this is the highest grade of krill that you're going to find.
[01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:50.530]  There's no coloring in that.
[01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:56.530]  It's bright, glowing, Superman red is what I call it, electric red,
[01:25:56.530 --> 01:26:01.530]  and that is only the oil of the krill, not all the other garbage, not brine.
[01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:04.530]  Most krill you find is all cloudy and yellow.
[01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:06.530]  Real krill oil is red.
[01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:08.530]  Very hard to find it.
[01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:11.530]  This is pure unpasteurized krill oil.
[01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:14.530]  What this does to your heart, your brain, your cells is insane.
[01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:17.530]  I'll be completely honest with you.
[01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:23.530]  I hate fish burps, and so you get a better effect if you eat this on an empty stomach,
[01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:24.530]  but I can't do it.
[01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:27.530]  I don't like fish burps, so I take it when I go to sleep,
[01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:30.530]  and then rarely do I wake up at like 2 a.m. to go to the bathroom.
[01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:31.530]  I'm like, ooh, a fish burp.
[01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:33.530]  I hate that, but it happens.
[01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:35.530]  If you want what's in it, you got to put up with that.
[01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:38.530]  If you're taking krill oil or fish oil and you don't get fish burps,
[01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:43.530]  it's been boiled and heated up and pasteurized until it's worthless, okay?
[01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:47.530]  It's like they'll tell you beef fat's really good for your brain and body if it's raw.
[01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:50.530]  It's bad if it's been burned.
[01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:52.530]  Burned meat is carcinogenic.
[01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:55.530]  Non-burned meat is anti-carcinogenic.
[01:26:55.530 --> 01:27:00.530]  Well, this, ladies and gentlemen, is insane.
[01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:02.530]  So you need to get krill oil.
[01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:04.530]  If you've not had krill oil, look at these babies.
[01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:06.530]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:07.530]  There's even more in the bottle.
[01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:10.530]  These are filled to the brim, but I've eaten seven or eight of these.
[01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:12.530]  I used to open this on, I guess, Sunday.
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:14.530]  So look at those.
[01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:15.530]  Look at those.
[01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.530]  I mean, you need to hold it in your hand to actually see the color.
[01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:20.530]  The TV can't quite pick it up, and if I poked a hole in it and put it on the table,
[01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:23.530]  there's no coloring in that.
[01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:24.530]  That's the color.
[01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:30.530]  It's funny, vitamin B12, with no coloring, is also the exact same color
[01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:32.530]  and is the precursor of your body.
[01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:35.530]  We've got ultra-12 as well in Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:37.530]  But you need ultimate krill oil.
[01:27:37.530 --> 01:27:40.530]  Because when I say ultimate, it is the highest grade.
[01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.530]  Sometimes it sells out.
[01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:44.530]  We can't get it for six months because they're like,
[01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:48.530]  well, you and a few other medical facilities want this pure grade
[01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.530]  where there's nothing in it but the oil.
[01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:51.530]  We'll do a run for you in three months.
[01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:53.530]  Put your money down.
[01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:57.530]  So I could get krill oil for 10% the cost of this and probably solve our problems.
[01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:59.530]  Everybody knows krill oil is great.
[01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:00.530]  You'd buy the low-grade krill oil.
[01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.530]  You'd still get a good response.
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:06.530]  But you'd be paying for kind of crushed pieces of the krill and brine
[01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:10.530]  and other things that are in there and maybe some of the krill poop.
[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:14.530]  It's kind of like buying shrimp that haven't been deveined or whatever.
[01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:15.530]  This doesn't have that in it.
[01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:19.530]  This is strained, unpasteurized, amazing.
[01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:22.530]  That means it gives you the psychoactive qualities.
[01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:24.530]  They don't technically call it psychoactive.
[01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:25.530]  Almost no one tells you.
[01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.530]  Take high-grade.
[01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:29.530]  We have high-grade fish oil, but this is the next level.
[01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:31.530]  We have the great fish oil, too.
[01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:33.530]  But this is the next level.
[01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:35.530]  And if you take two of these before you go to bed at night,
[01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:40.530]  almost everybody calls in and says, my gosh, I had the most fantastic dreams ever.
[01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:43.530]  Your brain loves this stuff, and it funds the InfoWar,
[01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:44.530]  waking up other people's brains.
[01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:50.530]  Your ultimate krill oil now at InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139
[01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.530]  It'll blow you away.
[01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:54.530]  We'll be right back with Dr. Rima Labo.
[01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:55.530]  This is going to be a historic interview.
[01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.530]  Believe me.
[01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:03.530]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:05.530]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:07.530]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:08.530]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:11.530]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:16.530]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:18.530]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:20.530]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:27.530]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.530]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:32.530]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:34.530]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:35.530]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:37.530]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:38.530]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:29:38.530 --> 01:29:40.530]  Alex Jones for president 2024.
[01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:43.530]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:44.530]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:53.530]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWars.com
[01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:58.530]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:00.530]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.530]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:03.530]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:05.530]  We made it even stronger.
[01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:09.530]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:16.530]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:22.530]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.530]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:28.530]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:33.530]  and amino acids that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart,
[01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:36.530]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:39.530]  It is the super fuel.
[01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:41.530]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:42.530]  RainForce Alt is great.
[01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:43.530]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:44.530]  They go good with this.
[01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:46.530]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.530]  This is the boss.
[01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:52.530]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.530]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:01.530]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:04.530]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny,
[01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:06.530]  our children's destinies.
[01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:09.530]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.530]  It takes commitment.
[01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:15.530]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWars.com

[01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:03.530]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:07.530]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:09.530]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:11.530]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:32:11.530 --> 01:32:15.530]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.530]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:32:19.530 --> 01:32:23.530]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:27.530]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:29.530]  It's almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:31.530]  It just can't end.
[01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:33.530]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.530]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:37.530]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:39.530]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:41.530]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:43.530]  You silenced those voices.
[01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:47.530]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:50.530]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:54.530]  the Souda Deep Globalists start going to prison.
[01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:03.530]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:05.530]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:23.100]  Dr. Rima Labo and her late husband, General Albert Stubblebine, are undoubtedly the biggest
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:28.940]  whistleblowers in modern history, and I don't say that lightly.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:34.820]  She from her sources and his sources laid out decades ago what exactly was going to
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.820]  unfold.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.620]  In 2009, I convinced her to go on Jesse Ventura's show.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:42.060]  We did the research for it, and it all came true.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.980]  Now she's going to tell you what the enemy's planning next and how to stop them.
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:46.820]  This could not be more important.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:52.140]  Here's just a short excerpt from that famous Jesse Ventura top-rated TV show that they
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.660]  censored and removed off DVRs.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.420]  Here it is.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:00.860]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:04.740]  elite group that tries to rule the world.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:14.100]  When the population gets too big to handle, the solution is cut it down.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.940]  Now one of those sources has summoned the governor.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:23.820]  Alex Jones says he knows how they plan to depopulate.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:29.100]  Alex, you sounded urgent.
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:36.140]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medicine,
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.660]  namely vaccines.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.300]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:45.380]  under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.840]  Who's behind all this?
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.880]  The Bilderberg group.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:52.860]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda,
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:57.500]  and they want to do it through the medical system, and that's why vaccines are so important.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.820]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.540]  This is being done by design.
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:06.000]  They kill you slowly over time.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.780]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.340]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo, but she doesn't
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:16.540]  live inside the United States because she's so concerned about all the police state developments
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.740]  that are taking place.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:21.820]  But if you can get her to come up here and talk to you, she's a medical doctor, she's
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:26.820]  treated heads of states, and she really understands what's happening on the inside.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:32.060]  Dr. Labo, how are you?
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.060]  I'm fine.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]  Thank you, Governor.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.060]  Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.060]  Thanks for coming.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.620]  Now, you've left the United States of America.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.620]  Yes, sir, I have.
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620]  Why?
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.620]  I do not feel safe living in the United States.
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620]  Really?
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620]  Do you want to come in and sit down?
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620]  No, sir.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.620]  I'd rather not.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.980]  You'd rather just be here so you can make a fast exit if you have to?
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:55.260]  As soon as you and I finish, I'm leaving the country again.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.260]  Why?
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:03.420]  Because in a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:09.500]  vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:12.700]  Are you talking to me now about the current swine flu?
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.700]  I am.
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.700]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.780]  Now, what is it about these vaccinations?
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.020]  You think that they're bad?
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:24.060]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.180]  that we have 90 percent too many people.
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:35.900]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.900]  sterility.
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:41.220]  Doctor, the response is going to be, and you're crazy, how can you say this stuff?
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.060]  I show them the documentation.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.100]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:49.500]  This process has already been ongoing.
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:59.360]  To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.780]  a substance called squalene.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:07.900]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.860]  the response.
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:15.820]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene, but then it
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.420]  starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:22.660]  What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening?
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.740]  It looks like Gulf War syndrome.
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:31.700]  It looks like every joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:34.020]  This is in these shots they're going to give us?
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:38.660]  It's in some of them, but the U.S. government has a trick up their sleeve.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.660]  Which is?
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:49.140]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:53.100]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.100]  You're going to get the flu.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:58.100]  Everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:03.260]  Then the United States government, based on their statements that they've already made,
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:06.580]  will say, oh my, we have a pandemic.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:10.100]  Oh my goodness, we don't have enough doses.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:18.780]  So we'll admix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations that the Department of Health and
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:24.940]  Human Services announced that they will ship the vaccines to.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:30.260]  People lining up, sometimes by the hundreds, for an H1N1 flu shot.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.500]  What that means is a holocaust.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.100]  A genocidal holocaust.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.100]  Men and women will sicken and die.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:48.020]  And those who survive will be infertile.
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:55.180]  If people start dying massively from these inoculations, won't there be like a revolution,
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:59.100]  a rebellion, a rising up from the peasants?
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:09.140]  Briefly, until the 420,000 U.S. military swing into action.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:17.580]  If you remember, NORTHCOM, the Northern Command, was created not long ago to, among other things,
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:24.140]  relocate the population in the event of civil disorder or pandemics.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:34.340]  Doctor, what you're saying is that if people refuse these vaccinations, that FEMA's going
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:38.220]  to put them into almost like concentration camps around the country?
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.180]  I think you have to leave out the word almost.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:47.340]  And we just saw the beta test for what she was told by heads of state they were planning.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.780]  Her husband headed up, the army headed up, the intelligence agencies going over his bio
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.140]  would take an hour.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.180]  He left us a few years ago.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.140]  That's Albert Stubblebine.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:00.220]  Famous Hollywood movies have been made about him, of course, to attack him, minister at
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.220]  goats and more.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.940]  Dr. Rima Labo, M.D., she's a famous doctor.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:06.980]  She invented many of the most used treatments today.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.100]  She's a scientist.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.900]  And again, her husband was Albert Stubblebine.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:12.900]  You should go look him up.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.740]  You want to understand how these people are the ultimate whistleblower.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.740]  So I'm skipping this network break.
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:18.740]  This is so important.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.540]  We've got her for the whole next hour.
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.540]  And in fact, in the last segment of the next hour, she's a talk show host in her own right.
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:29.540]  I'm going to have her host the last 11-minute segment so that I'm not interrupting.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.060]  Doctor, obviously, it's great to have you back here.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:33.060]  Time flies.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.060]  Decades fly like minutes.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.060]  People ask why you're not here.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.060]  I don't know.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.180]  I guess one time I tried to get you and you were out of the country or something.
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:39.180]  But you're here.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:44.260]  We want to get you back a lot because this is all hiding in plain view and a prophet's
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.420]  not recognized in their own country.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:49.340]  So maybe you should start at the beginning, how you discovered this.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:52.180]  Your husband obviously couldn't do a lot of it because of national security, but he
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:55.300]  knew and agreed what you were saying, said, look, it's real.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.340]  This is a plan.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:41:01.020]  So you couldn't have somebody better than you two treating heads of state and confiding
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.020]  in you.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.940]  You knew the gun was loaded in 2009.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.980]  They were thinking about doing it then.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.220]  They backed off for a while.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:08.980]  Now they've done it.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.460]  And so this is so important.
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:11.700]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.660]  So where would you like to begin first?
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:16.920]  Alex, first, I want to thank you for having me.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.960]  It is a pleasure to see you again and to talk with you and your audience.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.960]  I want to correct two things that you said, if I may, because I'm always able to jump
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.200]  in and offend somebody.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.920]  I hope I don't offend you.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.980]  First of all, General Burt didn't simply die.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.800]  He was murdered.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.320]  And since his murder, he actually finally died after they spent a long time trying to
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.880]  kill him.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.840]  He died in 2017.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:51.400]  And since that time, there have been nine serious, credible attempts on my life.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.000]  Obviously, we're right over the target.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.280]  Obviously, this is information that they don't want brooded about, which is an additional
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.960]  reason that I'm so happy to be here.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.440]  Well, that was one of my things, but I wanted you to get into that.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  Absolutely.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.800]  And look, I knew you were for real when I knew you 25 years ago.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.560]  I've been interviewing you and General Stubblemine, I've been interviewing him for like 27 years.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.160]  And so I know you're for real.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:20.280]  And that's why, you know, when we pitch you to Ventura, Ventura, his team spent months
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.000]  making you give them all the documents.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.280]  The show almost didn't air.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.080]  Then, of course, they erased it off the DVRs.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.980]  It was a big national story that, oh, they control our DVRs.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.640]  This just slipped through the cracks on them.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.720]  So maybe you should begin with the murder of General Stubblemine, or where would you
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]  like to begin?
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:42.480]  I'd like to begin with what turned me on to this line of thinking.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:43.480]  Very briefly.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:48.200]  I was treating a patient who happened to be a head of state.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:53.880]  And one day she rather casually said, you know, it's almost time for the great culling
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.880]  to begin.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  And I said, the what?
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.880]  And she said, culling.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  C-U-L-L.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.580]  I said, I know the word, but what are you talking about?
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.360]  She said the culling of the useless eaters.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:11.000]  And I questioned that because at the time in late 2002, early 2003, I had never heard
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.880]  the term useless eaters.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.640]  I said, what's a useless eater?
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:17.880]  She said, not what, my dear, who?
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.080]  And I said, okay, who's a useless eater?
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.240]  She said, those people who are consuming our natural resources.
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:31.520]  And I said, did it ever occur to you that you're consuming their natural resources?
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:38.740]  And she dismissed that and laid out the plan for getting rid of everybody except, as she
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:45.300]  defined it, us, the neo-aristocrats, and us did not include me and you, Alex, us,
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:53.060]  the neo-aristocrats in the neo-feudal system, surrounded by our servants and servitors,
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:44:00.620]  and below them our technicians, and that short pyramid requires only 10% of the current population.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.820]  And she left, and by the way, I cured her, and oh, by the way, she never paid her bill.
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.820]  But that's another matter.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:16.540]  She stimulated my thinking, and I had to know more about this useless eater business, and
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:25.780]  I had to know more about a widespread, cataclysmic, enormous genocide of almost the entire human
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.140]  population.
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:33.700]  So I began digging, and what I discovered was they were very serious.
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.060]  And first of all, this is batshit crazy.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:45.660]  First of all, it is well in place, and has been in place for a very long time, and I have
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.740]  learned a great deal about that.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:55.300]  And so I began telling people about it, and then I realized that our side, Alex, the health
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:45:01.980]  freedom side, all over the world was making a tragic and fatal error, and that is our
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:07.900]  side was not thinking strategically and planning their actions tactically.
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:12.940]  They were simply waiting around for something to happen, and then they would wave their
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:18.780]  hands and say, oh, my goodness, this is terrible, this is terrible, and lose that battle, rinse
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:20.180]  and repeat.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:27.540]  So I said to my husband, General Burt, I didn't call him General Burt, I called him Burt.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:36.460]  I said to my brilliant, strategic analyst husband, with a true warrior spirit, if somebody
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:43.620]  who doesn't think strategically and plan tactically doesn't get involved in the health freedom
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:50.860]  battle, we will lose all our rights, and they, these evil doers, will succeed.
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:57.580]  So we need to close our medical practice, which was how we earned our living, and take
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.900]  on the globalists to stop this.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:07.900]  So in 2004, we closed the medical practice that I had in New York, and we created the
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:14.340]  Natural Solutions Foundation, specifically to derail the globalist agenda.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:20.220]  And let me just jump in, you totally predicted it all, how they would then lock up sick people,
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:25.060]  lock up healthy people, now the UN's openly announced it, and from my research, we just
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.940]  saw a major beta test, I've been saying that for three years, now they admit that's basically
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.940]  a test, they're planning something much bigger, I know you can speak to that, but also from
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.980]  interviewing your husband, here it was, hiding in plain view, once you came to your conclusions,
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:43.700]  I remember interviews with him and you, that he basically had the other pieces of the puzzle,
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:47.540]  as well, you know, heading up major agencies in the U.S. military.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:52.580]  So you guys could not be more prestigious or have greater gravitas, and now everything
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:56.260]  you said to the letter has been confirmed, so I want to talk about what we just went
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.420]  through, and what you believe is coming next.
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:06.740]  What we went through, as you say, is a practice run.
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.860]  How much will people accept?
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:12.980]  How much diaper over their face will they allow?
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:18.540]  How much holocaust will they line up for and ask for?
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:27.180]  Me, me first, do me, oh, another one, oh, good, the statistics say that 62 days after
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:32.780]  the first injection, the deaths start, those that didn't start before, the statistics say
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:41.660]  that with every single dose of this kill shot, the deaths accelerate and the immune system
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:45.140]  collapses further until we get to strong negative efficacy.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:50.980]  And by the way, that's a fact, so what is it, in the insurance companies, 44 to 48 percent
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:54.780]  increase all over the world by the fourth shot of people that take it.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:57.460]  I mean, this is a fact.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:03.980]  And these facts, by the way, come from countries like the United Kingdom, which has been releasing
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:08.660]  information through the Office of National Statistics.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.180]  It comes from other countries.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:17.620]  It's not just wild eyed anti-vax advocates making up statistics.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:20.180]  The deaths are predictable.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:27.500]  What's not predictable is whether it's going to be you or you or you, but the sudden adult
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:32.820]  death syndrome, which, by the way, when I first heard, I laughed at because I thought
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:33.940]  it was a joke.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:38.260]  I thought, no, no, no one could be saying this seriously, but they are.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:41.860]  And people say, oh, well, now we have children having heart attacks.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:47.140]  We have fit players on the field of play having heart attacks.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:51.020]  And it's just an undiagnosed cardiac event.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.020]  Right.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:57.180]  Professional football players and soccer players world over and tennis players haven't had
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.180]  good physicals.
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:04.220]  There was an event a few months ago in high school basketball where in the same town,
[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.300]  two different players had heart attacks.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.300]  One died.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:11.180]  Normally, one one high school basketball player has a heart attack a year.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:15.020]  It's two in a town in one week.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:17.060]  And and it's anything but the vaccines.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.260]  We understand that.
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:26.780]  The fact is, these are death shots, but they're not the only death implementation that's being
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:29.860]  that's being brought forward.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:34.900]  I am speaking on Saturday at an event in California.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:42.220]  The the American Freedom Alliance has asked me to join them to make a presentation.
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:47.140]  And so I started doing research because I have an ongoing question, Alex, that any reasonable
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.500]  person has to be asking.
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.180]  How is this possible?
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:50:01.420]  How can every single nation in the world, a hundred and ninety six nation states, how
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:08.060]  can every single one of them sign on to destroying their people, to giving up their sovereignty,
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:13.740]  to eliminating any kind of of personal informed consent?
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:17.380]  How can any any country do that?
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.220]  And how is it that everyone is doing that?
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:26.020]  So I've made some very interesting discoveries in doing the research for this.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.940]  And actually, this is the first time I'm sharing it.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.960]  So this is really exciting for me.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.340]  How is this happening?
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:42.140]  How has the Agenda 21, now Agenda 2030, been instituted, implemented, accepted?
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:49.980]  How has our agreement to lose everything in our society, our families, our religions,
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:56.800]  our social structure, our jobs, our property, our freedoms, our health, our immune systems?
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.820]  How has it been our land ownership, our water ownership?
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:08.500]  How has it been possible for us to collectively so quickly surrender everything that makes
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:13.820]  us human and now get ready to surrender our DNA to the mass controllers?
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.820]  Easy.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:16.380]  It's been planned.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:24.800]  And the name that you should keep in mind for the planning system is not Bilderberger.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.220]  And it's not Illuminati.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:29.900]  I said, Alex, that I was going to disagree with you on two things.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.780]  One was that General Burt was murdered.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.180]  He didn't just die.
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.700]  And the second is it's not the Bilderbergers.
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:38.940]  The Bilderbergers are middle management.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:48.300]  The actual source of the evil, the organization, the destruction comes from John D. Rockefeller
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:53.620]  Sr. and his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr.
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:52:01.180]  Before the turn of the 20th century, the world's first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller Sr.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:07.620]  and his son, Jr., thought about the society they wanted to see.
[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:11.460]  Now these men were genocidalists.
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.780]  They were eugenicists.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.860]  They were ruthless.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.500]  They were psychopaths.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:26.400]  They had the realization that they could use predatory philanthropy to shape every aspect
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:27.780]  of the world.
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.660]  And they laid out the world that they wanted to see, which is the world that the globalists
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:34.059]  are now moving toward.
[01:52:34.059 --> 01:52:37.700]  The social movement at that time was called Fabian socialism.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:41.460]  It was not called globalism, but it was the same thing.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:47.820]  Utter, total domination from the DNA level out.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:48.820]  They didn't understand.
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:49.820]  And by the way, you're on fire.
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:51.340]  We've got the whole next hour to go over your presentation.
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:52.700]  I want to be clear.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.180]  You're right that I focused on Bilderbergers.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.900]  People didn't even know there was a global elite.
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.740]  That's obviously a top-level managerial meeting.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:00.740]  I totally agree.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.740]  The history's there.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:06.020]  The Rockefellers took over U.S. and then world medicine with Rothschild support.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:10.980]  The Rockefeller and Carnegie endowments, Gates is just a modern copy of that, weaponized
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.980]  philanthropy.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:16.020]  You are one zillion percent right, so we do not disagree.
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:17.140]  Excellent.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:20.180]  I knew we wouldn't.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:24.380]  So they decided that they would destroy the family.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.820]  That's why they supported women's suffrage.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:31.700]  Now of course I believe in women's suffrage, but they supported it not because they believed
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.620]  in it, but because they wanted to weaken the family structure.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:42.540]  They supported Dewey, John Dewey, for progressive education, not because they thought it was
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:48.100]  nice for people to value their own emotions as they grew up, but because that would allow
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:54.460]  them to weaken the rational component of the educational system, which was at that point
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.900]  very strong.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.860]  People learned inductive and deductive reasoning.
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:01.540]  The American people were the most literate folks on earth, and they openly said we can't
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:02.540]  allow this.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:03.540]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.740]  They said we can't allow that.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:12.580]  They wanted to destroy the fabric of reproduction, the very fabric of reproduction.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:18.740]  So they created in 1951 as part of their eugenics program, and we'll talk about that in a moment,
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:24.860]  they created the Population Council, John D. Rockefeller III and Alan Dulles.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.500]  And let's not forget, it was the Rockefeller Foundation that created Cold Springs Harbor,
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:31.460]  New York, that had eugenics solely worldwide, that then set up the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.740]  in the 1930s, that then ran Hitler.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:36.900]  Exactly.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:44.620]  It was John D. Rockefeller Jr. who sent his own personal public relations guy, John Ivy,
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:51.340]  to Germany to run a little private finishing school for three guys whose names most people
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:58.020]  will recognize, Goering, Goebbels, and Adolf Hitler, teaching them how to control the mind
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.680]  of the masses.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:08.820]  Now when that was finished, when they were correctly schooled in population deceit and
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:16.140]  control, mental and emotional control, and spiritual control, by the way, then Hitler
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:22.020]  was brought forward by Rockefeller money, who, by the way, also brought forward the
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.700]  Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:26.100]  I assume that your listeners know the story.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:30.500]  Lenin's train of gold and Stalin all being funded by the Rockefellers, yet again, that's
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.180]  a historical fact.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:33.180]  Exactly.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.180]  Historical fact.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:41.740]  And so these men had no love of country, no love of group affiliation, no love of religion,
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:48.460]  no love of anything other than total world full spectrum dominance.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.300]  We call it globalism.
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:52.220]  They call it Fabian socialism.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:57.500]  And I will remind you that Nobel Prize winning mathematician Bertrand Russell, who was an
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:09.340]  enthusiastic Fabian socialist, said, through injunction, injection, and indoctrination,
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:16.620]  it will not be possible for the man of the future to have an independent thought.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.380]  And let me finish the quote just to show how real it is.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.380]  People can look it up.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:21.820]  He's hailed as a top liberal and won all these prizes.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:26.340]  He said, in the future, the general public, the proletariat rebelling against our takeover
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:31.580]  would be as ridiculous as sheep rebelling against the practice of eating mutton.
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:32.580]  Exactly.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:33.580]  Exactly.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:38.900]  It would be as ridiculous as sheep rebelling against the practice of eating mutton, which
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:46.980]  is why the herd can be culled, which is why the herd can be culled.
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:50.180]  Understand these people do not see us as people.
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:57.580]  These people, these psychopaths see us as a herd to be controlled and culled.
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:01.740]  And so what they were waiting for, the plan was laid out.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.140]  The entire system was laid out.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.380]  The compression of humanity.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.380]  Hold on.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:07.380]  Hold on.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:08.380]  What they were waiting for.
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:13.059]  Now we're here and you come back next week or we can do a special hour to two hour commercial
[01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:14.059]  free podcast.
[01:57:14.059 --> 01:57:15.059]  Let's go.
[01:57:15.059 --> 01:57:16.059]  Super viral.
[01:57:16.059 --> 01:57:19.059]  I don't know what mind trick or what weird thing happened.
[01:57:19.059 --> 01:57:22.780]  You've been on in years, but it's amazing to have you, by the way, you've always been
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.780]  on fire.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:24.780]  But what's happened?
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:25.780]  You're you're like Gandalf.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:26.780]  Every fight.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.980]  So Balrog comes back 10 times more powerful.
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.780]  Dr. Rima Labo, M.D.
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:31.780]  Prevent genocide.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.780]  Twenty thirty.
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:33.780]  Dot org.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.780]  Prevent genocide.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:35.780]  Twenty thirty.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.780]  Dot org.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780]  Everybody tuning in.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:39.180]  Text message.
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.180]  Email.
[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:41.180]  Call your friends and family and neighbors.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.180]  Tell them.
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:43.180]  Tune in now.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.180]  And once this shows archive demand on video.
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.180]  Share it like your life depends on it.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.180]  Because it does.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:58:03.980]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.640]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:08.600]  So support InfoWars store.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.080]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.080]  I don't know.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.320]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.080]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.080]  Krill oil.
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:29.040]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.640]  that will keep you alive.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.560]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.920]  supplements, but the day will come.
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:40.940]  Vitamin C and zinc absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:42.820]  Mineral fusion.
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:43.820]  Absolutely.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:46.820]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:49.420]  You have to have these products.
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:55.220]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:57.900]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:03.660]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:08.660]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:11.940]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:16.300]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:21.500]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:25.180]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:26.180]  two or three times.
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:29.020]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:33.420]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:34.420]  competitor.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:39.700]  The media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:41.460]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:44.500]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.980]  The point is, you can get the filters at m4warestore.com.
[01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:47.980]  They're discounted right now.
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.980]  Finally back in stock.
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:56.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:29.140]  All right, some stations don't carry this segment, but most of the audience is here.
[02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:33.020]  I want Dr. Rima Lambo to wait for the next segment to start her big presentation she's
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:35.460]  going to be giving in California here very soon.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.060]  We're very honored to have her at ProvenceGenocide2030.org.
[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:43.220]  You can do this later if you want to get to it now, but let's just digress to what you
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.720]  started this off with.
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.500]  What happened, as best you can tell, because I know people are after you, they're after
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:49.500]  us.
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:51.020]  We know it's real.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:54.820]  What happened to General Stubblebine when he was, you're saying, murdered, and I have
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.940]  no doubt of that, in 2017?
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.120]  We were living in Chile.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:07.280]  We never stopped working for freedom in the United States, but General Burt realized that
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:13.360]  if we stayed in the United States, we were so noisy, they would kill us, so we left the
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.120]  United States in 2007.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:22.200]  We lived in Thailand trying to prevent Thailand from becoming a GMO rice country because Thailand
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:28.080]  was the major rice exporter in the world and Thailand, because of the old king, had a position
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.120]  of leadership in the third world, in the developing world, and so we wanted it not
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.940]  to become a GMO rice country.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:42.160]  We failed in that because Monsanto simply bribed the entire Thai government.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.480]  We then set up an eco-demonstration center in Panama with a medical center and educational
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:57.760]  center teaching farmers around the world how to stop poisoning people with the chemicals
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:04.480]  and how to reclaim the soil and grow clean food to support clean health.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:10.080]  When Fukushima happened, we decided that since there would never again be low radiation food,
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.040]  organic or biodynamic or any other kind, in the northern hemisphere, because Fukushima
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  is the US-generated gift that keeps on giving, we went to Chile and were in the process
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:29.840]  of setting up a commercial-sized organic low radiation food supply for the northern
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.920]  hemisphere.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:40.620]  I did not yet have my medical center open there and General Burt needed some intravenous
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:48.640]  nutrition and some axis orthogonal chiropractic and some acupuncture and acupressure and stuff
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.960]  like that, good stuff that wasn't yet available in South and Central America, so we came back
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:57.920]  to the United States for a quick visit.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:07.640]  He was poisoned with an intravenous injection, I believe, and that night he collapsed and
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.640]  I had a choice.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.640]  They were on the bathroom floor of our friend's home.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:17.400]  I could allow him to die in my arms or I could take him into the belly of the beast knowing
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:22.800]  that the hospital system would do its best to dispatch him.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:29.840]  I chose the second, I called an ambulance and for 158 days, while the medical system
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.840]  attempted to kill him, quite literally, and I'm a physician, this is not just a grieving
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:43.080]  wife speaking, this is a physician knowing precisely what was done and not done, I fended
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.800]  off the monsters who were trying to kill him.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:53.160]  Retrieving him had to go to court to demand that the hospital, General Burt was ambulatory
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:57.960]  at the time and they were denying him food and nutrition and nutrients.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:06.400]  I went to court about that and ultimately, a doctor walked into his room, plunged a needle
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:12.400]  into either his femoral artery or his femoral vein, I don't know which, injected something
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:19.480]  and General Burt went into a coma and was taken to the ICU where all of the tests...
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.120]  Hold on, we've got to join some stations, but start over a little bit when we come back
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.200]  because I know the inside baseball, I've studied it, somebody that knows all the secrets, he
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:33.080]  was at the highest levels of the deep state, especially before they die, they're scared
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:37.000]  that they're going to say things when they get older, so they generally kill guys that
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.280]  even serve them and don't turn against them like he did, he was never with them but he
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:45.280]  was at the highest levels and so this fits into a pattern I've seen where people, there's
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.840]  not many of them like your husband, General Stubblebine, Burt, that they actually kill
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.840]  him.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:52.840]  Let's finish up with that and get into your big presentation in 60 seconds, we'll be right
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:57.280]  back, stay with us.
[02:04:58.430 --> 02:05:03.430]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:05.430]  We made it even stronger.
[02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:09.430]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:16.430]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:22.430]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:24.430]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:30.430]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:36.430]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:39.430]  It is the super fuel.
[02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:41.430]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:42.430]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:43.430]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:44.430]  They go good with this.
[02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:47.430]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:48.430]  This is the boss.
[02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:53.430]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfowarsStore.com.
[02:05:53.430 --> 02:06:02.430]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:08.430]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:20.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:29.430]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:30.430]  All right.
[02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:32.430]  Dr. Rima Lebo is here with us.
[02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:34.430]  She's about to lay out what's coming next.
[02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:40.430]  She already predicted what was coming with absolute accuracy back in 2009 here on this show,
[02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:44.430]  on a show we produced together with Jesse Ventura that has been super viral since,
[02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:49.430]  despite the fact that Deep State literally tried to suppress it.
[02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:52.430]  And I'm not supposed to get into this because I signed a non-disclosure agreement,
[02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:55.430]  but people on the set got killed after this came out.
[02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:59.430]  They got threatened never to do it again, and they pulled it off the DVRs.
[02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:05.430]  The episode she's in, they went completely ape over because it slipped out, had top ratings,
[02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:07.430]  and we all know what happened after that.
[02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:08.430]  But she was getting into it.
[02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:12.430]  Albert Settlebein, who headed up all these important top military agencies,
[02:07:12.430 --> 02:07:17.430]  we can put his bio up on screen, but he knew what was going on.
[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:19.430]  He was fighting the tyrants worldwide.
[02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:22.430]  She was breaking down when they visited the U.S.
[02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:24.430]  She believes she's a medical doctor.
[02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:25.430]  He got poisoned.
[02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:28.430]  But she knows once he got in the system, they were trying to basically euthanize him.
[02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:31.430]  Please continue with what happened.
[02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:39.430]  So after the doctor waltzed into his room and put something into his femoral artery,
[02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:44.430]  he collapsed, or femoral vein, I can't say which.
[02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:47.430]  He collapsed and was taken to the ICU.
[02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:51.430]  Now, when a patient goes to the ICU, they do tests.
[02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.430]  They do blood gases.
[02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:59.430]  They do all kinds of tests on their physiology to figure out what's wrong,
[02:07:59.430 --> 02:08:01.430]  what's working, what's not working.
[02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:07.430]  Otherwise, they can't really guide any kind of treatment that's designed to save their life,
[02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:10.430]  reverse the reason that they got to the ICU.
[02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:12.430]  It's kind of logical.
[02:08:12.430 --> 02:08:15.430]  What they did, and we have the medical records to prove it,
[02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:20.430]  is they canceled all the tests that were ordered on this comatose patient
[02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:24.430]  who was wheeled in an emergency into the ICU.
[02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:29.430]  Those tests were later ordered again by the ICU doctor,
[02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:33.430]  who obviously hadn't been read into the program.
[02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:37.430]  She said, I can't treat him without having the laboratory values.
[02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:39.430]  What do I do?
[02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:41.430]  The tests were canceled again.
[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:44.430]  According to the medical records, which I have,
[02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:49.430]  and which were introduced into court in the wrongful death civil suit that I brought
[02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:55.430]  and was screwed entirely by the lawyer that I hired,
[02:08:55.430 --> 02:09:02.430]  according to the medical records, the tests were canceled with the notation patient deceased,
[02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:05.430]  only he wasn't dead yet.
[02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:08.430]  It took a number of hours for him to actually die.
[02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:10.430]  He died in my arms.
[02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:13.430]  I did not know that the tests had been canceled at that time.
[02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:16.430]  I didn't know that until I got the medical records.
[02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:21.430]  I saw that there was a specific attempt to kill him
[02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:27.430]  by making sure that no treatment could be guided that might possibly save his life.
[02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:29.430]  I would call this murder.
[02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:31.430]  I would too, but we know why they want to get him.
[02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:34.430]  Why don't you talk a little bit before you get into the presentation about Burt,
[02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:39.430]  because they admit this guy basically wrote so much of the modern doctrine,
[02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:44.430]  ran the secret operations worldwide, was like the most highly respected guy up there,
[02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:49.430]  running special operations for decades and just everything else, basically secret projects.
[02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:53.430]  They were really scared of what he knew because I know he wouldn't tell us on air.
[02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:55.430]  He would just say you were dead on.
[02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:57.430]  He knew it from his intel in the military.
[02:09:57.430 --> 02:10:00.430]  Did he ever – I know people aren't supposed to talk about classified stuff,
[02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:01.430]  but we're well past that now.
[02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:04.430]  Did he ever confide in you more information?
[02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:05.430]  Never.
[02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:06.430]  Never.
[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:14.430]  He never confided anything in me or anyone else that he believed was covered by security secrecy requirements.
[02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:15.430]  Never.
[02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:22.430]  He was a man of absolute conviction and total ethical centeredness.
[02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:26.430]  But he did say on air you were dead on and that you'd already figured it out.
[02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:27.430]  Absolutely.
[02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:29.430]  So did you know you were married to a guy that knew all this,
[02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:31.430]  and then once you figured it out he goes, yeah, honey, that's all true.
[02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:35.430]  Actually, he learned most of what was going on about the deep state from me.
[02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:36.430]  Wow.
[02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:38.430]  Because he had drunk the Kool-Aid.
[02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.430]  His father was a West Point graduate.
[02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:41.430]  He was a West Point graduate.
[02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:47.430]  He believed he was fighting for good and truth and democracy and all that.
[02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:51.430]  Sure, but once he shifted his perspective, then he could see what he was really seeing.
[02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:52.430]  Exactly.
[02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:53.430]  Exactly.
[02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:58.430]  And that happened because I refused to stop providing him with information.
[02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:07.430]  And finally got him a piece of information that was so compelling to him that he said, wait, what?
[02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:10.430]  If this is true, what the hell else is true?
[02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:14.430]  And he opened up this can of huge and hideous worms,
[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:22.430]  and he basically entered into what one must call a dark night of the soul and reformatted his entire world,
[02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:24.430]  his entire belief system.
[02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:31.430]  And it turned out that his incredibly brilliant analysis supported what I'd been saying all along,
[02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:36.430]  but he didn't believe me because that couldn't possibly be true until it was true.
[02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:40.430]  Well, that happened with my mom's brother who worked in special operations once he woke up.
[02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:41.430]  That was when I was a little kid.
[02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:42.430]  I didn't wake him up.
[02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:46.430]  And then I had another family member that wasn't an evil person but believed in the globalist plan,
[02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:51.430]  and then watching my show when I was younger he had that same epiphany and shifted and woke up
[02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:55.430]  because you believe you're doing good, you're compartmentalized, but once you see the bigger plan,
[02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:57.430]  now you see what you're really involved in.
[02:11:57.430 --> 02:12:02.430]  So let's continue and then get into your big breakdown.
[02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:12.430]  So when General Burt understood that although I may be insane, I was all correct,
[02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:17.430]  I mean, you know, being right and being sane are really orthogonal to one another.
[02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:18.430]  They're not the same thing.
[02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:26.430]  But he realized that he had to take his warrior mentality, presence, and heart
[02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:31.430]  and put it into the battle that had to be fought to save humanity.
[02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:32.430]  It's that simple.
[02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:37.430]  And we are now at an end point, the end game, one might say.
[02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:43.430]  You see, the Fabian socialists or the globalists before the 20th century began
[02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:46.430]  and during the entire 20th century had their plans laid out.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:48.430]  What they didn't have was the science.
[02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:53.430]  And so they paid for the science and they directed the science
[02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:57.430]  and they used philanthropy and government influence which they bought
[02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:03.430]  and which they created over decades and decades worldwide.
[02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:06.430]  They penetrated every government on the planet
[02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:12.430]  and they created the science that would allow them to take control of our DNA,
[02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:18.430]  to turn us into parts of the Internet of Things, their servants, their underclass,
[02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:23.430]  their intermension, and leave them at the top, the neo-aristocrats.
[02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:29.430]  This plan has been in operation waiting only the science of genetic manipulation,
[02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:34.430]  post-microwave transmission, nanotechnology, et cetera.
[02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:38.430]  And now they have the science and they're ready to go.
[02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:45.430]  Yuval Harari tells us what they're ready to do to which I say, don't you dare.
[02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:47.430]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:48.430]  We'll have plenty of time.
[02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:52.430]  But I would not call you crazy at all, obviously an eccentric,
[02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:54.430]  but anybody that's smart is an eccentric.
[02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:56.430]  But you've been totally proven right.
[02:13:56.430 --> 02:14:00.430]  Everything you said in thousands of shows 20 years ago, 15 years ago,
[02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:01.430]  it's all come true.
[02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:04.430]  But that doesn't feel like vindication, does it,
[02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:06.430]  because I've predicted a lot of this as well,
[02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:08.430]  and it makes me sick that we couldn't stop it.
[02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:11.430]  It's irritating as hell, but we can stop it.
[02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:16.430]  And the way we stop it is through my very favorite law firm in the world,
[02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:17.430]  Hubbub and Uproar.
[02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:19.430]  They operate in every country.
[02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:23.430]  And when enough of us, and you know this, Alex, you believe it in your gut
[02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:27.430]  and you've been working for it all these many lonely, difficult years,
[02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:30.430]  when enough people say,
[02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:36.430]  don't you dare, the three most important words of the free human being,
[02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:39.430]  when enough people say that effectively,
[02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:42.430]  what happens is that the globalists step back.
[02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:44.430]  Now, they will come around again.
[02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:47.430]  They will try it again, but we're smarter
[02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:50.430]  and we're more organized when they come back.
[02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:56.430]  And the way we do that has been set up to get out of the World Health Organization,
[02:14:56.430 --> 02:15:00.430]  the death star that's coming over the horizon toward us,
[02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:04.430]  to get out first of the World Health Organization
[02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:07.430]  by going to preventgenocide2030.org
[02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:15.430]  and bombarding your politicians with millions of emails and demands saying,
[02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:17.430]  get us out of the World Health Organization.
[02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:18.430]  All right, I totally agree.
[02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:19.430]  Stay there.
[02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:20.430]  We have the floor and we come back for the rest of the hour.
[02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:21.430]  I'm going to shut up and just let you go,
[02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:22.430]  but here's the thing that's riveting.
[02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:23.430]  There's four words, too.
[02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:29.430]  I do not submit and I do not accept your lies.
[02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:31.430]  And we just have to do that.
[02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:37.430]  So we've got all airtime worth in this hour, about 31 minutes of show left.
[02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:39.430]  So I'm going to try to shut up and come back
[02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:41.430]  and just go into your presentation we're going to see in California.
[02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:44.430]  Dr. Rima Labo, everybody needs to go to your website,
[02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:47.430]  needs to share it, preventgenocide2030.org.
[02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:51.430]  And soon we should have a commercial-free podcast that millions will see.
[02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:53.430]  And I'm going to try to get you on Joe Rogan.
[02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:54.430]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:55.430]  Stay with us.

[02:19:59.029 --> 02:20:06.029]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:20.410]  They've done their test run, they've done their beta test, and they tell you a new more
[02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:24.850]  deadly virus is coming, Bill Gates says it'll kill our children, and they've got Marburg
[02:20:24.850 --> 02:20:26.850]  ready.
[02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:28.210]  How do we stop them?
[02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:29.210]  This is real.
[02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:30.210]  This is happening.
[02:20:30.210 --> 02:20:35.530]  The lady that nailed it more than anybody else other than like Dr. Francis Boyle is
[02:20:35.530 --> 02:20:36.530]  Dr. Rima Labo.
[02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:39.890]  Doctor, I'm going to just let you host the rest of this segment.
[02:20:39.890 --> 02:20:41.170]  You're also going to continue hosting.
[02:20:41.170 --> 02:20:42.170]  I'll be here.
[02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:43.170]  PreventGenocide2030.org.
[02:20:43.170 --> 02:20:45.610]  Please continue.
[02:20:45.610 --> 02:20:49.570]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:20:49.570 --> 02:20:57.250]  It's really important to understand that, as Krishnamurti said, it is no measure of
[02:20:57.250 --> 02:21:04.610]  health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.
[02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:11.170]  We have, indeed, a profoundly sick society that has been made profoundly sick for a couple
[02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:12.490]  of objectives.
[02:21:12.490 --> 02:21:16.130]  One objective is to kill most of us.
[02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:23.130]  Another objective is to control the absolute inner workings of who and what we are, our
[02:21:23.130 --> 02:21:29.570]  DNA, which is a whole lot more basic than even our immune system, to control our DNA,
[02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:35.330]  to control our neurological system, our thoughts, our feelings, our emotions, our beliefs, and
[02:21:35.330 --> 02:21:41.650]  to enslave a few of us who are allowed to survive to serve the masters.
[02:21:41.650 --> 02:21:47.530]  Now, if that's the future you want, then don't do anything.
[02:21:47.530 --> 02:21:52.470]  If it's not the future you want, and I don't believe it is the future that any sane human
[02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:58.170]  being could want, then you have to take action.
[02:21:58.170 --> 02:22:01.370]  It's very easy to say, oh, it's all so big.
[02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:03.650]  It's too big for my little head.
[02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:06.490]  The great ones surely will figure it out.
[02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:11.610]  No, the great ones have figured out that they want to be part of the ruling class, and they
[02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:16.050]  don't give a damn about you, because to them, you're a cockroach.
[02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:21.650]  Let me digress for a moment and talk about the horrifying videos that you've seen of
[02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:30.690]  people who suddenly die by planking, by just falling over in one piece.
[02:22:30.690 --> 02:22:37.730]  Typically, they either look around in perplexity, because they're obviously hearing and experiencing
[02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:43.330]  something and they're looking for the source, or they don't do that, but they just suddenly
[02:22:43.330 --> 02:22:45.890]  die in one piece.
[02:22:45.890 --> 02:22:49.170]  It's the mother walking the baby in the baby stroller.
[02:22:49.170 --> 02:22:52.490]  It's the guy buying food at the fast food window.
[02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:56.290]  It's the person walking down the street.
[02:22:56.290 --> 02:23:02.930]  It's the Arab diplomat speaking to a bunch of pubas, and as he turns around to celebrate
[02:23:02.930 --> 02:23:06.170]  somebody, he simply falls over backwards in one piece.
[02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:13.970]  Well, I'm a doctor, and let me tell you that people don't die by falling over in one piece.
[02:23:13.970 --> 02:23:18.970]  There's only one way for that to happen, and I've made a video called A New Way to Die
[02:23:19.770 --> 02:23:26.930]  speculating, and we're talking about people who die of blood clots and heart attacks and
[02:23:26.930 --> 02:23:27.930]  so on.
[02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:32.690]  These are the people who die this way, in one solid piece.
[02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:40.130]  Now, my speculation is that they are experiments, because we are just cockroaches or lab rats
[02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:44.770]  to the great ones who see themselves as the elite.
[02:23:44.770 --> 02:23:46.310]  They are not the elite.
[02:23:46.310 --> 02:23:47.930]  They are scum.
[02:23:47.930 --> 02:23:54.210]  They are less than pond scum, because pond scum has a place in the ecosystem.
[02:23:54.210 --> 02:23:55.210]  They do not.
[02:23:55.210 --> 02:24:04.450]  These are the psychopaths who see us as nothing to be respected, only to be used and disposed
[02:24:04.450 --> 02:24:05.450]  of.
[02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:10.330]  So, what I believe is that they, having been injected, and many of these people that you
[02:24:10.330 --> 02:24:15.410]  see in the videos are in China, but not all of them, and China has a very, very high rate
[02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:23.450]  of vaccination, as we know, mandatory vaccination, I believe that the nanotechnology that has
[02:24:23.450 --> 02:24:30.890]  been injected into them causes the voluntary muscles, the striated muscles, to go into
[02:24:30.890 --> 02:24:36.210]  a spasm when they're hit with a pulsed microwave 5G signal.
[02:24:36.210 --> 02:24:37.210]  Exactly.
[02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:38.890]  That's the kind of death we're talking about.
[02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:43.370]  You notice that the arms and legs go out stiffly.
[02:24:43.370 --> 02:24:50.370]  The muscles that move your body are striated muscles, voluntary muscles, but you have another
[02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:52.010]  striated muscle.
[02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:53.450]  It's your heart.
[02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:59.730]  If you're hit with an energy pulse that causes you to go into total spasm, as this boy on
[02:24:59.730 --> 02:25:05.410]  the screen has gone into total spasm, your heart is also going into total spasm.
[02:25:05.410 --> 02:25:12.490]  I believe that these are experimental deaths to see if the pulsed microwave 5G system soon
[02:25:12.610 --> 02:25:19.650]  to be replaced by the 6G system is effective in eliminating those who are targeted for
[02:25:19.650 --> 02:25:26.450]  that elimination, and you will watch as this man goes into a complete spasm.
[02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:30.050]  This is not how people ordinarily die.
[02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:32.810]  This is induced death.
[02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:38.170]  This is part of the experimental program to which you notice her arm is extended.
[02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:39.370]  She's in spasm.
[02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:43.730]  Her heart, I believe, has been placed into spasm as well.
[02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:48.570]  If they're willing to do this to us, what else are they willing to do to us?
[02:25:48.570 --> 02:25:55.270]  You saw how people were locked into their homes and welded into their homes in China.
[02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:56.930]  That's only the beginning.
[02:25:56.930 --> 02:25:59.170]  That's only the beginning.
[02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:00.690]  What can we do?
[02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:06.330]  The very first thing we could do is instead of looking at the tentacles of the octopus
[02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:13.250]  that is coming toward us, to mix metaphors, the Death Star, which is also an octopus.
[02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:19.410]  Instead of doing that, we need to go for the very heart of the system that is intending
[02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:25.290]  to harm and enslave us, kill and enslave us.
[02:26:25.290 --> 02:26:31.610]  Right now, that Death Star has a very, very clear, observable name.
[02:26:31.610 --> 02:26:36.450]  It's called the World Health Organization, which should be called the World Holocaust
[02:26:36.450 --> 02:26:37.770]  Organization.
[02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:44.730]  The World Health Organization is the direct linear descendant of a Rockefeller organization
[02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:50.450]  called the Institute for Health.
[02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:55.310]  The Institute for Health is exactly what the WHO was modeled on.
[02:26:55.310 --> 02:27:00.550]  It was intended, when it was created, to become the world dictatorship on the health
[02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:01.550]  side.
[02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:07.470]  Now, as you know, the international health regulations, which are being amended at the
[02:27:07.470 --> 02:27:16.870]  World Health Assembly in late May in Geneva, the world health regulation, the international
[02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:17.870]  health regulations...
[02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:18.870]  They have a world treaty.
[02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:22.470]  They admit, takes over all the local governments, national governments publicly right now.
[02:27:22.470 --> 02:27:23.470]  Yes.
[02:27:23.470 --> 02:27:25.150]  And that can be stopped.
[02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.990]  How can it be stopped?
[02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:29.590]  It can be stopped by getting us the hell out of WHO.
[02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:35.830]  So Prevent Genocide 2030 is designed to help as many nations as possible generate the hubbub
[02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:42.070]  and uproar, generate the outrage, generate the demand to say to politicians, the gatekeepers,
[02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:46.230]  and I don't care if they're honest or dishonest or on our side or not on our side.
[02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:47.230]  Let's put the pressure on them.
[02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:51.470]  Let me ask you just a quick aside here, and then we'll come back and have the floor for
[02:27:51.470 --> 02:27:53.630]  the next two segments.
[02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:54.630]  What do you think of Trump?
[02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:57.390]  To be completely honest, because I don't know what to make of him.
[02:27:57.390 --> 02:27:58.390]  He went along with the shots.
[02:27:58.390 --> 02:28:00.230]  They're after him in other ways.
[02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:03.310]  What do you think is really going on with Trump?
[02:28:03.310 --> 02:28:05.150]  Not much.
[02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:11.990]  My evaluation of Trump, to be very frank, is that he is a self-interested, unprincipled
[02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:16.990]  manipulator who will do anything in order to have power, who will say anything, who
[02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:21.710]  will support any cause that he is advised is useful to him.
[02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:23.150]  I mean, I tend to agree with you.
[02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:27.790]  But if he's siding with America, he thinks we're going to win, or is he trying to lead
[02:28:27.790 --> 02:28:28.790]  the opposition?
[02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:31.270]  I mean, do you think he's in on it, though?
[02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:36.830]  He's the most pro-vaccine president we've ever had, allegedly with a vaccine-injured
[02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:37.830]  child.
[02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:38.830]  What does that tell you?
[02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:41.830]  Tells us a lot.
[02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:44.190]  Tells you everything you need to know.
[02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:47.110]  Dr. Reno Lemos, stay right there.
[02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:50.550]  And by indicting him, they ensure he gets the nomination.
[02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:51.550]  Jesus gives you a headache.
[02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:52.550]  But it's reality.
[02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:53.550]  What a smart lady.
[02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:54.550]  Dr. Reno Lemos, preventgenocide2030.org.
[02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:55.550]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:55.550 --> 02:29:02.910]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they
[02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:04.390]  knew that that would help Trump.
[02:29:04.390 --> 02:29:06.630]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:08.150]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:09.350]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:10.590]  So we've made our own.
[02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:15.670]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:18.150]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:20.710]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:26.910]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:29:26.910 --> 02:29:27.910]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:32.070]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:33.390]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:34.710]  No, I'm not running for president.
[02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:37.270]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:38.270]  Red, white and blue.
[02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:39.270]  Alex Jones for president.
[02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:40.270]  2024.
[02:29:40.270 --> 02:29:42.510]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:44.310]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:29:44.310 --> 02:29:52.350]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:57.590]  or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:29:57.590 --> 02:30:01.430]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:07.430]  I want you all to know something.
[02:30:07.430 --> 02:30:09.390]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:12.870]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:15.750]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:19.990]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:22.390]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:22.390 --> 02:30:25.750]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:29.430]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:32.750]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:33.750]  Years ago.
[02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:35.630]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:37.590]  Not for a second.
[02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:40.070]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:42.510]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:45.830]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:57.710]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:30:57.710 --> 02:31:03.990]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.990]  the atmosphere.
[02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:07.910]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:14.310]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:18.750]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:23.550]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:24.550]  dispose of it.
[02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:29.590]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the Treasury, who
[02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:33.070]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:39.590]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:41.950]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:47.230]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:53.670]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[02:31:56.310 --> 02:32:04.270]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:32:04.270 --> 02:32:06.230]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:07.230]  It is.
[02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:11.710]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:32:11.710 --> 02:32:13.070]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:14.950]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:20.630]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:23.350]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:32:23.350 --> 02:32:24.350]  And I'm sorry.
[02:32:24.350 --> 02:32:25.350]  You want something like this?
[02:32:25.390 --> 02:32:26.390]  You can get stuff for free.
[02:32:26.390 --> 02:32:27.390]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:32:27.390 --> 02:32:28.390]  It's so good.
[02:32:28.390 --> 02:32:29.390]  In my view.
[02:32:29.390 --> 02:32:31.390]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:32:31.390 --> 02:32:34.190]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:37.710]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:45.230]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:47.150]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:50.950]  But you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to
[02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:51.950]  you.
[02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:52.950]  I just can't do it.
[02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:53.950]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:32:53.950 --> 02:33:04.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[02:33:04.270 --> 02:33:05.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:30.500]  All right, Dr. Rima Lambo has a lot to say, we're going to be talking this evening, she'll
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:31.980]  be back with us again very soon.
[02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:36.340]  It's some weird blind spot or eddy pool where five years goes by and you're like, where's
[02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:37.340]  this person?
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:38.340]  You call up, they come right on.
[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:39.619]  Couldn't be a more amazing guest.
[02:33:39.619 --> 02:33:40.619]  We love her.
[02:33:40.619 --> 02:33:43.939]  And she's definitely always on fire, but she's on fire, on fire, on fire.
[02:33:43.939 --> 02:33:46.340]  So I'm going to shut up now, turn my mic off again.
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:47.340]  I won't be able to control myself.
[02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:48.340]  I'll write a few notes.
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:51.939]  We're back at the end of the segment, but just please continue with all the truth bombs
[02:33:51.939 --> 02:33:55.900]  you're dropping right now and get more into what you think you're planning next with Marburg,
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:56.900]  all this stuff.
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:34:00.660]  How do you think we stop them?
[02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:04.939]  Approximately four people in the history of the world have died since the Marburg virus
[02:34:04.939 --> 02:34:07.619]  was identified.
[02:34:07.619 --> 02:34:11.500]  And so Marburg is the next big thing?
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:18.140]  No, perhaps as I speculated when actually before the rollout of the vaccine, perhaps
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:25.939]  the 5G signals, the pulse microwave signals will be used to stimulate the nanotechnology
[02:34:25.939 --> 02:34:30.820]  to emulate the symptoms of Marburg.
[02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:32.380]  How very interesting.
[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:35.380]  That was specifically what I suspected would happen.
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:43.220]  And now they're talking about Marburg virus being the next continuous, unstoppable contagion.
[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:44.900]  No, not really.
[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:46.980]  That's what immune systems are for.
[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:56.539]  And by the way, things like nanosilver, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, you know, those terribly
[02:34:56.539 --> 02:35:03.300]  dangerous, difficult things that humanity has never known about before stimulate the
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:06.300]  immune system and then you don't get sick.
[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:11.619]  That's what the immune system is for, whereas their measures are designed to make sure that
[02:35:11.619 --> 02:35:16.220]  you get sick so that you can be eliminated or controlled.
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:21.939]  And remember the pharmaceutical industry, the pharmaceutical agenda, which John D. Rockefeller
[02:35:21.939 --> 02:35:27.859]  took control of in order to figure out what to do with the leftover gunk from the bottom
[02:35:27.859 --> 02:35:33.460]  of the refining towers, which is called coal tar.
[02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:43.820]  And the German Industrial Revolution organic chemistry brilliance was producing coal tar
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:46.539]  derivatives pharmaceuticals.
[02:35:46.539 --> 02:35:51.939]  So John D. Rockefeller bought up controlling interests in the pharmaceutical industry and
[02:35:51.939 --> 02:35:58.480]  then he created the elevated allopathic medicine system that we have now worldwide in order
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:35:59.740]  to sell his drugs.
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:02.699]  That's the same model that Gates uses, by the way.
[02:36:02.699 --> 02:36:08.800]  You invest heavily in vaccines, even though they kill people and make them sick before
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:09.859]  they die.
[02:36:09.859 --> 02:36:16.960]  And then you give money philanthropically to organizations like GAVI and the Rotary
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.619]  Organization and the World Health Organization.
[02:36:21.619 --> 02:36:27.740]  You fund them and you direct their attention to your vaccines.
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:31.519]  It's a business model, same model.
[02:36:31.519 --> 02:36:36.060]  And if in the course of events, lots of people sick and well, that's great because you're
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:40.859]  selling them the stuff that they're supposed to take, the drugs for their sickness, and
[02:36:40.859 --> 02:36:42.180]  then they die.
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:47.900]  That's even greater because you're a depopulationist right off the bat.
[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:49.900]  And Gates certainly is.
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:54.580]  And the Rockefellers certainly trained him well to be, as did his father.
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:37:00.300]  So we're looking at an interlocking business model that takes over agriculture and degrades
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:03.939]  food and weaponizes it so you're going to get sick.
[02:37:03.939 --> 02:37:13.300]  That takes over environmental issues that compress you into your urban prison because
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:20.939]  you're saving the world for animals to be able to rewild it, which is, of course, nonsense.
[02:37:20.939 --> 02:37:24.740]  It's all interlocked, all of these pieces.
[02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:30.500]  We shut down the farms in the Netherlands and degrade the food supply availability.
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:38.539]  We shut down the supply chain because we, the globalists, they, the monsters, control everything.
[02:37:38.539 --> 02:37:43.060]  We've put our fingers and our financial control into everything.
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:47.939]  We've created the octopus and the way we're going to control everything is by keeping
[02:37:47.939 --> 02:37:55.380]  you safe, by creating a medical dictatorship, and then telling you what happens to your
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:56.380]  DNA.
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:38:01.539]  And what happens to your DNA is that we, the globalists, take control of it.
[02:38:01.539 --> 02:38:05.740]  And then we kill lots of you, enslave the rest of you, and oh, by the way, you don't
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:07.539]  get to reproduce.
[02:38:07.539 --> 02:38:09.939]  This is the craziness.
[02:38:09.939 --> 02:38:14.820]  And we, the people, have to say, ah, no, not happening.
[02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:24.699]  Now, the only way that we have at this moment in my strategic analysis, the only strategic
[02:38:24.699 --> 02:38:31.779]  mission that we have at the moment to prevent all of this from coming to full fruition is
[02:38:31.779 --> 02:38:37.539]  to get the hell out of WHO and the United Nations because these are death machines.
[02:38:37.539 --> 02:38:45.019]  These machines were created through Rockefeller et al., and it involves Carnegie, and it involves
[02:38:45.019 --> 02:38:48.180]  Gates, and it involves Zuckerberg, and so on.
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:55.140]  It's a huge cabal, but let's call it the Rockefeller system because that's what it is.
[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:59.300]  It was created to accomplish this.
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:05.199]  And the death star coming over the horizon to kill us all, or most of us, and enslave
[02:39:05.199 --> 02:39:12.560]  the rest of us, is WHO, backed by the United Nations, and behind that, the international
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:16.800]  financial system, and behind that, the ultimate control system.
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:21.199]  Well, the one that we have access to right now is WHO.
[02:39:21.199 --> 02:39:24.480]  Ah, but you can't get out of WHO.
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:25.480]  That can't be done.
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:26.480]  Yeah, it can.
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:31.400]  I've done quite a lot of research, and I have a white paper available on exactly how we
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:34.199]  do it, and that's simple.
[02:39:34.199 --> 02:39:39.119]  The head of state of any country in the world writes a letter, just writes a letter, and
[02:39:39.119 --> 02:39:41.400]  says, I'm not in your club anymore.
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.880]  Our country isn't playing anymore, and sends it to the Secretary General.
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:48.840]  And by the way, that's something Trump did good.
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.080]  He pulled out of the WHO, but transferred the WHO power to Fauci.
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.320]  No, worse than that.
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:01.359]  Trump pulled out, he said he was going to pull out of WHO, and then he took the money
[02:40:01.359 --> 02:40:07.960]  that we give to WHO, doubled it, and gave it to Gavi, which is Gates.
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:09.880]  So that's not good.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:11.240]  That's not okay.
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:14.160]  And that's part of the deceit that I'm talking about.
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:21.080]  And by the way, before Steve Bannon advised him that his base would, when he was looking
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:28.560]  to be elected president, Steve Bannon advised him that his base would not like the fact that
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:33.840]  he was one of the principal supporters financially of Planned Parenthood, and that they were
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:40.240]  an anti-abortion base, and therefore Trump switched his position and became an anti-abortion
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:46.480]  president, which is part of the reason that I tell you that he is a self-interested manipulator
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.080]  who will do what is necessary to gain and maintain power.
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:52.199]  Sure, and I'm not defending Trump, I'm just doing full-spectrum analysis.
[02:40:52.199 --> 02:40:56.439]  He then got Supreme Court justices in that are moving against abortion, or is that not
[02:40:56.439 --> 02:40:57.439]  right?
[02:40:57.519 --> 02:40:59.160]  That is correct.
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:04.960]  And so when you asked me in the previous segment, what do I think of Trump, the answer is I would
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:12.960]  love to have a politician seeking power and authority who was a principled person, but
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:13.960]  I don't see that.
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:18.400]  What do you think of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:26.560]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and I have never gone public with this feeling, sucks all the air
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:32.400]  out of the environment, he's powerful, he's well-funded, he's well-placed, the changes
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:40.199]  that should be coming, should have come through all that air, all that oxygen, all that capacity
[02:41:40.199 --> 02:41:41.279]  have not come.
[02:41:41.279 --> 02:41:44.320]  I am extremely skeptical.
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.680]  Show me I'm wrong, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., please, show me I'm wrong, and that you are
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:59.400]  not a fifth columnist, a dark horse, obscuring the reality, and acting as controlled opposition.
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:03.519]  Prove me wrong, I will be grateful, I will be enthusiastic, and I will be confident.
[02:42:03.519 --> 02:42:08.279]  Sure, what do you think, I respect your opinion, what do you think of DeSantis?
[02:42:08.279 --> 02:42:12.359]  DeSantis has done some things that I agree with.
[02:42:12.359 --> 02:42:18.960]  His Surgeon General in Florida has been supported well, DeSantis has come out against the insanity
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:28.880]  of the institutionalized, transgender, racist, educational bullshit, and I appreciate that,
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:32.240]  but the rest of DeSantis' policies are not ones that I appreciate.
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:37.720]  All right, well said, Dr. Rima Labo, stay there, preventgenocide2030.org, we're going
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.439]  to come back, you're going to host the next segment, Powerful Information, then, coming
[02:42:43.439 --> 02:42:53.640]  up in the fourth hour, we have Paul Joseph Watson, all right, so definitely look for
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.439]  that straight ahead.
[02:42:55.439 --> 02:43:12.439]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements,
[02:43:12.439 --> 02:43:15.080]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:21.199]  So support InfoWars Store, listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't
[02:43:21.199 --> 02:43:25.760]  know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes,
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:31.359]  and again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[02:43:31.359 --> 02:43:37.500]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:42.119]  that will keep you alive, and I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe
[02:43:42.119 --> 02:43:46.599]  you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come, vitamin C and zinc, absolutely
[02:43:46.599 --> 02:43:51.880]  imperative for the cold, DNA force, absolutely imperative, mineral fusion, absolutely, as
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:55.279]  you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:43:55.279 --> 02:43:58.320]  You have to have these products.
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.359]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:44:02.359 --> 02:44:04.080]  This is their big move.
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.840]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:09.640]  He doesn't care.
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:10.880]  That's not his job.
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:12.640]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:16.320]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:20.960]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:21.960]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.519]  And that's who he is.
[02:44:23.519 --> 02:44:28.920]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:29.920]  Exactly.
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:33.320]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:36.460]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:38.960]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:41.439]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.439 --> 02:44:45.060]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:47.640]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:48.640]  You're right.
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:51.240]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:53.039]  And we say no.
[02:44:53.039 --> 02:44:58.519]  And we say no to your war.
[02:44:58.519 --> 02:45:02.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:06.599]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:45:06.599 --> 02:45:07.599]  That is a hellish future.
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.560]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:15.480]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:17.480]  Amazon or Infowarshore.com.
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.599]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[02:45:21.599 --> 02:45:23.039]  we got run out.
[02:45:23.039 --> 02:45:25.599]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:45:25.599 --> 02:45:31.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowarshore.com.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.920]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:37.960]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:40.439]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:45:40.439 --> 02:45:44.359]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[02:45:44.359 --> 02:45:49.640]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:54.119]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[02:45:54.119 --> 02:45:55.119]  local school.
[02:45:55.119 --> 02:45:56.119]  This is an Infowar.
[02:45:56.119 --> 02:45:57.119]  I'm counting on you.
[02:45:57.119 --> 02:45:58.119]  And thank you for your support.
[02:45:58.119 --> 02:46:02.119]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:46:02.119 --> 02:46:04.119]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:08.320]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:13.320]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:17.320]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:21.320]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:26.320]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:29.320]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:46:29.519 --> 02:46:35.519]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:46:35.519 --> 02:46:36.519]  I know you spread the word.
[02:46:36.519 --> 02:46:37.519]  I know you pray for us.
[02:46:37.519 --> 02:46:38.519]  And that's wonderful.
[02:46:38.519 --> 02:46:39.519]  Keep doing it.
[02:46:39.519 --> 02:46:42.519]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarshore.com.
[02:46:42.519 --> 02:46:46.519]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time
[02:46:46.519 --> 02:46:47.519]  keeping us on air.
[02:46:47.519 --> 02:46:51.519]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarshore.com.
[02:46:51.519 --> 02:46:55.519]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarshore.com, our funding problems
[02:46:55.519 --> 02:46:56.519]  will be over.
[02:46:56.519 --> 02:46:57.519]  Please take action now.
[02:46:59.519 --> 02:47:05.519]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:11.519 --> 02:47:12.519]  All right.
[02:47:12.519 --> 02:47:15.519]  To give her the floor, she'll be back again with us next week.
[02:47:15.519 --> 02:47:17.519]  I don't know why we haven't had her on, but I'm glad she's here.
[02:47:17.519 --> 02:47:19.519]  Dr. Rima Lebo here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.519 --> 02:47:22.519]  She's going to host the rest of this segment and the first segment of the next hour, then
[02:47:22.519 --> 02:47:24.519]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:47:24.519 --> 02:47:26.519]  Remember, it takes funds to fight a war.
[02:47:26.519 --> 02:47:28.519]  Plus, we have great products you need.
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:30.720]  We have a book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, unsigned.
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:34.720]  You get a signed copy as a fundraiser exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:40.720]  We have great supplements like highest grade krill oil, a great clean 10-hour energy, TurboForce.
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:48.720]  All of these in stock at Infowarshore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:51.720]  888-253-3139.
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:54.720]  We've upgraded our order center and our customer service.
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:55.720]  They're doing a great job.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:57.720]  During the bankruptcy, we're down to like three people.
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:02.920]  It's doing really well, so you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:03.920]  They can answer all your questions.
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:07.920]  Paul Joseph Watson's coming up here in about 16, 17 minutes.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:09.920]  But please go to Infowarshore.
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:14.920]  Get 1776 testosterone boost and the other great products like PainMD.
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:19.920]  Infowarshore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:21.920]  That's what makes this all possible.
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:22.920]  I thank you for your support.
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:23.920]  Take action.
[02:48:24.119 --> 02:48:28.119]  One percent or less of our listeners ever buy products, which is fine.
[02:48:28.119 --> 02:48:29.119]  Pray for the broadcast.
[02:48:29.119 --> 02:48:30.119]  Share the link.
[02:48:30.119 --> 02:48:31.119]  Share the videos.
[02:48:31.119 --> 02:48:33.119]  We're going to archive in a few hours after the show is live.
[02:48:33.119 --> 02:48:34.119]  It'll be a banned out video.
[02:48:34.119 --> 02:48:35.119]  I'm not sure what headline to give it.
[02:48:35.119 --> 02:48:36.119]  I'm going to let you take over, Doc.
[02:48:36.119 --> 02:48:42.119]  But what should we title this video today, this live show?
[02:48:42.119 --> 02:48:50.119]  I think we should title it, We Are the Power.
[02:48:50.119 --> 02:48:51.119]  I agree.
[02:48:51.119 --> 02:48:52.119]  That's powerful.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.320]  Dr. Rima Labo that predicted the COVID attack issues emergency warning.
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:58.320]  We Are the Power.
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:02.320]  I mean, the fact is, you nailed it, nailed it, nailed it.
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:04.320]  How about Kill WHO?
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:05.320]  We'll get that headline.
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:06.320]  Before it kills you.
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:07.320]  So I'm going to let you take over.
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:10.320]  It's like nine minutes left of the segment, five minutes next.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.320]  And you can do whatever you want.
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:13.320]  But what is it you're going to do next?
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.320]  You've already told us other facets.
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:17.320]  You've got the floor.
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:19.320]  Just give us the brain dump.
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:20.519]  The
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:30.680]  One of the many, many things that I learned from General Burt was that Sun Tzu understood
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:32.240]  how to fight a war.
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:38.000]  I had never heard of Sun Tzu before General Burt said, oh, Sun Tzu knows how to fight
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.160]  a war.
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:47.320]  And one of the things that Sun Tzu, 3,000 years ago, had to say was, we put our greatest
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:53.280]  strength against the enemy's greatest weakness in order to win.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.440]  And if we don't do that, we cannot win.
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:57.680]  What is our greatest strength?
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:01.360]  Our greatest strength is what they fear most and what they want to eliminate and what they're
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:04.180]  attacking, which is our numbers.
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:09.120]  Our greatest strength is our numbers and our ability to think independently.
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:14.880]  They are attacking our numbers, our reproduction, and they are attacking our ability to think
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:16.340]  with propaganda.
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:19.060]  What is the point of propaganda?
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:27.460]  Propaganda is designed to create a mass intentionality that they want to control.
[02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:29.860]  Intentionality creates reality.
[02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:35.740]  And our capacity to think and to discern allows us to create an intentionality.
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:41.060]  Our genetics allows us to create the will to survive.
[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:43.820]  And therefore, those are their targets.
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:46.060]  So what do we do?
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:47.780]  We don't go violent.
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:51.940]  As soon as we go violent, they have vastly superior weapons.
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:55.900]  We in the United States like to think, well, you know, I got my gun.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:51:02.460]  No, they have frequency weapons that can boil your eyeballs from a mile and a half away.
[02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:04.300]  And then what do you do once you're blind?
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:06.980]  You throw the gun at them, at the sound?
[02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:08.500]  Not going to work.
[02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:15.940]  Violence is not the answer because they are vastly superior in terms of armaments and capacity.
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:23.180]  The answer is we throw our determination at them in vast numbers.
[02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:24.780]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:32.140]  On September 15, 2009, then head of the Health and Human Services Administration, Kathleen
[02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:41.620]  Sebelius announced to Congress, did not ask Congress, but announced to Congress that FDA
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:46.980]  had fully funded a mandatory swine flu vaccination program.
[02:51:46.980 --> 02:51:51.380]  And they have the legal authority to do that, given to them by Congress, by the way.
[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:58.900]  FDA had fully funded and was about to implement a mandatory swine flu vaccination program,
[02:51:58.900 --> 02:52:03.860]  starting with, quote, those who wanted it first, end quote.
[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:08.900]  And then everyone else would be herded into vaccination centers or vaccinated in their
[02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:12.500]  homes forcefully via mandate.
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:21.700]  And they she announced that they had decided to add an adjuvant, an immune irritant called
[02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:30.460]  squalene, which you mentioned earlier in the show, Alex, to the to the vaccine in a particular
[02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:31.460]  amount.
[02:52:31.460 --> 02:52:32.540]  And I thought, well, that's odd.
[02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:35.580]  Why is she mentioning the particular amount?
[02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:41.100]  So I went looking and I discovered that the United States holds two patents, one on using
[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:50.860]  that particular amount of squalene injected to induce male sterility, immune mediated and
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.220]  irreversible.
[02:52:52.220 --> 02:53:00.540]  The other patent uses that particular amount of squalene injected to produce female infertility,
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:03.100]  which is immune mediated and irreversible.
[02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:09.180]  So they were going to sterilize every man, woman and child in the United States in 2009.
[02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:12.860]  Remember, this plan goes back quite a way.
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:14.540]  And we told people about that.
[02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:21.340]  We gave them a patent numbers and we said, click here, use your freedom mouse.
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:23.380]  Everybody's got one.
[02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:28.100]  Use your freedom mouse and click here and submit letters to all members of Congress who
[02:53:28.180 --> 02:53:33.060]  serve you and the White House and the vice president and head of Health and Human Services
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:35.620]  and the CDC and the FDA and so on.
[02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:40.860]  Send them a letter, an email letter with your freedom mouse.
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:45.220]  And they did. Three and a half million people in 11 days did that.
[02:53:45.220 --> 02:53:52.020]  Eleven days after announcing it on September 15th, Kathleen Sebelius said, we're not going
[02:53:52.020 --> 02:53:53.780]  to do that.
[02:53:53.780 --> 02:53:55.100]  I guess not.
[02:53:55.180 --> 02:54:00.860]  And they backed down because we said, don't you dare.
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:05.220]  When I was living in Chile a couple of years later.
[02:54:05.220 --> 02:54:11.340]  They were about to accede to a treaty called UPAV 91, which would have given total control
[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:19.460]  and ownership of the entire genome of their plant system to the bioengineering corporations,
[02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:21.900]  Monsanto and their evil twins.
[02:54:22.100 --> 02:54:27.140]  And we roused people in Spanish and English and gave them a place to ride their freedom
[02:54:27.140 --> 02:54:28.500]  mouse on.
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:34.300]  And each click in that campaign sent 68 letters.
[02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:36.700]  To this day.
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:44.860]  The Chilean government has not been able to pass to accede to that treaty UPAV 91 to this
[02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:48.220]  day because the people said, don't you dare.
[02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:52.700]  And so I say to you, if you're not willing to ride your freedom mouse, if you're not willing
[02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:55.780]  to say, don't you dare, then you don't deserve to live.
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:57.700]  You don't deserve to protect your children.
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:55:03.460]  You don't deserve to force these enemies off our territory, out of our homes, out of our
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:06.060]  lives, out of our water, out of our skies.
[02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:10.460]  You deserve to be a slave if you're not willing to take the effort that it takes to go to
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:16.860]  PreventGenocide2030.org and take the action there and then pick up the link and give it
[02:55:16.900 --> 02:55:21.340]  to everybody, you know, and motivate them and say, listen, guys, they want to kill us.
[02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:22.420]  They want to enslave us.
[02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:24.540]  They want to prevent us from reproducing.
[02:55:24.540 --> 02:55:28.260]  They want to take control of our bodies, our genes and our lives.
[02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:29.780]  And we're not going to let them.
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.780]  How hard is that?
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:32.740]  Really, how hard is that?
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:38.100]  You don't have to understand it very deeply to understand that this is a world dictatorship
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:44.580]  that has been marching toward us since before the turn of the 20th century and now is ready
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:50.700]  scientifically, as Yuval Harari says, to make us the last generations of human beings.
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:57.260]  And I say, no, let us make us the last generations of potential slaves and make us the first
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:03.260]  generation of indubitably, explicitly free human beings.
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:05.660]  Every single man, woman and child of us.
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:13.140]  It takes this and nothing more than this, except for intentionality and determination,
[02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:15.380]  which is our human capacity.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:18.660]  We are the strength to put against their weakness.
[02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:21.700]  Their weakness is that they're batshit crazy.
[02:56:21.700 --> 02:56:22.860]  Let's start with that.
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:24.460]  They're batshit crazy.
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:25.460]  They're powerful.
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:26.460]  They've got airplanes.
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:27.860]  They've got media.
[02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:31.060]  They've got all kinds of stuff, but they're batshit crazy.
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:37.580]  They're psychopaths who have no capacity to understand what is essentially human.
[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:38.580]  Are they reptiles?
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:39.580]  Probably not.
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:42.460]  I don't know what they are, but I know that they're psychopaths.
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:45.180]  And I know that I don't want to be ruled by these psychopaths.
[02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:51.140]  It is your responsibility to protect your DNA, to protect your society, to protect the
[02:56:51.140 --> 02:56:52.900]  future of humanity.
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:57:00.100]  It is your responsibility to take the actions that are available now, because if you wait,
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:01.860]  they will not be available.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:06.260]  PreventGenocide2030.org.
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:11.420]  Take the actions, share the information, mobilize your community.
[02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:18.660]  Because these people, these monsters, want you dead or enslaved, and I want you free,
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:20.860]  which is what you want.
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:29.420]  Alex, that's the simple down and dirty of it, as far as I can see.
[02:57:45.500 --> 02:57:53.060]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:54.460]  knew that that would help Trump.
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:56.780]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:57:56.780 --> 02:58:00.040]  We were waiting for the mugshot, we learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:01.040]  our own.
[02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:03.940]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:08.820]  With an image of President Trump, the shirt is being printed now in Texas, it'll be shipping
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:10.860]  out to you in one week.
[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:17.060]  Political prisoner, with Trump on the front, there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:22.180]  It's a fundraiser shirt, it says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:58:22.180 --> 02:58:25.300]  We also have Alex Jones for president, no I'm not running for president, it's a really
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:29.980]  nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue, Alex Jones for president, 2024,
[02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:34.460]  it's a fun conversational piece, and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation.
[02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:42.500]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:47.740]  or by calling toll free triple A, 253-3139.
[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:54.100]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our
[02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:56.300]  children drinking that.
[02:58:56.300 --> 02:59:02.060]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:07.220]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group, it's been
[02:59:07.220 --> 02:59:10.340]  around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:14.700]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:19.900]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:23.580]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[02:59:23.580 --> 02:59:27.460]  two or three times, there's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:59:27.460 --> 02:59:31.860]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[02:59:31.860 --> 02:59:37.660]  competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter
[02:59:37.660 --> 02:59:38.660]  your water.
[02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:41.460]  You should also filter your shower water, that's another way you absorb this crap, but
[02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:42.900]  I'm done talking about that.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:46.980]  The point is, you can get the filters at M4WarsStore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:50.180]  in stock.
[02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:56.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.860 --> 03:00:10.900]  I am so excited to be able to talk to you, Alex, and to talk to your audience, because
[03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:12.580]  your audience is already primed.
[03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:16.140]  You've been doing the work for years, you've been bringing people in, and in a few minutes
[03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:22.500]  you'll have Paul Joseph Watson, who is a very important person in our truth-telling
[03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:23.500]  exercise.
[03:00:23.500 --> 03:00:28.420]  If we don't tell the truth, and if we don't say it as we see it, and then change it when
[03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:33.140]  we see it differently, then we're allowing ourselves to be enslaved.
[03:00:33.140 --> 03:00:37.220]  There are two kinds of controlled opposition, as far as I can see.
[03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:41.940]  One is the controlled opposition that works for their masters, and says what they're supposed
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:49.060]  to say, and sows dissent, and acts as a provocateur, and then there's the really, really terrible
[03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:53.700]  kind of controlled opposition, those of us who choose to control what we say, lest the
[03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:55.260]  other side not like it.
[03:00:55.260 --> 03:00:59.500]  Well, if the other side likes what you're saying, you're part of the other side, and
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:06.540]  it is our responsibility, each and every one of us, to speak freely, and openly, and honestly,
[03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:11.900]  listen to each other, and be willing to change our opinions, as General Burt did.
[03:01:11.900 --> 03:01:18.340]  We began the show talking about a man who had drunk the Kool-Aid, and was a man of great
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:27.940]  honor and truth, and when his truth changed, he changed his behavior, and became a warrior
[03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:31.860]  for our side, instead of an honorable warrior for their side.
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:36.700]  I mean, we all have to do that, I think, because none of us knows the full truth, we're all
[03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:38.180]  learning continually.
[03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:44.060]  I learned from Paul Joseph Watson, I learned from you, I learned continually.
[03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:47.520]  Each of us, however, knows that we are imperiled.
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:50.440]  Your entire audience knows that we're imperiled.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:59.040]  And the way we must fight back at this point, is to get the Death Star off the horizon,
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:00.440]  that's the World Health Organization.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:07.040]  They have a program called One Health, which means that they, through their Director General,
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:16.560]  that is the Dictator General, a known, experienced genocidalist, Tedros Ghebreyesus, they intend
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:23.600]  to take control of every plant, every animal, every mineral, all resources, all water, and
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:29.040]  every interaction and relationship that anything alive on the planet has.
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:30.840]  It's called One Health.
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:32.640]  It means one death.
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:38.680]  And oh, by the way, they have announced in a chart that I have made public through their
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:47.120]  Immunization Implementation Agenda, an official WHO document, that by the year 2030, there
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:55.200]  will be 500 new vaccines, and we know that they'll all be mRNA-based, or worse, 500 new
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:59.920]  vaccines that every man, woman, and child on the planet will be forced to take.
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:05.600]  And oh, by the way, all of the conventional vaccines will also be forced into every man,
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.800]  woman, and child.
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:11.560]  By putting pus and poison into your body, they intend to take control of whether you
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:16.640]  live or die, what you think, what you can do, and of course, they'll compress you into
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:23.440]  their cities and control what you eat, what you experience, what you know, what you don't
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:26.200]  know, and every other aspect of your life.
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:32.400]  You will own nothing, and you will be happy, and you can eat the bugs.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:33.760]  No.
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:36.080]  Not happening.
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.160]  Ride your freedom mouse.
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:43.440]  Start by getting your country out of WHO, and that's easy to do.
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:51.640]  It's hard to get the leader to write the letter, but once we push the political engine, the
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:57.320]  gatekeepers, to write that letter and get us out of WHO, then we can sort out the rest,
[03:03:57.320 --> 03:03:58.320]  and we will.
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:07.160]  So go to PreventGenocide2030.org, take action there, spread the link, mobilize everyone you
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:13.400]  can reach, because this is a battle for the survival of humanity, for the survival of
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:14.400]  our genes.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:18.760]  Our DNA is our past, it is our present, it is our future.
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:21.320]  Otherwise, why would they be attacking it?
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:28.520]  And we have every right and reason to survive by supporting each other, by first getting
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:34.360]  out of WHO, PreventGenocide2030.org.
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:36.640]  Ride your freedom mouse.
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:39.720]  Say don't you dare.
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:41.160]  It's up to you.
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:47.400]  If it's not important enough to you to survive, then you don't deserve to.
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:49.480]  It's that simple.
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:21.480]  keeping us on air at the very same time.
[03:05:21.480 --> 03:05:22.480]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:27.720]  To get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate
[03:05:27.720 --> 03:05:33.720]  Bone Broth, back in stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:37.200]  quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:41.720]  It's all available at Infowarstore.com, some of the very best products, and a lot of you
[03:05:41.720 --> 03:05:43.360]  have never shopped at Infowarstore.
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:46.520]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:48.760]  the step to go to Infowarstore.
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:52.760]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:57.760]  So again, please take action, go to Infowarstore.com today, and I thank you.
[03:05:57.760 --> 03:06:06.760]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.news studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening
[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:09.760]  to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  You're live from the Summit News Hour on this April 19th, 2023 edition.
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:22.000]  And I don't know about you, but I've been tracking this story over the past few days.
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:29.500]  What should be a relatively minor domestic crime incident in Kansas City has garnered
[03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:35.400]  national attention, protest movements, which are now growing, continue to grow, and in
[03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:42.640]  fact, White House intervention and involvement in what otherwise would be a largely forgotten
[03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:46.640]  story after a matter of days.
[03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:51.640]  Information Liberation reports, 84-year-old homeowner hit with felony charges for shooting
[03:06:51.640 --> 03:06:57.640]  black teen he said was pulling on his exterior door in suspected break-in.
[03:06:57.640 --> 03:07:03.640]  Now, if this was any other role reversal, or if it was a white person shooting another
[03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:09.880]  white person, black person shooting another black person, this would barely even be a
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:13.880]  big story, at least after a few days, in local media.
[03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:18.880]  Because thankfully, the victim survived and is going to make a full recovery.
[03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:22.880]  So it's not as if this is a potential murder case.
[03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:26.880]  But this is one of the biggest stories in the United States right now, and I think we all
[03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:28.880]  know why.
[03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:35.120]  Homeowner Andrew Lester, 84, was hit with felony charges on Monday for shooting 16-year-old
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:41.120]  black teen Ralph Jarl after he allegedly pulled on his exterior door at night in what he
[03:07:41.120 --> 03:07:43.120]  suspected was a break-in.
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:46.120]  Now, we don't know what happened for sure.
[03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:48.120]  Lester is telling one story.
[03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:50.120]  Jarl is telling another story.
[03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:54.120]  It's basically one person's word against another.
[03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:58.120]  But of course, celebrities have tweeted about it.
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:02.360]  Kamala Harris has come out and said that this is basically another example of how young
[03:08:02.360 --> 03:08:08.360]  black people are being targeted by white people in the United States, of course, Harris being
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:11.360]  Jussie Smollett's most ardent defender.
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:20.360]  And in fact, also, Joe Biden met with the family of Ralph Jarl, bearing in mind he wasn't
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:25.360]  killed, suffered bad injuries, granted, but he's going to make a full recovery.
[03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:30.600]  Biden, amidst all the other important issues that the Commander-in-Chief should be dealing
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:36.600]  with, spent 20 minutes with the family of an injured 16-year-old boy in Kansas City
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:41.600]  who was involved in a relatively obscure domestic crime incident.
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:44.600]  Does that strike you as somewhat bizarre?
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:51.600]  Quite bizarre, isn't it, that the Commander-in-Chief, with everything he has to deal with, has inserted
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:55.840]  himself into a local news story in Kansas City?
[03:08:55.840 --> 03:09:01.840]  Are we seeing the nascent rollout of a Trayvon Martin 2.0 or a George Floyd 2.0?
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:06.840]  I don't think he's going to elevate to that level, of course, because Jarl survived, thankfully.
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:11.840]  If he'd have been killed, this would already be George Floyd 2.0, I'm telling you right now.
[03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:15.840]  Because look at this, CBS News.
[03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:21.080]  Andrew Lester, white man charged in shooting of black teen Ralph Jarl, out on bond as some
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:23.080]  urge additional charge of hate crime.
[03:09:23.080 --> 03:09:27.080]  Now, bear in mind the police in Kansas City went through the proper procedure.
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:32.080]  They immediately detained the individual responsible in this confrontation.
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:37.080]  Again, not knowing what had happened, the surveillance camera footage outside Jarl's
[03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:41.080]  home had been deactivated for over a year, according to reports.
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:48.320]  So again, he claimed Jarl had aggressively yanked on his exterior door in an apparent
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:50.320]  attempt at a home invasion.
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:55.320]  Jarl says that he was simply ringing the wrong doorbell.
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:00.320]  And even if that case does stack up, which to be fair, it looks like it will do because
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:06.320]  he was ringing the doorbell for 1.15, but 1.15 on the wrong street.
[03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:11.560]  But even if that's the case, that Jarl was legitimately just ringing the wrong doorbell,
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:15.560]  he wasn't trying to home invade, he wasn't trying to cause any harm.
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:24.560]  Was 84-year-old Andrew Lester right in being scared of any potential violent confrontation
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:29.560]  with what he described as a six-foot black teen outside his front door at night after
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:31.560]  he'd already gone to bed?
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:39.800]  An 84-year-old man, obviously somewhat infirm, scared for his life because this random intruder
[03:10:39.800 --> 03:10:44.800]  is, according to him, yanking on his door, trying to get in, shoots him once, shoots
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:47.800]  him twice, says, don't come round here again.
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:55.800]  Is he, in his right mind, legitimately engaging in a confrontation but a self-defense confrontation?
[03:10:55.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  That is what's up for debate.
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:04.040]  It isn't up for debate because this guy is never going to get a free trial, a fair trial.
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:08.040]  The President of the United States has already made an intervention.
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:14.040]  The media is running 24-7 with the story of Jarls ringing the wrong doorbell.
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:19.040]  They're basically saying that Lester is a racist who has targeted Jarl because of his
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:21.040]  skin color.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:24.040]  And that's the narrative, and that's the way the narrative will stay.
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:31.280]  We've had BLM-inspired groups, first off from Sean King, the known serial BLM activist hoaxer,
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:34.280]  threatening to dox the address of Andrew Lester.
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.280]  He didn't need to dox it, it was revealed very quickly.
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:43.280]  You had protest mobs outside his front door within about 20 minutes the next day after
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:49.280]  the news story was revealed, all calling not just for him to be sentenced on the initial
[03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:54.520]  charges, first-degree assault and armed criminal action, but also now for an added hate
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:12:00.520]  crime charge to be included in the actions against Mr. Lester.
[03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:03.520]  Despite the fact, again, there's no evidence either way.
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:05.520]  It's one person's word against another.
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:09.520]  They're trying to race bait, they're trying to create another national scandal out of
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:14.520]  this on the level of a Trayvon Martin to, again, try and create this mass division in
[03:12:14.520 --> 03:12:16.520]  America.
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:18.520]  And Lester's basically screwed.
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:24.760]  The jury, even if he gets a jury trial, even if he gets a, quote, fair trial, is now completely
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:30.760]  prejudiced because of the media intervention, because of the White House intervention.
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:35.760]  And, of course, because of the threats of intimidation, violence and rioting that we've
[03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:42.760]  seen in similar incidents before when we have a high-profile shooting like this, where it's
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:44.760]  white on black.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  So, again, CBS reports some civil rights leaders urged a hate crime charge.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said first-degree assault is a high-level
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  crime with a longer possible sentence of up to a life term.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  Lee Merritt, who, of course, was involved in the George Floyd case, an attorney for the
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  Yall family, said the case should qualify as a hate crime.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  So he's going to get life in prison anyway, whatever life he's got left as an 84-year-old
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:15.240]  man.
[03:13:15.240 --> 03:13:19.240]  So it doesn't even matter if they add another hate crime charge because it's not even as
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:22.240]  bad as the charges that he already faces.
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:27.240]  They're trying to add the hate crime charge to turn this into another racial divisive issue,
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:32.240]  again, despite the fact that there's no evidence that it was racially motivated.
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:37.240]  Now we have the affidavit report from the police here up on Summit News, quotes from
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:38.240]  it at least.
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:43.240]  Affidavit says Andrew Lester was scared to death by a teen trying to pull open his door.
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:48.480]  The elderly man told cops he believed he was protecting himself from a physical
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:53.480]  confrontation and could not take the chance of the large male coming into his house
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:56.480]  where he lives all alone, according to the police affidavit.
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:59.480]  Again, he didn't know Yall was ringing the wrong doorbell.
[03:13:59.480 --> 03:14:06.480]  All he sees is a six-foot man at the door at night after he's gone to bed, according
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:09.480]  to him, trying to yank the door.
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:11.480]  And so he acts accordingly.
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:12.720]  He grabs his revolver.
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:13.720]  He's scared.
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:14.720]  Was that extreme?
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:15.720]  Maybe you could argue that.
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:24.720]  Maybe you could argue that he deserves the full extent of the conviction and life imprisonment.
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:33.720]  But again, it's a local news story about a domestic potential crime incident or potential
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:35.720]  home invasion.
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:37.720]  Why is Joe Biden involved?
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:40.720]  The hell is going on?
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:42.960]  It seems like.
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:49.820]  At one point Jarl was fighting for his life, he made a very quick recovery, some people
[03:14:49.820 --> 03:14:55.500]  jumped on this very quickly and they were trying to basically grift off of it, Shaun
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:15:00.500]  King being prime amongst them, again for this BLM inspired narrative, but was the narrative
[03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:01.500]  fair?
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:02.500]  Is the narrative fair?
[03:15:02.500 --> 03:15:08.500]  And was Lester reasonable and in his right mind to suspect that his life could be in
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:09.500]  danger?
[03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:13.500]  Well, we're going to come back after the break and talk about that, talk about why he may
[03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:18.860]  have thought his life was in danger and why this narrative, which is what has been pushed
[03:15:18.860 --> 03:15:26.340]  after this incident, that there's some kind of nationwide wave epidemic of white on black
[03:15:26.340 --> 03:15:33.380]  violence across America because of these individual high profile cases, which are not common,
[03:15:33.380 --> 03:15:38.820]  which the media takes, which the BLM activists take, and now which the Biden administration
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:47.220]  takes and amplifies and elevates to try to create that false sense of white on black
[03:15:47.220 --> 03:15:53.860]  targeted shootings and murders, a narrative that simply does not exist in the real world.
[03:18:24.260 --> 03:18:25.340]  News will be back.
[03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:26.340]  Go away.
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:31.620]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:35.580]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:38.340]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:18:38.340 --> 03:18:39.860]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:18:39.860 --> 03:18:43.380]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:18:43.380 --> 03:18:48.660]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and computer guns.
[03:18:48.660 --> 03:18:51.420]  A CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:18:51.420 --> 03:18:53.420]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[03:18:54.100 --> 03:18:55.100]  In for a short, I come.
[03:18:55.100 --> 03:19:03.580]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to a store.
[03:19:03.580 --> 03:19:07.620]  I've come and gotten the great products that enrich your life and empower your immune system
[03:19:07.620 --> 03:19:09.540]  in your body and keep us on air.
[03:19:09.540 --> 03:19:15.180]  I am humbly patting hand talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you
[03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:17.980]  for years and never gone to a store or come.
[03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:23.900]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarshaw.com
[03:19:23.900 --> 03:19:26.820]  and never experience these great products and never found the operation.
[03:19:26.820 --> 03:19:30.340]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:19:30.340 --> 03:19:31.620]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:19:31.620 --> 03:19:35.700]  But we need funds to operate plus we've got really great products that do amazing things

[03:19:41.980 --> 03:19:43.540]  All of these are really great products.
[03:19:43.540 --> 03:19:46.220]  They keep us on air plus you're missing out on having these products.
[03:19:46.220 --> 03:19:51.540]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infowarshaw.com right
[03:19:51.540 --> 03:19:55.180]  now and get these great Infowars products at infowarshaw.com.
[03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:31.460]  So 84 year old Andrew Lester has been basically convicted in the court of public opinion.
[03:20:31.460 --> 03:20:34.540]  He is guilty until he has a chance to prove himself innocent.
[03:20:34.540 --> 03:20:39.180]  He won't have a chance to prove himself innocent because his, quote, fair trial has already
[03:20:39.180 --> 03:20:43.500]  been completely prejudiced by media coverage of this situation by White House involvement
[03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:45.540]  and intervention.
[03:20:45.540 --> 03:20:50.300]  This from the affidavit though, this is what Lester told the police, a story that is not
[03:20:50.300 --> 03:20:55.180]  being told in the media because they've already decided on his guilt and that he's racist
[03:20:55.180 --> 03:21:01.500]  and committed a hate crime based on the say-so of this 16 year old black teenager.
[03:21:01.500 --> 03:21:05.340]  Lester stated he opened the interior door, again this is at night after he's gone to
[03:21:05.340 --> 03:21:11.340]  bed, saw a black male approximately six feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,
[03:21:11.340 --> 03:21:13.380]  the police affidavit said.
[03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:16.580]  He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, shot him twice within
[03:21:16.580 --> 03:21:18.940]  a few seconds of opening the door.
[03:21:18.940 --> 03:21:24.020]  Lester stated the male ran away, he immediately used his home phone to call 911.
[03:21:24.020 --> 03:21:27.740]  Lester stated he'd never seen the male before, no words were exchanged during the incident
[03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:32.500]  and the male had not said anything prior to pulling on the door handle, he said he was
[03:21:32.500 --> 03:21:35.620]  scared to death.
[03:21:35.620 --> 03:21:40.860]  Now that's interesting because the media is running full board with the narrative that
[03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:45.220]  this was a racially targeted shooting basically, a hate crime.
[03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:51.460]  The Independent reports, although Ralph survived and is reportedly in good spirits, the shooting
[03:21:51.460 --> 03:21:56.300]  sparked protests in Kansas City, yeah they vandalized his home immediately.
[03:21:57.300 --> 03:22:03.420]  Even if he gets off he can never go home, you know he's 84 year old, he's probably lived
[03:22:03.420 --> 03:22:07.100]  there for decades, he's not even going to be able to move home but he can't go home
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:11.900]  anyway because he's targeted for life now, thanks to BLM activists on Twitter like Sean
[03:22:11.900 --> 03:22:13.900]  King.
[03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:18.980]  The shooting sparked protests and condemnation across the country, again despite the fact
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:24.100]  that it's one person's word against another, with activists and civil rights lawyers describing
[03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:30.820]  it as part of a pattern of white Americans using deadly force against unarmed black
[03:22:30.820 --> 03:22:39.980]  people based on exaggerated and unreasonable ideas of danger, really?
[03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:44.180]  Exaggerated and unreasonable ideas of danger, wow.
[03:22:44.180 --> 03:22:52.500]  I pulled up the FBI 2019 uniform crime report which says African Americans accounted for
[03:22:52.500 --> 03:23:01.100]  55.9% of all homicide offenders in 2019 with whites 41.1% which presumably includes Hispanics
[03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:09.420]  and other 3% in cases where the race was not known, so that's 55% of all homicides.
[03:23:09.420 --> 03:23:18.340]  The same report says that in 2019 17% of white victims were killed by black perpetrators
[03:23:18.340 --> 03:23:25.140]  while 8% of black homicide victims were killed by white perpetrators and again black people
[03:23:25.140 --> 03:23:32.220]  make up 13% of the population or 6-7% if you're talking about black males specifically.
[03:23:33.300 --> 03:23:39.300]  Bureau of Justice Statistics Crime Victimization Survey 2018
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:43.300]  Interracial Violent Crime Incidents 2018
[03:23:43.300 --> 03:23:47.300]  Black on White 547,000
[03:23:47.300 --> 03:23:52.300]  White on Black 59,778
[03:23:52.300 --> 03:23:59.300]  So when they say this is part of a pattern, a trend, an epidemic of
[03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:03.300]  white Americans using deadly force against unarmed black people,
[03:24:03.300 --> 03:24:08.300]  then you compare that with the actual FBI crime statistics
[03:24:08.300 --> 03:24:12.300]  of who uses deadly force on who typically,
[03:24:12.300 --> 03:24:17.300]  generally, not in these individual high-profile incidents
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:23.300]  which get amplified by the media, by BLM activists and by, in this case, the White House.
[03:24:23.300 --> 03:24:29.300]  The general trend kind of suggests that 84-year-old Andrew Lester
[03:24:29.300 --> 03:24:35.300]  was probably reasonably scared for his life in that situation.
[03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:41.300]  And this is all happening, by the way, while the White House
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:46.300]  Press Secretary Corinne Jean-Pierre has basically said that
[03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:50.300]  there's going to be a big White House meeting with lawmakers on Monday
[03:24:50.300 --> 03:24:55.300]  of people, lawmakers included, who protested after the Nashville shooting
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:24:59.300]  by a transgender terrorist in favor of more gun control
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:04.300]  the victims of the trans shooter herself, the children, the parents,
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:08.300]  well, they've not been invited to the White House.
[03:25:08.300 --> 03:25:13.300]  But Biden did have time to meet with this 16-year-old black teenager
[03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:17.300]  who was injured as a result of what was technically
[03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:21.300]  quite an obscure local crime incident in Kansas City.
[03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:24.300]  Interesting that, isn't it?
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:26.300]  There's another story here.
[03:25:26.300 --> 03:25:30.300]  Woman 20 fatally shot by upstate New York homeowner
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:33.300]  after pulling into wrong driveway.
[03:25:33.300 --> 03:25:37.300]  New York Post, but I haven't seen it really reported much anywhere else.
[03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:40.300]  20-year-old woman was shot dead by an upstate New York homeowner
[03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:43.300]  Saturday night after the driver of the car she was riding in
[03:25:43.300 --> 03:25:46.300]  turned into the wrong driveway.
[03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:49.300]  So again, an almost identical situation
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:52.300]  apart from it's based in a vehicle.
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:56.300]  Nighttime, they enter the property of the wrong house
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:25:58.300]  or just the driveway.
[03:25:58.300 --> 03:26:01.300]  Homeowner shoots the woman dead.
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:03.300]  20-year-old woman, she's dead.
[03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:07.300]  Thankfully Ralph, you all survived, but obviously if he'd have been killed
[03:26:07.300 --> 03:26:09.300]  it would have been an even bigger story.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:13.300]  So a 20-year-old woman in New York, white woman,
[03:26:13.300 --> 03:26:16.300]  by her name presumably, Kaylin Gillis.
[03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:20.300]  If she was black, it would be even bigger than the Ralph's story,
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:21.300]  let's be honest.
[03:26:21.300 --> 03:26:24.300]  20-year-old woman shot dead after entering the property
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:28.300]  of the wrong house by mistake, upstate New York,
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:31.300]  shot by a white person.
[03:26:31.300 --> 03:26:33.300]  So that's white on white crime.
[03:26:33.300 --> 03:26:35.300]  So, well, we don't care about that, do we?
[03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:38.300]  But when the perpetrators are in the right order,
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:42.300]  then it's a national news story.
[03:26:42.300 --> 03:26:45.300]  What wasn't a national news story was this.
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:49.300]  Woman attacked in Chicago, they said they were going to kill us.
[03:26:49.300 --> 03:26:51.300]  You've probably seen the footage by now.
[03:26:51.300 --> 03:26:55.300]  It had 15 million plus views on Twitter last time I saw it.
[03:26:55.300 --> 03:26:59.300]  You'd think that such a viral video would garner national media attention,
[03:26:59.300 --> 03:27:00.300]  wouldn't you?
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:05.300]  CNN, CBS, all the outlets that are reporting on this Ralph Yarl incident.
[03:27:05.300 --> 03:27:10.300]  But no, it remains basically obscure because it's only an internet viral video.
[03:27:11.300 --> 03:27:14.300]  A woman who was violently attacked with a partner during rioting in Chicago
[03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:18.300]  told Fox 32 they were going to kill us,
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:22.300]  revealed that police ignored her cries for help.
[03:27:22.300 --> 03:27:26.300]  This, of course, took place on Saturday night amidst widespread rioting,
[03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:30.300]  looting, lawlessness, chaos in Chicago,
[03:27:30.300 --> 03:27:35.300]  which, again, was largely ignored by media outside of Chicago.
[03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:38.300]  I noticed, by the way, that the Twitter video in this article
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:40.300]  has now disappeared.
[03:27:40.300 --> 03:27:43.300]  Whether that's actually been censored remains to be seen.
[03:27:43.300 --> 03:27:45.300]  You've probably seen the clip by now.
[03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:48.300]  The video of the assault subsequently went viral on Twitter.
[03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:52.300]  You see it here on screen amassing over 15 million views.
[03:27:52.300 --> 03:27:56.300]  So they were interviewed by one local Fox station afterwards
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:28:00.300]  and basically said they were set upon by this mob
[03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:03.300]  who were obviously out there wanting justice,
[03:28:03.300 --> 03:28:05.300]  whatever the latest pet cause is.
[03:28:05.300 --> 03:28:06.300]  Oh, no, they weren't.
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:07.300]  They were out to just cause chaos.
[03:28:07.300 --> 03:28:10.300]  They stole their shoes, stole their wallets,
[03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:13.300]  and they stole their iPhones.
[03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:17.300]  Ashley said, the woman involved in the attack,
[03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:19.300]  which you see there on screen,
[03:28:19.300 --> 03:28:22.300]  the cops saw she had been attacked and was in distress
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:24.300]  but chose to completely ignore her,
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:27.300]  said they almost had to avoid the collision to get past us,
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:30.300]  but they just drove by the incident in the middle of the street.
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:34.300]  Interesting, again, about this is they were helped by a good Samaritan
[03:28:34.300 --> 03:28:38.300]  called Lenora Dennis, a bystander who saw what was going on.
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:43.300]  When Dennis drove this couple who were viciously attacked to the police station,
[03:28:43.300 --> 03:28:47.300]  the desk sergeant told them that this is what happens
[03:28:47.300 --> 03:28:50.300]  when Brandon Johnson gets elected,
[03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:52.300]  and it's going to happen over and over again,
[03:28:52.300 --> 03:28:54.300]  and we'll get to that on the other side.
[03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:55.300]  This is summit.news.
[03:28:55.300 --> 03:28:56.300]  We'll be back.
[03:28:56.300 --> 03:28:58.300]  In the early 1900s,
[03:28:58.300 --> 03:29:04.300]  certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:29:04.300 --> 03:29:07.300]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:29:07.300 --> 03:29:12.300]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:15.300]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[03:29:15.300 --> 03:29:18.300]  still highly toxic but containable.
[03:29:18.300 --> 03:29:21.300]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:29:21.300 --> 03:29:24.300]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:29:24.300 --> 03:29:26.300]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[03:29:26.300 --> 03:29:28.300]  was also the secretary of the treasury,
[03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:32.300]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:29:32.300 --> 03:29:36.300]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:41.300]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:46.300]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:50.300]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:52.300]  and a remedy to this madness.
[03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:56.300]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:56.300 --> 03:30:00.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:30:00.300 --> 03:30:03.300]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[03:30:03.300 --> 03:30:05.300]  planned for our future.
[03:30:05.300 --> 03:30:06.300]  That is a hellish future.
[03:30:06.300 --> 03:30:10.300]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:30:10.300 --> 03:30:13.300]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:16.300]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:19.300]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:30:19.300 --> 03:30:21.300]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:30:21.300 --> 03:30:24.300]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:30:24.300 --> 03:30:27.300]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:30:27.300 --> 03:30:29.300]  a signed copy, at infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:29.300 --> 03:30:33.300]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:30:33.300 --> 03:30:36.300]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:30:36.300 --> 03:30:39.300]  You'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[03:30:39.300 --> 03:30:42.300]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:43.300]  or unsigned copies.
[03:30:43.300 --> 03:30:47.300]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarsstore.com
[03:30:47.300 --> 03:30:50.300]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:30:50.300 --> 03:30:53.300]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:30:53.300 --> 03:30:54.300]  This is an info war.
[03:30:54.300 --> 03:30:56.300]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:30:56.300 --> 03:30:59.300]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:30:59.300 --> 03:31:04.300]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:31:04.300 --> 03:31:08.300]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[03:31:08.300 --> 03:31:09.300]  It takes commitment.
[03:31:09.300 --> 03:31:13.300]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to infowarsstore.com
[03:31:13.300 --> 03:31:16.300]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life

[03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:20.300]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[03:32:20.300 --> 03:32:22.300]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:32:22.300 --> 03:32:26.300]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:31.300]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[03:32:31.300 --> 03:32:34.300]  your brain, your liver, you name it.

[03:32:37.300 --> 03:32:39.300]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[03:32:39.300 --> 03:32:40.300]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:32:40.300 --> 03:32:41.300]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:32:41.300 --> 03:32:42.300]  They go good with this.
[03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:44.300]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:32:44.300 --> 03:32:46.300]  This is the boss.
[03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:51.300]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, infowarsstore.com.

[03:32:57.300 --> 03:33:02.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:33:02.300 --> 03:33:04.300]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:20.180]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul
[03:33:20.180 --> 03:33:21.180]  Joseph Watson.
[03:33:21.180 --> 03:33:28.580]  I thought it was Baltimore the previous weekend, it was Chicago's turn, the weekend just gone.
[03:33:28.580 --> 03:33:31.580]  Whose turn will it be this weekend?
[03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:37.740]  Still we see more scenes of rioting, attacks on public and private property, vehicles being
[03:33:37.740 --> 03:33:42.540]  destroyed, people being viciously beaten in the streets.
[03:33:42.540 --> 03:33:46.620]  Whose turn is it this weekend in the United States?
[03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:50.220]  Of course many of you will have seen that footage out of Chicago, it wasn't really seen
[03:33:50.220 --> 03:33:55.580]  nationwide, Chicago media outlets covered it, it wasn't a big story nationally.
[03:33:55.580 --> 03:34:02.420]  In fact on Ground News, which is a website I use, they pointed out that McDonald's launching
[03:34:02.420 --> 03:34:10.860]  a new burger got about four times the amount of press coverage than these riots in Chicago
[03:34:10.860 --> 03:34:13.620]  in Chicago itself.
[03:34:13.620 --> 03:34:17.140]  What's interesting about the riots, and I'm going to come on to Brandon Johnson's comments
[03:34:17.140 --> 03:34:23.620]  after the riots, is what the mayor-elect Brandon Johnson said before the riots, and this brings
[03:34:23.620 --> 03:34:28.660]  us to our first video, which is called He Said It, Then This Happened, let's roll it.
[03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:41.700]  Chicago's new mayor-elect, Brandon Johnson, recently told a pro-BLM group that black people should not be subject to, quote, state-sponsored policing.
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:44.700]  Then less than two weeks later, this happened.
[03:34:53.700 --> 03:34:55.700]  Alright, who's got the meme?
[03:34:55.700 --> 03:34:59.700]  Just get away, because there's no fixing this.
[03:34:59.700 --> 03:35:02.700]  All hell broke loose in downtown Chicago on Saturday night,
[03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:07.700]  when hundreds of teenagers smashed car windows, destroyed public and private property,
[03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:09.700]  then later engaged in random shootings,
[03:35:09.700 --> 03:35:14.700]  in scenes that have become normalised in Democrat-run cities across the country.
[03:35:14.700 --> 03:35:29.700]  News stations pulled their reporters from the scene, saying it was too unsafe to be there.
[03:35:29.700 --> 03:35:34.700]  People unfortunate to have driven into the chaos fled in panic as their vehicles were destroyed.
[03:35:44.700 --> 03:35:57.700]  Fox 32 reported that a woman whose car was smashed by people jumping on the windshield
[03:35:57.700 --> 03:36:00.700]  said her husband was beaten as he sat in the driver's seat.
[03:36:00.700 --> 03:36:02.700]  He's been taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
[03:36:02.700 --> 03:36:05.700]  The same thing happened in Baltimore last weekend.
[03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:07.700]  The same thing happened in Austin, Texas a couple of months ago.
[03:36:07.700 --> 03:36:09.700]  And it's not even summer yet.
[03:36:10.700 --> 03:36:14.700]  Progressive, soft-on-crime cities turning into lawless hellholes.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:20.700]  Gangs of youths destroying their communities as major retailers pull out one by one.
[03:36:28.700 --> 03:36:29.700]  Who's to blame?
[03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:33.700]  Democrat politicians for letting urban scumbags and criminals run rampant?
[03:36:33.700 --> 03:36:36.700]  BLM for ramming through defund-the-police policies?
[03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:37.700]  No.
[03:36:37.700 --> 03:36:40.700]  Apparently, it's all Walmart's fault.
[03:36:40.700 --> 03:36:44.700]  Walmart, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves.
[03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:50.700]  You are the reason that our communities lack the investment that they have.
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:54.700]  I guess we just need more reparations and social workers.
[03:36:56.700 --> 03:36:58.700]  Now, of course, in the aftermath of these riots,
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:37:02.700]  which, of course, were exacerbated by the actions of Lori Light,
[03:37:02.700 --> 03:37:07.700]  the existing mayor, soft-on-crime, friendly to criminals,
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:10.700]  the Chicago mayor-elect came out and basically said,
[03:37:10.700 --> 03:37:13.700]  don't demonize the thugs who were looting the stores,
[03:37:13.700 --> 03:37:16.700]  attacking the innocent people on the streets,
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:20.700]  trashing vehicles, again, attacking public and private property.
[03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:22.700]  They're just misunderstood.
[03:37:22.700 --> 03:37:24.700]  They're just undervalued.
[03:37:24.700 --> 03:37:27.700]  Chicago mayor-elect Brandon Johnson defended rioters
[03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:30.700]  who caused chaos on Saturday night, saying they shouldn't be demonized.
[03:37:30.700 --> 03:37:32.700]  This video emerged, again, as we spoke about earlier,
[03:37:32.700 --> 03:37:36.700]  of black youth beating a white woman in the street.
[03:37:36.700 --> 03:37:40.700]  He came out with a statement, said, although he doesn't condone the activity,
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:43.700]  it's not constructive to demonize youth who have otherwise been starved
[03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:45.700]  of opportunities in their own communities.
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:50.700]  Yes, they stole the shoes of that innocent couple on the street
[03:37:50.700 --> 03:37:56.700]  because they've been starved of opportunities in their community, apparently.
[03:37:56.700 --> 03:38:01.700]  Meanwhile, more big retailers are pulling out of major progressive cities,
[03:38:01.700 --> 03:38:04.700]  citing record thefts.
[03:38:04.700 --> 03:38:07.700]  Breitbart reports REI has closed its only Portland store
[03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:09.700]  over break-ins, theft.
[03:38:09.700 --> 03:38:12.700]  Outdoor retail giant REI announced Monday it plans to close
[03:38:12.700 --> 03:38:14.700]  its only store in Portland, Oregon.
[03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:20.700]  Again, this after Walmart closed two flagship stores in the same city,
[03:38:20.700 --> 03:38:22.700]  citing an increase in theft.
[03:38:22.700 --> 03:38:25.700]  REI said its store in Portland had its highest number of break-ins
[03:38:25.700 --> 03:38:29.700]  and thefts in two decades, despite actions to provide extra security.
[03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:32.700]  What a surprise. Defund the police.
[03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:36.700]  Limit the resources that the police have to fight actual criminals.
[03:38:36.700 --> 03:38:38.700]  Let the criminals run loose.
[03:38:38.700 --> 03:38:41.700]  Bail them out, even when they do get caught.
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:44.700]  And what a surprise, all the retailers are pulling out
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:47.700]  because of record thefts and break-ins.
[03:38:47.700 --> 03:38:52.700]  Of course, I guess, as you just heard, that it's the retailers' fault themselves.
[03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:57.700]  Let's go to another video here, which is an incident that happened in London.
[03:38:57.700 --> 03:39:01.700]  I think you should just watch it, because words don't do it justice.
[03:39:01.700 --> 03:39:05.700]  This is called, Well, What Did You Expect?
[03:39:05.700 --> 03:39:06.700]  Let's roll the video.
[03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:10.700]  A young black man in London thought it would be a fantastic idea
[03:39:10.700 --> 03:39:15.700]  to chase a woman down a dark street at night while making weird noises at her
[03:39:15.700 --> 03:39:16.700]  to prove she's racist.
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:19.700]  Absolute unbridled utter genius.
[03:39:23.700 --> 03:39:26.700]  Come here. Come here. Come here.
[03:39:26.700 --> 03:39:30.700]  You scared of black people, yeah? You scared of black people, yeah?
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:33.700]  She's just been judging them on the content of their character.
[03:39:38.700 --> 03:39:40.700]  We're not scary. We're just normal people.
[03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:44.700]  Because nothing proves you're normal more than chasing women down dark alleyways
[03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:47.700]  while making growling noises like a rabid dog.
[03:39:48.700 --> 03:39:49.700]  Dumb bitch.
[03:39:51.700 --> 03:39:52.700]  Dumb bitch.
[03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:55.700]  Dumb bitch.
[03:40:04.700 --> 03:40:08.700]  Newsflash. Most women don't want to be walking near random men at night
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:10.700]  when there's no one else around.
[03:40:10.700 --> 03:40:13.700]  Lots of people in the Twitter thread saying she would have behaved the same with any man
[03:40:13.700 --> 03:40:14.700]  no matter the skin colour.
[03:40:14.700 --> 03:40:15.700]  Well, I don't know about that.
[03:40:15.700 --> 03:40:17.700]  But does that mean she's racist?
[03:40:17.700 --> 03:40:18.700]  Or just...
[03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:20.700]  If I speak, I am in big trouble.
[03:40:20.700 --> 03:40:25.700]  The overriding point here though is the galaxy brain level logic on display
[03:40:25.700 --> 03:40:29.700]  of believing that a defenceless woman being legitimately scared of your creepy
[03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:32.700]  aggressive behaviour proves she's racist.
[03:40:32.700 --> 03:40:34.700]  Yeah, that'll definitely show her not to be scared next time.
[03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:38.700]  Refers to himself as not scary and normal after chasing her down an alley.
[03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:39.700]  Gosh, I bet she's convinced.
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:41.700]  You scared of black people, yeah?
[03:40:41.700 --> 03:40:43.700]  There's only one person acting normally here, mate.
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:45.700]  And it certainly isn't you.
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:49.700]  Dude sounds like he's taken inspiration from that Four Lions movie.
[03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:51.700]  Allahu akbar!
[03:40:54.700 --> 03:40:55.700]  Mashallah, brother!
[03:40:57.700 --> 03:40:58.700]  Oh, what?
[03:40:58.700 --> 03:40:59.700]  What?
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:01.700]  What, just because I'm Muslim you thought it was real?
[03:41:03.700 --> 03:41:08.700]  UN inspectors have been investigating Britain to determine whether or not it's racist.
[03:41:08.700 --> 03:41:12.700]  But who needs them when this guy's already proven it beyond all reasonable doubt.
[03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:18.700]  Now, remaining in the United Kingdom, and you've had this system in America
[03:41:18.700 --> 03:41:21.700]  for a while now, for the first time ever they're going to send out,
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:25.700]  the government that is, they're going to send out an emergency alert system
[03:41:25.700 --> 03:41:31.700]  to everybody's phone across the entire country, which will trigger a beeping
[03:41:31.700 --> 03:41:36.700]  or a buzzing that will last for 10 seconds, a 10 second siren alert
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:41.700]  to prepare the population for unspecified emergencies.
[03:41:42.700 --> 03:41:46.700]  Remix News reports national emergency alert test in the UK on Sunday afternoon
[03:41:46.700 --> 03:41:48.700]  could cause mass panic, campaigners warn.
[03:41:48.700 --> 03:41:53.700]  Now you have domestic abuse campaigners warning that women,
[03:41:53.700 --> 03:41:59.700]  who are basically imprisoned or under the coercive control of abusive partners,
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:04.700]  sometimes have second phones which are kept hidden from those abusive partners.
[03:42:04.700 --> 03:42:08.700]  This alert, which will sound on every phone unless you turn off
[03:42:08.700 --> 03:42:11.700]  the emergency alert system, which many people don't know how to do.
[03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:16.700]  In fact, the guides on how to turn it off don't even apply to many phones.
[03:42:16.700 --> 03:42:22.700]  I checked on my iPhone earlier and the option wasn't even there to turn it off.
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:25.700]  So they're saying victims of domestic abuse are going to get this alert.
[03:42:25.700 --> 03:42:26.700]  Their phones are going to go off.
[03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:30.700]  It's going to alert the fact that they've got a second safe phone.
[03:42:30.700 --> 03:42:33.700]  And of course, the fact that it could cause accidents on the road,
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:36.700]  especially with elderly drivers not knowing what's going on.
[03:42:36.700 --> 03:42:39.700]  The fact is it's for a regional alert mechanism,
[03:42:39.700 --> 03:42:42.700]  and yet they're testing it across the entire country.
[03:42:42.700 --> 03:42:48.700]  If it's for regional disasters, why don't you test it on a smaller regional basis?
[03:42:48.700 --> 03:42:51.700]  That's why people are very suspicious about this test.
[03:42:51.700 --> 03:42:54.700]  We'll be back. Summit.News.
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:59.700]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs,
[03:42:59.700 --> 03:43:02.700]  not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:43:02.700 --> 03:43:04.700]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:43:04.700 --> 03:43:06.700]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:43:06.700 --> 03:43:09.700]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:43:09.700 --> 03:43:14.700]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:43:14.700 --> 03:43:16.700]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:18.700]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:43:18.700 --> 03:43:25.700]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[03:43:25.700 --> 03:43:26.700]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:30.700]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:43:30.700 --> 03:43:32.700]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:43:32.700 --> 03:43:33.700]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:43:33.700 --> 03:43:36.700]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[03:43:36.700 --> 03:43:37.700]  Alex Jones for president.
[03:43:37.700 --> 03:43:41.700]  Twenty twenty four. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:43:41.700 --> 03:43:43.700]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:43:43.700 --> 03:43:51.700]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com

[03:45:20.700 --> 03:45:22.700]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:45:22.700 --> 03:45:26.700]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[03:45:26.700 --> 03:45:30.700]  and amino acids that turbo charge everything

[03:45:46.700 --> 03:45:47.700]  Turbo Force.

[03:45:51.700 --> 03:45:52.700]  More power.
[03:45:52.700 --> 03:45:53.700]  More strength.

[03:45:56.700 --> 03:46:04.700]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:46:04.700 --> 03:46:06.700]  I want you all to know something.
[03:46:06.700 --> 03:46:08.700]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:08.700 --> 03:46:11.700]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[03:46:11.700 --> 03:46:14.700]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:46:14.700 --> 03:46:18.700]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:46:18.700 --> 03:46:20.700]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:20.700 --> 03:46:24.700]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:46:24.700 --> 03:46:28.700]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:46:28.700 --> 03:46:31.700]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:32.700]  Years ago.
[03:46:32.700 --> 03:46:34.700]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:46:34.700 --> 03:46:36.700]  Not for a second.
[03:46:36.700 --> 03:46:38.700]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:46:38.700 --> 03:46:41.700]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:46:41.700 --> 03:46:44.700]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:46:44.700 --> 03:46:46.700]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:49.700]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:46:55.300 --> 03:47:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:18.199]  Live, from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson, with Summit.News.
[03:47:18.199 --> 03:47:26.880]  Now I want to get to these final two videos, again, remaining in the United Kingdom, because
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:34.680]  we have more petulant posh twats in the form of Just Stop Oil, engaging in hysterical public
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:40.320]  temper tantrums, targeting specifically the working class, once again, whose lives they
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:44.440]  seem to enjoy ruining and making misery of.
[03:47:44.440 --> 03:47:50.800]  This was an incident that happened in Sheffield, my birthplace, at the snooker championships
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:54.320]  at the Crucible there in Sheffield just a couple of days ago.
[03:47:54.320 --> 03:47:57.520]  Just Stop Oil engaging in another public temper tantrum.
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:01.480]  This video is called, oh look, another posh twat.
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:02.880]  Let's roll it.
[03:48:03.880 --> 03:48:07.880]  Twats are once again out in force, ruining the lives of ordinary people.
[03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:13.880]  Well, I don't quite know what that was for.
[03:48:23.880 --> 03:48:29.880]  Take note of the loud, sustained booing from people who paid good money to attend the match.
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:32.880]  Snooker being largely the preserver of the working class.
[03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:37.880]  Underscoring, once again, how these tantruming trust fund babies succeed at nothing other
[03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:40.039]  than pissing off the common man.
[03:48:40.039 --> 03:48:44.199]  People struggling under a cost of living crisis, desperately trying to make ends meet to keep
[03:48:44.199 --> 03:48:45.199]  their homes warm.
[03:48:45.199 --> 03:48:51.760]  A situation exacerbated by the very climate crisis drivel being spouted by Tarquin and
[03:48:51.760 --> 03:48:57.880]  his uni pals, which is continually driving up prices due to over-reliance on green energy.
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:01.640]  This has proven time and time again to be completely inadequate to meet demand.
[03:49:01.640 --> 03:49:07.039]  While this same hysterical green lobby continues to deride nuclear power, the rapid expansion
[03:49:07.039 --> 03:49:11.240]  of which would meet the world's energy needs almost instantly, their performative outcry
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:15.560]  wraps itself in the cloak of the morally righteous greater good.
[03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:20.240]  While the actual impact of their demented scheme will cause more poverty, create more
[03:49:20.240 --> 03:49:24.600]  poor people, and spread more misery, they act like they've got the moral high ground
[03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:26.760]  when nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:27.840]  Well, what do you know?
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:31.359]  Yet again, it's some obnoxious, spoilt, privileged little brat.
[03:49:31.359 --> 03:49:33.279]  Edrid Whittingham!
[03:49:33.279 --> 03:49:35.520]  The son of a rich venture capitalist.
[03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:37.000]  Edrid Whittingham!
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:41.440]  Same boilerplate background and personality type every single time.
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:46.160]  Comfortable upbringing, mummy and daddy taking care of everything, never had to struggle,
[03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:47.640]  never had to face hardship.
[03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:51.880]  Thinking they have to assuage their guilt and prove themselves by becoming brainwashed
[03:49:51.880 --> 03:49:53.800]  hysterical eco-militants.
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:58.359]  It takes real guts to do something like this, surrounded by people screaming at you.
[03:49:58.359 --> 03:50:00.320]  The suffragettes were hated in their time king.
[03:50:00.320 --> 03:50:05.199]  Yeah, it really takes a lot of guts to be a narcissistic attention-seeking plummy toff
[03:50:05.199 --> 03:50:10.080]  whose green agenda is supported by every major corporation, every government entity, every
[03:50:10.080 --> 03:50:12.320]  cultural institution in existence.
[03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:16.800]  All while being protected by activist judges, activist barristers, and getting constant
[03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:21.440]  sympathetic and sometimes even grovelling treatment from the police and the media.
[03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:22.440]  So brave!
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:27.520]  Yeah, it takes so much guts to be a foot soldier for Just Stop Oil, which is bankrolled by
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:33.359]  the Climate Emergency Fund, co-founded and in turn funded by Eileen Getty, granddaughter
[03:50:33.359 --> 03:50:35.840]  of oil tycoon John Paul Getty.
[03:50:35.840 --> 03:50:38.800]  Just Stop Oil, funded by a billionaire oil family.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:40.119]  Yeah, funny that, isn't it?
[03:50:40.119 --> 03:50:43.400]  Because as ever, it has nothing to do with the environment, and everything to do with
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:48.840]  establishing faux-environmentalism as the new religion, neo-feudalism rebranded.
[03:50:48.840 --> 03:50:49.840]  Edrid Whittingham!
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:54.160]  Yeah, him and his old money-mates will be just fine living off the wealth of their rich
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:59.720]  parents while you shiver in your homes, unable to afford anything above 15 degrees Celsius
[03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:01.039]  on the thermostat.
[03:51:01.039 --> 03:51:06.199]  Because the contrived climate crisis just added another 200% to your gas bills.
[03:51:06.199 --> 03:51:10.279]  It's alright though, because Edrid Whittingham got to feel better about himself while having
[03:51:10.279 --> 03:51:12.359]  a public tantrum on television.
[03:51:13.359 --> 03:51:20.480]  Now, talking about that demented agenda, again making the lives of poor people poorer, colder,
[03:51:20.480 --> 03:51:25.760]  more miserable, Germany closes its last nuclear power plants, just shut down their last three
[03:51:25.760 --> 03:51:30.760]  nuclear power plants, lo and behold, their electricity bills have immediately spiked
[03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:32.160]  by up to 45%.
[03:51:32.160 --> 03:51:34.920]  Who could have seen that coming?
[03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:40.080]  RT reports Germany could run out of gas by the end of next January.
[03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:43.640]  Germany will have to put up further gas consumption restrictions off a severe gas shortage if
[03:51:43.640 --> 03:51:44.840]  the next winter is cold.
[03:51:44.840 --> 03:51:50.680]  They're basically saying, unless they have an unreasonably warm winter, maybe hoping
[03:51:50.680 --> 03:51:56.279]  for some more global warming that isn't happening, they're going to have to basically start rationing
[03:51:56.279 --> 03:52:00.520]  gas, start rationing power again to the German people who've already struggled through the
[03:52:00.520 --> 03:52:05.720]  recent winter, because of course they were dependent on Russia and that all got cut off.
[03:52:05.720 --> 03:52:09.840]  Now their final nuclear plants are being shut down, that had been delayed, now it's
[03:52:09.840 --> 03:52:14.880]  gone through, everyone's poorer, everyone's more miserable, while these upper middle class
[03:52:14.880 --> 03:52:19.680]  toffs continue to have performative temper tantrums like they're saving the planet, like
[03:52:19.680 --> 03:52:24.480]  they're morally righteous, when in fact they're just literally at the end of the day killing
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:25.480]  poor people.
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:31.039]  Let's go to this other clip now, again out of the United Kingdom, because Wales has decided
[03:52:31.039 --> 03:52:37.320]  to rename one of its beloved national parks, basically again in honour of the new religion
[03:52:37.320 --> 03:52:38.440]  of climate change.
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:42.119]  This video's called Another Piece of Inane Stupidity.
[03:52:42.119 --> 03:52:44.080]  Let's roll it.
[03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:48.199]  Wales continues to entrench its role as the California of the United Kingdom.
[03:52:48.199 --> 03:52:53.560]  Now they've suddenly renamed an entire national park in honour of the new religion of climate
[03:52:53.560 --> 03:52:54.560]  change.
[03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:57.359]  Brecon Beacons to be renamed over links to climate change.
[03:52:57.359 --> 03:53:01.480]  The national park says the symbol of a carbon-burning beacon is incompatible with its push to net
[03:53:01.480 --> 03:53:02.480]  zero.
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:06.080]  Brecon Beacons are set to be renamed over concerns that the word beacon is out of step
[03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:08.320]  with a fight against climate change.
[03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:18.600]  The national park will now officially be referred to, hang on a minute, the Bannow Breconog
[03:53:18.600 --> 03:53:19.600]  National Park.
[03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:20.600]  Genius!
[03:53:20.600 --> 03:53:24.600]  Because as every climate scientist worth his salt will tell you, changing two words in
[03:53:24.600 --> 03:53:28.800]  the name of something will directly lead to global temperatures plummeting.
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:33.279]  Maybe the sun will decide to shine a bit less, because it doesn't like the new name.
[03:53:33.279 --> 03:53:37.400]  Maybe the Earth's jet stream will choose to alter its behaviour, because fewer people
[03:53:37.400 --> 03:53:41.520]  will make the sound Brecon Beacons emerge from their mouths.
[03:53:41.520 --> 03:53:44.880]  Utter, unbridled, demented stupidity.
[03:53:44.880 --> 03:53:48.920]  Officials said the symbol of a flaming beacon emitting carbon does not fit with the ethos
[03:53:48.920 --> 03:53:51.520]  of the national park as an eco-friendly organisation.
[03:53:51.520 --> 03:53:55.199]  Catherine Mealink-Jones, the chief executive of the Brecon Beacons National Park, said
[03:53:55.199 --> 03:53:59.760]  we're an environmental organisation, we're trying to cut carbon and push to net zero,
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:02.640]  so having a carbon-burning beacon just isn't a good look.
[03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:06.800]  Right, so you've eliminated what has become a well-known and well-loved term for a piece
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:11.359]  of heritage, essentially, in order to make yourself feel better.
[03:54:11.359 --> 03:54:13.320]  And this is how braindead it all is.
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:17.760]  There's no historical evidence that warning beacons were ever even lit on the peaks.
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:20.840]  You've had awful wildfires over the last few years.
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:25.720]  So what, you think Mother Earth, Gaia, was offended by the term Brecon Beacons?
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:29.680]  Was the landscape outraged that you'd assumed its pronouns?
[03:54:29.680 --> 03:54:33.279]  Because I'm sure those wildfires will just suddenly decide to tame themselves.
[03:54:33.279 --> 03:54:38.160]  Now that you've decided to call it something unpronounceable to 99% of the population,
[03:54:38.160 --> 03:54:43.800]  welcome to the relentlessly absurd and contradictory nature of Welsh nationalism, where they're
[03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:48.600]  so desperate to protect the native language, but not so desperate to protect the native
[03:54:48.600 --> 03:54:49.600]  people.
[03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:53.920]  To the extent where they're now planning to tear down statues of white historical figures.
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:54.920]  Because...
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:54:55.920]  Well, because they're white.
[03:54:55.920 --> 03:54:58.400]  You can't have white people in Wales!
[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:00.160]  What's next on the chopping block?
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:01.160]  Burns Night?
[03:55:01.160 --> 03:55:02.160]  Blackburn?
[03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:03.160]  Burnley?
[03:55:03.160 --> 03:55:09.240]  Again, it's the raw, power-mad zeal to deform language and socially re-engineer the public.
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:10.920]  That's what really lies at the heart of this.
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:11.920]  It does every time.
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:17.000]  And as ever, it's all wrapped in the cloak of pretentious, cloying do-goodery.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:23.119]  Now, remaining in the UK, we had this story recently again.
[03:55:23.119 --> 03:55:24.359]  Entirely predictable.
[03:55:24.359 --> 03:55:30.119]  At least 19 suspected terrorists snuck into UK in small migrant boats.
[03:55:30.119 --> 03:55:34.800]  Again, Breitbart, at least 19 suspected terrorists have infiltrated the United Kingdom by crossing
[03:55:34.800 --> 03:55:38.039]  the English Channel and people smuggler small boats and claiming asylum.
[03:55:38.039 --> 03:55:43.960]  This, of course, after the Manchester Arena bomber was rescued as a refugee from Libya
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:46.840]  by our own government, went on to blow up a bunch of kids.
[03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:50.480]  You'd think they'd have learned their lesson, but no.
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:54.439]  Channel migrants to be declared a crisis, so government can use emergency powers to
[03:55:54.439 --> 03:55:56.400]  force migrant camps on communities.
[03:55:56.400 --> 03:56:02.240]  Of course, we've had this absolutely bizarre situation over the past year or so where,
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:07.560]  as taxpayers, we're paying £6 million a day to house illegal immigrants, which our own
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:14.160]  government rescues, in four- and five-star luxury hotels around the country because there's
[03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:16.720]  no room to put them anywhere else.
[03:56:16.720 --> 03:56:20.199]  The crisis, though, apparently, according to the government, which it needs to use
[03:56:20.199 --> 03:56:25.760]  these emergency powers to solve, is not the fact that they're rescuing and bringing in
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:29.960]  migrants, illegal immigrants, some of whom are literal ISIS terrorists.
[03:56:29.960 --> 03:56:31.640]  No, that's not the crisis.
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:36.520]  The crisis is that they're putting them in hotels and they need to set up new bases and
[03:56:36.520 --> 03:56:40.640]  indeed use old army bases to house them instead.
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:44.800]  The UK's Conservative government will use a special provision in emergency legislation
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:49.039]  allowing it to ignore normal planning laws to build migrant camps in areas where locals
[03:56:49.039 --> 03:56:50.439]  are resisting them.
[03:56:50.439 --> 03:56:56.840]  So basically, the councils have been, in many cases, good on them standing up for local
[03:56:56.840 --> 03:57:01.279]  residents who have been protesting against all this because of all the crime, sexual
[03:57:01.279 --> 03:57:06.760]  assaults that take place, antisocial behaviour around these migrant hotels by using planning
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:13.000]  laws to say that you can't use this hotel or this plot of land for a different purpose
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:14.439]  than initially stated.
[03:57:14.439 --> 03:57:19.760]  They use that basically to get around the government trying to claim that hotel, claim
[03:57:19.760 --> 03:57:22.160]  that land to use it to house migrants.
[03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:26.160]  Now the government is simply saying we're going to use this emergency law to override
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:31.360]  all that and at least have temporary camps which exist for six months again.
[03:57:31.360 --> 03:57:36.320]  Many of them ex-army bases which are situated in villages, in some cases, of just a few
[03:57:36.320 --> 03:57:39.320]  hundred people with 500, 600, 700 migrants.
[03:57:39.320 --> 03:57:40.320]  It's an absolute disgrace.
[03:57:40.320 --> 03:57:42.320]  That's going to wrap it up for Summit News.
[03:57:42.320 --> 03:57:43.320]  War Room is next.
[03:57:43.320 --> 03:57:43.820]  Don't go away.
[03:57:44.439 --> 03:57:44.939]  Don't go away.
[03:57:45.500 --> 03:57:49.500]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:57:49.500 --> 03:57:51.500]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:57:51.500 --> 03:57:55.500]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:57:55.500 --> 03:57:57.500]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[03:57:57.500 --> 03:58:00.500]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:58:00.500 --> 03:58:04.500]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:58:04.500 --> 03:58:07.500]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:58:07.500 --> 03:58:09.500]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:58:09.500 --> 03:58:11.500]  five, six, seven days a week.
[03:58:11.500 --> 03:58:13.500]  It's really just incredible.
[03:58:13.500 --> 03:58:15.500]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[03:58:15.500 --> 03:58:17.500]  I thank you for your past support.
[03:58:17.500 --> 03:58:21.500]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air
[03:58:21.500 --> 03:58:23.500]  if you do not support us.
[03:58:23.500 --> 03:58:24.500]  I know you spread the word.
[03:58:24.500 --> 03:58:25.500]  I know you pray for us.
[03:58:25.500 --> 03:58:26.500]  And that's wonderful.
[03:58:26.500 --> 03:58:27.500]  Keep doing it.
[03:58:27.500 --> 03:58:30.500]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:58:30.500 --> 03:58:33.500]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:58:33.500 --> 03:58:35.500]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:58:35.500 --> 03:58:37.500]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:58:37.500 --> 03:58:39.500]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:39.500 --> 03:58:41.500]  If just 1% more of you took action
[03:58:42.500 --> 03:58:43.500]  and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:58:43.500 --> 03:58:45.500]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:58:45.500 --> 03:58:46.500]  Please take action now.
[03:58:46.500 --> 03:58:47.500]  Every time I talk to you,
[03:58:47.500 --> 03:58:50.500]  you're either, like, on the border exposing the cartels
[03:58:50.500 --> 03:58:51.500]  and, like, coming under fire,
[03:58:51.500 --> 03:58:53.500]  or you're on the streets of some American city
[03:58:53.500 --> 03:58:55.500]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[03:58:55.500 --> 03:58:58.500]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:58:58.500 --> 03:59:00.500]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:59:00.500 --> 03:59:02.500]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:59:02.500 --> 03:59:05.500]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:59:05.500 --> 03:59:07.500]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:59:07.500 --> 03:59:09.500]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:59:09.500 --> 03:59:10.500]  Looking back on the day
[03:59:10.500 --> 03:59:13.500]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:59:13.500 --> 03:59:15.500]  I was so grateful because, you know,
[03:59:15.500 --> 03:59:18.500]  I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[03:59:18.500 --> 03:59:19.500]  and under the InfoWars team.
[03:59:19.500 --> 03:59:22.500]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to,
[03:59:22.500 --> 03:59:24.500]  you know, get these types of clips.
[03:59:24.500 --> 03:59:27.500]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[03:59:27.500 --> 03:59:28.500]  go where the story is.
[03:59:28.500 --> 03:59:31.500]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:59:31.500 --> 03:59:33.500]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:59:33.500 --> 03:59:35.500]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[03:59:35.500 --> 03:59:36.500]  and helping the American people.
[03:59:37.500 --> 03:59:39.500]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[03:59:39.500 --> 03:59:42.500]  really instilling that within me early on in my career.
