[00:00.000 --> 00:25.760]  We have a player down on the court will try to get more information.
[00:25.760 --> 00:30.760]  Dr. Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
[00:30.760 --> 00:35.760]  Leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses and footballers likely to be just a coincidence.
[00:35.760 --> 00:38.760]  A terrible coincidence at that, but just a coincidence.
[00:38.760 --> 00:39.760]  Yes, just a coincidence.
[00:39.760 --> 00:42.760]  One of their high school football players died.
[00:42.760 --> 00:49.760]  17-year-old Everest Romney got his vaccine shot and that is when doctors found out he had two blood clots inside his brain.
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.760]  Doctors baffled after 16-year-old football player and wrestler suffers a stroke and blood clot in his brain.
[00:54.760 --> 01:00.760]  17-year-old high school student dies suddenly after suffering critical medical emergency during flag football games.
[01:00.760 --> 01:06.760]  16-year-old high school football player collapses and dies after suffering medical emergency during practice.
[01:06.760 --> 01:11.760]  Family and doctors are baffled by the sudden and unexplained death of a 16-year-old Stanford high school football player.
[01:11.760 --> 01:17.760]  Buffalo bill safety DeMar Hamlin in critical condition after collapsing on the field during the game.
[01:17.760 --> 01:21.760]  He was administered CPR before being taken away in an ambulance.
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.760]  12-year-old Jason Kidd collapsed during warm-ups at basketball practice. He died a short time later.
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.760]  A South Carolina high school football player has died after collapsing at football practice.
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.760]  Isaiah Turner died yesterday following a, quote, sudden catastrophic medical event.
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.760]  17-year-old Philip Laster Jr. collapsed while practicing football on Monday.
[01:43.760 --> 01:50.760]  A 16-year-old student from West Catholic Repertory High School collapsed while warming up for a scrimmage in Chester County.
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.760]  Two young athletes, the latest to die, suddenly prominent cardiologist tie alarming trend to COVID shots.
[01:56.760 --> 01:59.760]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.760]  So, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we emphasize here.
[02:10.760 --> 02:19.760]  We emphasize what we already know with all the young athletes that have died from cardiac problems directly related to
[02:19.760 --> 02:22.760]  the COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.760]  The number one side effect being heart problems like myocarditis.
[02:28.760 --> 02:38.760]  People that got the vaccine are having foot long plus fiber clots pulled out of their body, something never before seen.
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.760]  We know all of this about the COVID-19 vaccine. They continue to promote it.
[02:44.760 --> 02:57.760]  We ask a legitimate question. Was a young NFL player's cardiac arrest on the football field due to his COVID-19 vaccination status
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.760]  and the entire establishment freaks out in panics?
[03:04.760 --> 03:09.760]  Now, they wanted to know your vaccine status for you to go eat at a restaurant.
[03:09.760 --> 03:18.760]  They wanted to know your vaccine status to go to work. They wanted to know your vaccine status to go to a ballgame.
[03:18.760 --> 03:25.760]  God forbid you want to know if DeMar Hamlin had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.760]  Now, in my opinion, I think that's his private business.
[03:31.760 --> 03:39.760]  And I don't want to become like the medical fascists that were fighting by saying, no, you tell me your vaccine status.
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.760]  I don't want to become like that. But fair is fair.
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.760]  And also, I'm the one that even gets a positive story in Raw Story.
[03:51.760 --> 03:59.760]  If you can believe that, Raw Story writing a positive piece on me because I'm the one saying that the hit is what caused the cardiac event on the field
[03:59.760 --> 04:04.760]  and the vaccine may have made a bad situation worse. We don't know. We may never know.
[04:04.760 --> 04:08.760]  I don't know Hamlin's vaccine status.
[04:08.760 --> 04:14.760]  I still believe that. I'm listening to Harrison Smith today. He disagrees.
[04:14.760 --> 04:21.760]  He's much more in consideration that the vaccine caused the thing. We're not a cult here.
[04:21.760 --> 04:26.760]  We disagree sometimes. I had a guest on yesterday, Tom Renz. He disagrees with me.
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.760]  I'm listening to other people's coverage last night. They disagree. People think this is 100% the vaccine.
[04:31.760 --> 04:35.760]  I don't know Hamlin's vaccine status. I can't say that for sure.
[04:35.760 --> 04:42.760]  I saw a violent NFL hit with a direct force blunt trauma to the heart that can cause a cardiac event like that.
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.760]  Was it made worse by a vaccine? Could very possibly have been. Perhaps that's even likely.
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.760]  But we're not allowed to ask the question. We're not allowed to have the conversation. We can't have the debate.
[04:55.760 --> 04:58.760]  I think it's pretty human interest worthy.
[05:25.760 --> 05:32.760]  I can't say this without funding. We make it easy to fund with great products, empower you and your immune system and your family as well.

[05:36.760 --> 05:40.760]  One time we're recurring, but I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent.
[05:40.760 --> 05:48.760]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you're literally non violently, politically punching the new world order in the nose.
[05:48.760 --> 05:54.760]  Punching their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the new world order, we're going over the top and right now is the critical juncture.
[05:54.760 --> 06:01.860]  so please go to M4store.com and donate now.
[06:08.060 --> 06:17.920]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[06:17.920 --> 06:29.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, January 4th, 2023.
[06:29.640 --> 06:36.920]  This is the Alex Jones show, Owen Schroder sitting in for Alex, and the conversation
[06:36.920 --> 06:44.200]  goes on when it comes to the NFL player collapsing on the field.
[06:44.200 --> 06:52.480]  The debate is not going to go away, it's not going to disappear, but I think that it's
[06:52.480 --> 06:59.440]  a healthy thing for us to have the debate, but we also need to be careful as the people
[06:59.440 --> 07:04.320]  telling the truth for so long, the people being vindicated on all of these issues that
[07:04.320 --> 07:11.440]  we don't step into a trap or jump the shark on something before we know all the facts,
[07:11.440 --> 07:17.800]  and that's been my stance on this, and I remain in the belief that it was the hit that caused
[07:17.800 --> 07:19.760]  the cardiac event.
[07:19.760 --> 07:24.880]  If Hamlin was standing on the sideline, it wouldn't have happened, I'm quite frankly
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.360]  flabbergasted that people are still arguing otherwise, but it's right here, it's our own
[07:30.360 --> 07:32.200]  Harrison Smith, who I love.
[07:32.200 --> 07:34.800]  I was listening to Harrison Smith this morning, I listen to him every morning, I love Harrison
[07:34.800 --> 07:39.360]  Smith, he disagrees, a lot of his callers this morning disagreed, a lot of you listening
[07:39.360 --> 07:43.840]  probably disagree, perfectly fine, it's okay to disagree, iron sharpens iron, let's have
[07:43.840 --> 07:49.640]  the discussion, let's have the debate, I'm all for it, but yeah, I'm still completely
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.600]  of the belief that it was the hit that caused the event, and if Hamlin was standing on the
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.440]  sideline during that kickoff, wouldn't have happened, to believe otherwise to me is shocking,
[07:59.440 --> 08:09.680]  but people do, okay, fine, but I'm also not so ignorant realizing that some of the biggest
[08:09.680 --> 08:18.680]  side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are myocarditis and blood clots, and that a COVID-19 vaccine
[08:18.680 --> 08:24.240]  causing myocarditis or a blood clot or fiber clot could have made a bad situation worse,
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.800]  could have made a cardiac event worse, or more likely in that situation, but I don't
[08:29.800 --> 08:36.040]  know that yet, maybe we'll never know, but the fact that conversation is ongoing I think
[08:36.040 --> 08:44.800]  is a good thing, except that a lot of people who may have been open minded to hearing about
[08:44.800 --> 08:55.560]  the negative side effects from the vaccines, seeing this hit, an event being completely
[08:55.560 --> 09:00.960]  classified as a vaccine injury is not helping the issue in my eyes, but we'll have that
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.600]  conversation today.
[09:02.600 --> 09:12.000]  Here's the important thing I think, as that young man is still in critical condition,
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.720]  and to just say one more positive thing on the issue, as I said yesterday, this was a
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.640]  young NFL player who was on pace to become a Walter Peyton Man of the Year award winner,
[09:21.640 --> 09:29.000]  that's the type of guy he was, that's quite an honor, that as he's been in critical condition
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.160]  on life support, last I checked more than six and a half million dollars has been raised
[09:35.160 --> 09:41.080]  in his name to his charities, I mean you want to talk about an impact, you want to talk
[09:41.080 --> 09:48.480]  about a guy who makes the world a better place, while he's on life support in critical condition,
[09:48.480 --> 09:56.280]  still making the world a better place, wow, so we'll have that story today as well.
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.040]  But here's what's going on guys, and actually what I do want in front of me is a live feed
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.760]  of the House vote, like we had yesterday, now it was supposed to have started I guess
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.760]  nine, now 10 minutes ago as it's 11-10 on the clock here central, it doesn't look like
[10:13.760 --> 10:17.240]  they've tallyed the votes yet, but it looks like they're sitting down getting ready to
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.240]  do it.
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.440]  So we'll be watching this, this is going to be interesting to see, we have had some developments
[10:23.440 --> 10:30.120]  in the last we'll say 12 hours, or since we've been on air here, comments from Donald Trump
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.160]  where he stands, comments from some of the individuals that voted against McCarthy, comments
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.880]  from some of the individuals that voted for McCarthy, and then of course, the response
[10:41.880 --> 10:49.240]  from the establishment Republicans, from the mainstream conservative media, I was not shocked
[10:49.240 --> 10:55.640]  by it, it went exactly how I expected it to go, and if you were tuned in yesterday you
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.440]  were warned how that's going to go, and so you were ready for that and you didn't panic
[11:00.440 --> 11:06.240]  and you didn't make a big fuss about it, and hopefully you didn't anyway, because all the
[11:06.240 --> 11:11.240]  hemming and the hawing and the, oh we can't get McCarthy, oh what have we done, oh this
[11:11.240 --> 11:17.440]  is a disaster, give me a break, like McCarthy not becoming the speaker of the House is the
[11:17.440 --> 11:23.920]  biggest problem we've had in DC in our lives, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[11:23.920 --> 11:29.440]  oh yeah, I'm going to be held hostage by the GOP intellectually, I'm going to be held
[11:29.440 --> 11:32.920]  hostage by the GOP politically, and they're going to say, we've got to get McCarthy in
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.920]  there, we can't get anything done, oh that's what's been, oh jeez guys, that's all it was
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.840]  this whole time, I mean 33 years me living in America, and it was just not Kevin McCarthy
[11:44.840 --> 11:51.480]  as the speaker that's been the problem, man, if it was that easy, I mean, why didn't we
[11:51.480 --> 11:57.800]  do this years ago, oh my god, no it's utter trash, it's utter garbage, what Matt Gates
[11:57.800 --> 12:04.400]  and Lauren Boeber and others have done was political brilliance, and it was the perfect
[12:04.400 --> 12:10.000]  example we needed of how to break from the establishment and not look back, and that's
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.520]  how it should be, and I remember when Trump announced saying this is going to be 2016
[12:18.520 --> 12:24.080]  all over again now, and isn't this the same thing, remember Trump running in 2015, 2016,
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.280]  the entire establishment against him, the entire GOP against him, you heard the media
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.760]  and the Republicans saying all the same things, we can't have Trump, it'd be a disaster, no
[12:34.760 --> 12:41.040]  way, this is the worst, and then Trump probably for you is the best president of your lifetime,
[12:41.040 --> 12:49.160]  certainly for me, so it's the same thing now, with Matt Gates and Lauren Boeber and the
[12:49.160 --> 12:52.680]  rest of the Freedom Caucus and the Republicans that voted against McCarthy, which I have
[12:52.680 --> 12:58.440]  the list in front of me right here, quickly though, I've got a bunch of other news, the
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.080]  Twitter files from yesterday, this is huge, and there's a phenomenon happening and I
[13:05.080 --> 13:10.520]  want to kind of take a deep breath myself as I'm getting hyped up, getting ready for
[13:10.520 --> 13:14.960]  this House vote, this is going to be exciting today, let me just take a deep breath because
[13:14.960 --> 13:20.400]  there's something weird I've noticed, and I get it, the world is becoming a stranger
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.680]  place and people are opening their eyes and opening their minds and we're starting to
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.020]  see the world through what it really is and it's quite different than what we're told
[13:31.020 --> 13:36.400]  it is and the world view that's forced upon us, so things can get weird and things can
[13:36.400 --> 13:43.840]  seem weird, but we have to realize that it's been like this for a long time and we need
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.880]  to stay grounded in some sense of reality here, folks, I understand that reality seems stranger
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.240]  than fiction with most things now, as we live and we learn and we open our eyes and we open
[13:54.240 --> 14:01.080]  our minds, but I think the weirdness of it all is starting to catch up to people and
[14:01.080 --> 14:08.320]  now it's like they're starting to believe things that are so ridiculous that I can't
[14:08.320 --> 14:11.640]  even explain it and these people I respect, these people I love, these are smart people,
[14:11.640 --> 14:16.240]  so I'm going to talk about that a little bit with some other stuff, but believe me, I get
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.320]  it, I've got a stack of weird news today that's just, you just, it's like how does this even
[14:20.320 --> 14:26.240]  go on, what is happening here, so we've got that and I just got tons of news, it's going
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.400]  to be a loaded news broadcast, hopefully we can get it, but we're going to be covering
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.120]  this speaker vote which is going to be starting up shortly, now quickly, here are the 20 Republicans
[14:35.120 --> 14:41.840]  that I salute that voted against McCarthy yesterday in the final vote with Byron Donalds
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.360]  from Florida being the one that switched, making it from 19 to 20 in the third vote.
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.240]  Andy Biggs, Arizona, Paul Gasar, Arizona, Eli Crane, Arizona, Lauren Boebert, Colorado,
[14:52.240 --> 14:58.520]  Matt Gaetz, Florida, Anna Paulina Luna, Florida, Byron Donalds, Florida, Chip Roy, Texas,
[14:58.520 --> 15:06.040]  Michael Cloud, Texas, Keith Self, Texas, Dan Bishop, North Carolina, Josh Brechin, Oklahoma,

[15:25.000 --> 15:31.400]  are the winners from yesterday, these are to me, the individuals that should be looked

[15:37.320 --> 15:43.120]  are the representatives we need to protect, they've broken from the GOP establishment,
[15:43.120 --> 15:48.080]  they've broken from the DC elites, and they've made it clear they're not looking back, no
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.240]  matter your threats, no matter you're withholding of funds, no matter your lies and attacks,
[15:53.240 --> 15:56.960]  they've broken from the establishment, they're not looking back, this is what we need in

[18:56.400 --> 18:59.680]  wars platinum, now available at infowarstore.com.
[18:59.680 --> 19:05.040]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any republican
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.000]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.640]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[19:15.640 --> 19:21.440]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[19:21.440 --> 19:27.120]  resistance to it possible, was people continuing to support info wars, despite the massive
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.000]  lawfare being waged against info wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.280]  info wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.000]  lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser, is what keeps info wars on the air, and what
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.320]  that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression,
[19:49.320 --> 19:55.400]  so continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to places like save info wars, continue
[19:55.400 --> 20:02.040]  to keep info wars alive, because in the process you are keeping American liberty alive.
[20:02.040 --> 20:31.040]  Reading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:31.040 --> 20:40.280]  I'm watching this, you have Brian Gallagher, representative from North Carolina, up here
[20:40.280 --> 20:45.200]  stomping on the Capitol Hill for Kevin McCarthy, laying out the speech of why we need to do
[20:45.200 --> 20:46.200]  it again.
[20:46.200 --> 20:50.120]  He's been nominated again, they're about to take a fourth vote, and I'm just sitting
[20:50.120 --> 20:58.840]  here laughing thinking how hilariously stupid this is, because why would he be up there
[20:58.840 --> 21:05.080]  stomping for McCarthy if they already knew they had the votes, it just doesn't make sense,
[21:05.080 --> 21:10.360]  they've been jockeying back and forth all last night obviously, so they know, they should
[21:10.360 --> 21:15.200]  know if they have the votes or not, you'd think, so why is he up there stomping trying
[21:15.200 --> 21:20.040]  to convince people to vote for McCarthy if they already have the votes, so that tells
[21:20.040 --> 21:24.040]  me they don't have the votes, no speech up there is going to get them the votes, and
[21:24.040 --> 21:29.480]  Kevin McCarthy is about to lose for a fourth time, that's the old platinum sombrero in
[21:29.480 --> 21:33.760]  baseball, you strike out four times in a game, you get the old platinum sombrero, you don't
[21:33.760 --> 21:39.520]  want to wear the golden sombrero, that's three, but the platinum sombrero, McCarthy is going
[21:39.520 --> 21:47.360]  to go for it, so this is so odd, if this goes how I expected to go here, and look, I kind
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.800]  of always assumed McCarthy would be able to shoehorn his way in, but I guess I kind of
[21:52.800 --> 21:57.440]  fell for the fake news saying, oh, there's only like maybe five Republicans that are
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.600]  going to vote against him, that's not going to be a problem, and I know how the swamp
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.440]  works, so maybe I even kind of fell for the fake news, but I don't see, in this list of
[22:04.440 --> 22:09.080]  twenty people, I don't see who flips their vote today, now let me just stop right there
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.280]  because I need to do this, because we need to pay bills around here, and when Alex is
[22:13.280 --> 22:19.080]  not in, the money coming in goes way down, and that's a problem, so I need to make up
[22:19.080 --> 22:24.000]  for that, I should be plugging every segment, but the news is so important, I can't take
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.320]  myself away from it, and I get it, that's what you want to hear, you don't want to hear
[22:27.320 --> 22:30.320]  me talking about all the great products at infowarstore.com, you already know about it,
[22:30.320 --> 22:34.080]  you already probably shopped there, but if you don't, if you haven't, please, do not
[22:34.080 --> 22:38.800]  take this transmission for granted, do not take this crew for granted, do not take the
[22:38.800 --> 22:44.440]  riders and everybody here at Info Wars and Band Out Video for granted, because you've
[22:44.440 --> 22:48.680]  seen the attacks against us, you've seen the censorship, you know they want to shut down,
[22:48.680 --> 22:51.640]  they're not going anywhere, we're going to be like these Republicans, we've already
[22:51.640 --> 22:55.160]  broke from the establishment, we're never looking back, in fact we didn't even have
[22:55.160 --> 23:00.520]  to break, we were never even connected, and so that's why they come after us so hard,
[23:00.520 --> 23:06.080]  we make it easy to support us at infowarstore.com, the highest quality supplements at the lowest
[23:06.080 --> 23:10.640]  price, that's the nexus that we reach for, and with vitamin mineral fusion, we've done
[23:10.640 --> 23:16.880]  it folks, we have done it, I start every day with vitamin mineral fusion, I suggest you
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.560]  do the same because you're going to get over 100% your daily value of vitamin A, vitamin
[23:21.560 --> 23:28.240]  B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and so much more, the flavor's great as
[23:28.240 --> 23:39.120]  well, ditch the toxic processed sugar, high-fructose corn syrup drinks in your fridge, if your kids
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.240]  were like me, they'd probably like those, I was a big Dr. Pepper fan as a kid, can't
[23:44.240 --> 23:48.080]  deny it, there was Dr. Pepper in the fridge, I was going to find a way to drink it, even
[23:48.080 --> 23:53.920]  if my mom didn't want me to, so just don't even have it in the fridge, get a nice ice
[23:53.920 --> 23:58.760]  cold pitcher of vitamin mineral fusion in there, and everybody will love it, the flavor
[23:58.760 --> 24:06.040]  is great, I mix it with juice, you'll love it as well, so 50% off vitamin mineral fusion

[24:21.520 --> 24:25.560]  off the shelves, the new Infowars Platinum line, check that out at infowarstore.com as
[24:25.560 --> 24:30.640]  well, and remember it's your support there that keeps us on the air, now the crew has
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.080]  Chip Roy pause on the screen here, I'm guessing that's because he was popping off guys, am
[24:35.080 --> 24:43.240]  I about to get some epic Chip Roy here? Okay, so let me just say this, I like what Marjorie
[24:43.240 --> 24:46.920]  Taylor Greene is doing, and I've got some of these video clips today too, I still like
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.240]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, I don't really understand her decision to stick with Kevin McCarthy,
[24:50.240 --> 24:55.480]  I mean she's kind of explained it but I don't agree with it, but I like what she's doing,
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.240]  I don't mind the finding, if you want to call it that inside the Republican Party, I think
[24:59.240 --> 25:04.080]  it's healthy, and I don't mind her saying, well look at what Matt Gage did when he voted
[25:04.080 --> 25:09.360]  for Paul Ryan, and look at what Chip Roy did when he didn't vote to stop the January 6th
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.680]  Committee, I think that's good too, I think that's good too, but I like Chip Roy, I like
[25:15.680 --> 25:21.480]  what he's doing here, I like Matt Gage, I like what he's doing here, when he voted for
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.840]  Paul Ryan, did he make a mistake? Absolutely, maybe he realizes that, he doesn't want to
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.680]  do it again, when Chip Roy didn't vote to stop the January 6th Commission, maybe he
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.000]  made a mistake, maybe he made a conscious decision, I disagree with it, but what he's
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  doing here is great, so, but good for monitoring Taylor Greene, call out their voting record,
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.160]  this is healthy, this is what we need, this is how we stay informed, this is how we stay
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.400]  aware, this is how we know who to get in office and who to keep out of power, so this is a
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.200]  good and a healthy process, don't buy into the panic, don't buy into the hem hoeing that
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.760]  you're seeing on Fox News and all the other conservative mainstream press and everything
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.720]  else, don't buy into it, this is a healthy thing, this is a good thing, they're mad
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.960]  because they're losing power and that's the one thing before I'll go to Chip Roy here,
[26:04.960 --> 26:10.600]  this is the phenomenon that's happening, Kevin McCarthy never had the votes, folks,
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.440]  there should have never been one vote for Kevin McCarthy for Speaker, he never had the
[26:14.440 --> 26:22.200]  votes and yet when he was asked, in fact guys, did you get that quote I sent you, I've got
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.920]  so much stuff here, I may have lost it, where a journalist asked Kevin McCarthy on December
[26:27.920 --> 26:33.160]  22nd, he said, Matt Gaetz says you don't have the votes, what do you say?
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.400]  And he basically called Matt Gaetz a liar and said, we'll see who has the votes, well
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.280]  I guess you're the liar then, Kevin McCarthy, or but I don't even think that's it, these
[26:40.280 --> 26:45.160]  people have had power for so long, they've been able to dictate your will for so long,
[26:45.160 --> 26:50.520]  they have been operating from a top down system of power for so long that they can't even
[26:50.520 --> 26:55.440]  believe it, McCarthy was genuinely in denial that he didn't have the votes, I've got the
[26:55.440 --> 27:03.000]  whole GOP, I've got all the big donors, I've got Fox News, I'm in, no you're not, no we
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.320]  the people are not Fox News, we the people are not the GOP, we the people are not the
[27:07.320 --> 27:14.840]  GOP donors, we're in control now, we're taking the country back, we've had enough, we've
[27:14.840 --> 27:20.280]  been abused, we've been terrorized, we've been mistreated, we've had our founding documents
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.600]  ripped up and shoved in our face, like it's a joke, we've had our schools attacked, our
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.720]  children's attacked, our religions attacked, our free speech attacked, we're done with
[27:31.720 --> 27:36.720]  you, you're done, we don't care what Fox News says, we don't care what the GOP says, we
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.000]  don't care what the donors want, we're done, we've broken from the establishment, you've
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.480]  screwed us long enough and we're never looking back, and that's their arrogance as McCarthy
[27:45.480 --> 27:50.240]  just says, well I have the votes, you never had the votes, there should have never been
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.840]  a House vote for Kevin McCarthy as a speaker, he never had the votes, they did it anyway,
[27:55.840 --> 28:01.320]  same thing with Fox News on a lot of their shows yesterday, oh they can't believe it,
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.360]  how could McCarthy not get in, oh the traders, all these big donors coming out and calling
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.880]  them traders and enemies, like Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, they haven't realized it
[28:11.880 --> 28:17.880]  yet, they haven't accepted it yet, you're out, we're done with you, you suck, you put
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.600]  us in this position, how can the country get any worse, 5 million illegal immigrants under
[28:23.600 --> 28:29.240]  Joe Biden, what are we in, 50 trillion dollars, I don't even know, 100 billion, per trillion
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.760]  debt, it doesn't even matter, 150 billion to Ukraine, roads falling apart, cities going
[28:34.760 --> 28:40.840]  to complete violence, medical tyranny, medical fascism, censorship of free speech, taking
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.520]  our second amendment, and then they sit here and they're like, what is going on, why won't
[28:46.520 --> 28:52.760]  they do what we say, why won't they do what we demand, we're done with you.
[28:52.760 --> 28:59.760]  I think this fourth vote for Kevin McCarthy is going to go hilariously bad.
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.800]  There is a war on for your mind, your mind is a battlefield, this is an information war,
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.760]  info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago, and today whether it's Donald
[29:11.760 --> 29:17.520]  Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.480]  info wars has popularized, because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to
[29:22.480 --> 29:27.280]  beat them, but we can't do it without funding, and we make it easy to fund with great products

[33:38.820 --> 33:40.620]  It's just so beautiful what's going on.
[33:40.620 --> 33:41.940]  And he said all the right things,
[33:41.940 --> 33:43.940]  but let me just try to catch up here.
[33:45.940 --> 33:49.340]  Where is Kevin McCarthy going to get the votes he needs?
[33:50.660 --> 33:53.140]  Okay, here's the 20 Republicans
[33:53.140 --> 33:54.580]  that voted against McCarthy.
[33:55.540 --> 34:00.540]  I think he'd need 10 to flip to get the nomination.
[34:00.940 --> 34:03.300]  Okay, maybe he could get Biggs.
[34:04.420 --> 34:05.940]  Andy Biggs from Arizona.
[34:05.940 --> 34:07.140]  Could he get Paul Gasar?
[34:07.140 --> 34:08.180]  I don't think so.
[34:08.180 --> 34:09.980]  I don't think he's going to get Gasar.
[34:11.180 --> 34:12.260]  Maybe Eli Crane.
[34:12.260 --> 34:13.380]  He's not going to get Bobert.
[34:13.380 --> 34:14.460]  He's not going to get Gates.
[34:14.460 --> 34:16.300]  He's not going to get Luna.
[34:16.300 --> 34:17.620]  He's not going to get Donalds.
[34:17.620 --> 34:19.100]  He's not going to get Roy.
[34:20.100 --> 34:21.700]  Maybe Michael Cloud.
[34:22.580 --> 34:24.580]  But again, these maybes, I don't know.
[34:24.580 --> 34:26.020]  Keith Self, maybe.
[34:26.860 --> 34:28.500]  Dan Bishop, no.
[34:29.420 --> 34:30.260]  Josh.
[34:31.220 --> 34:32.460]  Brett Sheen, maybe.
[34:34.020 --> 34:36.580]  Andrew Clyde, maybe Bob Good, no.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.940]  Andy Harris, maybe. Mary Miller, maybe.
[34:38.940 --> 34:41.860]  Ralph Norman, no.
[34:41.860 --> 34:43.780]  Andy Ogles, maybe.
[34:43.780 --> 34:45.580]  Scott Perry, no.
[34:45.580 --> 34:46.740]  Matt Rosendale, maybe.
[34:46.740 --> 34:50.580]  So, I mean, that's a split right there.
[34:50.580 --> 34:51.500]  Woo!
[34:51.500 --> 34:54.900]  I mean, this is going to be right down to the wire.
[34:54.900 --> 34:56.420]  This is going to be right down to the wire.
[34:56.420 --> 34:59.580]  And that's assuming that these guys are going to switch.
[34:59.580 --> 35:01.900]  I'm confident in the ones not switching.
[35:01.900 --> 35:02.860]  The ones that may switch,
[35:02.860 --> 35:06.380]  I'm just not confident that they wouldn't.
[35:06.380 --> 35:08.100]  So, I put them as switching.
[35:08.100 --> 35:11.060]  I don't think McCarthy has the votes today, folks.
[35:11.060 --> 35:13.580]  I think this is about to be an 0 for 4 sweep.
[35:13.580 --> 35:15.820]  Here's what Scott Perry said this morning.
[35:15.820 --> 35:17.020]  What will happen at noon?
[35:17.020 --> 35:19.260]  All I know for sure is I won't back down.
[35:19.260 --> 35:21.180]  It's time to end the status quo.
[35:21.180 --> 35:23.660]  Everything I'm hearing from the anti-McCarthy Republicans
[35:23.660 --> 35:26.180]  in the house is exactly what I want to be hearing.
[35:27.540 --> 35:28.860]  Everything I heard from Chip Roy,
[35:28.860 --> 35:31.820]  nominating Byron Donalds is exactly what I wanted to hear.
[35:31.820 --> 35:32.820]  It was a great speech.
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.540]  I'd play it, but I just need to catch up.
[35:34.540 --> 35:37.220]  And guys, put me live on the screen if we aren't now too
[35:37.220 --> 35:38.060]  of the vote.
[35:38.060 --> 35:38.900]  Thank you.
[35:40.180 --> 35:41.820]  Continuing.
[35:41.820 --> 35:43.660]  Matt Gaetz, if you want to drain the swamp,
[35:43.660 --> 35:45.340]  you cannot put the biggest alligator
[35:45.340 --> 35:46.580]  in charge of the exercise.
[35:46.580 --> 35:48.020]  That's Kevin McCarthy.
[35:48.020 --> 35:48.860]  Agreed.
[35:49.940 --> 35:52.060]  The votes are now coming in, folks.
[35:52.060 --> 35:54.860]  And let's just put this up on the screen, guys,
[35:54.860 --> 35:57.220]  so people can see these votes coming in in live time.
[35:57.220 --> 35:58.980]  We can just do like a screen and screen
[35:58.980 --> 36:00.060]  as I'm talking here.
[36:01.620 --> 36:03.620]  And then Matt Gaetz sent this letter
[36:03.620 --> 36:05.020]  to the architect of the Capitol
[36:05.020 --> 36:08.340]  attempting to evict Squatter, Kevin McCarthy,
[36:08.340 --> 36:09.380]  from the Speaker's office.
[36:09.380 --> 36:12.140]  Imagine, McCarthy never had the votes.
[36:12.140 --> 36:13.820]  He told all the media he had the votes
[36:13.820 --> 36:15.220]  and then Matt Gaetz was lying.
[36:15.220 --> 36:17.020]  Turns out he was wrong.
[36:17.020 --> 36:19.500]  And then he moves into the Speaker's office.
[36:19.500 --> 36:21.140]  He never even had the votes.
[36:23.260 --> 36:27.380]  And so Matt Gaetz asks the architect of the Capitol
[36:27.380 --> 36:31.340]  to evict the Squatter, quote, Squatter,
[36:31.340 --> 36:34.100]  from the Speaker's office.
[36:34.100 --> 36:37.180]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[36:37.180 --> 36:38.340]  It's so beautiful.
[36:38.340 --> 36:40.820]  And this is what we're trying to avoid right here.
[36:40.820 --> 36:42.660]  Mitch McConnell becomes longest serving
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.620]  party leader in Senate history.
[36:44.620 --> 36:46.900]  This is what we're trying to avoid.
[36:49.060 --> 36:50.900]  Mitch McConnell looks at himself in the mirror
[36:50.900 --> 36:52.900]  and what does he see, Kevin McCarthy.
[36:53.820 --> 36:55.500]  Now here's where it gets interesting.
[36:55.500 --> 36:57.820]  Donald Trump was silent all day yesterday.
[36:57.820 --> 37:00.260]  Breaks his silence this morning.
[37:00.260 --> 37:01.740]  Now remember, he did come out and supported
[37:01.740 --> 37:03.340]  Kevin McCarthy a month or so ago.
[37:03.340 --> 37:04.820]  He'd been silent since.
[37:04.820 --> 37:07.100]  He makes this statement today.
[37:07.100 --> 37:09.780]  Some really good conversations took place last night.
[37:11.140 --> 37:13.940]  And it's now time for all of our great Republican House
[37:13.940 --> 37:16.660]  members to vote for Kevin, close the deal,
[37:16.660 --> 37:19.300]  take the victory, and watch crazy Nancy Pelosi
[37:19.300 --> 37:21.860]  fly back home to a very broken California.
[37:21.860 --> 37:23.740]  The only speaker in U.S. history
[37:23.740 --> 37:25.420]  to have lost the House twice.
[37:25.420 --> 37:27.580]  Republicans do not turn a great triumphant
[37:27.580 --> 37:29.140]  to a giant embarrassing defeat.
[37:29.140 --> 37:31.140]  It's time to celebrate, you deserve it.
[37:32.100 --> 37:33.620]  Kevin McCarthy will do a good job
[37:33.620 --> 37:35.620]  and maybe even a great job, just watch.
[37:37.180 --> 37:39.780]  Sorry, Donald, no.
[37:41.660 --> 37:46.660]  Boy, oh boy, the steam, the turbo boost,
[37:49.020 --> 37:52.420]  the momentum that Trump had after he announced
[37:52.420 --> 37:54.260]  has all gone away.
[37:54.260 --> 37:57.140]  I mean, yikes, it's not sputtering.
[37:57.140 --> 38:00.660]  It is coming down fast.
[38:01.940 --> 38:04.060]  And I've already said, I support Donald Trump,
[38:04.060 --> 38:05.140]  I support his run.
[38:05.140 --> 38:07.260]  I'll even be honest to the point where
[38:08.500 --> 38:10.340]  I want the Trump revenge tour.
[38:10.340 --> 38:11.860]  Like, I won't mince my words.
[38:11.860 --> 38:14.260]  I want the Trump revenge tour.
[38:14.260 --> 38:16.380]  Absolutely, I want the Trump revenge tour.
[38:18.780 --> 38:21.180]  But man, he has really turned into
[38:21.180 --> 38:23.820]  almost a Republican hack.
[38:23.820 --> 38:29.100]  It's just, this is just not,
[38:29.100 --> 38:31.220]  I mean, with the vaccines and now with this,
[38:31.220 --> 38:33.460]  I mean, it's like he has no pulse on his own voters.
[38:33.460 --> 38:36.260]  It's like he has no pulse on his own base.
[38:36.260 --> 38:37.900]  But so here you go.
[38:38.980 --> 38:42.700]  Here's the conservative establishment in the media
[38:42.700 --> 38:45.180]  going into panic mode that they don't dictate
[38:45.180 --> 38:47.300]  Republican policy and they don't dictate
[38:47.300 --> 38:49.020]  Republican power from the top down
[38:49.020 --> 38:52.540]  like they have our whole lives, we're taking it back.
[38:52.540 --> 38:54.700]  And thank God for the 20 Republicans
[38:54.700 --> 38:56.980]  that are helping us in this endeavor
[38:56.980 --> 38:59.620]  that are not confirming McCarthy.
[39:00.820 --> 39:03.740]  Anti-Trump Uniparty leader, Carl Rove,
[39:03.740 --> 39:05.660]  suffers meltdown after McCarthy fails
[39:05.660 --> 39:06.780]  to secure his speakership.
[39:06.780 --> 39:09.820]  Yeah, Carl, you have no influence anymore.
[39:12.940 --> 39:15.580]  The five hosts, rec rogue Republicans,
[39:15.580 --> 39:18.860]  they make the squad look positively reasonable.
[39:18.860 --> 39:23.620]  Aw, Fox News and Carl Rove can't tell conservatives.
[39:25.740 --> 39:28.740]  Can't tell conservatives how to vote
[39:28.740 --> 39:30.220]  and how to think anymore.
[39:31.540 --> 39:34.140]  Fox hosts come unglued after Rhino McCarthy
[39:34.140 --> 39:36.020]  is rejected three times for speaker.
[39:36.020 --> 39:37.260]  I think about to be poor.
[39:39.060 --> 39:40.180]  I think the only chance he has
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.820]  is if five Democrats vote for him.
[39:41.820 --> 39:43.820]  Hey, maybe he has it, but I don't think so.
[39:43.820 --> 39:47.620]  Republican Jewish coalition head slams GOP Infidels
[39:47.620 --> 39:50.780]  voting against Kevin McCarthy, threatens consequences.
[39:50.780 --> 39:52.820]  Ooh, you're not gonna get any of our money,
[39:52.820 --> 39:54.780]  which we didn't already give you anyway.
[39:56.060 --> 40:01.060]  Ooh, oh, imagine that, imagine that.
[40:01.500 --> 40:03.740]  A politician that gets elected
[40:03.740 --> 40:07.820]  and then wants to do their job, wow.
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.300]  A politician that gets elected
[40:09.300 --> 40:11.020]  isn't thinking about the next election
[40:11.020 --> 40:13.500]  and how they can raise the most money to be reelected,
[40:13.500 --> 40:14.860]  but a politician that gets elected
[40:14.860 --> 40:16.540]  and then wants to do their job
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.140]  that they were elected to do.
[40:19.660 --> 40:22.820]  And the donor class says, you better not.
[40:22.820 --> 40:26.460]  You do what we tell you to do or else.
[40:27.700 --> 40:29.100]  Not anymore, Jack.
[40:30.380 --> 40:33.300]  Oh, Kevin McCarthy's roommate, Frank Luntz,
[40:33.300 --> 40:35.300]  seen with McCarthy at the Capitol today.
[40:35.300 --> 40:36.820]  Oh, Frank Luntz is hanging around.
[40:36.820 --> 40:38.300]  Nice.
[40:38.300 --> 40:40.980]  Frank Luntz and the old turd blossom.
[40:40.980 --> 40:42.260]  Carl Rove.
[40:42.260 --> 40:47.260]  So, I'm mostly caught up here.
[40:50.460 --> 40:52.860]  Let me see if there's any clips I just wanna play quickly.
[40:52.860 --> 40:55.020]  Yeah, even Newt Gingrich is coming out.
[40:55.020 --> 40:56.300]  Listen to Newt Gingrich last night
[40:56.300 --> 40:57.580]  on Fox News and Clip 15.
[40:57.580 --> 40:59.580]  This was disheartening.
[40:59.580 --> 41:02.860]  The conference understands this is a core decision.
[41:03.980 --> 41:07.700]  Do the 202 win or do the 20 win?
[41:07.700 --> 41:10.660]  And in a free society, you cannot,
[41:10.660 --> 41:12.740]  just as you can't give in to terrorists
[41:12.740 --> 41:14.860]  and you can't give in to hostage takers.
[41:14.860 --> 41:15.700]  Hostage takers.
[41:15.700 --> 41:17.940]  You can't allow them to take the conference hostage
[41:17.940 --> 41:18.780]  and win.
[41:18.780 --> 41:21.900]  I hope that in a conference tomorrow morning,
[41:21.900 --> 41:23.660]  when people had a good night.
[41:23.660 --> 41:25.660]  It was the one that was using
[41:25.660 --> 41:27.300]  the hostage situation comparison.
[41:27.300 --> 41:28.420]  That was me yesterday.
[41:28.420 --> 41:30.580]  And now Newt Gingrich wants to flip that.
[41:31.940 --> 41:34.820]  Oh, I see the 20 Republicans
[41:34.820 --> 41:37.380]  versus the entire GOP establishment,
[41:37.380 --> 41:39.820]  the entire conservative mainstream news,
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.500]  and all the big donor class,
[41:41.500 --> 41:43.660]  they're the ones holding us all hostage.
[41:43.660 --> 41:46.180]  I see, I see.
[41:46.180 --> 41:48.300]  They're the ones holding us hostage.
[41:48.300 --> 41:49.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:49.140 --> 41:50.860]  No, it's not the donor class saying,
[41:50.860 --> 41:52.580]  you better do this or else.
[41:52.580 --> 41:55.500]  It's not Fox News so saying, you better do this or else.
[41:56.420 --> 41:58.540]  It's not Dan Crenshaw saying we're enemies now.
[41:58.540 --> 42:01.260]  No, it's not them threatening us and holding us hostage.
[42:01.260 --> 42:02.260]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[42:02.260 --> 42:04.780]  Very disheartening from Newt Gingrich.
[42:04.780 --> 42:08.820]  Comes so far or so quickly from what he's been doing
[42:08.820 --> 42:11.220]  since Trump announced, which has been mostly good
[42:11.220 --> 42:14.380]  and I've always liked Newt Gingrich, but this is just...
[42:14.380 --> 42:15.940]  And then they just fully get caught up here
[42:15.940 --> 42:17.180]  as the vote is ongoing.
[42:18.740 --> 42:20.860]  Matt Gaetz again calling out McCarthy,
[42:20.860 --> 42:22.140]  saying this is why we can't have him.
[42:22.140 --> 42:24.420]  I got the clip, I just don't have the time.
[42:24.420 --> 42:26.660]  Dan Crenshaw saying anybody blocking McCarthy,
[42:26.660 --> 42:28.300]  you're the enemy now.
[42:28.300 --> 42:30.380]  Jim Jordan saying I don't wanna be House Speaker,
[42:30.380 --> 42:32.460]  please don't nominate me.
[42:32.460 --> 42:34.620]  Marjorie Taylor-Green calling out voting records
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.100]  of Matt Gaetz, Scott Perry, Chip Roy,
[42:36.100 --> 42:38.100]  and everything else saying to vote McCarthy.
[42:38.100 --> 42:39.540]  By the way, I like Marjorie Taylor-Green.
[42:39.540 --> 42:40.620]  I did disagree with her on McCarthy,
[42:40.620 --> 42:41.540]  but I like what she's doing.
[42:41.540 --> 42:43.900]  Yeah, make people think about their voting record.
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.700]  Make people think hard about the decisions.
[42:45.700 --> 42:47.220]  Hold them to task on that.
[42:47.220 --> 42:48.700]  So we're basically all caught up
[42:48.700 --> 42:50.580]  for all intensive purposes.
[42:50.580 --> 42:52.260]  We're gonna continue to monitor this vote.
[42:52.260 --> 42:54.260]  I think Ken McCarthy's about to go over for.
[42:54.260 --> 42:56.820]  I think he's about to get the platinum sombrero, folks.
[43:00.340 --> 43:02.020]  You wanna beat the New World Order?
[43:02.020 --> 43:03.860]  You wanna stop their globalist agenda?
[43:03.860 --> 43:05.220]  Well, so do I.
[43:05.220 --> 43:08.220]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight
[43:08.220 --> 43:10.300]  against the globalist and I've got their number
[43:10.300 --> 43:12.060]  and I know how to bring them down.
[43:12.060 --> 43:13.620]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[43:13.620 --> 43:15.980]  I can't do it without your support.
[43:15.980 --> 43:18.300]  And the good news is we're only under
[43:18.300 --> 43:20.620]  about $200,000 a month.
[43:20.620 --> 43:23.220]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[43:23.220 --> 43:25.260]  on every front, but I'm not gonna back down.
[43:25.260 --> 43:27.260]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[43:27.260 --> 43:29.100]  So please keep me on the field.
[43:29.100 --> 43:30.740]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy
[43:30.740 --> 43:32.540]  while getting great products at the same time
[43:32.540 --> 43:34.260]  that will empower you and your family.

[43:52.660 --> 43:53.860]  Now take action.
[43:53.860 --> 43:56.860]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[44:00.380 --> 44:02.820]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[44:02.820 --> 44:05.340]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[44:05.340 --> 44:07.700]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[44:07.700 --> 44:09.540]  I was barely holding on to a job,
[44:09.540 --> 44:12.140]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.780]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[44:14.780 --> 44:16.660]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[44:16.660 --> 44:19.020]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[44:19.020 --> 44:20.860]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[44:20.860 --> 44:22.740]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[44:22.740 --> 44:25.940]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[44:25.940 --> 44:29.100]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[44:29.100 --> 44:30.500]  You know, I could think again,
[44:30.500 --> 44:32.340]  I could connect with people again,
[44:32.340 --> 44:35.140]  and over the course of the next couple of years,
[44:35.140 --> 44:37.780]  I got my health back and I religiously took basically
[44:37.780 --> 44:38.740]  all of your supplements.
[44:38.740 --> 44:41.140]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[44:41.140 --> 44:42.980]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[44:42.980 --> 44:45.180]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[44:45.180 --> 44:46.460]  It's amazing, it works.
[44:46.460 --> 44:49.060]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[44:49.060 --> 44:51.540]  We have to break free of the globalist system,
[44:51.540 --> 44:54.100]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[44:54.100 --> 44:55.180]  into our own hands.
[44:55.180 --> 44:56.380]  Beautifully said, brother.
[44:56.380 --> 44:58.620]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[44:58.620 --> 45:02.860]  So, when I first started taking survival shield,
[45:02.860 --> 45:05.380]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[45:05.380 --> 45:07.740]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[45:07.740 --> 45:09.500]  I was barely holding onto a job,
[45:09.500 --> 45:12.220]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[45:12.220 --> 45:14.820]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[45:14.820 --> 45:16.700]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[45:16.700 --> 45:18.740]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that,
[45:18.740 --> 45:20.900]  you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[45:20.900 --> 45:22.740]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[45:22.740 --> 45:25.940]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[45:25.940 --> 45:29.100]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.

[45:38.980 --> 45:41.140]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.

[46:54.780 --> 46:56.780]  with massive, massive savings.
[47:01.780 --> 47:04.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[47:04.580 --> 47:08.180]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.940]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here.
[47:14.940 --> 47:18.060]  And let me just kind of correct myself a little bit.
[47:18.060 --> 47:21.780]  The golden sombrero is four strikeouts in a game.
[47:21.780 --> 47:24.060]  The platinum sombrero is five.
[47:24.060 --> 47:26.020]  And the reason why I correct myself
[47:26.020 --> 47:28.740]  is because Kevin McCarthy is about to be wearing
[47:28.740 --> 47:29.940]  the golden sombrero.
[47:31.460 --> 47:33.500]  And there's another beautiful thing happening,
[47:33.500 --> 47:35.980]  which I don't like this, I wish this wasn't the case,
[47:35.980 --> 47:37.500]  but it's kind of good news.
[47:38.780 --> 47:41.740]  Folks, this political movement,
[47:42.580 --> 47:44.620]  whatever you want to call it, the Great Awakening,
[47:44.620 --> 47:47.180]  the Great Renaissance, America First,
[47:47.180 --> 47:50.260]  Common Sense, us just paying attention,
[47:50.260 --> 47:53.100]  it's now officially outgrown Donald Trump.
[47:54.140 --> 47:57.020]  It's now officially become bigger than Donald Trump.
[47:57.020 --> 47:58.460]  And it's not that we broke from Trump,
[47:58.460 --> 48:01.820]  Trump kind of broke from us in different ways,
[48:03.300 --> 48:05.260]  maybe smaller ways that we could forgive
[48:05.260 --> 48:09.780]  while he was in office and try to understand
[48:09.780 --> 48:13.100]  the spending bills, the debt and some other such stuff.
[48:13.100 --> 48:14.780]  But then when the vaccine, it was like,
[48:14.780 --> 48:19.780]  well, was some of the inaction, it was like, I don't know.
[48:19.780 --> 48:21.300]  And now with this McCarthy thing,
[48:21.300 --> 48:26.300]  it's kind of like Strike Three, hmm, you're out.
[48:30.660 --> 48:33.260]  But you know what, you hate to see that.
[48:34.300 --> 48:36.540]  Trump was a great, and is a great fighter for America,
[48:36.540 --> 48:39.380]  but I think that the thing we're seeing now,
[48:39.380 --> 48:42.260]  the phenomenon is that this America First,
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.420]  Great Awakening, Great Renaissance,
[48:45.500 --> 48:48.500]  taking our country back from the corrupt corporate DC
[48:48.500 --> 48:52.260]  interests has now officially gotten bigger than Donald Trump.
[48:53.380 --> 48:54.780]  And it's to a point where I guess
[48:54.780 --> 48:56.580]  we really just don't even need him.
[48:56.580 --> 48:58.460]  But there it is, I mean, I wasn't gonna get ahead of it,
[48:58.460 --> 49:00.100]  folks, but I think there it is.
[49:00.100 --> 49:03.580]  I think Kevin McCarthy, there we got a nice,
[49:03.580 --> 49:06.580]  a nice big beautiful golden sombrero.
[49:06.580 --> 49:08.940]  Okay, let me tell you, Kevin, I supported you,
[49:08.940 --> 49:11.060]  I tried my best.
[49:11.060 --> 49:15.340]  But the same paint that we put on the Trump jet,
[49:15.340 --> 49:17.180]  you've seen the jumbo jet with my name on it,
[49:17.180 --> 49:18.260]  it's big, it's beautiful.
[49:18.260 --> 49:19.300]  It's gold.
[49:19.300 --> 49:22.620]  And now we have the same color scheme
[49:22.620 --> 49:25.220]  for a nice sombrero for you, Kevin, okay?
[49:25.220 --> 49:27.460]  You've embarrassed me enough, Kevin.
[49:27.460 --> 49:29.660]  Kevin, I have to move on from you now.
[49:29.660 --> 49:31.900]  You're not like Kevin McAllister,
[49:31.900 --> 49:34.540]  you're Kevin McCarthy, okay?
[49:34.540 --> 49:37.140]  Kevin McAllister we love, madam, nice young man.
[49:37.140 --> 49:40.380]  Kevin McCarthy, golden sombrero, loser, okay?
[49:40.380 --> 49:43.420]  We're gonna give, now I'm a little embarrassed,
[49:43.420 --> 49:47.740]  I shouldn't have put my support behind such a loser.
[49:47.740 --> 49:50.820]  Four-time loser, Kevin McCarthy,
[49:50.820 --> 49:54.660]  with a big, beautiful golden sombrero.
[49:54.660 --> 49:56.540]  You went over for four, Kevin,
[49:56.540 --> 49:59.540]  that's a golden sombrero now, okay?
[49:59.540 --> 50:03.140]  I'm embarrassed and I need to think about maybe
[50:03.140 --> 50:06.700]  throwing my support behind the great Byron Donalds,
[50:06.700 --> 50:08.860]  right here in Florida, okay?
[50:08.860 --> 50:11.460]  McCarthy, you've embarrassed me.
[50:11.460 --> 50:18.260]  Here's a nice, big, beautiful golden sombrero.
[50:18.260 --> 50:22.540]  Yeah, I think it's official, folks.
[50:22.540 --> 50:27.460]  The golden sombrero to be placed upon Kevin McCarthy's head.
[50:30.900 --> 50:34.980]  I would like, this would be so beautiful.
[50:34.980 --> 50:38.900]  It could be a Matt Gaetz staffer or something.
[50:38.900 --> 50:41.020]  Somebody needs to go find a sombrero,
[50:41.020 --> 50:43.740]  spray paint that sucker gold,
[50:43.740 --> 50:49.100]  and put it on Kevin McCarthy's door in his office,
[50:49.100 --> 50:51.420]  or put it in front of the speaker office,
[50:51.420 --> 50:52.980]  which he's squatting in right now.
[50:52.980 --> 50:55.660]  Somebody, please, this is too beautiful,
[50:55.660 --> 50:57.340]  this is too much fun for the country,
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.940]  this is how you get people on board,
[50:58.940 --> 51:00.380]  this is how you get people interested,
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.420]  this is how you get people activated.
[51:02.420 --> 51:04.940]  I'm telling you, political genius,
[51:04.940 --> 51:07.300]  political genius from Matt Gaetz.
[51:07.300 --> 51:11.060]  It's such a great thing to watch.
[51:11.060 --> 51:15.620]  But aside from the political brilliance of the move,
[51:15.620 --> 51:17.820]  the thing that's really encouraging
[51:17.820 --> 51:19.660]  is the breaking from the establishment
[51:19.660 --> 51:21.940]  and the not looking back.
[51:21.940 --> 51:27.780]  That's what is really the beautiful thing about this.
[51:27.780 --> 51:29.540]  But please, if anybody working,
[51:29.540 --> 51:32.180]  if anybody working in the Capitol today,
[51:32.180 --> 51:35.300]  a Matt Gaetz staffer or a Bober staffer or something,
[51:35.300 --> 51:37.380]  you guys are about to get a nice big raise,
[51:37.380 --> 51:38.940]  so why don't you work for that,
[51:38.940 --> 51:43.220]  go get a sombrero, spray paint that sucker gold,
[51:43.220 --> 51:47.620]  and put it on Kevin McCarthy's doorknob to his office,
[51:47.620 --> 51:51.740]  or put it on his door, I mean, it's just so beautiful.
[51:51.740 --> 51:54.780]  He's gonna get the gold at sombrero.
[51:54.780 --> 51:57.580]  Guys, I wish, I'm telling you, I may have to,
[51:57.580 --> 52:00.300]  I'll come find it in the break, but I'm telling you,
[52:00.300 --> 52:05.300]  Kevin McCarthy was telling journalists and reporters,
[52:05.300 --> 52:11.940]  Kevin McCarthy was telling journalists and reporters
[52:11.940 --> 52:13.180]  that he had the votes.
[52:13.180 --> 52:16.900]  He was telling them this since November.
[52:16.900 --> 52:19.900]  He never had the votes.
[52:19.900 --> 52:21.580]  He never had the votes.
[52:21.580 --> 52:22.900]  Did he even try?
[52:22.900 --> 52:24.260]  Like, did he even try to count?
[52:24.260 --> 52:25.300]  Can he not do math?
[52:25.300 --> 52:28.900]  I mean, was he just lying?
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.180]  He never had the votes.
[52:30.180 --> 52:34.780]  He was walking around the Capitol in November and December,
[52:34.780 --> 52:37.060]  telling reporters he had the votes.
[52:37.060 --> 52:38.860]  He never had the votes,
[52:38.860 --> 52:43.820]  and he's about to wear the golden sombrero.
[52:43.820 --> 52:47.460]  So, but see, even though I'm happy with this,
[52:47.460 --> 52:52.180]  it just shows you how ludicrous our politicians are,
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.900]  that they just think they can do whatever they want.
[52:54.900 --> 52:57.380]  How do you do this four times?
[52:57.380 --> 52:58.740]  How do you do this four times?
[52:58.740 --> 53:01.340]  It should have never even happened once.
[53:01.340 --> 53:04.060]  I mean, that right there alone shows you
[53:04.060 --> 53:07.140]  why Kevin McCarthy shouldn't be the speaker.
[53:07.140 --> 53:09.820]  He shouldn't have lost one vote.
[53:09.820 --> 53:11.020]  He's lost four.
[53:16.860 --> 53:21.260]  This is like if I'm trying to get into a crawl space
[53:21.260 --> 53:23.740]  or something, where there's this thing in St. Louis called
[53:23.740 --> 53:25.580]  the City Museum, and they have all these different,
[53:25.580 --> 53:26.620]  like, crawl spaces.
[53:26.620 --> 53:27.460]  It's this big thing.
[53:27.460 --> 53:28.980]  I love to crawl through it and play games in it.
[53:28.980 --> 53:29.820]  It's pretty cool.
[53:29.820 --> 53:30.660]  I remember as a kid.
[53:30.660 --> 53:32.980]  But this is like me trying to go into that now as an adult
[53:32.980 --> 53:35.980]  and not being able to squeeze through a tree
[53:35.980 --> 53:39.220]  that you can climb into, and I have to get helped out,
[53:39.220 --> 53:41.500]  and then I try to squeeze into it again,
[53:41.500 --> 53:42.820]  and then I have to get pulled out,
[53:42.820 --> 53:44.820]  and then I go in for a third time,
[53:44.820 --> 53:46.340]  and by then people would probably be saying,
[53:46.340 --> 53:47.780]  okay, what's wrong with this guy?
[53:47.780 --> 53:49.100]  He knows you can't fit in there.
[53:49.100 --> 53:50.060]  Why did you try to go in?
[53:50.060 --> 53:52.820]  And then I go in for the fourth time.
[53:52.820 --> 53:54.020]  Now you're just insane.
[53:54.020 --> 53:56.260]  Now you just need to be committed.
[53:56.260 --> 53:58.700]  The Golden Sombrero is coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.740]  Meanwhile,
[54:03.060 --> 54:04.820]  Florida is where woke goes to die.
[54:04.820 --> 54:07.060]  Governor Ron DeSantis sworn in for second term.
[54:07.060 --> 54:09.980]  Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis is just soaring.
[54:09.980 --> 54:14.140]  Just soaring above and all like an eagle, like a hawk.
[54:15.540 --> 54:19.980]  Just soaring, just flying, not even being distracted by it,
[54:19.980 --> 54:21.760]  not even looking down at it.
[54:21.760 --> 54:24.440]  Very impressive from Ron DeSantis.
[54:26.760 --> 54:29.000]  I'm very impressed by Ron DeSantis.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.160]  I'm not worried about this.
[54:30.160 --> 54:32.440]  Oh, look, he liked Bush 10 years ago.
[54:32.440 --> 54:33.760]  Give me a break.
[54:36.680 --> 54:38.600]  Ron DeSantis, I like it.
[54:38.600 --> 54:41.760]  Just soaring above all of it, like a golden hawk.
[54:42.760 --> 54:45.240]  Not even distracted, not even bothered,
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.040]  not even, no, just doing his thing.
[54:48.040 --> 54:50.000]  Florida, where woke goes to die.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.960]  Florida, where woke goes to die.
[54:54.040 --> 54:55.920]  So there's that going on.
[54:58.480 --> 55:02.200]  So this is an interesting thing to witness.
[55:02.200 --> 55:04.600]  I think it's a positive thing.
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.880]  I think if you're Kevin McCarthy, you're embarrassed.
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.000]  I think if you're the mainstream establishment
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.040]  conservative media, you're embarrassed.
[55:12.040 --> 55:13.720]  If you're the GOP establishment,
[55:13.720 --> 55:16.320]  the Republican donor class, you're embarrassed.
[55:16.320 --> 55:18.600]  If you're Kevin McCarthy, you're embarrassed.
[55:18.600 --> 55:21.080]  But you should be.
[55:21.080 --> 55:22.760]  You thought you could beat me, the people.
[55:22.760 --> 55:24.440]  You thought you could tell us what to think,
[55:24.440 --> 55:27.900]  what to do, how to decide our politics and our policies.
[55:27.900 --> 55:30.720]  You've done nothing for us and we're done with you
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.440]  and we're not looking back and we finally have
[55:32.440 --> 55:35.680]  some representation in the house that feels the same way.
[55:39.800 --> 55:43.100]  So I see it all as a good thing.
[55:43.100 --> 55:44.520]  The vote is ongoing, folks.
[55:44.520 --> 55:49.520]  We will probably have a final tally by the next
[55:51.240 --> 55:52.780]  10 or 20 minutes here.
[55:54.080 --> 55:55.240]  It's gonna be right down to it,
[55:55.240 --> 55:57.200]  but I don't think he's going to have the vote.
[55:57.200 --> 56:02.120]  So unless there's a Democrat or two that votes for McCarthy,
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.000]  I don't think he's gonna get the votes here.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.320]  And so now you have a golden sombrero wearing Kevin McCarthy.
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.280]  If he doesn't renounce it or if he doesn't remove himself
[56:13.280 --> 56:14.640]  and say, I'm not gonna do this anymore,
[56:14.640 --> 56:16.400]  then he's just a total embarrassment
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.800]  and the exact swamp alligator that Matt Gaetz warned us about.
[56:23.480 --> 56:26.760]  But so how can any Republican keep doing this,
[56:28.200 --> 56:31.840]  this fuel exercise, how can any Republican
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.720]  keep engaging in this insanity?
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.680]  Don't even tell me McCarthy will go
[56:40.680 --> 56:44.240]  for the platinum sombrero. We'll have it all for you
[56:44.240 --> 56:46.280]  right here on the Alex Jones show if he does.
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.120]  First hour in the books, what an exciting hour it was.
[56:49.120 --> 56:50.200]  I'm telling you, I'm excited.
[56:50.200 --> 56:52.120]  This isn't, we're not acting up here, folks.
[56:52.120 --> 56:54.120]  This is a great thing to see.
[56:54.120 --> 56:57.120]  Finally, we have some breaking from the establishment
[56:57.120 --> 57:00.080]  with these House Republicans.
[57:00.080 --> 57:01.320]  And here's the thing too, folks.
[57:01.320 --> 57:02.920]  You gotta understand, there've been good people
[57:02.920 --> 57:04.120]  in the Republican Party before.
[57:04.120 --> 57:05.760]  There've been good people in the House before,
[57:05.760 --> 57:09.360]  but they've always been too afraid or too threatened
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.280]  or too connected or whatever to make this break
[57:12.280 --> 57:14.040]  from the establishment and not look back.
[57:14.040 --> 57:16.320]  We finally have it now.
[57:16.320 --> 57:18.560]  We finally have it now and we're about to see
[57:18.560 --> 57:23.200]  just how concrete and just how dug in it is.
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.160]  But I think it's gonna, I think it's gonna spur
[57:25.160 --> 57:27.760]  a new movement for other Republicans to say,
[57:27.760 --> 57:30.240]  boy, you know, I bought into this whole McCarthy thing
[57:30.240 --> 57:33.680]  and it was not what I was told it was.
[57:33.680 --> 57:35.600]  Maybe these guys over here got the right idea.
[57:35.600 --> 57:36.760]  All right, hour one in the book.
[57:36.760 --> 57:40.840]  Remember, folks, infowarstore.com, it's your support
[57:40.840 --> 57:43.040]  at infowarstore.com, buying the great supplements
[57:43.040 --> 57:45.120]  that keeps us on the air.
[57:49.920 --> 57:52.080]  There is a war on for your mind.
[57:52.080 --> 57:53.880]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[57:53.880 --> 57:55.880]  This is an information war.
[57:55.880 --> 58:00.640]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.120]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis
[58:04.120 --> 58:07.600]  or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms
[58:07.600 --> 58:10.960]  that Infowars has popularized because we understand
[58:10.960 --> 58:13.480]  the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[58:13.480 --> 58:15.960]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy
[58:15.960 --> 58:18.320]  to fund with great products that empower you

[58:27.960 --> 58:30.360]  We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money,

[58:32.440 --> 58:34.600]  you are literally, nonviolently, politically,
[58:34.600 --> 58:37.080]  punching the new world order in the nose,
[58:37.080 --> 58:39.400]  punching their lies in the nose.
[58:39.400 --> 58:41.240]  We are gonna defeat the new world order.
[58:41.240 --> 58:42.400]  We're going over the top,
[58:42.400 --> 58:43.840]  and right now is the critical juncture,
[58:43.840 --> 58:47.000]  so please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[58:47.000 --> 58:47.840]  Donate now.
[58:50.240 --> 58:52.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching
[58:52.200 --> 58:55.560]  the most powerful supplements in the history of Infowars
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.400]  under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[58:59.400 --> 59:01.360]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.240]  you see in front of you are already number one bestsellers
[59:05.240 --> 59:07.600]  in the market for the last few years
[59:07.600 --> 59:09.040]  because they work so well.
[59:09.040 --> 59:10.800]  We've gone right to the manufacturer,
[59:10.800 --> 59:13.000]  who are listeners, the owners of fan,
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.960]  and they've given us this huge deal off of retail,
[59:15.960 --> 59:18.800]  40% off what these products are found for
[59:18.800 --> 59:20.800]  under other names.
[59:20.800 --> 59:22.600]  And not just under one name,
[59:22.600 --> 59:25.400]  they sell these under three or four other brands
[59:25.400 --> 59:28.160]  that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[59:28.160 --> 59:32.680]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[59:32.680 --> 59:34.560]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[59:34.560 --> 59:37.240]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[59:37.240 --> 59:40.080]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[59:40.080 --> 59:41.840]  These things are incredible.
[59:41.840 --> 59:43.880]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less
[59:43.880 --> 59:46.680]  when you first do and consult your healthcare provider
[59:46.680 --> 59:47.800]  because they're so powerful.
[59:47.800 --> 59:49.440]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[59:53.200 --> 59:55.680]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[59:55.680 --> 59:58.360]  you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.400]  So you asked about the vaccine status
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.560]  of a young NFL football player
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.720]  that has a cardiac arrest on the field
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.720]  and needs nine minutes of CPR.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.800]  And they say, how dare you ask?
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.200]  But they demanded that you take the vax
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.320]  and prove your vax status with your little vaccine passport
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.920]  just to go have dinner, go to work, travel, movies, ball games.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.840]  But then, oh, you're curious about that player.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.560]  No, you're not allowed to ask those questions.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.920]  Which, hey, I'm all for consistency.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.720]  Medical privacy is medical privacy.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.400]  But it's the ones that wanted to violate your medical privacy
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.280]  and your medical freedom
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.240]  that are now telling you how dare you ask.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.320]  How dare you?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.400]  Now, the censorship on Facebook,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.160]  and by the way, we're gonna get into the Twitter files
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.280]  later today addressing the censorship,
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.800]  but the hashtag died suddenly in response
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.880]  to the vaccine deaths.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.320]  The hashtag died suddenly, trending hashtag,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.440]  has now been banned from Facebook.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.280]  You can't use it.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.720]  And if you search for it, it bans your search results.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.720]  Facebook covering up the vaccine injuries.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.640]  Now, this is an incredible story developing
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.000]  for Demar Hamlin, who, as I've explained,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.480]  was on pace to be, and still is, I would say.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.640]  He probably should win it this year, actually.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.680]  There's a lot of deserving men.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.720]  But Demar Hamlin, maybe Walter Payton Man of the Year
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.600]  for this one, such a positive impact
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.400]  on the community around him.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.320]  As he is still in intensive care and on life support,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.360]  last I checked, more than six and a half million dollars
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.120]  has been raised in his name for his charity,
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.400]  which was already doing amazing work in local communities.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.440]  And now, with more than six and a half million dollars
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.080]  to work with, surely is gonna expand
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.800]  and do even more great work.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.200]  And the numbers are just gonna keep coming in.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.080]  So many professional football players and big CEOs
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.000]  and business owners have donated money.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.800]  Robert Kraft and the New England Patriots
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.320]  donate $18,003 with the three for his number.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.640]  Matthew Stafford, Russell Wilson, Tom Brady,
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.320]  Devonte Adams, Carpet Man flooring.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.880]  I mean, the list just goes on.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.240]  The number is gonna keep growing.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.760]  It was six and a half million this morning when I checked.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.080]  So I would expect, it's probably closer to seven now.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.840]  That's, I mean, wow, a guy who is so positive
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.680]  for his community, so positive for the people around him.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.440]  So good at making the world a better place
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.800]  that even as he lies with his life and the balance,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.200]  he's continuing to improve the world around him.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.440]  That's just, oh, what an incredible story that is.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.880]  And big ups to everybody being a part of it.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.040]  It's amazing what humanity can do
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.240]  when we come together for something good.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.240]  And then they lit up Niagara Falls last night,
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.400]  blue for support of DeMar Hamlin.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.320]  And it was a pretty amazing spectacle to see.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.480]  Niagara Falls already an incredible spectacle.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.560]  And then they're able to do some stuff with the lighting
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.560]  to just make it even more beautiful
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.880]  and lit blue last night for prayers for DeMar Hamlin.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.520]  And it will be lit again tonight, by the way.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.980]  They do this quite frequently, I suppose.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.240]  Tonight Niagara Falls will be illuminated blue
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.240]  to pay tribute to OPP officer, Greggers Pershala,
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.520]  who was fatally shot in the line of duty,
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.880]  sending our condolences to this young man's family,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.080]  all affected by this tragedy.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.320]  So an officer falling in the line of duty
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.920]  going to be remembered tonight with the blue Niagara Falls.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.600]  Now, there have been disagreements here.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.680]  In fact, I've got a doctor coming up in the next segment.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.400]  I'm not sure his take on all this.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.160]  He may agree or disagree with me.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.880]  It's perfectly healthy to have a debate.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880]  It's perfectly healthy to disagree with somebody.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.160]  Doesn't mean you have to hate them.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.800]  Still break bread.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.520]  Tom Ren's disagreed with me yesterday.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.840]  Harrison Smith on the American Journal this morning
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.960]  disagreed with me.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.640]  That's fine, I don't take that personally, they disagree.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.680]  That's their opinion.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.880]  Leading anti-COVID vaccine lawyer responds
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.520]  to NFL players cardiac arrest event
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.920]  during Monday night football.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.880]  Now, I think the Gateway Punnett, Jim Hoff,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.200]  the great guys over there probably disagree with me
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.360]  with headlines like this.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.720]  With roughly 1.7 million NFL hits in the last 50 years,
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.000]  why have we never seen an arrhythmia cardiac arrest before?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  And the answer might be
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.880]  because you've never had the COVID vaccines before.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.320]  But this is a freak event.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.640]  And who was I telling you had a similar event?
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.280]  Chris Pronger. Now, there's millions of times
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.920]  that hockey players have been hit by pucks
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.480]  and they've never had a cardiac event.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.920]  Why was it only Chris Pronger?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.720]  Because it's a freak event that very rarely happens.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.080]  And Chris Pronger even tweeted that out just last night
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.840]  saying, this is what happened to me.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.240]  So was I proven right?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.640]  Maybe the doctor will say.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.560]  You wanna beat the New World Order?
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.400]  You wanna stop their globalist agenda?
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.760]  Well, so do I.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.200]  And I've been the most effective individual
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.760]  in the fight against the globalist
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.600]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.160]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.520]  I can't do it without your support.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.840]  And the good news is we're only under
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.200]  about $200,000 a month.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.760]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.840]  on every front, but I'm not gonna back down
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.800]  and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.640]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.280]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.080]  while getting great products at the same time
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.800]  that will empower you and your family.

[01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:19.360]  The Globalist are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:27.920]  Now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.440]  All right, quickly it appears as we've said,
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.320]  Ken McCarthy is going to be wearing the golden sombrero
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.360]  very shortly with the votes coming in.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.600]  We'll continue to monitor that,
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.800]  but it looks like it's gonna be the same result
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.680]  unless a shock group of Democrats votes McCarthy.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.720]  He's gonna be wearing the golden sombrero.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.440]  It'll be official in about 10 minutes.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.280]  We'll be continuing to monitor that situation.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.920]  Now joining me now is Dr. Paul E. Alexander.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.040]  I'm not even gonna get into his huge resume here.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.680]  Very impressive.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.720]  And you can follow him palexander.substack.com
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.560]  for all of his news.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.720]  Now I said, hey, let's get a doctor on to respond
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.120]  to the football player collapsing on the field
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.960]  with cardiac arrest, let's hear from a doctor.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.120]  And so Dr. Alexander joins me.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.960]  Doctor, upon seeing the event, seeing the contact,
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.600]  obviously seeing the response
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.840]  since the Monday night football game,
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.160]  what is your conclusion about this cardiac event?
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.560]  And how do you analyze kind of the commentary
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.600]  surrounding it, Dr. Alexander?
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.960]  Hi, so thanks very much for having me.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.240]  It's an honor and a privilege.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.920]  I've been on Alex's show before.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.720]  So I'm speaking to you now as an academic scientist.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.080]  I did work for the Trump administration prior
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.560]  and the reality about it is that
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.160]  when we, based on the uncertainty so far,
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.920]  based on the fact that the Bill's organization reported
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.640]  about 100% vaccination of his players,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.840]  I think maybe just a quarterback, Josh Allen,
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.600]  reported he did not.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.360]  We think that the most likely diagnosis right now
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.000]  from the uncertainty that we have
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  is vaccine-induced myocardial scarring
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.040]  from some sort of prior COVID injection
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.440]  led to a high adrenaline arrhythmia episode
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.920]  that caused the cardiac arrest.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.840]  And we can't, as a differential diagnosis,
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.200]  again, you can't rule it out.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.200]  And post these shots, this gene injection,
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.080]  you've had a lot of myocarditis, pericarditis, et cetera.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.960]  So it is a serious, serious consideration
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.120]  and the fact that his heart stopped
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.240]  a second time on arrival to the hospital
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.400]  based on reporting, it raises the possibility
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.520]  that we are looking at potentially
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.800]  that he had what we call silent myocarditis
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.200]  that they didn't understand the extent of his damage
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.800]  and with the exertion, with the exertion on the field,
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.200]  with the flood of adrenaline, et cetera,
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.840]  onto a damaged heart that's scarred,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.280]  that puts too much pressure and stress on the heart
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  and you could suffer cardiac arrest and die.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.840]  So yeah, we don't have all of the information,
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.800]  but they rushed off with this commercial cordous diagnosis
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.200]  when they, just like myself as an academic scientist,
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.120]  sitting back, I'm looking on to,
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.800]  and I'm trying to bring all of the studies
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.400]  and science together to understand this,
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.680]  but they had no better vantage point.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.080]  So all of those CNN and media, television, medical experts,
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.280]  and even some in our own freedom fighting movement
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.200]  who kind of recoiled and slinked away,
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.600]  left people like myself and McCullough on the front,
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.000]  trying to bring the vaccine situation
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.720]  back into the discussion, because you cannot,
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.920]  you cannot have this discussion without the potential
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.440]  that the vaccine, and all of those players on that field,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.520]  all NFL players today must demand
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.320]  that they will not take the field
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.400]  without a proper test of myocarditis,
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.200]  because if they took the vaccine,
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.000]  they may have silent myocarditis
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  and they could fall on that field too.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.240]  Is that serious?
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.880]  Yeah, I completely agree,
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.920]  and I think that's the big reckoning moment
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.480]  that the NFL is afraid to have here,
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.760]  and it's actually kind of a disgusting approach
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.160]  the way the NFL is taking this,
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.400]  because my guess is we already know
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.240]  they obviously don't want to talk about this.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.720]  They don't like talking about the concussion issues,
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.520]  the mental health issues that have been going on
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.200]  with NFL football players long before this vaccine issue,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.760]  and so how they deal with this, quite frankly,
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.200]  I think they're waiting to see what happens this week
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.600]  with the individual in intensive care, Hamlin,
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.680]  and they're gonna kind of just wait and see this one out
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.080]  instead of just coming out telling the truth
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.320]  and making the right decision,
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.240]  which would be the suggestion that you just made,
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.400]  they don't wanna do that, too much hangs in the balance.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.520]  I think they're waiting for an outcome here,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.960]  and then they're gonna test the waters maybe on Friday,
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.520]  I mean, again, with the situation here,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.440]  it's gotta be tough for the next snap
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.640]  that goes off on the NFL.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.840]  I mean, the next snap is gonna be
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.520]  one of the most controversial snaps in NFL history.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.680]  Now, here's my question.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.360]  Could we have a situation where
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.840]  do you think the
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.920]  Codio Cordis is an increased risk
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.840]  if you have a clot or if you have myocarditis?
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.600]  Could that be the situation here that it's an increased risk
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.920]  or maybe it was the freak accident and that happened,
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.240]  but the myocarditis or a clot could have made it worse?
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.720]  Or do you think this is a situation
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.280]  that could happen potentially to anybody
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.040]  that took a vaccine that's doing strenuous activity
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.880]  and maybe it wasn't the Codio Cordis at all,
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.240]  but this was just heavily exerted, big tackle,
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.720]  whether it was the impact it did or not,
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.920]  he's breathing heavily, he's exerting himself.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.040]  Do you think it could have been a combination of the two
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.880]  or do you think, no, this is just anybody
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.400]  who's had a vaccine with myocarditis,
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.080]  this could happen to you in any time?
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.560]  Well, you are a brilliant individual,
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.920]  how you tee that up,
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.960]  and the way I'm listening to the nuance in your statement,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.920]  and I think you understand the issue.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.320]  Dr. Peter McCullough wrote a brilliant sub-stack
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  in the past and myself on this issue of dying a dawn,
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.560]  dying suddenly a dawn, where we are seeing this rash,
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.000]  to answer your question,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.880]  we are seeing this rash of deaths in persons in their sleep
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.160]  as they're waking in the morning and we are very confused
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.400]  and we are connecting the dots
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.440]  for the medical community here and for the public
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.680]  so that you can ask the right questions.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.760]  It's kind of paradoxical in a sense
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.520]  that there's a flood of what we call catecholamines,
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.840]  which are like adrenaline, dopamine, epinephrine,
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.000]  norepinephrine into the bloodstream
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.400]  when you exercise and exude yourself.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.640]  That's like the players on the field,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.120]  but those catecholamines also get released
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.280]  as you are rising from sleep
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.320]  because it lifts the breathing rate,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.000]  it lifts the blood pressure,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.760]  it lifts your heart rate, et cetera,
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.440]  because you are waking up.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.080]  We are arguing that those instances
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.360]  where people died in their sleep,
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.680]  it's because they had silent myocarditis,
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.600]  so the heart tissue is scarred
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.800]  and then as they are waking
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.520]  and the flood of this dopamine adrenaline
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.560]  onto the scarred heart tissue
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.400]  puts too much stress on the heart
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400]  and the scar, the a caress and death.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.400]  Same situation on the field,
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.320]  when you exert yourself and those adrenalines,
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.000]  the dopamine epinephrine gets released,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.160]  there is too much stress on a myocardial damaged heart
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.640]  that is damaged and it puts too much stress
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.160]  and you get that cardiac arrest.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.720]  The reality is I also put a study,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.600]  a recent study we found I believe in 2021 was published
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.280]  that showed that a blow to the chest,
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.280]  a blow to the chest in an already damaged myocardial heart
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.280]  could cause cardiac death
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.200]  and we are trying to make the argument too
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.760]  and it's a very nuanced,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.400]  but it's very important.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.000]  I am trying to say,
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.640]  first of all, I wrote a stack recently
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.640]  on Alexander COVID-19 saying that Faisal Maduna
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.800]  killed a black American in our faces
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.720]  on national television.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.360]  That is the argument.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.440]  Yes, you might say, well, you brought your waistcard in this.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.240]  I am saying it is time for the NAACP
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.240]  and the black congressional caucus members to stand up.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.120]  Here's a black man.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.840]  He took an injection.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.920]  We are arguing that may have caused,
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.280]  this guy died on the field.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.040]  Let's be frank.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.880]  He died for 10 minutes in front of us.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.720]  He died.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.080]  You have to understand how I'm saying it
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.680]  and I'm trying to say and I'm true.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.080]  We are trying to color myself or squee.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.400]  We are trying to wake up the community to understand.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.280]  This is no joke.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.920]  It's a very serious thing that happened in front of us
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.960]  and the NFL, you are right to say.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.520]  And what we are saying is,
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.080]  this guy was probably experiencing cardiac arrest,
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.640]  absent of that hit.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.960]  In other words, the hit.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.440]  If somebody had walked up to him
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.000]  and give him a kiss on his cheek,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.400]  five seconds before he fell, he was still going to fall.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.320]  He had likely myocardial scarring
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.960]  from a prior COVID vaccine.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.440]  We need to know when was his last shot?
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.760]  Did he get boosted?
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.000]  We need to know this.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.240]  There's a lot of information we need to know.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.440]  We need to know was he ever tested for myocarditis, et cetera.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.520]  So this is no simple matter.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.440]  Yeah, and I think too, the issue of some big group
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.440]  is going to have to raise this issue,
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.640]  whether it's the NAACP,
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.520]  they'll try to ignore the frontline doctors
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.960]  as they have for the last two years.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.840]  But, I mean, folks, this is inevitable to happen again
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.800]  if they don't take these precautions.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.800]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.080]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.880]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880]  This is an information war.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.600]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.120]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.600]  or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.800]  that info wars has popularized
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.040]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.480]  and we know how to beat them.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.160]  But we can't do it without funding
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.600]  and we make it easy to fund with great products
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.320]  and power you and your immune system

[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.400]  punching their lies in the nose.

[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.400]  We're going over the top.

[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.360]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.960]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.640]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.560]  to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.200]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.040]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.320]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.200]  but we've got a real game changer now.

[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.800]  We're here with Dr. Paul E. Alexander.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.160]  Read his great work, palexander.substack.com
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:27.920]  and I've got a couple of questions here for the good doctor.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.840]  And I'm trying to decide where to start.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.320]  So let me kind of let's let me try to humanize
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.560]  this before I get into some of the more pressing questions
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.880]  that we have right now.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.240]  Just so we can all kind of have a better understanding
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:47.040]  because I know there were times where when I was playing
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.360]  sports through high school, I don't know if it ever
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.360]  happened as an adult, but I do remember a couple of times
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.080]  as a kid where you'd be running hard or something
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.680]  or I'd get kicked and hit in the chest with a sock
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.880]  and I'd be like, oh, I'm going to get kicked
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.160]  and hit in the chest with a soccer ball
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.600]  or I'd run into a fence to catch a baseball
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.720]  or something like that.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.840]  And you kind of get a little light headed
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.800]  and you almost kind of black out a little bit
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.840]  and maybe you even feel something in your chest
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.920]  for a second.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.440]  And then after a couple seconds, you kind of the light
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.280]  comes back and you kind of regain your balance
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.640]  and everything seems seems to be OK.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.320]  Maybe a lot of people have experienced that.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320]  Maybe athletes experience that.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.320]  Is that the kind of thing where this could have been
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.560]  innocent enough where you just kind of have a little moment
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.760]  of, oh, OK, I'm shaking up and then I'm OK.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.040]  But because of myocarditis or a potential fiberclot,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.560]  that moment of coming back and being OK never happens.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.320]  Well, look, here's how I would try and answer
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.880]  that question to you again.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.800]  And there's a lot of individual differences in people.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.600]  But the reality about it is if you look at that
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.120]  commotion cord is that they're trying to say happened.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.320]  It took a blow.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320]  Yes, got lightheaded, but it was enough
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.880]  to cause that kind of injury.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.440]  Remember, the data tells us, I was looking at some data
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.320]  last night that in the last 20 to 30 years in America,
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.120]  there were only 20 instances of this, less than one a year.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.400]  It is that rare, number one.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.320]  Number two, the age group that happens is generally kids
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.240]  like around 10, 12, 15 years old.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.600]  Early teen years, not generally his age.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:28.200]  Number three, that happens with like a projector,
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.880]  like a ball, a baseball, a cricket ball, a hockey
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.080]  park, direct blue to the chest.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.880]  And really, the data suggests to the left lower section
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.600]  of the chest.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.800]  This guy had proper protective padding from all we know.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.480]  He's an NFL player.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.840]  And the padding, the chest padding
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.000]  is such absorbed, those sorts of blue.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.880]  And no matter how many times you look at it,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.360]  you could see that, yeah, there was body intact.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.920]  But it doesn't come across.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.760]  I look at so much football.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.800]  I spent a lot of time in Buffalo, across the border in Niagara.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.600]  And I actually lived there.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.720]  And the reality is looking at it.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.240]  It doesn't look like a hit, a devastating hit,
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.560]  the way it's being described in the media.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.840]  Again, I'm trying to say that there is a potential,
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:23.320]  several potentials that this guy had myocarditis.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.480]  Silent and some myocardial scarring
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.680]  that was manifesting itself within the backdrop
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.240]  of the exertion of the game, the high adrenaline flood,
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.280]  onto a damaged scarred heart.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.120]  Myocardium was damaged.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.960]  That can cause cardiac arrest, as you saw.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.920]  In other words, I'm making the argument
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.800]  that he could have gone down absent of the hit,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.360]  that he was going down at that moment.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.440]  The hit happened.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.320]  That's why we saw him jump up.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.520]  If you look properly, he clapped his hands.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.920]  He was about to move away and go about his business,
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.160]  and then he fell.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.640]  So there's a temporal issue here, the timing.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:04.320]  Some say that it could be due to the hit.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.080]  I don't think we had that information.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.920]  Those who made that argument, the commercial courtes,
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.760]  those are television CNN-enept doctors, who it is those,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:19.200]  those people who are trying to avert your gaze
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.920]  and to stop the conversation and attacking me,
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.800]  attacking my collar, attacking us now as we are speaking,
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.840]  and raising the vaccine issue and a potential link.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.280]  These are the same people who for three years, three years,
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.760]  forced you to lock down, lied and deceived the public
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.520]  about these lock downs which showed us now,
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.080]  we have declared data to show that every single lock
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.720]  down fail, every school closure fail,
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.600]  every mass mandate fail, every business closure fail,
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.120]  to the tune, to the tune that people in America,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.720]  people who locked down businesses, who were laid off,
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.880]  children who were sent home, we had so many suicides.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:04.360]  People committed, took their lives from the hopelessness
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.400]  and the helplessness.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.760]  These same television doctors are now coming out to tell you,
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.920]  I believe nothing you say, I turn it off, CNN, MSNBC,
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.360]  even Fox at times I turn off, I come to Alex Jones.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.520]  I go to Alex Jones with Stu Peters.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.120]  I go to your forum to get my information,
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.000]  because at least you talk the truth.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.880]  Well, and here's part of that process too,
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.560]  because for full transparency,
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.800]  I still believe that it was the hit
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.280]  that led to the cardiac arrest.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.320]  I believe that personally, however,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.280]  I think that you're dealing with a situation
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.040]  where if he has a fibercloth that's five feet long
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.960]  in his body like other young football players
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.760]  have been discovered, or he does have myocarditis,
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.920]  that that's what made a bad situation worse.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.840]  I'm still of that belief, but we're willing
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.400]  to have the conversation, and that's the key difference here.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.800]  We're willing to have the conversation,
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.400]  it's the conversation that needs to be had,
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.120]  and here's where the conversation goes in my eyes, doctor,
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.680]  and I'd like to hear your thoughts on this,
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.160]  because I don't see how this goes any other way,
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.720]  but one of these two ways.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.920]  One, the NFL is gonna have to sit here
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.240]  and face a new reality that let's just say,
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.440]  this has nothing to do with the vaccine,
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.280]  or he wasn't vaccinated.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.680]  Well, now the NFL is gonna come out,
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.040]  and they're gonna have to say what is considered
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.600]  a routine tackle or a routine hit in the NFL
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.040]  is now potentially fatal.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.320]  Well, now all of a sudden we have to reevaluate
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.800]  the game altogether in ways that we haven't had to yet,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.160]  but we've kind of flirted with, with the concussion issues
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.200]  and the mental health problems and the suicides,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.560]  or as you suggested earlier, they're gonna have to be honest
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.840]  that the vaccine is gonna potentially lead
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.800]  to more cardiac events like this,
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.880]  and if they're not gonna be testing players' hearts,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.400]  this event happening again is inevitable.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:47.720]  Do you see any other path forward here for the NFL?
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.240]  Well, the way you laid it out again,
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.000]  I like how you critically think about these things,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.840]  and the way those two sides of it
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.640]  is what they're facing now and they're in a bind,
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.520]  because either which direction they're going to,
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.560]  they're gonna lose tremendous amounts of money.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.320]  That's the, the NFL doesn't care about the lives
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.520]  of these players.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.240]  Don't care what you saw on the field.
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.920]  Many of those players who you saw shedding tears
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.360]  is because they're vaccinated,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.200]  and these people are not stupid.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.160]  They're following Alex Jones too.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.440]  They're following me.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.640]  They're following McCullough, Rich, et cetera.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.040]  They're looking and reading.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.320]  These are critical thinking people.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.240]  Then they looked at him and realized that could be me next.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.040]  That's the issue.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.360]  A lot of those tears was for that.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.040]  So we really have a serious issue in the NFL right now
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040]  is that it's inflection point.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.120]  What it does next is critical.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.440]  They could destroy it complete.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.680]  Destroy the league complete.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.600]  How much they lie, how much they cover up,
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.560]  how much they mislead, they need the popul-
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.840]  Look, I'll end it.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.240]  I'll say it this way.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.720]  It is absolutely imperative.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.360]  It is incumbent on the NFL and the families of this guy,
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.240]  the Mar Hamlin.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.360]  They must tell the nation.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.600]  They must tell the NFL players across America,
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.960]  not just Buffalo Bill, what is his vaccine status?
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.560]  That is a key question.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.000]  Don't hide that because then people,
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.760]  other players can make informed decisions.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.200]  Well, if this guy was vaccinated,
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.400]  oh, and he took a booster last week, et cetera,
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.240]  we need that.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.320]  We knew the evidence that showed
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.760]  that if you have myocarditis,
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.400]  let's say this guy had silent myocarditis.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.680]  Medically, you are not supposed to engage
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.000]  in any physical exertion for six months.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Well, and I'll tell you what, we're about to come to a break
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.400]  and I've got one more question for you
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.400]  on the other side of it.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.720]  But here's what I think is so key
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.080]  about what you just analyzed,
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.360]  is that they postponed this game, folks.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.880]  The reports were that the NFL told them
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.520]  five minutes to get back on the field.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.080]  The players decided not to play.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.640]  Was that because they saw their player
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.080]  out on the field potentially dead
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.400]  or was that because they're worried
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.320]  my heart might give out next?
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.160]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.960]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.960]  This is an information war.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.960]  Info wars popularized those terms
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.680]  more than two decades ago.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.720]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.600]  or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone,
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.680]  they're all using the terms
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.880]  that info wars has popularized
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.120]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.560]  and we know how to beat them.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.240]  But we can't do it without funding
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.680]  and we make it easy to fund with great products
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.400]  and power you and your immune system

[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.000]  A one-time recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.400]  We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money,
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.440]  every time you buy products,
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.480]  every time you keep us on air,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.680]  you are literally nonviolently politically
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.120]  punching the new world order in the nose,
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.440]  punching their lies in the nose.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.320]  We are gonna defeat the new world order.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.480]  We're going over the top.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.920]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.120]  So please go to infowarstore.com
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.920]  and donate now, donate now, donate now, donate now.

[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.440]  You wanna stop their globalist agenda?
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.800]  Well, so do I.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.200]  And I've been the most affected individual
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.760]  in the fight against the globalist
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.640]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.200]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.560]  I can't do it without your support.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.080]  And the good news is,
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.200]  we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.800]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.840]  on every front, but I'm not gonna back down
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.840]  and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.680]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.320]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.120]  while getting great products at the same time
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.840]  that will empower you and your family.

[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400]  not part of it going towards product cost.

[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.440]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.800]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered

[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.280]  and energy levels, most men know that testosterone levels
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.240]  begin to decline starting around 30
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.120]  at a rate of about one to 2% per year.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.240]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy,
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.240]  low sex drive and muscle loss.

[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.680]  from the front lines of the info war.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.960]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.800]  All right, quick update on the speaker votes.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.800]  This is hilarious.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:34.000]  The Republican establishment, the conservative establishment
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.320]  media is all hemming and hawing, just how I expected.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.360]  Oh, it's so bad.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.280]  We need McCarthy.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.200]  Oh, it's so bad.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.080]  And even on Fox News, they say McCarthy
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.320]  appears to have lost the vote.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.520]  He lost.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.120]  Appears?
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.400]  No, he lost.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.960]  That's like them saying, remember,
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.760]  they called Arizona before a vote was cast.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.000]  So they'll call Arizona for the Democrat.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.840]  Biden before a vote is even tallied.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.280]  But, oh, McCarthy, after all the votes are tallied and lost,
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.680]  they say appears to have lost.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.880]  That's hilarious stuff.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.560]  We'll continue that coverage.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.000]  We'll see.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.920]  Now McCarthy is reportedly reaching across the aisle
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.320]  to Democrats looking for votes.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.080]  So I'm surprised he didn't do that last night,
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.760]  but it's being reported now.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.240]  Now back to Dr. Paul Alexander, DrPaulAlexander.com
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.200]  or his sub stack, pAlexander.substack.com.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.040]  Quickly, just finishing up on what I said last
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.240]  so you can respond to this.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:27.760]  It's never before seen in my life an NFL game
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.120]  postponed mid game.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.440]  They rarely even cancel them at all, folks.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.560]  Like, it never happens.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.440]  Whether anything, they have to play the games
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.880]  the way the schedule works.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.480]  And reportedly, the NFL said, take five minutes,
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.760]  get your teams ready, and get back on the field and play.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.840]  The players and coaches said, no more.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.200]  And so, of course, that's either because they
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.840]  saw their fellow player die on the field
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.880]  and that, how do you go play football after that?
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.120]  Or they're worried, could I be next?
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.360]  Maybe a little of both.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.240]  I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that,
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240]  Dr. Alexander.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.120]  Well, again, as an academic scientist,
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.160]  I'll tell you this, looking at all of the data,
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.720]  we've been looking at information since yesterday.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.040]  Sadly, sadly, you have to be honest with what we saw.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.880]  This guy for nine or 10 minutes died.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.120]  And modern medical technology, thank goodness,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120]  brought him back.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.960]  We heard that he died again.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.400]  I don't wait at the hospital or at the hospital.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.440]  This guy is very, very sick.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.640]  He's very, very ill.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.000]  And if it is the COVID gene injection,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.640]  the mRNA, DNA platform, did this.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.200]  They have serious questions now.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.760]  They have serious accountability.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.000]  The NFL, who mandated this 100% of the players, et cetera.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.680]  But the reality is, these players a lot of time
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.080]  as they're looking on, they must be shocked and stunned
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.200]  because we have reports over the last two years
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.880]  of soccer players across the world,
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.000]  high performance athletes just dropping dead
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.160]  on the field on the pitch.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.400]  So it's not the first time.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.960]  And everyone is just pretending.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.360]  These instances of people just suddenly dying.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.520]  And even, as I mentioned earlier, dying in your sleep,
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.800]  dying as you wake,
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.160]  there's a reason for that.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.520]  That this is a new phenomena,
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.800]  but we need to figure out why.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.800]  And in the common thread, here's the common thread.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.360]  They're looking on at him laying there.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.480]  The common thread that they all have in them
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.720]  that he had is a vaccine.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.160]  That's the common thread.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.880]  So they're not stupid people.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.800]  And the NFL could potentially be facing a situation
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.680]  where players refuse to take the field.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.040]  So how they handle this and the truth
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.760]  is very, very important.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.880]  And I think they're going to try and pretend
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.120]  that the vaccine, they might even confabulate
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.360]  that he took no vaccine.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.640]  That would be impossible for them to say now
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.080]  because the bills have been on record
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.320]  saying 100% vaccinated.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.000]  So it's not a fun, hilarious situation.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.200]  It's a drastic catastrophic situation.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.800]  And we need some leadership.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.240]  We need honesty.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:14.240]  Because if this vaccine did this to this player,
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.240]  then the other players, it is incumbent
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.000]  that they be told the truth.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.960]  So they can decide for the 10 million
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.840]  or whatever they're getting in salary,
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.640]  if they want that money or if they're gonna just retire.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.800]  And remember, so JJ what?
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.280]  Who's the top in his position?
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.880]  I believe he's 33, 32 or 33.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.040]  He had to be AFib.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040]  A couple of weeks ago, just before a game,
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.640]  he had to go to the EO.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.720]  They had to, his heart went into fibrillation,
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.600]  vaccinated, he retired instantly.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.720]  And he was at the top of the profession.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.840]  I mean, maybe now that he's a little bit older,
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.880]  maybe not the best, but when he was in his prime,
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.920]  he was the best and still a high performing athlete.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.240]  You think probably could have gone on
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.320]  if not for the potential vaccine side effects there,
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.520]  but I'm glad you brought that up
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.160]  because that brings me to my final question for you here.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.120]  And that's, we did see some NFL players
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.800]  have what appear to be vaccine side effects,
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.160]  but they were detected before something happened
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.000]  on the field.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.640]  A couple of players got sidelined.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.960]  A couple of players had medical procedures done
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.440]  with what are the top vaccine side effects?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.880]  The blood clots, the heart murmur type situations.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.000]  But when I look at the deaths that have come
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.440]  from the top side effects from the vaccines,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:33.360]  most of them appear to be in high school athletes
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.560]  and younger.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.000]  As you mentioned, the reason why Hamlin
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.240]  was able to survive this
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.760]  is because of the top medical care that he received.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.600]  Is that why we're seeing this mostly happening
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.440]  with younger athletes?
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.000]  Because they don't have that top tier medical care sitting
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.400]  right there sidelines at the field
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.360]  when they go into these events.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.600]  And so sadly, they don't have somebody there right there,
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.120]  professional teams getting on top of the situation
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.000]  within seconds.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.560]  Do you think maybe that's why most of the athletes
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.560]  and football players dying are younger ones?
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:06.360]  I think, again, you're on top of the money here.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.800]  The timing is key.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.800]  And the way the NFL or the Buffalo Bills
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.880]  emergency, the medical team responded was outstanding.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.840]  And they probably, not probably,
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.840]  they were the reason for him being,
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.840]  if he is alive right now, he's on a ventilator.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.840]  I wouldn't even say he's in a classic sense alive.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.640]  But that's going to have to be,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.560]  we're going to have to find out shortly.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.600]  But they did what they need to do to bring him back
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.800]  and to get his heart going from what the reporting says.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.240]  But remember, the science is showing us
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.000]  that the mRNA vaccine is served,
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.320]  that the delivery of the mRNA in the lipid nano,
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.600]  that particular platform,
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.000]  whether it's the Pfizer mRNA or the Moduna mRNA,
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.400]  both of them result in tremendous risk of myocarditis.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.040]  And the problem here is the myocarditis is silent.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.080]  But many times you get myocarditis vaccine related
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.680]  and even from infection, viral infection,
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.240]  even before this COVID situation came along,
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.760]  it could be silent.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.840]  And that's why many young people,
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.880]  when they got viral myocarditis in their lives,
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.760]  they said 15, whatever, you don't know.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.960]  Nobody ever tested it.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.880]  And then later, 40 years old,
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.560]  when your heart and the system is not compliant
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.200]  or as rigorous and robust as before,
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.480]  and you then exude yourself with some physical exercise,
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.960]  at that point, it's too much for the heart.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.480]  So to me, the issue is,
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.800]  the data is showing us that the Moduna shot
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.840]  is much more toxic than the Pfizer shot.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.360]  And the second shot is much more toxic than the full shot.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.720]  So it depends, to answer your Kev's question,
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.760]  it depends on how many shots they took,
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.160]  which one they took,
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.120]  but both Pfizer and Moduna are deadly
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.520]  from our examination of the data.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.360]  And also the issue is that that question of timing,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.800]  if there's a proper support,
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.840]  that would be defining the matter
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.840]  of whether someone lives or dies.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.720]  And that's why the issue of dying in your sleep,
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:24.080]  that subsequently wrote about dying just before dawn,
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.040]  is so important because if your heart stops
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.680]  and your partner, let's say,
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.560]  or you, a young person, you're in your bedroom,
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.720]  nobody knows, nobody could revive you
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.960]  and by the time they find you the next day, you're dead.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.960]  So it's a tragedy and we need honest answers.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.080]  We've been clamoring for two years now
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.760]  since they brought these gene injection platforms.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.320]  We've been clamoring that the data
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.120]  that Pfizer and Moduna presented to FDA
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.400]  to get the emergency use authorizations were flawed.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.880]  The methodology of the studies were flawed.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.000]  It was not properly safety tested.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  It was not even safety tested.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.120]  And the vaccine showed itself quickly
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.760]  to be highly ineffective,
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.000]  according to negative effectiveness territory,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.200]  means the vaccine doesn't work.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.320]  And it's harmful, myocarditis,
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.840]  paracarditis, blood clotting, bleeding,
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.200]  VITT, which is a paradoxical vaccine induced thrombotic,
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.160]  thrombocytopenia, you're bleeding,
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.920]  you're clotting at the same time.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.400]  Which of course is much more dangerous
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.520]  than getting COVID itself or the flu.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.960]  And doctor, let's do this
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:34.000]  because I want to talk about your book.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.320]  It's an important issue in your book.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.880]  Let's do one more segment on your book
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.040]  because that's important.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.960]  And I'll just say this kind of put a book end
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.320]  on this discussion.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.840]  The sad thing is I don't expect to get any truth
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.960]  from the NFL.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.040]  I don't think they've been honest.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.680]  They haven't been honest about anything
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.120]  as far as whether it's concussions,
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.680]  mental health, or vaccine status forever.
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.640]  So sadly, I'm not expecting any honesty there.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.320]  But let's come back with Dr. Alexander
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.600]  in his important book.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:00.880]  I have an extremely important message
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.280]  to all of my fellow M4 Warriors here in the United States
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.680]  and around the world.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.280]  We are so excited to announce M4 Wars MD.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.120]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.320]  for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.320]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.040]  that no one else is getting
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.800]  because they want to support M4 Wars
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.080]  and keep us on the air.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.680]  This deal has been a year in the making
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.040]  and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:29.920]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands

[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.960]  at M4WarStore.com, whether it's turmeric
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.280]  or whether it's joint care,
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.320]  or whether it is super greens,
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.480]  we have them all at M4WarStore.com
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:54.160]  under the banner of M4 Wars MD.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.000]  This is the best deal out there
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.800]  and it keeps M4 Wars on the air, M4 Wars MD.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.440]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.680]  are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.720]  M4 Wars has made it easier to make sure
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.440]  you're getting enough in your system
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.600]  with a supplement that contains both.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.640]  This M4 Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.280]  should be your next purchase from the M4 War Store.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.680]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.440]  just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.760]  Natural chemicals found in the hips
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.720]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.920]  including those with osteoarthritis
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.160]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.320]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.080]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.000]  in nutrition, immune defense,
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.160]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.320]  It has been reported that intake of both
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.440]  is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.800]  like here in America.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.880]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.320]  at M4WarStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.800]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.360]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.800]  in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.240]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.080]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.640]  or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.680]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.600]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.680]  produce vitamin D3.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:31.440]  But if you're not getting enough sun,
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.560]  you will not produce vitamin D3
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.360]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.920]  and other things to start replicating
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.240]  and taking your body over.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.880]  So now it's more important than ever
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:43.080]  because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin D3
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.480]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.920]  with calcium for better upload into your body
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.920]  for 50% off at M4WarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.840]  Don't wait, support the M4War and your immune system
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.440]  with vitamin D3 gummies at M4WarStore.com.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.120]  since high school and they had great effects.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.080]  And the science has gotten better and better
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.800]  and better over the years.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.440]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:13.560]  and the water and the food and the feminizing factors,
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.680]  it is more important than ever to use the compounds
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.600]  God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.600]  But these products work great for women as well.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.520]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.120]  We got it discounted for 40% off at M4WarStore.com

[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.080]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.640]  and take it before you go to bed at night.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.680]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.240]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.240]  Go read about them, learn more about them
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.240]  at M4WarStore.com in the M4War Platinum section.

[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.000]  under the new name M4War Platinum.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:35.960]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.840]  Brought to you by M4WarStore.com.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.560]  We've got one more segment with Dr. Paul Alexander,
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.520]  DrPaulAlexander.com, or follow his sub-stack,
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:47.760]  pAlexander.substack.com.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.840]  And you have written a book.
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:52.480]  You know, there was a famous movie that came out
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:54.160]  probably about just over 10 years ago
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.480]  called The Dallas Buyers Club.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.480]  Very popular movie, especially when it came out, very liked.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.400]  Well, people don't realize the bad guy in that movie
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.280]  is Anthony Fauci.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.320]  It's funny how people don't realize that.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.160]  Very popular, very famous movie,
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.320]  Matthew McConaughey filmed The Dallas Buyers Club.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.920]  The bad guy in that film is Anthony Fauci
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.160]  and his government.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.920]  Well, now you've written a new book about Fauci.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.560]  Tell us what is in there.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.880]  But first of all, thanks very much again
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.480]  for having me back on.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:27.520]  And I'm very disappointed with this speaker vote situation
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:31.000]  if I answer that is because if this guy has to reach across
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.960]  to get Democrats to put him in the slot,
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.280]  that means he's gonna be withholding
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.480]  and is demonstrating corruption of Washington.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.760]  It's just, it's worse than a swamp and I was there.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.600]  So to answer your question,
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.320]  the title of the book is Presidential Take Down.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:48.040]  And I wrote that book with Sky Horse
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:50.720]  who wrote the book, The Real Anthony Fauci.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.280]  You can buy it at Amazon.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.240]  Presidential Take Down, how Fauci, the NIH, CDC, et cetera
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.480]  conspired and worked together to topple President Trump.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.560]  And what I'm trying to say is because
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.280]  I got the pleasure and privilege to work
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.920]  in the Trump administration in Washington
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.160]  and my office was in the Health and Human Services,
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.160]  just opposite the Capitol building.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.360]  All of these players, like Redfield, Han
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.920]  and the Task Force, they had sub offices in my building.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.920]  Incidentally, Operation War of Speed
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.040]  was run out of my building, the vaccine development
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.480]  and the Moderna Company was run out of my building.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.320]  So I knew all of these people and I can tell you
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:35.840]  that from my vantage point,
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.000]  President Trump was on peace to win the election
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.560]  in January 2020, hands down.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.280]  He would have won about 380 electoral votes
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.920]  in about 42 states and we were looking at all of the data.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.360]  But something went wrong from January, February, 2020
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.600]  to that election.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.640]  And I'm trying to say by around mid of the year, June, July,
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.880]  it became clear that the Fauci and Berks
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.080]  inspired lockdowns and school closures hurt him.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.600]  It hurt him terribly.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.400]  And I don't think President Trump really understood
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.560]  that they were hollowing out his presidency from the inside.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:17.200]  When Atlas wrote the plague and the house, yes,
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.080]  they were hollowing out President Trump from the inside.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.080]  He trusted these people.
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.840]  President Trump trusted Fauci, Berks, Han, EZR,
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.920]  Redfield, all of these people.
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.680]  But many of these people conspired and worked against him
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.200]  and subverted him.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.560]  They worked against him to make the pandemic response
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.720]  a failure.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.800]  That's the key.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.640]  It was almost like Harry Carey.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.400]  They created a devastating response
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:48.560]  because they knew Trump is an egotistical guy.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.440]  He wanted to be in front of the podium every day.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.520]  So they let him wear it even.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.760]  And that was something that we argued with the White House.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.000]  Please, let the president come out to the podium
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:58.920]  with the task force every day.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.640]  But don't let him speak.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.000]  Just let him stand in the back.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  But no, he had to stand in the front.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.080]  He had to speak.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.080]  They let him wear it.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:06.720]  Why?
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:10.360]  In other words, they were eviscerating him.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:14.200]  Berks wrote in her book that they slow walk data.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.920]  They held back data.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.280]  They sent him wrong data even.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.960]  It was shocking how clear she was.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:21.200]  They subverted him.
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.080]  Yeah, actually, Berks basically,
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:25.640]  she was so transparent, not just in her book.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.560]  I mean, even in TV interviews, she was like,
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.320]  yeah, if you came in with a runny nose,
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.640]  if you came in with a scratched knee,
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:32.920]  we counted everything as COVID.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.800]  I mean, she admitted they inflated the numbers.
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.320]  Everything, listen.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.520]  So everything about COVID from the virus, and yes,
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.480]  we even have data now that is showing us
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.320]  that the timeline actually is beginning to look
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.320]  like it was March 2019.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.520]  That means we might be looking at late 2018.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:55.960]  This didn't begin in February 2020 or even January 2020.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:58.080]  This virus was circulating globally.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:02.200]  Our immune systems had seen this virus or a version prior.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.200]  We were mostly naturally immune.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.360]  We did not need no lockdowns, no school closures.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.600]  We knew COVID was age-restratified.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.320]  We could target and focus the approach.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.600]  It was amenable to restratification
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.440]  that we just needed to focus on the vulnerable
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:24.160]  in our society and let the vast rest of society live free,
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.560]  free lives, unfettered, no lockdowns, no school closures.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.320]  We could find no evidence in the entire world.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.680]  None where any lockdown work in America, anywhere,
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.520]  no school closure, none, no mass mandate, no business.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.320]  They only caused deaths.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.840]  They suffered people.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.680]  They shifted the burden of mortality
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:46.880]  from the rich onto the poor.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.600]  It was the poor, the poor in society
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:53.280]  who had the front face and had to work in the open.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.760]  They are the ones who suffered,
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.880]  not the richer laptop class, the cafe latte class.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.480]  And I wrote the book to say,
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.600]  yes, I know a lot of you people run around
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.280]  and you say, well, the electron was stolen.
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.800]  They did a mail-in ballot.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.520]  I agree.
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.600]  Even Republicans, to me, would still vote it.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.000]  They had a chance.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.280]  But I'm trying to tell you
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.200]  that you need to wrap your head around.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.160]  And I'm speaking, I support President Trump still today.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.400]  If he gets the nod, I want to rally behind him
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.440]  and push him through.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.240]  I think he deserves a second shot.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.080]  I think he would have been
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.720]  the greatest president United States had
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.800]  in January, February, 2020.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.800]  Had it not been for this COVID
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.840]  and had he not let Foutian Brooks lead that lockdown
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:37.600]  that destroyed his presidency,
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:42.600]  I think that in the end, we would see,
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.080]  we would understand how great his presidency was.
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.600]  And I would like him to be honest.
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.800]  I would like him to get back up in there
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.560]  and tear up Washington,
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.720]  strip all those alphabet health agencies,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.280]  dunk to the studs, fumigate them,
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.280]  fire everyone a hundred dung,
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.560]  all the directors and fire a hundred deep.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.560]  I would take each one.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:06.640]  I'd take the CDC out at Lantern Place on Alcatraz.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:10.000]  I would open Alcatraz and set up the office there.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.640]  These people are really swamp,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:16.120]  corruptible, inept, incompetent people.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.040]  And they worked to hurt Trump.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.400]  They subverted him daily.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.600]  They told me that.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.480]  That people told me in words,
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.000]  we worked to damage President Trump's pandemic response
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.840]  because when we get him up on that podium,
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.320]  we will make him look irrelevant,
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.880]  the response chaotic, ungovernable, unmanageable.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.000]  And they did it.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.160]  They did it because Trump didn't become reelected.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.280]  That's the key.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.200]  They introduced enough doubt
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.320]  and enough pain and suffering on the American people
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.120]  across that pandemic lockdown lunacy, I call it,
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.920]  that people blocked.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:59.240]  And they had a writer
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.840]  because we wanted Trump to fire Fauci on birds,
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:02.680]  but he didn't.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:05.360]  And history, he would have to explain all of those things
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.280]  beyond my capacity.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.040]  But I am saying that these people worked against him.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.640]  And that's why we wrote the book.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.840]  You can get it at Amazon.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.200]  It's my view.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.160]  And I have nothing ill to say about the guy.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.680]  I think he would have gone down as the greatest president.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.640]  I support Ron DeSantis even.
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.280]  But I want somebody up in there
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.640]  that when they hit the floor,
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.160]  they know where everything in Washington is.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.120]  And they could begin some serious arresting
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.880]  and put a lot of people in jail.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:35.320]  A lot of people in his administration
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.880]  and in the Biden administration need to sit on
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:40.400]  in a jail cell, for my opinion.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.640]  And I think millions,
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.760]  if not hundreds of millions of Americans
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.880]  share that opinion with you.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.760]  Dr. Paul Alexander, great stuff.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.280]  Thank you for this entire hour.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.400]  Dr. PaulAlexander.com or his sub-stack,
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.240]  palexander.substack.com.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.200]  And you just heard about his book right there,
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.680]  explaining it all as he just laid out.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.040]  Dr. Alexander, thank you.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:08.120]  now quickly, this has been an information-loaded transmission.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.720]  But we won't be able to disseminate any information
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.920]  if we're not on the air.
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:15.800]  And we need your support at infowarstore.com.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.960]  Remember though, share the links, tell friends and family,
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.840]  share the videos, take the clips, take the stories.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:24.440]  That's a very key and important element right now
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.400]  as the Great Awakening is ongoing
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.440]  and minds are opening, searching for information
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.560]  and sources for information.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.080]  And we need to be that source.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:36.040]  And so that's why infowarstore.com exists.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.360]  I can't tell you enough about vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.560]  I talk about it all day long.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.720]  It's 50% off.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:42.640]  I take it every morning
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:45.120]  because I know I'm gonna get 100% the daily value,
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.920]  vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C,
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:51.000]  vitamin D, vitamin E, so much more.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.800]  One popular supplement that has been out of stock for years
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.360]  but is finally back in stock
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.400]  is the Real Red Pill Plus,
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.680]  an incredible supplement unique to anything else
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:01.480]  on the market that I know of
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:02.880]  with the Pregnenolone, the vitamin K,
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:05.400]  and so much more in there at the Urbimate.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.560]  Also, it goes hand in glove with the DNA Force Plus,
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.000]  the way all the different supplements in there
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.560]  work together to help build your immune system
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.560]  and give you daily energy and longevity.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.280]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.080]  And this stuff is selling out fast.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.520]  The new line of Infowars Platinum
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.680]  has already had one of the three products,
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.280]  the HGA Boost, sell out.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.240]  So there's still other on the,
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.400]  the other supplements on the Infowars Platinum line
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.960]  are still on sale at infowarstore.com,
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:37.280]  but one has already sold out.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.400]  So get these amazing, life-changing supplements
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.240]  at infowarstore.com before they sell out.
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.280]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.080]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.080]  This is an information war.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.800]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.840]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.720]  or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone,
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:06.800]  they're all using the terms
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.000]  that Infowars has popularized
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.240]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:12.680]  and we know how to beat them.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:14.360]  But we can't do it without funding.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.800]  And we make it easy to fund with great products
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.520]  and power you and your immune system
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.960]  and your family as well.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.840]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com,
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.280]  clicking on the big red banner, a one-time recurring.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.120]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.360]  We're non-violent.
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.520]  But every time you donate money,
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.560]  every time you buy products,
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:31.640]  every time you keep us on air,
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.800]  you are literally non-violently politically
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.280]  punching the new world order in the nose,
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.600]  punching their lies in the nose.
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.440]  We are gonna defeat the new world order.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.600]  We're going over the top.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.040]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:46.080]  So please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:49.160]  Donate now, donate now, donate now, donate now.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.240]  Infowars secret weapon is finally here.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:54.160]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.480]  for your stamina, for your energy,
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.560]  for your way of life, for your libido.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:00.640]  And it also keeps Infowars on the air.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:01.960]  And I almost forgot.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.760]  You save at least 50% on these products
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.800]  for what you pay for similar products
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:10.440]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.280]  That's because we go right
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.720]  to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.600]  that supplies some of the top names.
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.560]  They then give us the best deal out there
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.640]  because the owner is a listener
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.040]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.440]  You're not gonna find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.200]  for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.840]  You're not gonna find it at the 10 milligram
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:28.680]  or the 20 milligram.
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:31.320]  You're not gonna find two-market 95% of humanoid
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.360]  at the price we're selling it.
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.000]  You're not gonna find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  These similar formulas or the same formulas
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.880]  Infowars MD, now available exclusively
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.920]  at infowarsstore.com, a true 360 win.
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:57.080]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:07.240]  All right, let's get back into the house vote situation.
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.000]  The fifth vote is about to take place
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.760]  and McCarthy's going for the golden sombrero,
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.160]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.800]  He's going for the, oh, I'm sorry, the platinum sombrero.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.160]  He's already got the golden sombrero.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.440]  He's going for the platinum sombrero.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:25.680]  Oh, for five, a mythical accomplishment.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:29.880]  McCarthy's going for it and unless he has
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.440]  about 10 Democrats willing to vote for him,
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.480]  then he's not gonna get it.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:38.200]  You know, I gotta say, I don't know how,
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.960]  I don't know what to attribute this to.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:45.160]  Other than a lot of these politicians
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:48.160]  and we'll include the mainstream media in here as well,
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.200]  they're really dumb people.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.960]  Like just really dumb.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.560]  How can Kevin McCarthy be so stupid?
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.440]  Again, I'm not even trying to be insulting towards the guy here.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.880]  I don't really know him like that.
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:02.320]  I don't support him for House Speaker
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.080]  because I don't trust him as a politician.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.680]  And I don't see anything positive
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:07.280]  that will come from him as a speaker.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:16.280]  But I sat on my couch at home on Monday night
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.600]  and in a live stream on Getter.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.600]  And I said, there's no way Kevin McCarthy
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  has the votes unless a bold Democrat votes for him
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  or perhaps somebody that has a squad decides to vote for him.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:34.600]  I knew that from my couch in Austin, Texas on Monday night.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.600]  How the hell did Kevin McCarthy
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:38.600]  and the Republicans not know that?
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  Are they that stupid or are they that?
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:46.600]  What do you even call it to just go into this futile vote
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:48.600]  four different times knowing you don't have the votes?
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:50.600]  I mean, do you just call it insane?
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.600]  Is it just arrogance?
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.600]  Is it entitlement?
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:56.600]  Stunning stuff.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:03.600]  Now, I suspect that there were already talks last night
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.600]  between McCarthy and the Republican establishment
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.600]  swamp creatures and the Democrats.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:10.600]  I suspect that went down last night.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  I'd be stunned if the Democrats do vote for McCarthy.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:23.600]  However, just as it was a bold act of political brilliance
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.600]  from Matt Gaetz that has put us in this situation,
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.600]  it would be a bold act of political brilliance.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  The only one I could see pulling this off would be AOC
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.600]  and then getting the squad to join her to vote for McCarthy
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.600]  to push him over the edge to have a little leverage on him
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.600]  and to just throw even a bigger wrench into the Republican Party.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:48.600]  That would be a bold act of political brilliance
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.600]  and I think the only one that could pull it off would be AOC.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  But if she hasn't done it to this point,
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:54.600]  I don't think she's going to do it.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:03:00.600]  So if we're, we are about to witness the platinum sombrero.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.600]  And if that's how this goes down,
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:06.600]  this is even more pathetic than we can even imagine.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.600]  I mean, how futile is this?
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.600]  Talk about the definition of insanity.
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.600]  You're witnessing it.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:15.600]  McCarthy never had the votes.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.600]  We learned it in real time.
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.600]  He went 0 for 1.
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:19.600]  Nothing changed.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  He still didn't have the votes.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:22.600]  They voted again.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.600]  He was 0 for 2.
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.600]  Nothing changed.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.600]  He still didn't have the votes.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.600]  He lost votes in the third round.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.600]  He was 0 for 3.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.600]  So then they said, OK, this isn't going to work.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  He thought maybe we'll see something rational tomorrow.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  They show up again today.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.600]  He still doesn't have the votes.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:39.600]  Nothing changed.
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  He goes 0 for 4.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:44.600]  And now we're getting ready and lined up
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.600]  for a fifth round of voting.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.600]  And are we really now this insane?
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.600]  Is the political process now this futile?
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.600]  Which I don't really mind.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.600]  Actually, shut the whole government down as far as I'm concerned.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.600]  Stole this government out of existence as far as I care.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.600]  But are we really about to watch this exact same thing
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.600]  happen a fifth time?
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:06.600]  Like what is this?
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:08.600]  This is the definition of the swamp.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:10.600]  This is the definition of the establishment.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  Just trying to force their way.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:14.600]  Just trying to force it down our throat.
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:16.600]  Just trying to battering ram this tyranny home.
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.600]  Trying to battering ram the uniparty home.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.600]  Trying to battering ram the top down.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.600]  Donors, establishment, legacy, class, elite class,
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.600]  deciding what we want, deciding our future,
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:32.600]  deciding our policies, deciding our politics.
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.600]  That they just sit here, even after taking loss,
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.600]  after loss, after loss, they just say,
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  no, we will get it.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:40.600]  How many times are we going to see this?
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:41.600]  So we're about to see a fifth time?
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.600]  Six times?
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.600]  Seven times?
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:44.600]  Eight times?
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:45.600]  Ten times?
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.600]  Twenty times?
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:50.600]  This is, I love this.
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:52.600]  To me, this is the establishment.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:58.600]  Just taking loss after loss after loss after loss after loss.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.600]  You want to beat the new world order?
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.600]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.600]  Well, so do I.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:06.600]  And I've been the most affected individual in the fight
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:08.600]  against the globalist, and I've got their number,
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:10.600]  and I know how to bring them down.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:14.600]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:18.600]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.600]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.600]  on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.600]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.600]  So please, keep me on the field.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.600]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy,
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:31.600]  while getting great products at the same time
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:33.600]  that will empower you and your family.

[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:59.600]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:08.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:16.600]  and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:21.600]  All right, we're going to be monitoring the fifth vote
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.600]  for Speaker of the House,
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:27.600]  but I have to cover this other news in the interim,
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:30.600]  and that's the Twitter files that dropped yesterday.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:34.600]  So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to read directly
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:41.600]  from the latest Twitter files thread from Matt Taibbi,
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:44.600]  and then the crew is just going to be following along
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:46.600]  on the screen, opening all the links,
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:47.600]  all the documents, and everything else.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.600]  But this is a long one, so bear with me here,
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.600]  but this is important, the latest Twitter files,
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.600]  the thread from Matt Taibbi on Twitter.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.600]  How Twitter let the intelligence community in.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.600]  In August 2017, when Facebook decided to suspend 300 accounts
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.600]  with suspected Russian origin, Twitter wasn't worried.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:11.600]  Its leaders were sure they didn't have a Russian problem.
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:15.600]  We didn't see a big correlation, no larger patterns.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:18.600]  Facebook may take action on hundreds of accounts,
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:21.600]  and we may take action on about 25.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.600]  Keep the focus on Facebook.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.600]  Twitter was so sure they had no Russia problem,
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:30.600]  executives agreed the best PR strategy was to say nothing on record
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:34.600]  and quietly hurl reporters at Facebook.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:37.600]  Twitter is not the focus of inquiry into Russian election
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.600]  meddling right now.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:39.600]  The spotlight is on Facebook,
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:43.600]  wrote public policy vice president of Twitter, Colin Crowell.
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:47.600]  In September 2017, after a cursory review,
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:51.600]  Twitter informed the Senate it suspended 22 possible Russian accounts
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:54.600]  and 179 others with possible links to those accounts,
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:08:00.600]  amid a larger set of roughly 2,700 suspects manually examined.
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:02.600]  Receiving these meager results,
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:04.600]  a furious Senator Mark Warner of Virginia,
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.600]  a ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee,
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:10.600]  held an immediate press conference to denounce Twitter's report
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:15.600]  as frankly inadequate on every level.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.600]  Irony mused Crowell the day after Warner's presser
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:23.600]  after receiving an e-circular from Warner's re-election campaign,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  asking for $5 or whatever you can spare,
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:32.600]  LOL replied General Counsel Sean Edgett.
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.600]  Keep producing material after meeting with congressional leaders,
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:39.600]  Crowell wrote, Warner has political incentive to keep this issue
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:40.600]  at the top of the news,
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.600]  maintain pressure on us and the rest of the industry
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:45.600]  to keep producing material for them.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:47.600]  So even at this time in 2017,
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.600]  they knew the Democrats were trying to use Twitter
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:52.600]  as a political weapon against their opposition.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:54.600]  In steps, Hillary Clinton.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:56.600]  Taking their cues from Hillary Clinton,
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.600]  Crowell added, Dems were taking cues from Hillary,
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.600]  who that week said,
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:05.600]  it's time for Twitter to stop dragging its heels
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.600]  and live up to the fact that its platform is being used
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:10.600]  as a tool for cyber warfare.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.600]  In growing anxiety over its PR problems,
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:15.600]  Twitter formed a Russia task force
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.600]  to proactively self-investigate.
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.600]  And so quickly, let me just monologue here
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  to get us a little context.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.600]  So Twitter's executives at the time were not falling
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  for the Democrat propaganda
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.600]  and they didn't want to be a part of it
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:32.600]  and they actually investigated the claims the Democrats were making
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  and said there's nothing here.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:36.600]  So the Democrats came back and said,
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.600]  we're not happy with your report.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:40.600]  Now we're going to have a strategy
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.600]  to make you look bad in front of the public
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.600]  and we're going to put out a bunch of hit pieces on you
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.600]  doing the bidding for the Russians.
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.600]  And so now Twitter felt they had to respond
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.600]  because of that bad PR.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  We pick it back up with the forming of the Russia task force.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:57.600]  The Russia task force started mainly with data
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.600]  shared from counterparts at Facebook,
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  centered around accounts supposedly tied
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:04.600]  to Russia's internet research agency.
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:09.600]  But the search for Russian perfidy was a dud.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  October 13th, 2017.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  No evidence of a coordinated approach.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  All of the accounts found seem to be lone wolf type activity.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  Different timing, spend targeting under 10,000 in ad spends.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.600]  October 18, 2017.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:29.600]  The next day, first round of RU investigation.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.600]  15, Russia investigation.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  15 high-risk accounts.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.600]  We each have connections with Russia,
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.600]  although two are RT, the Russian news agency.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.600]  October 20th, 2017.
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.600]  Built a new version of the model that is lower precision
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.600]  but higher recall, which allows to catch more items.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.600]  We aren't seeing substantially more suspicious accounts.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  We expect to find about 20 with a small amount of spend.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.600]  So again, this is the Democrats saying,
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.600]  Russia, Russia, Russia, censor the internet for us.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.600]  It's all Russians.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  Twitter goes in and looks at it.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  And anything the Democrats or the intelligence community is claiming
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  and says there's nothing we can do here, here's 20 accounts we found.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  The Democrats, the intelligence community continues to get more angry.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.600]  October 23rd, 2017.
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.600]  Finished the investigation.
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:19.600]  2,500 full manual account reviews.
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.600]  We think this is exhaustive.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.600]  32 suspicious accounts and only 17 of those are connected with Russia.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  Only two of those have significant spend.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:33.600]  One of which is Russia today remaining at under 10,000 a spend.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.600]  Twitter's research, Twitter's search finding only two significant accounts.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.600]  One of which is Russia today was based on the same data
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.600]  that later inspired panic headlines like Russia Influence reached 126 million
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.600]  through Facebook alone.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.600]  So they didn't get the results they wanted and the pressure they were putting on Twitter.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.600]  So then they just took the results they wanted and wrote headlines
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.600]  going for the result that they wanted.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.600]  So they didn't get the result they wanted, but then they wrote the stories
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.600]  pretending like they got the result they wanted.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.600]  The failure of the Russia task force to produce material worsened the company's PR crisis.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.600]  In the weeks after Warner Presser, a torrent of stories sourced to the Intel committee
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:24.600]  poured into the news an example being Politico's October 13th Twitter deleted data
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.600]  potentially crucial to Russia reports.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:29.600]  So again, here's the Democrats working with the media to attack Twitter
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:32.600]  because Twitter won't do their bidding in 2017.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.600]  Which I got to say is really amazing even here to me now
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.600]  because this is what InfoWars was reporting at the time.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:44.600]  And my crew will remember and people that listened to the War Room will remember
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:49.600]  I was saying at the time I was like, and Jack Dorsey has come out and said stuff since.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.600]  I said, look, Jack Dorsey doesn't want to be a part of this.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  I'm not sitting here telling you he's a good guy or not a liberal.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  I'm just saying Twitter is not putting up with this stuff.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.600]  They're not doing the bidding of the Democrat Party.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.600]  So the Democrats in the intelligence community continued to attack, attack, attack, attack Twitter
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  until they did what they wanted them to do and eventually Dorsey stepped down.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.600]  But let's get back to the story.
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:19.600]  Were Twitter a contractor for the FSB, they could not have built a more effective disinformation platform.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  John Hopkins Professor and Intel Committee expert Thomas Ryd told Politico.
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  So here comes the pressure.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  As Congress threatened costly legislation and Twitter began, was the subject to more bad press fueled by the committees,
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.600]  the company changed its tune about the smallness of its Russia problem.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.600]  There's the pressure applied getting the desired result.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  From another email we go.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:50.600]  Hi guys, just passing along for awareness.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:55.600]  The write up here from the Washington Post today on potential legislation or new FEC regulations
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.600]  that may affect our political advertising wrote crawl.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.600]  So the Democrats and the committee said, we're going to make laws and legislations and rulings
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  that's going to cripple you and that is going to bankrupt you.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  Do you still not want to do our bidding?
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:17.600]  In Washington weeks after the first briefing Twitter leaders were told by Senate staff that Senator Warner feels like
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:24.600]  tech industry was in denial for months, added an Intel staffer big interest in Politico article about deleted accounts.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  Twitter pledged to work with them on their desire to legislate.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.600]  In other words, the threats worked.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:36.600]  Knowing that our ads policies and product changes are an effort to anticipate congressional oversight.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  I wanted to share some relevant highlights of the legislation Senators Warner, Klobuchar and McCain will be introducing.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  Wrote policy director Carlos Mange soon after.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  Wow, talk about, I mean, what do you even call that bribery, blackmail, racketeering, gangsterism.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:56.600]  It's the Democrats.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  It's the intelligence communities and the committees.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:08.600]  Committees appeared to have leaked even as Twitter prepared to change its ad policy and remove RT and Sputnik to placate Washington.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:15.600]  Congress turned the heat up more, apparently leaking the larger base list of 2700 accounts and saying why didn't Twitter ban these?
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.600]  We demanded they would.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:23.600]  Reporters from all over started to call Twitter about Russia links Buzzfeed working with the University of Sheffield claim to find a new
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  network on Twitter that had close connections to Russian link bot accounts. You may remember all this fake news coming out.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:31.600]  It will just embolden them.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.600]  Now, I've almost finished it.
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.600]  There's a couple more left, but we've gotten most of the points.
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  So do you see how corrupt that is?
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  This is not only a First Amendment violation.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  This is racketeering.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:45.600]  This is election interference and meddling and rigging.
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.600]  And we're not even talking about the Hunter Biden story yet.
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  This is just post-Trump election, everything the Democrats and their friends in the intelligence communities were doing to censor your free speech.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:04.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars Live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:09.600]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States.

[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.600]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.600]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.600]  There's a solution.
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  The Wellness Company.

[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:28.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to have the fifth vote for Speaker of the House.
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:32.600]  I can't believe they're going to do it, but they're going to do it.
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:39.600]  And McCarthy is probably about to get the rare Platinum Sombrero.
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:41.600]  He's already got the Golden Sombrero.
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:43.600]  He's already 0 for 4.
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:45.600]  They're really going to go 0 for 5 today, aren't they?
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:46.600]  They're really going to do this.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:49.600]  So how many, how many is it going to take?
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:51.600]  Six, seven, eight.
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:59.600]  How many times does McCarthy have to fail before he says, okay, it's time for me to throw in the white towel?
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:02.600]  Or is he so entitled and arrogant that, I mean, how many is it going to take?
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:03.600]  Seriously.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:10.600]  Now Matt Gaetz just sent this zinger out.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:15.600]  Statement from Matt Gaetz just moments ago.
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:19.600]  Another day, another lie from Kevin McCarthy.
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:25.600]  Just weeks ago, Kevin McCarthy promised me and the entire House, Republican Caucus,
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:28.600]  that he wouldn't seek Democrat votes to secure the speakership.
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:33.600]  In fact, his people said it was a doomsday scenario if this were to happen.
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:40.600]  So I guess that means for Kevin McCarthy, it's a doomsday scenario now.
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:45.600]  And I guess it's for the Republican establishment, the GOP donor class,
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:50.600]  the conservative Inc., the neocons, the military industrial complex.
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:56.600]  I guess this is their doomsday moment because they now have reached across the aisle to beg for votes from Democrats.
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:01.600]  And again, I will tell you what I've been saying since Monday night.
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:14.600]  The only hope that McCarthy has to get votes from the Democrats is if somehow AOC has the same spark
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:19.600]  of political brilliance that Matt Gaetz had to stand up against the swamp,
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:24.600]  that she would give the Republican swamp the victory at once by going for McCarthy,
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:30.600]  then throwing an even bigger wrench into the Republican Party moving forward with a voter base
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:33.600]  and a movement that doesn't like or want McCarthy,
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:38.600]  but then there he is stabbing us in the back with all the holdouts.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:42.600]  But I still don't suspect that to happen.
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:48.600]  And where it stands right now, McCarthy is going to go 0 for 5 and get the platinum sombrero.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:52.600]  So unless AOC, which I think would be an act of political brilliance,
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:58.600]  in a different way from what Matt Gaetz has done but in a similar idea, in a similar fashion,
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.600]  but she'd have to convince the squad to go along with her.
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:04.600]  And I don't think they really like McCarthy either.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:08.600]  So plus they move in unison, it's a cult.
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:14.600]  So I think they're going to just keep voting Jefferies every time to 200 or 202 or whatever it is.
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:18.600]  But where it stands right now, should we do it?
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:22.600]  I mean, we just caught a little, we got a little teaser there.
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:24.600]  I don't know.
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:27.600]  I don't know.
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:31.600]  Oh, that's looking good.
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:35.600]  Now I know why he wanted the platinum sombrero.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:39.600]  We thought the golden sombrero looked good on Kevin McCarthy.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:46.600]  Well, he's trying on for size, the platinum sombrero right now, and it looks good.
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:51.600]  Yeah, you know, the golden sombrero, it's just, that's not his look.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.600]  I don't think the golden sombrero is really working for Kevin McCarthy.
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:58.600]  He needs to trade that in for the platinum sombrero.
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:03.600]  I suspect that that is going to be the case in about 10 minutes.
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:05.600]  Actually, it's already over. It's done.
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:07.600]  He didn't get it.
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:13.600]  It's over. It's the platinum sombrero.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:16.600]  This is too good. And he looks good with it.
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.600]  Dang.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:20.600]  He looks good.
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:24.600]  Kevin McCarthy, congratulations.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.600]  The golden sombrero, it just wasn't really your look, Kevin.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:32.600]  But the platinum sombrero, you're looking good on that.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:38.600]  That, hey, the platinum sombrero, that's Kevin McCarthy's look.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:40.600]  Congratulations, Kevin McCarthy.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:42.600]  You have done it.
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:45.600]  The platinum sombrero, 0 for 5.
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:49.600]  Now, I don't think we have a thing for 0 for 6.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:52.600]  I don't know if there is an 0 for 6.
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:55.600]  I don't think, I mean, we've got a couple guys that played ball in college here.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:57.600]  I've never heard of the 0 for 6 sombrero.
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:59.600]  I don't think there is such a thing.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:06.600]  So, are we about to have the 0 for 6 strikeouts in a game?
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:11.600]  What is that, the ruby sombrero, the emerald sombrero, the lithium sombrero?
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:17.600]  I mean, I think platinum is still the most expensive precious metal.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.600]  I don't know.
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:23.600]  What comes after the platinum sombrero and will Kevin McCarthy go for it?
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.600]  Why wouldn't he?
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.600]  He's come this far.
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  He went for 5.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:29.600]  He's struck out 5 times.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  That's like going up to bat with a hole in your bat.
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  Kevin McCarthy digs in for the fifth time tonight and he has a hole in his bat.
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:40.600]  That's odd.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.600]  I've never seen that.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:57.600]  There's a baseball-sized hole on the barrel of the bat.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.600]  Congratulations to Kevin McCarthy.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.600]  You are the official winner of the platinum sombrero.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  Why did you guys turn the music off?
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:08.600]  We were celebrating here.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:09.600]  What are you doing back there?
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:10.600]  We're celebrating.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  This is Kevin McCarthy's moment.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  This is the moment Kevin McCarthy always wanted.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.600]  See, there's a little confusion.
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:21.600]  You thought Kevin McCarthy wanted to be speaker of the house.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.600]  No.
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:24.600]  Kevin McCarthy wanted to wear the platinum sombrero.
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:25.600]  Yes.
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:26.600]  Yes.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  Yes.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  Yes.
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.600]  It's beautiful.
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:48.600]  So if it's a sixth time, it is even a sombrero.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:49.600]  It's a horn?
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:50.600]  What are you saying?
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:51.600]  We're looking into this, folks.
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:53.600]  We're looking into this.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.600]  Okay.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:56.600]  He's going to wear the horn.
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  He's going to wear the horn when it's all said and done.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:03.600]  Are you going to, you know, Frank Luntz is going to give him the horn?
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:04.600]  Okay.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:08.600]  This is just ridiculous at this point.
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.600]  Kevin McCarthy, you have embarrassed yourself, but that's fine.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  You decided that that's what you would do for the establishment.
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:17.600]  You decided that's what you would do for the donor class.
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:19.600]  That was your decision.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:22.600]  And so now you wear the platinum sombrero.
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.600]  At this point, really, man, are you really going to go for the horn?
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  I don't think that one goes on the head.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.600]  Okay.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:34.600]  I think Frank Luntz may be putting the horn there.
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:36.600]  Geez, man.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:38.600]  Well, this is beautiful.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  This is great.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.600]  And so we see where it goes from here.
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  Oh, and just wait.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:47.600]  Oh, I can't even wait if McCarthy fails again for the second straight day.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:49.600]  You just wait till tonight.
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:52.600]  I mean, you wait till Fox News tonight.
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:55.600]  You wait till all the conservative establishment tonight.
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.600]  You wait for the donor class tonight.
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.600]  You wait for the DC political tonight.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:00.600]  This is going to be brilliant.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.600]  Even the Democrats are probably going to try to be telling you how bad this is.
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.600]  That's how you know it's great.
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:08.600]  That is how you know this is a victory.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  I want Mexican mariachi going out to break guys.
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.600]  We're celebrating the moment here.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.600]  We are celebrating this moment for Kevin McCarthy.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  He wanted to be speaker of the house.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.600]  Instead, he goes 045.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:25.600]  And where's the platinum sombrero?
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  Will he go for the horn?
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  Will he go for the horn and go 046?
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.600]  It'd be stunning.
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:33.600]  It'd be shocking.
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:35.600]  But he's so committed he just might do it.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:37.600]  He loves the establishment that much.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:41.600]  He's willing to put his entire reputation on the line for the donor class.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.600]  But this is great.
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.600]  This is actually the people getting what they want.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  This is amazing.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:46.600]  We're getting what we want, guys.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  Thanks to Matt Gaetz and others.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:50.600]  We don't want McCarthy.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:51.600]  Thank you.
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  Yes.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:53.600]  This is a victory.
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:29:21.600]  045, McCarthy.
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:28.600]  Hello.

[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.080]  other names.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:33.960]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:36.160]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.720]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:42.600]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:45.280]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:48.160]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:49.760]  These things are incredible.
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:53.840]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your healthcare
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:54.840]  provider.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.840]  Those are so powerful.
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:58.520]  Get them at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.680]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and
[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:03.680]  band.video.
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:07.840]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right now.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:11.760]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:16.960]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:21.920]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:22.920]  including myself?
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:27.520]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:31.280]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:32.280]  Jones.
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:36.400]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:37.400]  Tim Cass IRL.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:43.280]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted, because
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:45.600]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:50.320]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:54.000]  their store, go support Infowars, leave a donation right now.
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:00.400]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:16.440]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:22.280]  Well, we continue with the theme of the day.
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:26.440]  This is a truly amazing accomplishment for Kevin McCarthy.
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:32.280]  No, he's not Speaker of the House, but he does now wear the Platinum Sombrero, 0 for
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.320]  5 with 5 strikeouts.
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:36.160]  Now folks, this is just incredible.
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.880]  It's already happening.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:40.920]  We have a new swamp creature, by the way.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:46.120]  Brian Lawler is his name, Republican from New York, who spent the last three days stumping
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:50.960]  for McCarthy on Fox News, and it's the same hemming and hawing, oh, this is so bad what
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.960]  they're doing.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:54.360]  Oh, this is crushing conservatives.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:56.160]  This is crushing the Republican Party.
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.880]  This is so great for Joe Biden.
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:02.520]  You guys have done nothing for us, okay?
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.120]  We gave you everything with Donald Trump in 2016, and you did nothing for us.
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:12.440]  So this whole notion of like, you have any kind of leverage over us, or any kind of leverage
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:16.920]  over Matt Gaetz and the Freedom Caucus, you still don't get it, do you?
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:21.760]  We've broken from your lies, we've broken from your deception, we've broken from the
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:27.000]  Uniparty, we've broken from the establishment, top down dictating to the people how things
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.520]  are going to go, and we're not looking back.
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:31.400]  Like, we're done.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:36.120]  It's like the girlfriend that's moved on and is maybe even married now, and you still
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.760]  think there's a chance, it's over.
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:41.760]  The ex-girlfriend is now married with seven kids, okay?
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.880]  Like, it's done.
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.360]  We're done with you.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:50.960]  But folks, he's going on there, they're going to go again.
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:55.480]  They're going for round number six, folks.
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:02.560]  And Lawler is going on as the voice box for the McCarthyites, and is saying they're going
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  to have the votes in round six.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:05.560]  This is hilarious.
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:10.880]  Yeah, and I'm going to wake up tomorrow and be seven foot tall, and I'm going to go play
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:13.280]  in the NBA too.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:18.400]  By the way, Lauren Boebert went out there and said, it's time for Donald Trump to tell
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.480]  Kevin McCarthy to get the hell out of the way.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.360]  Man, and Trump's smartest move right now would be to do just that.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:29.960]  And he doesn't even have to say Lauren Boebert's name if he doesn't want to act like he's responding
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:32.960]  to Lauren Boebert for political reasons, whatever.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:34.720]  That's fine.
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.480]  But look, Donald Trump, I'm telling you right now, if this message gets to you, you are
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.600]  reeling politically right now.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:42.680]  You are reeling.
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:44.640]  You are talking to one of your biggest supporters.
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:46.800]  In fact, let's just be perfectly honest.
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:52.000]  There's very few people that have done as much as me for Donald Trump.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  Very few.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.480]  I created an entire genre of content on the internet of going out and stumping the Trump
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:59.200]  protesters on the streets.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:04.800]  I got arrested three different times and am still going through multiple legal cases for
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:07.000]  my public support of Donald Trump.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.960]  I stood up to the Democrats and told them what they were doing to Donald Trump was treasonous.
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.960]  Not many people have that rap sheet.
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:17.120]  So you know what, I got a little bit more skin in the game than most of these people
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:21.280]  on TV and inside conservative Inc.
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:24.440]  So you know, Trump, you might want to start listening to the people that put their skin
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:28.680]  in the game and put their neck out there and continue to be right on all the issues.
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:32.200]  So if you don't want to have any political connection to Lauren Boebert, that's fine.
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.760]  But you better realize you're reeling right now politically and you're losing your base
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:37.840]  with Kevin McCarthy.
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:41.040]  You can still save face right now.
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.720]  But you better come out and say it's time for McCarthy to move on.
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:48.320]  The Platinum Sombrero is enough, it's time to move on.
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:53.120]  And if you continue to support McCarthy, you're going to continue to lose support.
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:54.120]  That's just the facts.
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.080]  And in case you haven't noticed, and this is going to hurt you, I got a big ego too.
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:59.080]  I get it.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:00.080]  This is going to hurt you.
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:05.960]  But in case you haven't noticed, this America first, great awakening, great renaissance,
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:09.800]  whatever you want to call it, it's bigger than you and it's ready to move on from you.
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:11.280]  We don't want to move on from you.
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:12.280]  We like you.
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:13.840]  We like you at the head of the ship.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:20.560]  But if you're going to continue to stomp from McCarthy, when none of your voters want him,
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:23.480]  we will move on.
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.560]  I've supported Donald Trump.
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:28.280]  I've said I supported his third run that he's already announced.
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:30.200]  I've said why.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:35.240]  But I'm just speaking from the objective facts of the matter as I see them.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:36.800]  Trump is reeling politically.
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:38.200]  He's losing his base.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:43.400]  His base is ready to move on and his approach towards this, Kevin McCarthy's speakership
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:46.360]  is only hurting him.
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:50.000]  So McCarthy wears the platinum sombrero.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.360]  Now we've had some debates because we figured this out just because we're going to get ready
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.360]  for this.
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:58.200]  He's about to wear, he's about to go 0 for 6 with 6 strikeouts.
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:01.000]  I believe we're going to see that in the next hour.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.200]  So the reason why I was called a horn, these are all baseball references we're using here.
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:11.240]  A horn refers to a player striking out six times in a game.
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:15.760]  The term was coined by pitcher Mike Flanagan after a teammate Sam Horn of the Baltimore
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:19.920]  Orioles accomplished this feat in an extra inning game in 1991.
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:23.280]  So we could actually just call this the McCarthy now.
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:28.240]  We could just say going 0 for 6 with 6 strikeouts is the McCarthy and that might be better.
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:34.360]  But alternative names for this accomplishment have been considered the titanium sombrero
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.760]  or the double platinum sombrero.
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.840]  Now we're thinking about going with the double platinum sombrero because we could just stack
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:44.760]  a nice little second sombrero on top of McCarthy's head there.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:45.920]  He can wear the double sombrero.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.360]  I don't know how we would do a titanium sombrero and then the platinum sombrero looks good.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.800]  And we can always just call it the McCarthy too.
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:58.080]  He already has the platinum sombrero, maybe we just call it the McCarthy at this point.
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:59.080]  What are they going to do?
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.360]  How does he think he's going to get the votes?
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:05.400]  He's obviously not getting the votes from the Freedom Caucus and the Republican holdouts.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:09.600]  He's obviously not going to get the votes from the squad or the Democrats.
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:13.200]  And so we're going to get up here and we're going to witness this for the sixth time now.
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:15.960]  Kevin McCarthy losing the vote.
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:19.360]  This is hilarious stuff.
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.400]  And then watching the conservative Republican GOP donor class elitist establishment flailing
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:29.600]  and flopping around and going on Fox News saying McCarthy will win.
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:30.600]  We have the votes.
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:32.320]  We just need to do it again.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.720]  And anybody who's stopping this is the bad guy.
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:40.480]  Oh yeah, keep telling us how we're the bad guy and then expecting us to do what you want
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:41.600]  us to do.
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:43.160]  You jerk.
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:44.160]  Brian Lawler.
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:49.160]  Boy, a congressman elect Brian Lawler and I already can't stand the guy before he even
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.160]  gets confirmed.
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:52.280]  Boy, bad move, Brian, from New York.
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:55.480]  You're going to be a one-term representative.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:56.480]  Mark my words.
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:03.080]  Right here, Brian Lawler, one-term representative already showing himself as a swamp creature
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:05.760]  before he even gets sworn in.
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:07.240]  But hey, this is fine.
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:09.920]  This is all part of the process, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:13.000]  Are we having fun in 2023 yet or what?
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:21.320]  All right, let me just take a deep breath because I got other news to cover.
[02:40:21.320 --> 02:40:22.560]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to get to it.
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:25.280]  I've gotten through most of the important stuff and we're obviously monitoring this
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.960]  house vote, which is the big story here.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:38.760]  But there is some other news I would like to report on and I don't know when they're
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.600]  going to start or conclude this next vote.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:44.880]  I'm stunned.
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:46.040]  Are they really going to do this?
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.400]  Are they really going to go 0 for 3 twice?
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:50.480]  And how dumb are they?
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:51.480]  What?
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:55.520]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:01.920]  Have you ever seen just like in Idiocracy when they're doing the IQ test and they're
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:07.600]  trying to shove the circular block into the triangle section and they're just like, how
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:09.640]  do I do this?

[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:13.600]  Crazy stuff.
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.840]  All right, let me just do this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.200]  We have to be on air.
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  You know that.
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:20.200]  We know that.

[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:52.840]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:54.240]  It's the Alex Jones show filling in today.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.240]  Owen Schreuer.
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.240]  You want to beat the new world order?
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:01.560]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:03.200]  Well, so do I.
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.280]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:09.520]  got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:15.840]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support and the good news is we're only
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:18.520]  under about $200,000 a month.
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:22.360]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:25.200]  to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:27.120]  So please keep me on the field.
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:30.320]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:35.440]  that will empower you and your family infowarstore.com for the best supplements and more or just
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:40.200]  make a straight donation, big red man at the top of infowarstore.com and that way all the
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:43.440]  money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:45.360]  But I thank you all for your support.
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:49.480]  Please commit now to go to infowarstore.com, get great products and make donations.
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:51.760]  I thank you for your support now take action.
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:58.200]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:04.080]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:09.440]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:11.520]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:14.320]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:17.520]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:18.960]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:23.120]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:27.440]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:28.440]  your support.
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:31.520]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:36.040]  as to America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.680]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:41.360]  because of your past support.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:45.200]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now to critical juncture of the battle,
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:49.600]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:50.600]  on air.

[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:01.520]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.160]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:11.880]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:17.680]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:18.680]  globalists have done.
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.440]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:24.440]  now.
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:26.720]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:32.840]  It's Info Wars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:37.000]  This is private labeled, three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:42.320]  it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of Info Wars Platinum
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:44.440]  at infowarstore.com.

[02:45:58.560 --> 02:45:59.560]  the Info War.
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars live products have always been the highest quality, triple
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:05.440]  tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:10.240]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:15.040]  it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:16.040]  we were already using.
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:21.160]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.440]  the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases even better.

[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:06.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:24.640]  So we're gonna do it, get McCarthy is gonna go for the double platinum sombrero, or maybe
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:32.840]  we call it the platinum McCarthy sombrero, or the McCarthy platinum sombrero.
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:38.200]  We're still taking submissions here, not official yet, but double platinum sombrero, leader
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  in the clubhouse right now.
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.640]  All right, let me just do this, let me just cover some other news here as we wait for
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.500]  the sixth vote to begin.
[02:47:47.500 --> 02:47:51.400]  Nothing has changed since the first vote really, but yeah, it's all good, the establishment
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:55.680]  is that desperate to get their guy in, Kevin McCarthy.
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:58.800]  So here we go though, let's just look at some of this other news here.
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:10.840]  So the story about the murders, those gruesome stabbing murders in Idaho finally had a suspect
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:19.560]  arrested Brian Coburger, and the way they arrested this guy is very interesting.
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:26.400]  How FBI uses genetic genealogy websites to nail murder suspects like Idaho's Brian Coburger.
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:31.520]  Just run DNA through public websites, find their suspect, then secretly and legally collect
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.360]  their DNA to match crime scene.
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:41.520]  Now I actually looked at some legal takes and some crime blogs about this, and there
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:51.920]  seems to be a potential problem here with using the DNA from the website in the process
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:52.920]  of the courtroom.
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:54.680]  There could be some potential challenges to doing that.
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:58.440]  This worked before, but it's failed before.
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:03.920]  And the legal takes that seem to make the most sense to me said that the FBI should
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.960]  have requested a DNA test from him before admitting that this is how they got it or
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.760]  get a DNA test from him before they admitted this how they got it because they could run
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.080]  into problems with that in the future.
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:16.520]  But nonetheless, how do you feel about that?
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:26.240]  How do you feel about you've got these ancestry websites that you submit a DNA sample to and
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:32.760]  then they tell you whatever your ancestry is or wherever their science tells your heritage
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:38.240]  comes from, your countries or regions of origin, and you submit to that, and then that ends
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:44.280]  up being used as evidence in a crime.
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:50.680]  So I don't know, that's a little, it's like, yeah, we want to catch murderers and stuff.
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:54.440]  We want to catch murderers and rapists, so okay, we use every tool necessary, but then
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.880]  there's the issue of, well, I mean, what about privacy?
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:02.440]  Very, very difficult issue, I think, right there.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:06.440]  And it's amazing that it's not really getting the attention or having the conversation it
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:10.360]  deserves, but I guess I can see why with all the different distractions going on, even
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:15.600]  though they do continue to talk about this, so that's going to be interesting to see how
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:18.960]  that goes.
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:26.200]  But serious debate, you submit your DNA to an ancestry thing, and then it's used by law
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:28.760]  enforcement as evidence.
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:37.160]  Now my guess is whenever you agree to the terms and conditions for these websites, they probably
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:41.240]  have something in there like this can be used for other purposes or law enforcement purposes
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:43.960]  or whatever, and you sign it, so you basically waive your rights, you basically give your
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:44.960]  DNA away.
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:46.640]  Kind of scary if you think about it.
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:48.240]  That's why I've never done this.
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:52.000]  So then there's the other issue of why would you ever do this and put yourself in a potentially
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.240]  compromising situation to begin with, but there it is.
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:58.960]  So that's going to be an ongoing story to watch.
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.600]  Then there's this nice little ditty, Ray Epps is hired an attorney, and Ray Epps attorney
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:07.160]  was an FBI agent for nine years.
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:12.320]  Well, I'm sure that's just a coincidence that Ray Epps attorney is a FBI agent for nine
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:13.320]  years.
[02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:16.240]  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:18.800]  Just a coincidence.
[02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:21.680]  Let's see what the Democrats are up to over here.
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:30.640]  Now this is the party, well let me just explain the irony through some headlines here.
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:36.480]  Kathy Hockel and New York Democrats legalize human composting for eco-friendly burials
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:37.480]  in New York.
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:39.720]  So you already have this in California, you already have this in New York.
[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:40.720]  It's soilent green.
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:42.840]  It's going to be soilent green soon.
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  You know.
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:44.840]  Oh, you want to eat meat?
[02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:48.600]  Well, you're going to have to eat people then, because we're saving the planet from
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:50.240]  climate change.
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:54.840]  Human composting for eco-friendly burials in New York.
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:52:00.440]  So now the California Democrats and the New York Democrats are into human composting.
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:02.680]  That's what they think about human life.
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:12.280]  And then there was this in Portland, an anti-abortion billboard in northeast Portland was removed
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:18.560]  after it was vandalized with the words, kill them kids, spray paint it over the sign, and
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:23.720]  X's crossed over a photographed baby's eyes.
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:29.520]  Now I can see a potential chance that maybe this is a little culture jamming, and maybe
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:32.560]  somebody that wanted to do a little culture jamming, showing how liberals love killing
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:34.760]  kids and call it an abortion.
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:39.920]  Or I could see, I mean, this is Portland, that this is genuinely some crazed, whacked
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:48.320]  out leftist liberal Democrat that really does love abortion and hates the pro-life people
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:52.640]  and hates the pro-life politics and decided to do this.
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:54.480]  Nonetheless, there you go.
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:55.480]  There you see it.
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:53:01.280]  We know who loves abortion in this country, it's Democrats.
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:02.280]  More proof.
[02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:08.040]  Unearthed video shows animal rights activist liberal Democrat Jane Goodall calling for
[02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:11.640]  depopulating the earth to solve climate change.
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:13.720]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:15.080]  There you go.
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:19.920]  Maybe now you know why they love abortion so much.
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:26.880]  60 minutes rings in the new year with doomsday message from anti-human eugenicist Paul Ehrlich,
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:30.320]  humanity is not sustainable.
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:36.120]  And while I understand some of the logic he points out, there's also direct data and
[02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:38.720]  evidence that that's not how it goes.
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:43.080]  They used to say that as the population is going to be going up, that the food supply
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:45.920]  is going to become scarce, but that's not really been the case.
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:52.680]  Look at America, our population continues to go up and we continue to have excess food,
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:54.960]  which they also say is bad because we have too much food.
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:57.520]  So they say, you're not going to have enough food because there's too many people.
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:02.380]  By the way, you're also bad because you have too much food and you throw it away.
[02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:11.240]  But even Elon Musk was calling out Paul Ehrlich as a eugenicist and anti-human and re-fortifying
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.360]  his stance as being pro-human.
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:16.080]  So good for Elon Musk there.
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:19.720]  Now why is all this ironic to me?
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:24.120]  So here's just a small stack of news just showing you how much Democrats, or I should
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:30.680]  say how little Democrats value life, how little Democrats care about humanity.
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:34.080]  But then there's always cases of irony where you kind of scratch your head and they seem
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:41.160]  like they care about humanity all of a sudden and life all of a sudden for a second.
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:47.480]  Missouri defies Democrat politician, executes evil transgender child murderer.
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:50.040]  And this was the case of Amber McLaughlin.
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:55:05.480]  Now Amber McLaughlin is a demonic individual who raped and killed minors and stalked others.
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:15.280]  And then magically as soon as she was facing the death penalty, or he was facing the death
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:18.360]  penalty, decided to become a woman.
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:25.000]  So Scott McLaughlin was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl in 1992.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:34.480]  He then stalked and brutally raped and murdered his ex-girlfriend in 2003.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:41.120]  And so he was placed on death row and then changed to a girl.
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:45.080]  And then all the liberal Democrats came out and said, there's never been a woman executed
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:48.080]  in the state of Missouri, there's never been a woman executed with the death penalty in
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:51.760]  the next many years, this is so bad, why would you kill a woman, why would you kill the death
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  penalty?
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:54.480]  Wait a second, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.960]  You guys are pro-abortion, you kill innocent babies.
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:03.040]  You guys, I've got dozens, hundreds, thousands of statements from you saying we need to get
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:06.000]  rid of humanity and depopulate the planet, stop from climate change.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.400]  I mean, I've got all your clips, all your stories, everything, all the anti-human crap.
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:18.360]  But now that you have a rapist and a murderer, now you care about life?
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:22.400]  The innocent baby's life that you want to suck out of the womb with a vacuum, you're
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.000]  not moved by that.
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.760]  But a rapist and a murderer, now you value life.
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:31.320]  Does that not tell you everything about the Democrat Party?
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:34.840]  And by the way, folks, in this Gateway Pundit story, and all over the internet, I got one
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:40.400]  right here from India Urban, we've got Congresswoman, Cory Bush, all these other liberal Democrats
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.640]  complaining about capital punishment, well, what about all the babies you sent us to capital
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:46.960]  punishment who never even committed a crime?
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.600]  So oh, they don't value the innocent life of a baby, they don't value the innocent life
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.840]  and just humanity generally on this planet, they want to kill it, they want to depopulate,
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:57.520]  they want to kill all the babies.
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.720]  But then when there's a rapist murderer, all of a sudden they care about their life.
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:05.840]  So they don't care about any life until it's a rapist murderer, they don't care about any
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.800]  life until it's a demonic, satanic, disgusting, twisted, psychotic individual.
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:15.320]  Does that not tell you everything you need to know about these people, who they are,
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:20.960]  what they stand for, what they represent, where they're getting their frequency from?
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:27.960]  The babies slaughter them all, humanity on the planet end it, oh, the convicted rapist
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:32.480]  and murderer protect that life at all costs and if you don't protect that life, you're
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:48.520]  a bad person, wow, liberals, Democrats, when they show you who they are, believe them.
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:54.680]  There is a war on for your mind, your mind is a battlefield, this is an information war.
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:58:00.480]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:07.200]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:11.440]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:12.440]  them.

[03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:18.840]  We've got Alex Jones here, it's a great guest.
[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:24.000]  I don't want to go too stir crazy here, but with this developing news, I may be back on
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:27.760]  the war room, we do have a guest host, Pete Santilli today who always does a fantastic
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:30.900]  job.
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:37.400]  But with all this development around the speaker vote, I may pop back in.
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:42.280]  But with Alex out, I do have some other roles to fill and some other work to do, not on
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:43.520]  air stuff.
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:44.600]  So we'll see what happens.
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:48.200]  But Pete Santilli hosting the War Room today, I'm going to be here for a couple more segments
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:50.840]  for Kate Dally and Dr. Merrick.
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:56.400]  But you know, I've got a bunch of weird dues here on my desk and I just want to do something
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:00.840]  and you know, Rob do kind of brought me to task and I told him I was going to do this
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:01.840]  today.
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:07.000]  And by the way, I think we need a little bit more of this and we're already seeing this
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.040]  with what's going on with the Republicans in Congress.
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:10.040]  I like this.
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:13.760]  We need to be able to have a debate and a disagreement with one another amicably and
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:18.400]  smile and laugh about it and still move on because that's how you have healthy debates.
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:21.920]  That's how you grow and that's how you can come together and really make the world a
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:22.920]  better place.
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:25.280]  Doesn't mean you're going to get along or see eye to eye.
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:29.360]  But I told Rob because Rob do because he was one of the people that sent me this last
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:31.040]  night and was a bunch of people that sent me this.
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:32.440]  And I think we have it guys.
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:34.360]  Do we have that basketball clip?
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.520]  Did I send you that basketball clip?
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:38.760]  I don't see it on the list here.
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:43.960]  I could have sworn I sent you that.
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:45.480]  Well Rob do sent it in a text.
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:46.480]  You guys can pull it up.
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:47.480]  Everybody's sharing it.
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:48.840]  I remember I did share it actually.
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:50.200]  I did send it to you guys.
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:51.200]  But you can find it.
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.160]  It's all over the internet and it's a video because I've got all this other news that's
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.200]  just totally weird.
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:58.200]  So I get it.
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:01:59.800]  While you guys search for that, let me just mention this other news.
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.960]  I get why people look at things and think the craziest stuff.
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:07.760]  Here's news stories for an example.
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:14.720]  American Airlines ground worker killed, ingested into the engine of aircraft.
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:18.200]  Cancelled Alabama flight was expected to depart Montgomery Regional Airport to Dallas
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:28.160]  Fort Worth Saturday afternoon when an employee got sucked up into the engine.
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:30.560]  That's crazy.
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:34.840]  Rogue wave strikes, hold off on the clip for now.
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:40.160]  Rogue wave strikes Antarctic cruise ship, leaves one dead and four injured.
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:42.640]  Rogue wave coming from Antarctica.
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:47.720]  Rogue wave coming from Antarctica strikes a ship, kills one, injures four others.
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:49.240]  Rogue wave?
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:51.720]  They're investigating.
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:59.520]  Then spends $15,000 on hyper realistic costume to live life as a dog.
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:02.840]  And then you've got the whole phenomenon of Miami and these other police departments
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:05.520]  making gay pride police vehicles.
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:09.640]  So anyway, and I'm not just giving Rob do a hard time here.
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:15.360]  He was one of like four or five people that sent me this clip of a basketball player and
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:18.880]  other guests that I've had on the show before that go on other shows and do their own podcast
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:23.680]  like Jelissa Danielle, she shared it and I mean, it's going everywhere.
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:27.400]  And it's this clip, put the clip on the screen.
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:31.240]  And I guess the theory is that somehow the simulation is breaking down and the matrix
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:35.160]  is breaking down if you will, which I do agree with that, but let's not completely lose our
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:36.160]  minds.
[03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:38.960]  And so I guess people here and Rob do can come defend himself.
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:43.480]  People think you have an instance of a basketball like disappearing.
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:46.720]  Let me explain this because we just folks, I get it.
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:47.800]  I get it.
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:48.960]  These are weird.
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:50.360]  The world is a crazy place.
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:51.360]  I mean, look at this.
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:53.360]  I mean, I got stacks of this stuff.
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:57.600]  NHS allows trans males to treat women who request same sex staff.
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:03:58.600]  So you're a woman.
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:03:59.600]  You say, I only want to be treated with a woman.
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:00.920]  They send a man in and say, that's a woman.
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:02.120]  I mean, this is, I get it.
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:06.200]  The world's insane, but folks, the ball does not disappear.
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:07.440]  Okay.
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:11.800]  You're not watching a simulation or a matrix or a video game.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:14.840]  When you're watching NBA games, there's people in the stands.
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:15.840]  There's announcers.
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:16.840]  There's players.
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:19.640]  The ball didn't disappear and reappear in Clay Thompson's hands.
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:24.080]  But since people believe that's what happens, I'll go ahead and do a slow motion breakdown.
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:26.760]  Watch what happens here when Draymond Green gets the ball.
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.480]  Slow motion this for me.
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:30.240]  Watch his right arm.
[03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:33.280]  His right arm does a bounce pass.
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:34.960]  You can watch his right arm extend.
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:36.080]  He does a bounce pass.
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:41.840]  And then the ball just happens to get cut off by the camera angle because the ball bounces
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.480]  right in front of Clay Thompson.
[03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:49.560]  When people are sitting here thinking what, that the ball just disappeared in front of
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:54.320]  an entire audience and then reappeared in Clay Thompson's hands, it was a bounce pass.
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:56.560]  The ball got cut off by the camera angle.
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:04:58.200]  Please people.
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:04.000]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing infor wars, attacking myself and
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  the crew and our other hosts?
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:07.880]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:09.600]  They know we're telling the truth.
[03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:11.160]  They know we've got their number.
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:15.880]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:20.440]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:23.720]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[03:05:23.720 --> 03:05:29.760]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:38.440]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:42.400]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:45.400]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:53.800]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[03:06:04.480 --> 03:06:11.880]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:11.880 --> 03:06:17.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, a couple of things here to note with Alex
[03:06:17.560 --> 03:06:21.040]  out, you know, people tune in to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:23.560]  I mean, I'm no dummy.
[03:06:23.560 --> 03:06:27.160]  I know a lot of people when they see or hear me, they just want to hear from Alex and so
[03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:28.160]  they tune out.
[03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:32.360]  And so sadly, we don't get the funds we need when Alex is out.
[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:35.200]  So please make up for that, shop at infowarstore.com.
[03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:38.560]  Remember to support us financially by going to infowarstore.com today.
[03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:41.820]  It's even more important when Alex is out.
[03:06:41.820 --> 03:06:45.760]  But as I said, I've got some other things I need to take care of, too, with Alex being
[03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:49.400]  out and so I'm not going to be doing double duty today, plus he wants to hear six hours
[03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:50.400]  of Owen Troyer every day.
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:51.960]  That's just a little much.
[03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:56.920]  But I'm following the speaker vote so much, I'm excited to watch Kevin McCarthy go double
[03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:02.120]  McCarthy Platinum sombrero that I may be hanging around or even going on to the war room with
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:03.120]  Pete Santilli.
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:09.400]  But one of the things that I have to address here now to handle a little business and we're
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:13.320]  making sure of this because we have so many moving parts.
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:21.560]  But there is what appears to be a fishing attempt or some sort of email fraud campaign
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:22.560]  going around.
[03:07:22.560 --> 03:07:23.560]  You may have seen this.
[03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:26.340]  I had a couple of people reach out to me about it last night.
[03:07:26.340 --> 03:07:28.520]  We did some digging just to make sure it's not us.
[03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:32.120]  Like I said, there's so many moving parts and stuff around here.
[03:07:32.120 --> 03:07:36.480]  Some projects are ours that may not be connected or we may be helping or whatever.
[03:07:36.480 --> 03:07:42.440]  But the point is, there's a fraudulent thing going on and you may have seen it and if you
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:46.620]  do see it in the future, you need to be one of it and that's this thing called Alex Jones
[03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:48.400]  Inner Circle.
[03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:54.580]  And emails are going around from AJ at alexjonesinnercircle.com requesting information saying it's
[03:07:54.580 --> 03:07:58.920]  part of some club with access to Alex Jones that is not us.
[03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:04.840]  We have no idea what it is or who is running it or where that information is going.
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:08.040]  And so this is just kind of some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[03:08:08.040 --> 03:08:14.040]  But since this one is directly targeting our audience, I wanted to come here and just let
[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:15.040]  you know about that.
[03:08:15.040 --> 03:08:20.320]  So if you see anything about an Alex Jones Inner Circle email campaign or promotional
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:24.340]  campaign or website or anything like that, that is not us.
[03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:25.440]  We don't know who that is.
[03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:27.440]  We don't know what that is.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:33.320]  And it's kind of a weird paradox to be in because we're free to air.
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:36.920]  People can promote us and do all kinds of different artwork and stuff that helps promote
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:39.960]  us and we promote that and we like that.
[03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:45.600]  But then also that kind of opens up stuff like this where maybe there's some ulterior
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:47.840]  motive there and we have no connection to it.
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:51.480]  We don't know who it is, what it is, so we just want to warn you that's not us.
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:56.920]  Whatever this Alex Jones Inner Circle thing is going around, it is not us.
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:08:59.400]  Boy, oh boy.
[03:08:59.400 --> 03:09:05.360]  All right, let's look at a couple other stories here before the guest host takes over.
[03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:06.600]  I found this hilarious.
[03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:13.280]  So the mainstream media that hates Elon Musk keeps telling you that hate speech is up on
[03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:14.280]  Twitter.
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:15.280]  Well, actually, they're wrong.
[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:19.320]  Guys, just quickly here, play it for me, clip seven.
[03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:45.280]  Okay, so hate speech is down at Twitter.
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:46.960]  Well, okay.
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:49.440]  Where is the hate speech going?
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:53.920]  Well, I can tell you that headline, Washington Post.
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:58.960]  Democrats leave Twitter to join alternative mastodon in protest of Musk.
[03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:04.800]  So all the Democrats and the liberals left Twitter and hate speech went down.
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:06.240]  Go figure.
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:09.680]  It gets even better, follow up report.
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:16.360]  Majority of content on mastodon social media site is child porn and this is a new phenomenon.
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:20.640]  So imagine hate speech goes down on Twitter when Democrats leave.
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:23.720]  Child porn goes up on mastodon when Democrats join.
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:31.240]  I think that's a coincidence.
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:34.680]  Donald Trump Jr. signs big deal for new podcasts on rumble.
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:38.600]  You know, I really do like Donald Trump Jr. and I really do like his takes.
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:43.040]  But if he wants to have a successful podcast, he's really going to need to polish his delivery
[03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:47.520]  style because it's very clunky and rough around the edges.
[03:10:47.520 --> 03:10:49.520]  I'm saying this as a fan of Donald Trump Jr.
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:53.320]  I really like him and I actually think I like his politics better than his father's, even
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:56.640]  Eric's as well at this point, but that's not here nor there.
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:10:59.200]  So if you're interested in that, I'll maybe be checking that out.
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:06.360]  But hope Don Jr. kind of polices himself up a little bit.
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:11.120]  Just smooth out your delivery a little bit, a little less clunky, a little less iteration
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:17.240]  and ups and downs in the voice, but seven figure podcast deal for Don Jr. with rumble.
[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:18.240]  I like it though.
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:19.640]  I like it.
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:23.280]  I like it.
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:27.680]  White House repeats claim that talking about the border makes it insecure.
[03:11:27.680 --> 03:11:29.080]  Oh, that's what it is.
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:32.880]  So it's the borders wide open and then you saying the borders wide open is causing the
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:34.640]  border to be wide open.
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:37.880]  Man, that's just genius stuff.
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:42.040]  This is probably your fault too for saying the borders open smuggler crashes at border
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:44.720]  patrol checkpoint during high speed chase.
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:45.720]  And this happens all the time.
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:47.160]  I've seen a couple while we were down there.
[03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:51.640]  A lot of times results in fatalities, a lot of times children are in these vehicles.
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:52.640]  But there you go.
[03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:54.440]  That only happened because you said the border was open.
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:59.400]  See that that smuggler was not going to try to traffic those humans in until you a conservative
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:01.480]  said the border was open.
[03:12:01.480 --> 03:12:03.600]  You see that's that's the White House logic there.
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:11.760]  You know, come on now, just more news of the weird here.
[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:15.640]  I mean, guys, what is this?
[03:12:15.640 --> 03:12:18.560]  Try to keep up with this.
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:24.600]  Co-founder of queer indigenous artist collection in Wisconsin is unmasked as a white woman
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:28.640]  after claiming she was Native American and two spirit.
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:35.320]  Now this is interesting because let's think logically about this.
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:42.660]  So she's bad because she's a white woman pretending to be Native American, just like Elizabeth
[03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:43.660]  Warren.
[03:12:43.660 --> 03:12:45.640]  But Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat, so she has Democrat privilege.
[03:12:45.640 --> 03:12:49.600]  But this one was a liberal too, so what's the problem?
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:54.840]  But wait a second though, if she's two spirit and you believe that gender is a spectrum,
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:12:58.920]  well, why can't race be considered a spectrum because in case you haven't noticed, there's
[03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:01.080]  no consistency on that anymore.
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:05.120]  So you can be white and be Jewish, but you're not white, you're Jewish.
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:09.640]  But you can be white and Christian, but you're not Christian, you're white.
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:12.560]  So race actually now has nothing to do with skin color.
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:14.920]  They're even admitting it.
[03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:19.120]  I mean, really, if it's about skin color, then really how many different skin colors
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:20.120]  are there?
[03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:21.120]  Either you're white, you're brown, or you're black.
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:25.240]  I mean, it's basically from white to black, and you know, you may be anything in between.
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:30.920]  No matter what your so-posed racial identity or heritage is, there's black people that
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:35.840]  have light skin, there's white people that are really tan, and look brown.
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:39.920]  So who's to say it could all be a spectrum?
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:42.920]  But isn't it funny because they talk about white privilege, white privilege, white privilege,
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:46.280]  but then why do all these white people pretend to be something they're not in order to get
[03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:47.280]  ahead in the world?
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:49.520]  I don't know, I'm done.
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:56.360]  Two men arrested for sabotaging four electrical power substations in Washington state.
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:01.520]  So we've had this phenomenon in the last two years of all the sabotage.
[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:07.240]  We've had all the sabotage power stations, food processing centers, oil refineries, all
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:10.200]  this stuff, and now we had two men just arrested.
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:15.480]  Are these eco-terrorists, leftists like we've seen before?
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:19.480]  Could this have something to do with all the other incidents we've seen at power stations,
[03:14:19.480 --> 03:14:23.320]  which by the way, remember the one that happened on the east coast, I forget where, and they
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:29.080]  said, this sabotage of the power station was done by Christian conservative Trump supporters
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:31.880]  who don't like drag queen story time.
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:34.000]  What?
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.280]  Just total insanity.
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:40.240]  Here's another liberal Democrat fail, but for them maybe it's a good thing.
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:44.040]  Celebrity-backed bail group collapses after helping free serial criminal.
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:48.200]  Yeah, how many criminals did the Democrats and the liberals free in the name of George
[03:14:48.200 --> 03:14:50.240]  Floyd or Black Lives Matter?
[03:14:50.240 --> 03:14:51.560]  But what does this do?
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:53.800]  This is why people are leaving Democrat cities.
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:55.440]  Wall Street Journal, first of the year.
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:59.600]  The blue state exodus continues.
[03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:00.600]  And where are they going?
[03:15:00.600 --> 03:15:08.800]  Of course, red states, 10 states that lost the most population from 2021 to 2022.
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:13.200]  California Democrat, New York Democrat, Illinois Democrat, New Jersey Democrat, Massachusetts
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:14.200]  Democrat.
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:20.840]  Louisiana Republican, Maryland Democrat, Pennsylvania, well, Democrats steal it, Virginia Republican
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:26.120]  right now, Minnesota Democrat, Florida, where they gained population, Republican, Texas
[03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:30.800]  where they gained population, Republican, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Republican,
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:34.920]  Republican, Republican, and then Georgia, which is Republican, but they stole it, Arizona
[03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:38.960]  Republican, but they stole it, Idaho Republican, Alabama Republican, Oklahoma Republican.
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:45.560]  So all the blue states are losing population and all the red states are gaining population.
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:51.200]  But I'm sure that's not a sign of how bad Democrat Party leadership and policy is, right?
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:57.400]  I'm sure it has nothing to do with that or how good some of these Republicans have been.
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:04.760]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the wellness company.

[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:15.280]  been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:00.840]  Info wars secret weapon is finally here.

[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:19.280]  the country.

[03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:17.840]  guest.
[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:21.440]  If you know her and I know her I absolutely love her what a fountain of knowledge she
[03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:22.600]  is and wisdom.
[03:20:22.600 --> 03:20:27.960]  Dr. Lee Merritt is joining me Dr. Lee Merritt began her medical career at the age of four
[03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:34.360]  carrying her father's black bag on house calls and completed an orthopedic surgery residency
[03:20:34.360 --> 03:20:38.880]  in the United States Navy served over nine years as a Navy physician and surgeon and
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:43.480]  of course served on the board of the Arizona Medical Association past president of the
[03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:46.800]  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:52.960]  I could go on and on the medical rebel dot com is her website and I wanted to chat with
[03:20:52.960 --> 03:20:59.040]  her today I wanted to talk to her about the DeMar Hamlin headlines that seem to be just
[03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:05.720]  grabbing the nation and maybe why I also have just basic questions about where are we at
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:10.040]  right now because a lot of people after three years we hear bits and pieces and bits and
[03:21:10.040 --> 03:21:15.640]  pieces of information and so what where are we now and a lot of people are asking this
[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:20.120]  how do I how do I arm myself with information going to friends and family because I know
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:24.920]  bits and pieces but I but I want to know right now where we're at and so I welcome you Dr.
[03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:27.120]  Lee Merritt how are you.
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:29.120]  Hey thanks for having me back.
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:32.120]  Oh so glad.
[03:21:32.120 --> 03:21:38.000]  Yeah I can see now I had to I had to my Skype my somehow my communication with Skype is
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:42.400]  not good I'm not a techie my my younger son is coming home for Christmas maybe he can get
[03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:49.360]  me up to speed and I need a 10 year old you know that's my problem.
[03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:55.760]  Well let me let me say this the DeMar Hamlin it seems to be science improvement I just
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:00.840]  I actually just got off of a pre-tape interview with Dr. Peter McCullough and he made this
[03:22:00.840 --> 03:22:06.840]  observation and he said you know the reason that the faces were so distraught of the team
[03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:12.720]  members of the faculty of of the coaches everybody the reason that it was hitting so hard this
[03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:21.480]  particular case is because he believes it's coming from the shots because of the significant
[03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:27.280]  help that it is to have these pads in place the breast plates everything else to stop
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:33.800]  a hit to the sternum right and to also stop these kinds of tackles from causing said cardiac
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:39.200]  arrest that would that would manage in itself in a direct fall right after instead of days
[03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:43.120]  after usually it's days after there have been studies where it says days after they could
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:48.400]  see the effects of maybe getting hit in the heart but but not instant right and so he
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:53.320]  said you know those faces of those distraught are probably because they realize that those
[03:22:53.320 --> 03:22:58.480]  shots may be the issue and I wanted to get your take on that.
[03:22:58.480 --> 03:23:02.520]  Well yeah I mean you know you don't need to be reading medical literature to figure this
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:08.920]  out this is one of those things that a little common sense can can go a long way we see
[03:23:08.920 --> 03:23:15.840]  hits worse than that all the time you know and I'm going to tell you something too if
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:21.560]  this weren't related to the vaccine you'd be hearing people and it was happening so
[03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:26.840]  if this weren't related to the vaccine then we would be seeing unvaccinated people falling
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:31.760]  over and we we don't we're not hearing because we would hear about that don't you know we
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:35.440]  would hear people say wait a minute no no you guys it's not the vaccine because so and
[03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:40.240]  so and so and so and so on wasn't vaccinated and they fell over they know the truth okay
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:44.400]  now the other thing is you can't just look at this well the other thing is before I get
[03:23:44.400 --> 03:23:48.720]  to that I think one of the things you can notice is they're lying about things to try
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:52.560]  and cover it up now that tells you all you need to know probably my favorite one was
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:57.400]  when they discern discern that it was the referees whistles that was scaring people
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:24:02.360]  into having cardiac issues are you kidding me we've had referees whistles I think forever
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:07.400]  so when they come up with stuff like that or cold weather or what are some of the other
[03:24:07.400 --> 03:24:13.520]  crazy explanations that they've had the fact that they're putting defibrillators on the
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:19.560]  outside of people's doors in England tells you but here's what I did okay let's just
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:25.160]  first of all it's not just football it's like then soccer we've been looking a lot at soccer
[03:24:25.160 --> 03:24:29.880]  because Europe got vaccinated before we did and we've heard I heard through the grapevine
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:36.640]  that 10 soccer teams 10 fifa level soccer teams are essentially dead after this now you know
[03:24:36.640 --> 03:24:40.960]  the the people doing this always give the excuse well but that's still not very many people
[03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:44.480]  compared to the billions that we've been vaccinated that's not the way you look at it that's apples
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:48.880]  and oranges you want to look at have you ever heard of 10 soccer teams dying in one year
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:53.840]  these are young healthy guys what's going on here so I went to look at this okay and
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:58.680]  it turns out that the fifa data goes back to 1889 they don't tell you about the all the
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:03.280]  deaths okay we can only look the fifa keeps the scores of death on the field and this
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:07.000]  is a very interesting thing anybody can do this it's open art well now that I've been
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:10.480]  talking about they'll probably take it off the air but anyway you could find it a month
[03:25:10.480 --> 03:25:15.760]  ago a couple months ago when I looked at it now it goes by month and it goes by year and
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:20.920]  when I went when I went through the the years from 1889 to 1999 they were on the average
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:29.400]  zero to three on field deaths a year and what were they from they were mostly from not cardiac
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:34.800]  but they were from being struck by the gold thing falling over on you or running into
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:41.240]  somebody or my favorite apparently is a really dangerous problem of being hit by lightning
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:45.360]  you can't believe how many soccer players are killed by lightning every year so anyway
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:49.960]  but the average number of deaths between those in those 110 years that we've been measuring
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:57.920]  it fifa's been measuring 1889 zero to three deaths now in 2021 we had 27 deaths on the
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:05.240]  field so number one is orders of magnitude worse and number two it's all cardiac now
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:12.040]  here's the other point what I stopped at 99 what about 2000 to 2020 very interesting
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:18.000]  so this problem did not start with this vaccine it did not start in 2021 this is just a magnum
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:27.200]  opus okay from 20 from 2000 to 2020 the deaths went up from zero to three to three to 10
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:34.000]  and they were mostly cardiac now what changed between the 90s and the 2000s oh well I can
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:38.440]  think of a couple one is this is the generation of kids are now getting like 80 shots in by
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:44.200]  the time they get out of high school and they also are getting this flu vaccine okay flu
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:48.440]  vaccine is associated with lots of bad things it's one of the more toxic things that we've
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:54.640]  been exposed to recently and the reason I think it's not by accident this is true is
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:27:02.000]  because the military also seems to have this increase in myocarditis in those years so
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.400]  and nobody was paying attention to it nobody was doing I think where are all the university
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:12.360]  boys why weren't somebody noticing that young people were having an increased risk of myocarditis
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:17.560]  so I you know I'm sorry I I know that it's it's hard to think this is all preplanned
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:22.600]  but it's all preplanned and and who's it attacking primarily let's just let's just
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:26.920]  look at this because you have to kind of look at this like a who done it this is like a mystery
[03:27:26.920 --> 03:27:33.920]  novel it turns out I mean these things it's yes young women can have it too but it's primarily
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:38.520]  young men for some reason whether it's hormones or their level of activity something it's more
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:43.480]  we we more see young men dying than we see young women dying well why would that be an
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:47.800]  issue well let's see we have the military's been forcibly vaccinated the border patrol
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:53.960]  the police the fire units our trauma surgeons all predominantly young men you know that
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:28:00.160]  would take out the infrastructure of the security of our nation or any nation that took it I'm
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:07.440]  just not and oh and by the way we got the blueprint from the communist Chinese scientists
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:12.800]  not our allies now I'm not saying they're the primary mover here because quite frankly
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:16.600]  the other thing that people have to wake up to if you want to know where we are in 2023
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:21.160]  we're still not at this point yet where we need to be because people are saying what
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:25.040]  do you mean we had they had bio weapons labs in Ukraine what do you mean we had something
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:29.920]  to do with it well let me tell you let's just go back in time a little and I know you like
[03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:35.080]  to read old newspapers and I you know it's kind of like that kind of a story in fact

[03:32:58.800 --> 03:33:12.560]  Making a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.560 --> 03:33:16.480]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones show I'm Kate Dally your guest host my guest is
[03:33:16.480 --> 03:33:21.040]  Dr. Lee Merritt my friend and let me just tell you a fountain of knowledge that's all
[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:25.640]  I could say about Dr. Lee Merritt fountain of knowledge I learned so much from her every
[03:33:25.640 --> 03:33:32.280]  time I speak with her and let me tell you there's a lot of concern a lot of distraught
[03:33:32.280 --> 03:33:39.720]  over the impact of watching a player go down and realizing that the NFL took part of that
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:45.720]  13 billion dollars from the feds and distributed that for promotion and really sort of a mandate
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:53.640]  of the COVID-19 blovid-19 shot and shots boosters and we're seeing the fallout of that and I
[03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:58.040]  think that distraught on their faces was oh my gosh we were made to take the same thing
[03:33:58.040 --> 03:34:03.520]  and I think that's why the players were really heavily emotional about this as well and we
[03:34:03.520 --> 03:34:07.040]  are just going to go into a little bit of history because we learned so much more history
[03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:12.040]  the patterns of history that seem to just keep replicating themselves that's what a
[03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:18.680]  pattern is and we fail to see it as as people as Americans as humankind these well-laid
[03:34:18.680 --> 03:34:25.680]  plans and the fallout of these well-laid plans on us the citizenry my guest Dr. Lee Merritt
[03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:29.360]  talking a little bit about history and and you were right you were talking about the
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:35.680]  deaths per year 29 on average I guess per year in athletes we're talking the the most
[03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:41.480]  healthy the most fit you know the most the most of everything right these are the examples
[03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:52.320]  of finely tuned machines right and then in the last year and a half now we have 1598
[03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:58.920]  problems with heart attacks things like this plots and then 11 over just over 1100 fatalities
[03:34:58.920 --> 03:35:04.920]  going from 29 a year on average to 1100 fatalities in a year and a half and the media is silent
[03:35:04.920 --> 03:35:10.640]  it's insane so we'll talk a little bit of history to yeah and pilots to I mean when
[03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:15.520]  have we seen pilots dying in the cockpit of our commercial jets and we're seeing that
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:19.640]  I mean you know it just they're trying to talk all of this away and when you look at
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:25.720]  the preponderance of evidence it's all caused mortality is off the roof sterility is up
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:34.040]  infertility is that is up I mean still birth is up fetal loss is horrendous in women that
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:40.480]  get vaccinated the first two trimesters it's 80% fetal loss it's unbelievable and that
[03:35:40.480 --> 03:35:43.800]  doesn't count the still birth so we're in a demographic nightmare with this and if they
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:48.120]  keep denying this why would they deny it because they know they're guilty I'm just going to
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:51.280]  say there's another point to this and that's what I was going to get into about this Ukrainian
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:56.120]  bio weapons labs how does that play a role well I was giving a talk at the freedom law
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:00.520]  school about you know at their meeting last year and I just realized when I got up there
[03:36:00.520 --> 03:36:04.280]  to speak I realized I started out by saying you know I'm just listening to all you guys
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:09.960]  and I realized all my life I've paid taxes like a good little citizen so that my country
[03:36:09.960 --> 03:36:17.040]  my country not China not some other place you know not Russia not not Poland my country
[03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:21.360]  United States of America could buy bio weapon years to poison my children and I think I'm
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:27.160]  really over that that's what's happened here if you go back in time to the nun Luger act
[03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:33.040]  of 1991 they were this idea that nobody knew about these Ukrainian labs come on now we
[03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:38.760]  were paying those guys we were paying the bio weapon years so in 1991 the nun Luger
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:43.280]  act was signed and the idea was that the Soviet Union was coming apart and they had all these
[03:36:43.280 --> 03:36:48.920]  socialist republics around the outside that had these you know weapons labs and bio weapons
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:55.880]  labs they had it was basically bill preparat and they had they had nuclear stores and things
[03:36:55.880 --> 03:36:59.960]  like that and the idea was well we can't let these guys get in all this stuff get into
[03:36:59.960 --> 03:37:04.480]  the bad hands because they can't afford to protect them well you know the kindness of
[03:37:04.480 --> 03:37:08.960]  our heart will go over and will help them so we gave them so the nun Luger act assigned
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:14.120]  allocated $400 million a year for I think four or five years in order for us to essentially
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:18.800]  buy up these labs at a fire sale we didn't actually own them but we took control over
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:25.200]  them we funded the rehab we sent our people over to supervise them we specifically tasked
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:30.880]  them with gain of function research with vaccine research and production getting these things
[03:37:30.880 --> 03:37:34.920]  to make them useful that's what we did and these are not just in the Ukraine I mean and
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:39.960]  they didn't hide it you know in in Tbilisi Georgia the lab was called the Luger lab named
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:47.000]  for Senator Luger you know how insane is this so we are part of this now I can't prove exactly
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:51.840]  where this came from but the idea that it's a leak out of a Chinese lab I think is just
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:58.320]  laughable and I've had a lot of opportunity to talk to other people like myself that have
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:03.440]  plenty of time that have scientific background to research this and we're not being paid
[03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:08.280]  by anybody to go speak you know those are the qualifications of somebody that you can
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:14.400]  believe maybe and so Karen Kingston for example and I chatted now I've come to the conclusion
[03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:19.200]  that one of the ways a major way that this this vaccine is damaging and killing people
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:23.800]  is through the through your own parasites so liberating your own parasites it sounds
[03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:29.360]  a little crazy but it turns out that your parasites and we all have parasites and this
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:34.440]  vaccine seems to be knocking down the part of the immune system that keeps them in check
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:38.920]  we also have a lot of new information coming out about parasites being the cause of cancer
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:43.640]  parasites being the cause of MS parasites being the cause of dementia and neurologic
[03:38:43.640 --> 03:38:47.800]  other neurologic diseases and all sorts of things that we were yes that is a critical
[03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:52.080]  video you should really watch that and I have a whole video on the parasite paradigm on
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:56.680]  my website that will take you to that link so this is from German researchers I mean
[03:38:56.680 --> 03:39:00.520]  this is not just me saying this I'm just collating it because these guys have been screaming
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:04.960]  about this for years and it just hasn't gotten out to people so I'm trying to scream a little
[03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:11.720]  louder and and the point I'm going to say is that it it it may not be exactly what we're
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:16.120]  thinking is happening with these vaccines in other words they're the Lecinta Columna
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:20.080]  the German lab the German consortium they haven't found any genetic material in this
[03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:26.920]  stuff but they found everybody has found hydrogel graphene oxide and these particulate metals
[03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:32.280]  so well I shouldn't say everybody everybody that's a truly independent lab that I know
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:40.080]  of so what what's happening is I think and and and and we also know by the way that wavelength
[03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:45.080]  can produce disease all by itself if I bombard you with a certain wavelength if I capture
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:50.280]  the electromagnetic signal the so all the Russians called the full Tony Smith the death
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:56.200]  photons I could create disease and I create symptomatic disease specific symptoms disease
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:40:00.520]  so there's a lot of opportunities here to damage people in a specific way that have
[03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:06.000]  nothing to do with genetics they may be leading us down that that path and and I think that
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:11.720]  Karen Kingston's onto something because when you look at like when I look at the lab the
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:16.680]  research that was done so in like in that Ukrainian lab and back in the 90s we had our
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:21.120]  guys our paid bio weaponaries I know one I'm I don't want to get wax I'm not gonna name
[03:40:21.120 --> 03:40:28.080]  any names today but you know he was working on bat coronavirus in the 90s okay and then
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:32.800]  we also know of course Ralph Barrick was working on bat coronavirus but what what she pointed
[03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:40.920]  out is one of his last research papers said essentially this it said yeah we were working
[03:40:40.920 --> 03:40:45.120]  on this bat coronavirus as a gain of function stuff but it just didn't work very well meaning
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:50.200]  translated we couldn't get this to kill anybody we couldn't get it to make people sick we tried
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:56.000]  we tried it didn't work this also goes along let me just say see there's lots of disparate
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:59.240]  I know I mean to be jumping around but it's all sorts of information from all sorts of
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:06.040]  different places so we've been kind of pointing the finger at at Feng Zhang in the in the MIT
[03:41:06.040 --> 03:41:11.040]  Zhang lab because he's kind of the father of CRISPR young guy but very you know this is
[03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:16.920]  what he has been taught it touts as being the father of but it turns out he said on
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:21.480]  his MIT site he says you know when we talk about gene insertion and genetic manipulation
[03:41:21.480 --> 03:41:26.800]  we can drop out genes but we're not very good we really can't insert things precisely I
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:31.240]  read that and I said what you know this is what they've been telling us they've been
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:38.120]  doing all this precise manipulation of this so what's really going on well you know I
[03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:44.040]  think what he and if you look at what his PhD is in by the way it's in optogenetics
[03:41:44.040 --> 03:41:52.440]  in other words wavelength changing genetic phenotypic expression not change not inserting
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:58.760]  little letters and things but using wavelength to change how your genes function and that
[03:41:58.760 --> 03:42:03.240]  is I think with the heart of this now that's what Karen Kingston said when she said they've
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:08.240]  developed this hydrogel that she found in the research and the hydrogel again goes along
[03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:13.040]  with what we're finding these independent labs hydrogel normal stuff is just like they make
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:17.880]  soft contact lens as a it's a it's a it's a plastic or it's a polymer that absorbs
[03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:26.400]  water now smart hydrogel can be changed its shape based on something external like wavelength
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:31.040]  so you make a high picture this this is where this goes if you have time for the punch line
[03:42:31.040 --> 03:42:35.080]  or we'll wait but that's let's wait let's go on the flip side of the break we're about
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:38.560]  to go to a break but I want to hear about this because this is where it gets really interesting
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:43.640]  hard for people to take in this info but very important because there's so many aspects coming
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:48.480]  at us and they're utilizing so many different ways to do this too and I think that's really
[03:42:48.480 --> 03:42:53.640]  important as well I'll be right back my guest Dr. Lee Merritt of course the amazing Dr. Lee
[03:42:53.640 --> 03:43:01.320]  Merritt on the Alex Jones show so there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield
[03:43:01.320 --> 03:43:08.160]  this is an information war info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and
[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:13.600]  today whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone they're all
[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:19.440]  using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:24.080]  and we know how to beat them but we can't do it without funding we make it easy to fund
[03:43:24.080 --> 03:43:28.240]  with great products and power you and your immune system and your family as well you

[03:43:58.640 --> 03:44:06.120]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist I have come from nowhere to the
[03:44:06.120 --> 03:44:12.000]  very heights of politics not just in America but the world we are engaging the globalist
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:17.840]  at point like range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I've persevered
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:24.080]  but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason we've had the success
[03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:28.320]  we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've
[03:44:28.320 --> 03:44:35.760]  ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:40.040]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:44.840]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them God bless you all I salute
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:50.080]  you I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over
[03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:55.200]  the target and history is happening the fight is my fight it's your fight it's our fight
[03:44:55.200 --> 03:45:00.160]  God bless you all you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their globalist
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:05.440]  agenda well so do I and I've been the most effective individual in the fight against
[03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:10.240]  the globalist and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down but ladies and
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:15.440]  gentlemen I can't do it without your support and the good news is we're only under about
[03:45:15.440 --> 03:45:20.160]  two hundred thousand dollars a month the bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks

[03:47:13.840 --> 03:47:18.640]  k dally your guest host for the hour my guest dr lee merritt the wonderful dr lee merritt
[03:47:18.640 --> 03:47:24.000]  happy new year to you i i don't know about this year i i when i saw the new york post
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:29.960]  uh op ed about short people mary short so you can help with climate change um i think
[03:47:29.960 --> 03:47:34.680]  it's the year of the loon bag i think it's the year that we're going to see people spiral
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:40.680]  out of control and we're going to just see how how ridiculous people can become i i don't
[03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:45.360]  know why i just have this feeling uh that that's this year uh but uh we thought it was
[03:47:45.360 --> 03:47:49.700]  bad before no it's going to get worse in that way but we have so many different things coming
[03:47:49.700 --> 03:47:58.440]  at us but today's focus is is the is the awareness of americans all over the country thinking
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:04.400]  i took those shots i took those shots to those that did and i'm so grateful i didn't i've
[03:48:04.400 --> 03:48:09.960]  never met a person yet that didn't take it and regretted it regretted not taking it everybody
[03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:15.240]  that didn't take it's like who so glad i didn't do this we were talking about hydrogel going
[03:48:15.240 --> 03:48:20.280]  into uh this last second into this last segment or out of the last segment so let's let's go
[03:48:20.280 --> 03:48:26.080]  from there uh dr merit right because i'm actually i guess i'm more hopeful i i think
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:30.520]  we're coming into the year we win i think we're going to see the end of a 2000 year war
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:35.600]  and i think we're going to solve this problem because i think it's solvable um we're just
[03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:39.640]  ignoring it the the the problem these guys are having they're dying because nobody's
[03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:44.200]  telling them the truth and they're not listening so don't think it's an irreversible problem
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:48.840]  i don't think it is in fact i've even heard um christian northrup told me that she's had
[03:48:48.840 --> 03:48:54.320]  some people that that have solved the infertility problem so i'm telling you i think we have
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:59.440]  we we know a lot but but here's the hydrogel idea the idea is this has nothing to do with
[03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:04.000]  genetic manipulation because that's you know if you think you had your gene your genome
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:07.680]  altered that's really depressing and you think oh i might as well just give up hope i'm out
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:12.160]  of it no no that's and plus these guys are cheap you know that's a very expensive technology
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:16.520]  the hydrogel is not i'm i'm voting on the hydrogel it was a million dollars a dose in
[03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:23.080]  2018 to do genetics i don't think they're going to use that so the hydrogel is a is a conformable
[03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:27.760]  substance and what they're doing is if you think about how do you get sick with this
[03:49:27.760 --> 03:49:31.760]  they made you sick because you have a thing in your body called an ace two pathway think
[03:49:31.760 --> 03:49:36.320]  of it as a door lock okay and to get into you they had to put a key in the door lock
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:41.280]  that key is the hydrogel and the hydrogel can be first they can dose you by they just
[03:49:41.280 --> 03:49:44.320]  put it out in the environment and people pick it up and they get it in their mouth they get
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:47.360]  it on their hands and they've got it in them but it doesn't have it's not in the right
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:52.200]  shape to put the key in the lock then you turn on a wavelength because the very first
[03:49:52.200 --> 03:49:57.520]  victim was october 19th the day they turned on 5g and wuhan and and this is to be honest
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:01.480]  as i as i had lunch with karen kinks on one day i said you know between what you're saying
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:05.200]  what i'm saying about parasites it really explains everything and that's kind of a nice
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:09.360]  thinking we're not sure it's right or you know can't prove it's right right now but
[03:50:09.360 --> 03:50:13.360]  it does explain things better than what we've heard and what she's saying is that this thing
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:18.640]  you turn on a wavelength this thing this this this hydrogel conforms now and it fits into
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:22.560]  the ace two pathway and gives you all the things that we see to make people sick in
[03:50:22.560 --> 03:50:26.640]  favor of that is that the fact that it didn't spread like an airborne virus why would it
[03:50:26.640 --> 03:50:30.720]  why did it go to really do wuhan and then didn't go everywhere else why did it just go it went
[03:50:30.720 --> 03:50:35.320]  wuhan lombardi new york city and then it kind of fizzled out why why in my state of iowa
[03:50:35.320 --> 03:50:40.800]  did it kind of go periodically up the interstate 80 as if it were planted places right there's
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:44.320]  there's things that just don't make sense i mean and and the transmission they've never
[03:50:44.320 --> 03:50:48.040]  studied transmission they've never really done enough autopsies to know what's going
[03:50:48.040 --> 03:50:53.720]  on but in terms of what we do know by the chinese you know there's no there's no asymptomatic
[03:50:53.720 --> 03:50:57.240]  spread but there's also within the chinese themselves they were quarantined in their
[03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:01.480]  house so they know what they got into they know who they were with whom they were with
[03:51:01.480 --> 03:51:06.200]  and basically one person in the house could be sick and the other three weren't so it's
[03:51:06.200 --> 03:51:11.080]  not what they were telling us and to me this sounds like a tactile contact poison that
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:16.200]  was activated it makes sense so here's the beauty of it the other thing that they're
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:20.160]  doing is you know there's seven words that george carlin used to say you couldn't say
[03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:25.320]  on tv and nobody nobody cares about those but they do care about these six words these
[03:51:25.320 --> 03:51:31.360]  six words are nitrozoxanide chloroquine hydroxychloroquine ivermectin fendazol and chlorine
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:35.880]  dioxide in fact you'll go to jail for saying chlorine dioxide it's fine to kill you i thought
[03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:41.280]  you were going to say the government stuff yeah and those are the six words you can't
[03:51:41.280 --> 03:51:47.960]  say and then what are they they're all anti parasitic drugs now so so see that's my point
[03:51:47.960 --> 03:51:53.280]  is that you know you kind of can know your enemy by what he really hates and what does
[03:51:53.280 --> 03:51:58.920]  he really hate in this situation is anti parasitic drugs so i'm thinking we should really be
[03:51:58.920 --> 03:52:02.720]  looking at this now if you put this together what we're also hearing i'm hearing from my
[03:52:02.720 --> 03:52:07.360]  friends in the military that these guys that took the jab they get they get they get they
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:12.320]  come in and they have i mean first of all they're they've gone a huge number of of of
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:17.440]  increase in people showing up at sick call their their their whole the military readiness
[03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:22.600]  is down from this but one of the things that's unusual is that they're seeing when these young
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:25.920]  guys come in and they have a cancer they just don't have like we used to see testicular
[03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:31.120]  cancer it's an age related thing 25 year old guys get it periodically it's not that uncommon
[03:52:31.120 --> 03:52:35.920]  but you don't show up with it showered all over your body now they're showing up with
[03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:40.720]  can't with cancer all over their body now what is it really happening i think what's
[03:52:40.720 --> 03:52:46.000]  happening is these guys have been showered with parasites because they've been out if
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:51.960]  you look at that german field german film i mean what they what they show you is evidence
[03:52:51.960 --> 03:52:57.040]  of intracellular parasites these are not worms in your gut necessarily these are little intracellular
[03:52:57.040 --> 03:53:04.600]  parasites and and and a sack of intracellular parasites is indistinguishable from a cancer
[03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:10.560]  that's the problem is that we have been missing it on histology and so why would this happen
[03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:16.280]  in other words why we know what based on our beliefs about cancer why would these guys
[03:53:16.280 --> 03:53:21.280]  suddenly be showered well let's suppose this and i've i've looked at this and it gets technical
[03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:26.000]  but this seems to turn off the part of your immune system that allows these egg sacks
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:30.720]  that we all have we all have some parasites in our body it allows these egg sacks to escape
[03:53:30.720 --> 03:53:36.680]  the immune system and start growing and multiplying and that would explain a lot of what we're
[03:53:36.680 --> 03:53:43.400]  seeing now in favor of that is there's an underground cancer treatment it's fenbendazol.org
[03:53:43.400 --> 03:53:51.960]  is the is the website and so i think there's now the other the other potential this issue
[03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:57.680]  with the with the football player the question is what caused that now well we know that
[03:53:57.680 --> 03:54:02.880]  graphene oxide is a bad substance that it steals electrons and there's a belief that
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:07.800]  it can cause myocarditis i don't know the level of proof of that okay it's a good supposition
[03:54:07.800 --> 03:54:15.160]  i can prove that that i pretty well that the my that the um the graphene oxide is responsible
[03:54:15.160 --> 03:54:19.040]  for the low formation for the clumping of the red blood cells that you see okay and
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:25.120]  i can also tell you how we can redo that undo that because graphene oxide steals electrons
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:31.200]  if you replace the electrons the problem goes away we know how to do that so what we don't
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:36.440]  know for sure is is that what's causing the myocarditis but we know how to get we we think
[03:54:36.440 --> 03:54:40.560]  we know how to get we have ideas how to get the graphene oxide to be neutralized and then
[03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:44.920]  to get it out of you we know how to get the heavy metals out of you the real issue we
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:49.320]  don't know is the myocarditis now one of the things that should be looked at is there's
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:55.200]  a parasite called trypanosomacrusy and it's very common in south america it caused shogus
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:55:00.200]  disease but what what are its symptoms well when you first are infected with it it goes
[03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:06.600]  to the heart and it can cause these acute heart problems and then if it gets if it gets
[03:55:06.600 --> 03:55:10.640]  established it becomes very hard to get rid of so that ought to be checked for immediately
[03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:14.680]  i don't even think we're checking our blood supply for it i could be wrong but i don't
[03:55:14.680 --> 03:55:18.360]  think we're checking our blood supply for that parasite even though we know it's coming
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:25.120]  across the border so i i really think this is about parasites not the least of which
[03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:28.640]  i heard somebody say instead of calling these guys the elite we should call them what they
[03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:33.400]  really are parasites so maybe they're afraid we're going to use these drugs on them that's
[03:55:33.400 --> 03:55:38.760]  so true and they never want to discuss the truth so so to bypass this topic completely
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:43.240]  and act like all these things are a mystery and they can't figure out why but they refuse
[03:55:43.240 --> 03:55:48.680]  to look at parasites should be telling us a lot and we're in the age now of disinformation
[03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:53.720]  you know alex has been right for decades i mean god love alex jones and i appreciate
[03:55:53.720 --> 03:55:58.520]  everyone who supports him because he has been telling us way ahead of time about this we
[03:55:58.520 --> 03:56:03.760]  are in an info war we are in an information disinformation war and it's very hard to tell
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:08.800]  the truth and i will tell you my my scheme for for understanding what i think is true
[03:56:08.800 --> 03:56:14.320]  first of all if it's in a hierarchy at the top of every hierarchy is control and that's
[03:56:14.320 --> 03:56:19.240]  what they need to control us and to create lies if you find a rebel i didn't mean that
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:23.480]  as the pun but if you find people that are out on their own speaking that they're not
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:28.440]  getting money from anybody they're not associated with some organization they're more likely
[03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:32.960]  to be telling you this at their own expense that's more likely to be true unfortunately
[03:56:32.960 --> 03:56:39.320]  people are being bought to speak okay the other thing is what is the goal of disinformation
[03:56:39.320 --> 03:56:43.640]  it's not to stop the information getting out because they know that most of this information
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:49.320]  is out there in one form or another what they're doing is they're slowing down you paying attention
[03:56:49.320 --> 03:56:53.760]  to the right things in other words it's it's fine to talk right now about let's stop the
[03:56:53.760 --> 03:56:58.040]  vaccine stop the vaccine well okay almost everybody's been vaccinated how good is that
[03:56:58.040 --> 03:57:02.440]  lesson why don't you tell us how to get out of this let's be working on the next lesson
[03:57:02.440 --> 03:57:07.040]  on how to how do we get rid of this problem let's start being worried about our border
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:12.240]  security because we're in a demographic nightmare let's let's look for it let's look into the
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:17.000]  future we have to because it doesn't help to keep talking about the past and i'll just
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:20.920]  i just have to read you this quote because i think this is one of the better quotes
[03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:25.720]  about yeah the information war this is by uval harari not somebody you'd probably quote
[03:57:25.720 --> 03:57:31.240]  it more often but it's a 20 second ship yeah censorship no longer works by hiding information
[03:57:31.240 --> 03:57:35.320]  from you censorship works by flooding you with immense amounts of misinformation of
[03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:40.760]  irrelevant information of funny cat videos until you're just unable to focus there you
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:45.440]  go doctor we merit thank you for being on alex jones with me we'll see you next week
