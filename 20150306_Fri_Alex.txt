[00:47.600 --> 00:54.400]  you dovetail that with alan greenspan's latest statement mainstream financial experts recommend
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.400]  quote take out a loan and invest in the stock market and that ties into a new report with alan
[01:02.400 --> 01:10.960]  greenspan warned stocks are without a doubt extremely overvalued we've got intensifying

[01:28.400 --> 01:35.040]  him all this and more coming up but first here's a leon macadam report from info wars nightly news
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.760]  on google and some of the latest hacking so one of the big things that you're probably going to be
[01:39.760 --> 01:46.320]  seeing coming out of south by southwest is how technology is doing away with those pesky passwords
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.960]  and of course biometrics is being hailed as the best less hackable alternative but there's just
[01:52.960 --> 01:59.360]  one problem with that every single time they roll out a new biometric security measure it's bypassed
[01:59.360 --> 02:05.520]  with a really easy technique for instance eye scanning authentication can be skirted by simply
[02:05.520 --> 02:13.280]  printing a high res photo found in a google search security researcher jan starberg chrisler from the
[02:13.280 --> 02:20.160]  chaos computer club tells forbs how this kind of attack is possible the best targets are bright
[02:20.160 --> 02:27.920]  eyes because iris recognition systems work with infrared light also only 75 percent of a target's
[02:27.920 --> 02:35.360]  iris needs to be visible in photos and an iris diameter of only 75 pixels is necessary to be
[02:35.360 --> 02:42.080]  printed out with a resolution of 1200 dpi and believe it or not this can all be easily attained
[02:42.080 --> 02:48.720]  with readily available printers now starberg has already proven how easy a biometric hack can take
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.240]  place in december he showed off a clone of a thumbprint of the german defense minister
[02:54.240 --> 03:00.400]  ersola von der leyen and he was able to create this fake print using photos of the politician's
[03:00.400 --> 03:06.400]  hand now unlike a fingerprint attack where it is necessary to create a proper clone chrisler
[03:06.400 --> 03:12.080]  claims that all that's needed to hack iris recognition is this printed out photograph now you can
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.240]  imagine how easily a brazen hacker could target biometrics considering just how many high res
[03:18.240 --> 03:24.080]  photos are on the internet and this technology is already everywhere iris scanners are being rolled
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.200]  out just to customize your order at pizza hut have a nice meal guys and forget about being a
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.000]  sophisticated hacker you just need to be a scorned lover to get past biometrics
[03:53.120 --> 03:57.520]  so using your thumbprint to unlock your phone might just be a little bit too convenient for
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.320]  those crazy ex-girlfriends now we've shown you just how easily your credit card information
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.800]  can be siphoned off so in this case biometrics are better than passwords but they're not bullet

[04:27.520 --> 04:32.640]  researchers need to ensure that they are not creating a false sense of security
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.600]  that's actually leaving us vulnerable to a whole new criminal level of identity theft

[09:57.120 --> 10:01.680]  also get his take on any of the latest false flag developments that he's been tracking
[10:04.560 --> 10:11.360]  we've got john bainer now caught red-handed cutting a deal with nancy polosi to use net
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.440]  and yahoo's speech as cover to fund obama's executive amnesty that same day they sent the
[10:17.440 --> 10:24.080]  legislation to the president unchanged from what obama wanted giving him a blank check just like
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.880]  obama cares a blank check the gun grabbing a bullet banning garbage is a blank check
[10:30.880 --> 10:38.800]  congress is letting obama operate and act like a dictator and we've got an article at
[10:38.800 --> 10:45.840]  lou rockwell dot com posted info wars dot com by andrew napolitano that's very important
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.920]  judge napolitano a lone wolf president when the president effectively writes the laws congress is
[10:51.920 --> 11:01.920]  effectively neutered well that's right and the congress is self neutering itself self
[11:03.360 --> 11:09.200]  neuteration i guess not self mutilation uh is the word here but they're dragging us all along with
[11:09.200 --> 11:16.800]  them as that goes we'll be breaking that down the hillary clinton situation heats up into high gear
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.160]  but what's really behind the move to finally destroy hillary rottem clinton i'll give you
[11:22.160 --> 11:27.040]  my breakdown in a moment and cover the different developments i will certainly enjoy warming my
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.560]  hands and my posterior as well to the glowing funeral pyre of her criminal political dynasty
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.680]  and it signals curtains for jeb bush as well this is not just a maneuver between the bush
[11:39.680 --> 11:48.080]  clinton crime syndicate uh to take out hillary as a rival this is a larger repudiation of old
[11:48.080 --> 11:54.400]  figureheads by an establishment desperate for new faces to deceive the public into the future
[11:54.400 --> 12:00.400]  but i'll give you my full breakdown on that in a moment we'll also spend a lot of time on this
[12:00.400 --> 12:09.600]  uh this new gop bill would completely gut the fcc's net neutrality rules the washington post
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.960]  that's what they say of course i don't believe a word the washington post says when it gets into
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.800]  actual legislation another one out of ours technica republicans internet freedom act
[12:20.800 --> 12:27.600]  would wipe out net neutrality here he is a slash dot headline house republicans roll out legislation
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.160]  to overturn new net neutrality rules internet freedom act for consideration in the house
[12:34.640 --> 12:41.680]  congresswoman backed by atnt comcast introduces bill to kill net neutrality
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.840]  so i thought hey why don't we just actually get the bill
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.640]  instead of just listening to what the washington post says or listening to what
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.600]  ours technica says and i've read over the bill it's a very short bill and i'm going to give you
[12:59.600 --> 13:07.840]  my take on it coming up but i'll say this you have to overturn what the fcc has done because
[13:07.840 --> 13:14.960]  they can't legislate from a federal agency that's what you have a legislator a congress or a state
[13:14.960 --> 13:25.360]  house for this is all part of this dictatorial avalanche that we see accelerating the way this
[13:25.360 --> 13:32.800]  bill is written it does protect the internet from the fcc power grab that is undoubtedly a
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.200]  takeover and funded by a bunch of big corporations the problem is the way this is written it could
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.760]  also be interpreted as to let telecoms get around net neutrality so see we're getting
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.080]  sliced up from both angles you got a bunch of special interests fighting like pirates on the
[13:48.080 --> 13:53.760]  deck of a ship every man for themselves to seize control of the internet and then take advantage
[13:53.760 --> 14:00.000]  of having the regulatory cat bird seat so the republicans leadership want to gut the internet
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.080]  take it over the democrat leadership wants to get the internet take it over and there's different
[14:04.080 --> 14:17.200]  ways to skin a cat different ways to pluck a goose different ways to slit a throat different ways to
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.080]  burn down free speech the truth is leave the consumers in with boycotts antitrust laws are on
[14:24.080 --> 14:31.360]  the books which aren't enforced for the last 30 years we need antitrust enforcement in this country
[14:31.360 --> 14:38.000]  the consumerists and others act like oh we had our precious thing to protect the internet which
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.640]  they still won't release which didn't originate out of the legislative body see i said i'd cover
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.360]  this i'm going to cover it when i have covered some other news and i'm going to read the bill on air
[14:48.240 --> 14:55.440]  instead of just hear what they say we're going to read the bill the bill is better than what
[14:55.440 --> 15:03.520]  the FCC did because it comes out of the legislature a b overall it looks like a pretty fair good bill
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.880]  that would protect the internet but it's got some language that is not as good as what we had
[15:08.880 --> 15:17.200]  no regulation just a week ago so see i don't trust the snout the the the proboscis the
[15:17.200 --> 15:26.400]  the strip mining nozzle of government being involved the internet in any way
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.800]  so that's the big issue there and they get all these fools to fight with each other on both
[15:34.800 --> 15:41.360]  sides of the debate not realizing the whole thing is a fake debate government worldwide
[15:41.360 --> 15:48.240]  wants to control the internet because government is low in the polls the lowest it's ever been
[15:48.240 --> 15:54.720]  since we've had polls the last 200 years and across the world not sure in the u.s and mainstream media
[15:54.720 --> 16:03.040]  is collapsing and then collapsing again kind of like a sun will swell up and become a red giant
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.200]  for a while but not put off a lot of heat and then it'll kind of implode into a white door for a
[16:07.200 --> 16:14.000]  black dwarf or a red dwarf depending on what type of gases it's mainly made up out of and then finally
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.440]  it just dies sometimes into a gas giant or into a gaseous remnant or sometimes it explodes
[16:22.320 --> 16:28.720]  you have a nova or supernova and so you just keep seeing mainstream media collapse collapse
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.240]  collapse collapse collapse collapse collapse collapse in on itself is it going to go nova
[16:34.240 --> 16:41.200]  supernova and blow up supporting incredibly horrible totalitarian policies in an attempt to
[16:41.200 --> 16:48.560]  maintain hegemon and then the process blow up peace and freedom by backing tyranny or will
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.520]  you just admit that you screwed up and do like a lot of mainstream journalists that have been
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.680]  censored just go start your own operation you end up being more successful reaching more people
[16:57.680 --> 17:04.800]  and in a lot of cases making more money on your own than working for these big establishment systems
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.640]  but instead mainstream media across the gambit across the field
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.560]  is lining up to support censorship as if that's ever going to resurrect you
[17:20.560 --> 17:27.920]  you know i like to say it because it's true all the king's horses and all the king's men can't
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.200]  put mainstream lying deceiving media back together again even if you start telling the truth now
[17:34.400 --> 17:42.960]  you are so discredited you are so known to be frauds that no one is coming back to you
[17:42.960 --> 17:50.880]  and the model of how you're designed and how you're built can't compete in the future regardless
[17:51.600 --> 17:57.680]  so you had a chance to have the internet empower journalism instead you have just continued
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.880]  doubling and tripling and quadrupling down with new lies for old and so you're discredited
[18:03.600 --> 18:09.280]  the question is what will these cornered miscreants do now well they're they're they're calling to
[18:09.280 --> 18:12.880]  shut down their competition that's what media matters and others are calling for they're calling
[18:12.880 --> 18:19.040]  for going after anybody that's not a collectivist and you've got the republican leadership backing
[18:19.040 --> 18:25.120]  open borders and amnesty you've got the republican leadership backing this FCC power grab so that
[18:25.120 --> 18:31.440]  they can deny it you've got good grassroots republicans meaning well bringing forward a bill
[18:32.240 --> 18:36.080]  that is much better than what obama and the republican leadership have done and it's being
[18:36.080 --> 18:42.960]  decried by the establishment publications as a horrible power grab and of course Comcast who's
[18:42.960 --> 18:47.360]  been a villain in all this and wants to destroy net neutrality for their own aims of course they're
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.000]  backing this because this takes them out of the regulatory hegemon the regulatory umbrella the
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.200]  regulatory universe of the FCC but we don't want the FCC over the internet and we don't want Comcast
[18:57.200 --> 19:10.720]  either but the language isn't in here from what i've read to empower Comcast so again it's a delicate
[19:10.720 --> 19:16.400]  issue we wouldn't need this bill if we didn't have the FCC power grabbing right now so that's
[19:16.400 --> 19:20.960]  where i stand on that i'll detail it more coming up the really big news we'll cover first when we

[33:43.200 --> 33:51.440]  nightly news mr burns declares war and if you're not watching us you don't get the fact that lord
[33:51.440 --> 33:58.800]  rothschild is a spinning image of mr burns from the simpsons who's always saying smithers i'll never
[33:58.800 --> 34:02.400]  even really watch the simpsons my mom really likes them well i do watch it it's funny but
[34:02.400 --> 34:09.520]  there's a lot of programming in there like men are idiots men are morons every dad on a fox show
[34:09.520 --> 34:15.360]  for 30 years since married with children is just a complete buffoon that's all financed just like the
[34:15.360 --> 34:22.320]  current attorney general back when he was deputy attorney general 20 something years ago said we
[34:22.320 --> 34:27.200]  got literally brainwashed the public well these are the messages and when you see every show where
[34:27.200 --> 34:34.000]  the father's a moron and every show where gun owners are racist and every show where women are the
[34:34.000 --> 34:42.800]  boss you're seeing globalist conditioning meanwhile a record number 56 million 23 000 women are not
[34:42.800 --> 34:48.320]  in the labor force and women in every major study are the biggest sex objects they've ever been
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.240]  and most women say that they and studies are not happy with the way their lives are going
[34:54.240 --> 34:57.680]  well that's because the government wrote the script for you cupcake
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.880]  and men aren't happy as well unless they're busy watching one of their favorite football shows
[35:05.600 --> 35:11.280]  but i want to go to your phone calls jason matthew brian paul kevin and others on this whole move
[35:11.280 --> 35:17.120]  toward dictatorial power now it's just out in the open son alex jones saying we're devolving
[35:17.120 --> 35:24.160]  and degenerating and rotting and sinking and collapsing and festering into a stinking heap
[35:24.160 --> 35:31.760]  of dictatorial swarminess with gaggles of sycophantic pumps becoming their own little local vice
[35:31.760 --> 35:42.080]  royce to oppress and and and and dabble in in control freak dreams it's the establishment we're
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.920]  technocrats now why the eu appoints presidents and prime ministers now and we'll do it in america too
[35:47.920 --> 35:54.240]  ha ha ha ha and goldman sacks will fund both jeb bush and hillary or will you we'll talk about
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.480]  the fall of hillary clinton coming up but i do want to go to your phone calls but since i mentioned
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.920]  what alan greenspan and north roth child are saying i thought i'd play a brief report a brief
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.640]  snippet from last night's info originally news hosted by our anchor darin mcbrane
[36:14.880 --> 36:23.680]  now speaking of arming our enemies lord roth child is warning investors that we are about to
[36:23.680 --> 36:30.560]  embark on the most dangerous geopolitical time since world war two well he should know after all
[36:31.120 --> 36:38.640]  his family funded most every war since the napoleonic wars lord jacob roth child whose
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.840]  business associates include weasels like warren buffett and henry kissinger
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.960]  when he blamed the dangerous climate on chaos and extremism in the middle east russian aggression
[36:50.960 --> 36:59.360]  and expansion and a weakened europe threatened by horrendous unemployment so that is a very scary
[36:59.360 --> 37:05.840]  thought coming from this guy and if you're not familiar with the history of the roth child family
[37:05.840 --> 37:12.640]  i suggest you look into it i mean these guys are worth a lot of money the roth child family is worth
[37:12.640 --> 37:21.440]  five hundred trillion dollars and they own nearly every central bank in the world they financed
[37:21.440 --> 37:28.560]  both sides of basically every war since napoleon the roth child's they own your news the media your
[37:28.560 --> 37:36.480]  oil and your government most of you don't even know who this evil bastard is and i also found
[37:36.480 --> 37:44.800]  out something else very disturbing about lord roth child he looks like mr burns from the simpsons
[37:46.640 --> 37:53.440]  i mean the resemblance is obvious the only difference is mr burns is about as harmless
[37:54.080 --> 38:02.800]  as a boy scout or mother trisa in comparison what a douche smithers let's start world war three
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.440]  all right we're going to take a quick break the info wars nightly news will return right
[38:07.440 --> 38:13.680]  after this when we come back we have two very powerful reports one from leon macadoo the other
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.320]  from john bound and i'm going to sit down and talk to a biblical scholar we're going to talk
[38:18.320 --> 38:26.000]  about the emergence of implantable microchips is the mark of the beast coming up that's coming up
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.600]  next on the info wars nightly news i don't think it's coming up i think it's pretty much arrived
[38:31.600 --> 38:36.480]  that's what his report shows that's all that prison planet dot tv and info wars dot com
[38:36.480 --> 38:42.080]  forward slash show to find all those details all right coming up i'll get into this new
[38:42.960 --> 38:50.320]  save the net bill the republican junior members have brought forward that's where legislation
[38:50.320 --> 38:54.720]  is supposed to come from so i think it needs to be supported because we should cause a debate
[38:54.720 --> 39:01.200]  about the bill should be in congress not from an executive branch agency but the washington
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.560]  post is attacking it because it doesn't let the feds take over the internet where they had no
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.560]  jurisdiction before it just returns it back to the people doesn't mean i trust the way this
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.640]  bill would be implemented there needs to be no government involved a vaccine not abola made
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.320]  doc sick that's a new study mainstream news we'll get into that we're going to get into a new time
[39:24.320 --> 39:32.640]  magazine poll where drudge and the food babe were far more influential than obama well drudge was
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.480]  number one this is why feds want to take over the internet alternative media pioneer matt drudge
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.560]  and held activist vani harry aka the food babe are far more influential than president obama
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.000]  according to time dot com poll people ask why i wasn't included i frankly don't care uh but i was
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.400]  not included in the big list of names you could choose from so that's just why i think it was
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.080]  smart of time actually to pick drudge and vani harry just just to see what folks would say and
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.880]  drudge was number one vani harry number two alternative media pioneer matt drudge and health
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.600]  activist vani harry aka the food babe are far more influential than president obama according to
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.000]  a time dot com poll respondents the poll appears at the end of an article listing times picks
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.040]  the 30 most influential people on the internet and at the time of this writing matt drudge of the
[40:17.040 --> 40:23.760]  drudge report commands the lead with 29 the food babe of 27 and president obama comes in a distant
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.600]  third with six percent yeah i mean even three four years ago the obama babe quit doing what she
[40:29.600 --> 40:35.680]  was doing because of the youtube videos we get like 2000 views i mean people are sick of it okay
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.840]  they're they're sick of all the polish teleprompter bull and it just goes through the whole graph
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.360]  you've got drudge number one vani harry number two barack obama number three taylor swift number
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.840]  four jimmy fallon number five brandon stanton whoever that is number six and it just goes on
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.920]  from there from the 30 things that people that time chose to let folks choose from
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.360]  and i i think about have been included i've probably been like number two and vani harry
[41:05.360 --> 41:08.720]  number three but i mean i don't even care vani harry was number one all i care about is getting
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.680]  the gml out of our food it's a victory for all of us and you see this in so many other metrics
[41:13.680 --> 41:16.560]  this is why they want to take over the internet and that's why they're doing it
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.840]  the george soros didn't give 196 million dollars with the government run ford foundation
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.960]  to pass this net neutrality legislation excuse me it's not legislation this this federal rules
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.240]  power grab out of the fcc because they love internet freedom it's because they're coming
[41:36.240 --> 41:43.280]  for internet freedom period and they still won't release the 330 plus pages will they again
[41:46.080 --> 41:52.000]  freedom is still there but they've built this whole new tyranny beside it that is now swallowing up
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.400]  dissolving like a jellyfish kind of grabs a fish and pulls it up to dissolve it
[41:58.400 --> 42:04.160]  it's just dissolving down to our skeletal bones what was left to the republic and i'm just watching
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.280]  it with horror and the elite in their conquering realize it's so dangerous they're all running
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.200]  to armored redoubts in switzerland and australia and and monnie carlo and and and the bahamas
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.680]  to watch the us blow up and melt down from afar maybe they'll roast hot dogs in the flames or
[42:23.680 --> 42:31.760]  something i mean it's just redunculus how classical tyranny this is classical corruption
[42:31.760 --> 42:40.720]  classical oligarchy degenerating i mean quite frankly we had some corrupt oligarchy that still
[42:40.720 --> 42:46.960]  was narcissistic and wanted to build big public institutions and build big beautiful art houses
[42:46.960 --> 42:52.800]  and you know fun grandiose ideas it still be bad i would still oppose it as not being freedom based
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.680]  and picking winners and losers but i wouldn't be risking my life fighting it i wouldn't be
[42:57.680 --> 43:04.240]  throwing myself at it with just absolute savage tooth and nail viciousness just turning loose
[43:04.240 --> 43:11.040]  every fiber of will i've got to try to come up with the semantical palette to paint the picture
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.600]  that represents reality of a horror to try to get people out of their trance
[43:20.640 --> 43:23.760]  i mean this this this world government
[43:23.760 --> 43:35.520]  is an expression of hatred for humanity and hatred of goodness is just so nasty so stinking
[43:35.520 --> 43:42.640]  so crawling directly out of the rotting hole that of the carcass that is the mouth of hell
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.160]  it's like a dead cow blood in the sun with a big hole on the side of it with the maggots pouring
[43:50.160 --> 43:53.840]  out of it i mean i hate to be gross like that but that's what like looking at this is like
[43:54.480 --> 44:00.000]  crawling all over us i get careless about red carpets and big giant jets and all the narcissistic
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.400]  stuff these festooned tyrants and their little outfits prancing around all day to each other
[44:06.400 --> 44:15.440]  basically want to throw up when i see michelle obama or john bainer michael more it's like seeing
[44:15.440 --> 44:23.200]  a maggots spilling out of rotting flesh it's just i just recoil from these nasty little wicked
[44:23.200 --> 44:29.600]  scumbags who've joined with the most evil forces on earth to try to overthrow goodness and bring in
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.960]  a new age of darkness all right i said i go to your calls and i'm ranting uh briefly

[47:21.760 --> 47:28.720]  the air go ahead hello alex thank you for taking my call two quick comments uh you mentioned what we
[47:28.720 --> 47:34.240]  should do about the president becoming a dictator i think texas is on the right path we need to uh
[47:34.240 --> 47:40.400]  a state to secede from the union well i don't mean to brag or to interrupt you but i mean i got to
[47:40.400 --> 47:45.760]  say a texas has got its fair share of problems but texas bat is the only state battling hardcore
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.040]  federally the gun grabbing the only state battling the hardcore dictator open borders the only state
[47:51.040 --> 47:57.280]  battling shutting off the power plants in a big way and and and i mean texas is just absolutely
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.840]  about to lead the country and i'm so proud of our state and i know the governor uh from sources
[48:03.840 --> 48:10.720]  is aware of what's going on so you better he better watch out because the system hates his guts
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.640]  i'm telling you i'm telling you texas i'm so proud of texas go ahead yeah god bless texas
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.440]  my son was born there i'm proud of that for sure uh my second comment was alex i'm listening to you
[48:21.440 --> 48:27.760]  for a long time and uh i've never been more upset with you than i was when you uh interviewed bill
[48:27.760 --> 48:36.560]  errors and the reason is is because i felt like you just attacked him immediately and uh didn't
[48:36.560 --> 48:43.040]  really give him a fair share a fair shot and sort of just labeled him a commie when he was actually
[48:43.040 --> 48:50.560]  saying that here he wasn't a communist or not not outright but he was sort of you guys were on the
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.040]  same page it seemed like and but see that's what communists do is is in their new phase they act
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.920]  all friendly and nice and try to get common ground with you this guy wrote the playbook that obama
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.480]  is using predominantly along with a few other people the guy that wrote uh rules for radical
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.520]  solowinsky and others and so i knew he was saying oh that red star that's the symbol of macy's i'm
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.640]  not a commie when he is a famous communist and then oh we were we didn't want to hurt anybody with
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.240]  the bombs and then i've got clips of him saying we wanted to hurt people so i mean he came off as
[49:26.240 --> 49:33.280]  very slick i've got a lot of criticism for not being meaner to him uh so listen i do this three
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.600]  four hours a day you're right i probably could have done a better job the problem is is that one
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.720]  you're at when you're actually live on air you don't always uh you know score the perfect touchdown
[49:42.720 --> 49:49.280]  but i think we uh overall i think i exposed him and then we put the video out later showing him
[49:49.280 --> 49:56.160]  playing ignorant i understand uh it's just i i don't see that i've listened to the guy for a while
[49:56.160 --> 50:03.600]  and and i've had an impression of him kind of just based on what i heard in the media
[50:03.600 --> 50:08.000]  and from what i read of him and what i listened to of him it's totally different than the
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.080]  what the media portrays him as and it seems like they're trying to demonize him and demonize
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.520]  anti-war activism because that's kind of what he's all about here's the deal an anti a communist
[50:19.520 --> 50:24.400]  like him does not represent an anti-war movement my view and discredits it so you're absolutely
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.760]  right he and others were used to discredit the anti-war movement so what you just picked up on
[50:29.760 --> 50:34.480]  is absolutely true but i mean here's the deal i've studied bill ares and the guy is a liar
[50:35.680 --> 50:41.840]  in my view uh but i hear you man and and and i understand that the some of the right wing
[50:41.840 --> 50:45.040]  and people kind of use him as their boogeyman when they're involved in much bad stuff as well
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.120]  but uh i appreciate you putting up with me god bless you jason paul kevin brian matthew how
[50:51.120 --> 50:55.840]  do we stop the government turning into a dictatorship i think we label it as a dictatorship

[54:36.080 --> 54:41.120]  to paul in indiana thanks for holding her on the air hey how you doing i'm good brother
[54:42.240 --> 54:46.720]  hey i just want to say i've been loving your show here for a couple years and i just recently
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.080]  started using your products everything you said about them is correct uh me and my wife both use
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.320]  a lot of them and made a lot of changes in our lives here thank you brother it's because it also
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.640]  funds our operation but doing that i know i've got to have the highest quality i mean just briefly
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.200]  since you mentioned i didn't know you were going to bring this up i mean an example of what the
[55:05.200 --> 55:11.600]  products have done for you uh well we both uh we do the super male and the super female vitality
[55:11.600 --> 55:17.920]  uh big changes a lot of energy we've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks energy shots
[55:17.920 --> 55:24.160]  saving a ton of money there uh just general improvements all over wife's menstrual cycles
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.200]  been better you know just little things like that mainly getting off the energy drinks have
[55:29.200 --> 55:34.880]  been our biggest benefit did you feel an immediate effect with the super male or to take time
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.640]  i think it took a little time for it to get my system to start working the bad stuff out
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.120]  yeah it took a couple weeks for me as well when i got on a few years ago before we were even putting
[55:45.120 --> 55:51.760]  on our own uh variety of it and it it's it just it it's that's how you're supposed to feel or
[55:51.760 --> 55:56.080]  or even better because you this is just trying to block all the estrogen members it's probably not
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.360]  completely successful but it's a little closer to what we should be feeling like they want to stun
[56:01.360 --> 56:05.600]  and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.880]  my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's
[56:10.880 --> 56:14.800]  pretty exciting and i love it well thank you for your support sir what specifically did you call in
[56:14.800 --> 56:21.520]  about paul well basically the the whole government like you said has become a joke uh the presidency
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.560]  definitely has become a joke and i think we should uh try to initiate a new way to split the president
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.480]  and i'm thinking uh maybe we use uh hollywood to hijack government stay other way around
[56:32.480 --> 56:39.840]  and i'm thinking reality tv show uh let the american people choose the popular president candidate
[56:39.840 --> 56:46.080]  from anyone who wants to try to become president put them through a set of tests let some judges
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.480]  let the american people vote if that was open and free it ended up being somebody like ron paul or
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.240]  somebody because he would always be winning up front the first primaries and they would come in
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.960]  and demonize him or start shooting him but how would you keep though the networks from trying to
[56:58.960 --> 57:05.840]  manipulate it well it would be wouldn't be easy it would have to be uh done by some people that
[57:05.840 --> 57:13.680]  really cared about the outcome uh basically just put the people up there anyone that wants to try
[57:13.680 --> 57:18.000]  put them up there put them through the test the other handle certain situations let the american
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.640]  people do a popular vote and then whoever wins to put them up as an independent party candidate

[57:37.600 --> 57:44.320]  very close to kicking out baner the globalist main attack pattern is to block a republican
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.360]  takeover by the patriots so we need to work on that while promoting third party candidates
[57:49.360 --> 57:53.280]  especially at the state level i totally agree with you and we should just start doing our own

[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.480]  to some folks involved with the fellow reserve just last week i'll leave it at that at dinner
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:51.440]  and uh we were discussing the major power struggle out of the dallas and kansas city fed

[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.640]  at the qe unlimited and they believe it's hurting the country and i was sitting there with i'd say
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.240]  high level for the fellow reserve not super high level but pretty big in one of the regional
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.920]  branches i'll just you know they're you know their names out there and we're talking to some
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.200]  other folks let's leave it that and they said look for some big stuff to be happening my life's
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.640]  getting too weird i remember buzz aldrin telling me over the phone he's been on the show before
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.000]  but telling me over the phone telling charlie sheen over the phone see truth is so much weirder
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.960]  than fiction that they were going to crash an indian probe and discover water but that they
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.240]  already told them where to crash the probe because they discovered water there in the 60s and then
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.920]  like six months later i'm walking through an airport it's like indians to crash probed as a
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:53.680]  proud to find water and then months later they find the water and then i had of course the
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.840]  talk show host on a few weeks ago who has on his show that the chief economist for the

[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.680]  10-minute pop about this to see what intel he has because he was hinting at some of this i mean
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.840]  here's the deal a lot of people in the fellow reserve even if they're not good guys
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.160]  they don't want to wreck the golden goose the globalists do to bring in an even bigger world
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.000]  government you got to break eggs make an omelet and they also don't want to get the blame when

[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.440]  and trust by beta iota dot net or big bat usa dot org now he wanted to come on today and i'm
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.920]  i want to get him on about a bunch of subjects we're gonna cover the waterfront
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.440]  about fixing our election system getting past the jeb bushes and hillary clinton's
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.800]  getting real issues in there that don't divide people but bring us together for real prosperity
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.960]  we'll talk some about that with him he's also thinking about running for president
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.640]  with libertarians but he's a real expert from covert operations in the middle east he knows
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:08.400]  iran he knows the al-qaeda type folks out of saudi arabia which are isis and isle the islamic state
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.040]  he knows a lot of the players so he can give us really an expert he's not one of these cia guys
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.520]  that was like a desk jockey or all the new generation that's where they've tripled the
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.600]  size of their operatives just to run around in that cool and wear black sunglasses he's actually
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.080]  worked with the marines the army and actual operations all the middle east so he could speak
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.440]  to what he thinks is going on because you've got double crossing iran double crossing saudi arabia
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.800]  the west funding isis under the free syrian army and then not funding it but are they and the iraqi
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.560]  president says they have proof that they are and so is it a triple cross a double cross
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.880]  or is it really just caused a destabilization civil war between the arab's and the persians
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:58.240]  uh where is all this going because i've never seen such a fog of war hanging over this and i'm
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.280]  pretty pretty good at analyzing what's happening and what's unfolding what's going to happen when
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.240]  isis as the fbi says they will hits the us will anyone point out that we gave them the weapons
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.560]  the motive of course has let them attack us to take our liberties a form of false flag
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:22.240]  but then i say what is the answer to the dictatorial move by government internet power grabs opening up
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.160]  the borders outside of law well the wall street journal has the headline washington strips new
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.520]  york feds power the new york fed folks is the private arm that makes most of the decisions
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.560]  this would actually be a u.s government takeover partially of the federal reserve this just came
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.040]  out 30 minutes ago i'm stunned trying to read during breaks it's a long 16 page article secret
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:53.120]  triangle document gives control of bank regulation to committee and i'm even saying this is a good
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:13:02.160]  thing right now the committee is run by fed governor which is calling the shots in an oversight
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.440]  of banking titans such as goldman sacks group and city group ink so is this good or bad all i know
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:13.200]  is this there are major movements happening right now it's been said many times that more happens
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.200]  in a year that happens in the previous 50 or more happens in a month happened the last 10 years
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.720]  we're entering as we go towards the singularity a lot of sub singularities or or or waypoints
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  and everything's compressing and i'm seeing movement for good for bad you name it just
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.840]  accelerating the light speed everywhere and this is a time when good people can get involved and
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.800]  really change history the world has been unfrozen and put into a type of flux where it's being
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:47.440]  remolded but if we understand that we can change things and we can get involved and we can
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.720]  actually control our destiny then we can change the world but if we believe that we're just passive
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.600]  spectators it's game over so i threw out a lot there what's happening geopolitically why are
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.680]  things moving so quick for mr. steel there's so much to cover here what do you want to hit
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.320]  first well let's start with the government being an enemy hands the greatest threat to us liberty
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:19.040]  and us prosperity is the u.s government um isis is a theatrical threat it's funded by
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:25.440]  saudi arabia it's trained by cia more people will die in the next two years to us police
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:33.760]  brutality then will ever in 10 years died isis continue you've got the floor break it down
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.960]  um well let me let me focus on why you invited me in the first place and then we can go to google
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:46.800]  as the ministry of truth and that other stuff um i am putting together a nonpartisan movement
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:53.840]  called open power and the tiny url forward slash is open power and that'll get people right to the
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:00.480]  book and the blog and the documents uh here's the bottom line alex 60 percent of the american
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:07.360]  voters are disenfranchised it might even be as high as 80 out of 319 million and the total
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:15.680]  population 240 are eligible to vote in 2012 110 million voted and the reality is that once they
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.920]  vote and they're generally told how to vote by the 42 billionaires congress forgets about us so
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.680]  what i want to do is bring together the constitution green libertarian reform parties and the
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.400]  independents and i want to create a non-party ticket and this is not no labels or americans
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:40.080]  elect those were good ideas badly executed basically my dream candidate is agnes king
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.120]  as an independent with jill stein as a vice president from the green party gary johnson
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:51.280]  running a new thing called the governor's council um and everybody else on a cabinet that's
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:59.440]  announced in advance we have four planks electoral reform in 2015 remobilizing occupy to occupy the
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.440]  lawns and and and offices of a very lazy corrupt congress when it comes home on its summer recess
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.360]  um eliminate all taxes all income taxes and institute edgard feige's um automated payment
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:20.080]  transaction tax changed the law so that you cannot be eligible to run in the general election unless
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:25.840]  you first appoint your cabinet and have cabinet level debate so the public can see what it's
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:32.960]  buying uh and last but uh not least i believe we absolutely must get to a balanced budget
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.120]  but that's a balanced budget that has to be formulated by a coalition cabinet
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:44.160]  transparently in front of the public and here's my bottom line if 100 million americans provide
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.080]  $10 each to a democracy fund that's a billion dollars you combine that with your show and social
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.640]  media and i absolutely guarantee we can kick the two-party tyranny out of office well 10 years
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.520]  ago i would say that you were being too much of an eternal optimist but the climate with gallup
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.640]  poll showing a seven to eight percent approval of congress and people completely leaving the main
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.240]  line political reservations uh we are entering a time when you could create a coalition type movement
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.920]  uh to do this the problem is they will attack it they will send in disinfo operatives uh and
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.480]  anything that started actually gaining steam would be attacked as you know uh the difference was
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.640]  though if we openly talked about it up front people would expect to see that and the attacks
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.760]  would actually generate more support but it is quite a undertaking you're discussing and have
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:42.640]  on your website well alex i put a small kindle book up uh at amazon and it hit number eight
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:49.200]  in civics and i opened the book with the youtube from eric lu on what citizens need to know about
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.760]  power that's the most powerful 17-minute youtube i've seen in my 63 years three years of life
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:02.560]  i will tell you without any qualification whatsoever if the independents greens and
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.720]  libertarians are willing to put aside their obsession with individual issues and come
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:15.440]  together on the one thing that we can all rally around electoral reform i absolutely guarantee
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.560]  i can deliver the u.s government back to the u.s public well let's expand on that specifically
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:28.560]  from your training in the cia or specifically your training in business from your research
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:34.320]  and live experience why are you certain that that could be done well alex the internet really has
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.800]  made a difference i mean i'm a huge admirer of mica sifri's new book um the big disconnect why
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.640]  the internet hasn't fixed politics yet and mica makes a core point which is that all of the activists
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.600]  today are as fragmented as the activists were in the 1960s when cia and the atlantic council
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.920]  and ford and rockefeller foundations they were basically throwing out a lot of money
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.840]  in order to divide and conquer and we are divided and conquered today the think tanks in washington
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.040]  are largely worthless because they're all chasing after bits of money that will keep them in line
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:16.400]  um the reason i'm certain is that we are now starting to see some revolutionary moments and
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.080]  i've posted the most popular graphic on my website is called graphic preconditions of revolution in
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:29.040]  the usa today i did my 1976 my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and i'll tell you
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.920]  i'll hold it there because this is so important you're talking about flashpoints catalyst trigger
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.800]  events we'll get that graphic from your site put it on screen for tv viewers we'll direct folks to
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:45.360]  the website give their radio listeners but there are catalysts and and the system may try to launch
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:52.400]  its own catalyst ahead of time to detonate a false revolution to stop our revolution
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.800]  so i want to ask you about that as well this subject could not be more important stay with us

[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:24.640]  ground operations author researcher a book reviewer got two popular websites and he was just getting
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:31.440]  into if you joined us writing a thesis paper on trigger points he's talked about this before
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:37.920]  if a soccer mom torches herself in front of the white house and it gets caught on tape i'm not
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.000]  saying somebody should do this and it's put out the correct way you could get whatever the issue
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.480]  was basically changed if it has the public's will behind it already so trigger events catalyst
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.440]  and the establishment knows we've reached this tipping point i think they'll try to
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.000]  trigger a fake thing like the air of spring and then have it led in the vacuum by a bunch of
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.440]  miscreants that's my concern as they'll use it as a socialist or communist revolution not a free
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:10.880]  market revolution that you and others are promoting you've got the floor mr. steel breakdown exactly
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.080]  what you're getting at here and the climate we're in right now well first off i'm increasingly
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.680]  concerned that elizabeth warren is being turned into a manchurian candidate and that she is the
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:29.200]  logical follow-on to obama oh yes theatrical pap i mean if you look closely at warren she's doing
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.640]  everything she can to protect fed secrecy and she's doing everything she can to protect the new
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:41.200]  york banks and they're continuing to do business as usual so i'm extraordinarily skeptical of the
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.240]  progressive enthusiasm about elizabeth warren now let me come back to who i do believe in i
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.080]  believe in angus king i believe in john huntsman i believe in jill stein i believe in gary johnson
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.680]  although i think gary should be a governor general in charge of the governor's council and focusing
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:05.120]  on state rights rather than president um i also believe that we're now reaching a point where
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:12.080]  people understand that the fbi and its false flag movement is in fact the sole source of terrorist
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.920]  incidents in the united states um in fact i was just reading about how a muslim community
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:29.680]  has increasingly begun begun to identify fbi uh provoc provocateurs and get uh legal restraining
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.680]  orders against them so you now have the situation where the muslims in the united states of america
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:42.960]  are filing restraining orders against fbi false flag attacks well i mean the false flag incentives
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.200]  to attack this is extraordinary the citizens are becoming very aware and they're finding
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.640]  that they can in fact fight back and expose uh all of this stuff but for me the long and the
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:00.480]  short of it is that mark suckerberg of facebook jone blades of move on and jackie salet of
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:07.520]  independent voting dot org have the power to bring together not just the former political
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.680]  candidates but activists like myself and eric leo and richard wolf whose book occupy the economy
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:19.440]  confronting capitalism is extraordinary uh ralph mayer is also starting to come along he has a
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.840]  new book out on stoppable which i'm not completely satisfied with um ralph is sugar coating a whole
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.000]  bunch of things and he's avoiding some tough issues sure he's been on the show many times and i want
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.760]  you to elaborate on that but but sure zuckerberg could help save the country but instead he's backing
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.560]  the democratic party establishment and censoring people and of course your plan would succeed if
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.680]  they put zuckerberg you know behind it but i mean that's like that's like saying david rockefeller
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:51.200]  is going to get behind it well you know i've been talking to some people that write for salon and uh
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.960]  and a couple of other of these progressive rags and what i'm starting to find out is that not only
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.840]  are the elites fragmenting the one percent is actually fragmenting you've got people doing
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.800]  conferences on inclusive capitalism and they're talking about redemptive capitalism that's code
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.960]  for stop the pitchforks i can stop no you're right you talked about in england just a few
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.920]  months ago the rothschilds are having those meetings that's right now what i'm also finding
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.520]  is that the progressives are fragmenting the super smart people among the progressives are
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.880]  starting to understand and terry samatta was an aide to ralph mayer and she wrote a wonderful book
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.920]  called grand illusion the myth of voter choice in a two-party tyranny and that's where i took the
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:40.320]  term from um the smartest progressives are starting to realize that hillary clinton doesn't have a hope
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:47.760]  in hell and that the democratic party as it is presently constituted is as i have on the cover
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:57.040]  of my book one bird two wings same crap okay okay so we really are starting to see the smart people
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:03.440]  converge from all sides i just got off a skype with paul ray who wrote with sherry and ruth Anderson
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.880]  a book called cultural creatives and he told me yesterday the cultural creatives are now
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.880]  80 million in number imagine if we got each of them to donate ten dollars to a democracy fund
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.480]  that is neither democratic nor republican that's 800 million dollars with 800 million dollars i can
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:26.960]  crush the rich because i will have you and the social media and we will have the partnership
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.400]  among the greens and the libertarians the reform party constitution party working families with
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:39.200]  bill deblasio justice emerging with rocky anderson i'm telling you if we all come together we can
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.760]  win this it's not about money well the climate certainly there for it stay the robert david

[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:42.560]  robert david steel is our guest very interesting informative guy i want to pick his brain about
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.520]  the different geopolitical movements we're seeing not just here in the united states
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.760]  i know we've got a lot of callers that also would like to make a statement about how to try to fix
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.680]  our government or how to try to reverse the dictatorial slide that we're in and i want uh
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.200]  mr schilder to finish the point he was just making we can have him back up in the future as well
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.760]  or even here to town and studio to put on you know some of the ideas that he has here's what i see
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.560]  if i was the establishment which i know in fights with itself it's not totally monolithic
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:16.320]  if i was the western establishment the anglo-american establishment as carol quickly called it
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:23.840]  or brazinski or Rockefeller i would be trying to promote institutions of freedom i would want
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:30.960]  transparency i would want to process because a that produces incredible wealth but b it also
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.400]  secures the wealth of the elite who can tend to set up on top of things and skim off the top and
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.880]  get even richer but instead they want to kill the golden goose and totally bring in corporate
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:52.160]  fascism corporate uh kleptocracy crony capitalism discrediting capitalism itself and are setting up
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:59.040]  autocratic oppressive classically dictatorial systems and google announcing they'll decide what's
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.800]  true or not and delist websites i mean this is this is all really scary and i see the left
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.480]  as horrible cheerleaders for all of it just like the republican leadership is so you i i
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.400]  guess kind of see a coalition of libertarians and paleo conservatives with the left and if things
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.240]  get bad enough that could happen the problem is the left has these sacraments of restricting guns
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.760]  and you know men need not wear pants and and you know things like just just stupid social i mean
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.680]  look at zuckerberg he's funding right now men do more work during uh you know ads on the mba as if
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.040]  men did something bad you know more divide and conquer so i get in general the idea i mean it
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.760]  could be a third party candidate out of nowhere if they have the right rhetoric and get into the
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.640]  debates would would would would win hands down they'll just never let it get to that point so i've
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:55.200]  thrown a lot out there let me ask you this why do you think historically even though long term it's
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:04.480]  bad but currently why is the establishment unified only in my view on setting up the
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:11.440]  totalitarianism why do they think that will protect them when historically that will destroy them
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.360]  alex first off one of the reasons you're not supposed to marry first and second cousins is
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:24.000]  because incest makes you stupid yeah and that's what we have among our one percent a leaf that
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.400]  you now have inherited wealth and incest and a whole bunch of other things and you've addressed
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:34.880]  pedophilia and satanism and these are some sick puppies um now the smartest ones the most ethical
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:42.000]  ones are starting to realize precisely as you said that their only protection from pitchforks
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.800]  and having their mansions burned down and there's no place they can hide including switzerland
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.280]  is an accommodation and this is why i like richard wolf so much i think he's really a great mind and
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:57.200]  he's really putting out some good stuff and i recommend all of his youtube which i've been
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.840]  watching but i wanted accommodation from the billionaires not somebody making 200 grand a year
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.400]  i'm sick of the billionaires trying to make accommodations with the engine of a free market
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.000]  and then they never pay jack squad look one of the things that i really believe in is eliminating
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.840]  all taxes i finally figured out the tax code it's the way congress blackmail's people into bribing
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:23.200]  them okay and in fairness to business it's congress that shakes down business it's not
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.440]  business that set out to bribe congress so if we do the edgar feige automated payment transaction
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:36.080]  tax that taxes all transactions including the currency and stock transactions of wall street
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.520]  that are not now uh tax that creates more than enough money it does we have a balanced budget we
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.400]  eliminate the subsidies for the fossil fuel business we eliminate the subsidies for the
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.000]  moronic think tanks like new america foundation and all these other places that just have people
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.480]  going through the motions and and chasing money um they have no integrity so i'm telling you one of
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.760]  the things that i've done right with this campaign that is starting to take off is firmly insisted
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.400]  from the very beginning that this is a nonviolent revolution and the truth and reconciliation
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.480]  are our hallmarks all we want from the one percent is keep your wealth get out of our way
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.960]  absolutely and that's the thing they always say oh we got to keep the economy going humanity is so
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.480]  prosperous if they just get out of our way with all their crony bureaucracy and selective enforcement
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.960]  the wealth and innovation is just startling the way they block quote all the disruptive technologies
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:40.960]  that's why i think the libertarians are central to the solution well i agree with you and it's very
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.120]  exciting and i mean i have a london guardian i mean we already knew this but now it's in the
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:50.800]  wall street journal the london guardian that the elites admit at davos they're buying air
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:57.360]  strips in the arctic air strips in new zealand air strips in the desert of australia and building
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.480]  armored redoubts and it's not just a few of them i mean they're building them in the ozarks they're
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:11.760]  governments digging in why why not just fix things and let there be prosperity why gobble up everything
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.920]  and then go oh my gosh this kind of collapse and then run to the hills why well i you really have
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.320]  to understand there's an excellent book called business blind spots by ben gillard and one of
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.760]  the things he points out is that the information that is reaching these people including presidents
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:34.400]  of countries as well as corporations the information is invariably filtered bias late or false
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:41.200]  okay so these people are operating in an alternative reality and one of the things that
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:48.320]  we have to do is actually get to the point where we can retake the congress we can then
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:54.080]  start to publish truth rather than google's version of the truth or the obama version
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:02.320]  of the truth or the 700 club version of the truth and i believe that we are on the verge
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.080]  of a major convergence and also a major breakout all of our prior institutions including labor
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:14.160]  unions the church and the universities have failed sure about to go into revolution 3.0
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.880]  well when you mentioned the inbreeding um by the third dynasty i know i was reading about it just
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:27.600]  again the other day of the egyptians they on average would live to be about 12 uh they were
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.880]  about three feet tall they were completely i mean seriously that they had they had so many
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.840]  disorders in the royal family if you've ever gone to like one of the british museums or others
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.000]  and you go through and see the mummies of this king that king this queen they're all
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.440]  literally completely insane and mutated from interbreeding and marrying their sisters and
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:53.200]  brothers over and over again for 500 years you look at this and you talk about the Rothschilds the
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  Rockefellers the asters it's a handful of families that interbreed with each other and they admittedly
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.640]  i mean the queen of england has most of her siblings are locked up in mental institutions
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:10.880]  or already dead most of and it's very sad but you're absolutely right so many of these elites
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.560]  are what anthony good sharding my buddy calls aliens he calls all the rich trust fund kids
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.760]  in austin that we run into uh aliens and i mean they could be 50 a trust fund kid they don't know
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:27.280]  what planet they're on they don't know how to tie their shoelaces but they've got brand new Ferraris
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:34.000]  and they they have no idea what's even going on well look let me come back to a positive note
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.320]  you talked about the billionaires one of the things that i've noticed is that warren buffett
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:45.360]  tom stayer and bill gates have all admitted that not only is the system broken but all of the money
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.360]  they've been giving away to charity and various issues has been wasted all right so what's happening
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:42:00.240]  now is there is a growing realization among a critical center of gravity mass that if we set
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:06.080]  aside the issues if we stop trying to push one thing like lauren slussig is completely wrong
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.280]  to be focused on getting money out of politics that's a side issue one of the things that i found
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.800]  when i briefed in portland is people's eyes were opened they suddenly realized that electoral reform
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.520]  is is is 11 different things and among them ballot access and paper ballots and hand counting
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.760]  at the polling station and no mail ballots because mail ballots is basically code for fraud all of
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.800]  this stuff matters getting money out of politics makes no difference at all if you still have
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:40.240]  gerrymandered districts and you keep people from actually being eligible as independents or greens
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:47.920]  or libertarians to run for office or to be elected so here's the deal his stayer wants to
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.840]  make his money work for climate change first he has to fund electoral reform
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:06.640]  again pulling back from the the day-to-day garbage that's going on and just seeing the
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:12.880]  direction of the establishments going in if there isn't real moves towards reform and instead of
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.440]  move towards totalitarianism to control things and clearly i think they've made that decision
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:20.880]  in the main that's the direction they're going i agree with you there's a lot of signs that
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.960]  some of the more sane people in the establishment realize that's going to end up being a bear trap
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.000]  that catches their leg more than it catches the general public's leg but where does this go as
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.160]  not just a field guy in the cia and actual operations but also as an analyst looking into that
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:42.720]  crystal ball where does the world go if we don't start reforming well first off i gotta tell you
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.840]  i was just watching this video of a guy that stripped down to nothing in a during a tsa search
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:54.400]  to protest unreasonable search and seizure and i i wrote an article that was that was widely read on
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.640]  the two cops that were killed in new york the canary dies also the system is very close to
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:07.280]  imploding it's unsustainable and it's in its current form and it might be able to elect
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.920]  another manchurian candidate in 2016 but all indications are that by 2020 we have american
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:20.240]  populism back in power so i'd rather not waste those four years and if people will take a look
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:27.600]  at the electoral reform act of 2015 and the open power concept i believe that we can non-violently
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.040]  get us back on track and i uh my final phrase there's nothing wrong with the united states of
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.560]  america that can't be fixed and fixed quick by restoring integrity to our electoral system
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.520]  and to our government oh i agree it screwed up as things are historically we could turn it around
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:49.200]  with the gravitas the power we still have but if they push much further into a totalitarianism
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.440]  we're done i mean they are so close to breaking this they will hasten they will hasten the soccer
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:03.360]  mom alex everything they do from this point forward is going to work against them in a
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.520]  in an accelerating fashion i agree with you that it seems like everything the establishment
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:15.440]  does now blows up in their face and when i talk to military or cops or school teachers or auto
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.520]  mechanics or farmers that's why i say so many people on the control left want to have a fight
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:27.040]  a classic communist revolution like the cops of the enemy no the cops i found are more awake than
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.840]  anybody they understand the position they've been put in they understand what's happening so how do
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:36.880]  we aid you agree with the statement i just made and then b how do we avert killing the canary in
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:42.240]  the coal mine as you said when this whole thing kicks off well look i've i've put forward and
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.600]  frankly i would love to run for president for the reform the green and the libertarian party
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.640]  and that's only until angus king or john huntsman sits up and pays attention because i'd rather
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.880]  one of them ran for president with a coalition team but the key to victory here is a series of
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:04.000]  electoral reform workshops around the country the other half of this initiative which is in my little
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.480]  booklet at amazon is the open source activist toolkit which addresses mica sifri's very sound
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.520]  analysis which is we have to learn how to share information and talk to each other but i believe
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:22.400]  we can have an electoral reform summit in june at which all of the prior political candidates
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:29.760]  including ralph nader and jesse venturi and synthia mckinney and uh carol moseley brawn and and so
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:36.800]  many others barbara marx hubbard they all come forward and they all issue a statement of demand
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.480]  now i really want to emphasize that these are not my ideas when i ran for president 2012 after
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:49.200]  getting occupy uh briefed up on electoral reform i was inundated with stakeholders coming to me
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.720]  and so what i have done is i have aggregated the best ideas from across this country on electoral
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.520]  reform and i have put these into a little booklet and a kindle booklet which will also be a create
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:05.920]  space next week uh which basically is a starting point for national dialogue do not under there's
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:11.840]  a great cartoon that shows how much power we have there is a plank out over a cliff and the one
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:17.280]  percenter at the end of that plank standing on thin air and we the people are standing on the other
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.120]  end of the plank on free ground all we have to do is get off the damn plank that's right in fact we
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.560]  would probably pull that up online just type the one percent plank uh graphic and we've had it on
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.760]  info wars dot com before but what you have is the one tenth of one percent that actually run it all
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:39.200]  trying to sick the eighty percent on the other nineteen or so when most of the nineteen percent
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:45.760]  you know that top twenty percent and in that top one percent got their money fair and square
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.520]  employ a bunch of people and are good folks it's that tiny tiny tiny elite that are the real issue
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.480]  and that are actually setting policy globally let's go to who's up first for the guest john in
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:03.920]  florida you're on the air hi i'm just wondering what your guys's take is on snowden is either
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:12.720]  real deal or what do you think um i actually think that snowden is an approved cia operation
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:20.000]  and that the state department took his visa away so that he would be forced to stay in russia in
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:28.320]  exile um i don't believe that snowden would ever in a million years have gone from security guard
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:38.400]  at nsa to cia overseas um uh technical operate another lee harby oswald um no he's far more than
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:45.200]  oswald because he's been used he's been used i think nsa went one blackmail up too far uh and
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.480]  the powers that be started to realize that nsa was doing insider trading to beef up its offshore
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.480]  accounts um basically that's what a lot of heavy hitters have told me is it was a cia nsa fight
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:03.120]  basically yes well no this is this is i mean the first apartment war is going on within the u.s
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:10.400]  government yeah um and one of them is between the fbi and cia and others between nsa and cia and
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.160]  others between nsa and everybody else basically nsa has finally scared the crap out of the one
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.720]  percent that's it and so they're trying to cut it down to size yes got too big for the bridges
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.840]  and and does snowden know that because here's the deal i've had major whistleblowers on from
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:32.560]  the nsa like william benny and so many others no attention you know at nt whistleblowers real
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.520]  whistleblowers almost no coverage but then when snowden comes out i mean the mainstream media
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.360]  got all behind it and i tell you that's what's suspicious it is suspicious and someone else
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.160]  i was discussing this with someone else and the whole way in which the snowden operation
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:55.040]  handled greenwald who i think has been has been uh scammed uh they basically isolated greenwald
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:50:00.800]  they they put him into a little box and so then they started feeding him stuff now let me say
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:07.520]  i think that what's the outcome of the snowden operation has been uniformly positive i have no
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.440]  problem you said it was a good move by the elite to start realizing this panopticon can burn their
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.480]  bridges as well yes but one of the things we really need and actually obama could make much
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:22.160]  much more of his last two years in office if he would get in touch with the truth and with ethics
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:28.080]  because what we have now between jim clapper and uh mike vickers at the department of defense
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.280]  and john brannon with his drone still assassinating people and rendition and torture and kids that
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:39.440]  don't know anything it's a disgrace uh we need our government to get ethical and smart again

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:38.880]  briefly congress stands up to FCC power grab with bill bill important because it reasserts power of
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  congress over unelected bureaucracy now again i've read the bill it isn't perfect but it is
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  congress is supposed to do this you better believe the FCC taking over the internet's not going to
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.680]  protect it but you also better believe that the republican side wants it to be taken over by
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.600]  corporations so we'll talk about the battle for the internet and what google and others are doing
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.800]  with steel who's an expert on it some of the next hour right now let's go to a phone call
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:08.960]  jerald in california you're on the air with our guests go ahead alex always a pleasure um lung
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.080]  cleanse is definitely one of the go-to's for me thank you still uh this has definitely been one of
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:18.480]  the most informative guest appearances at least for me you've given me a lot of tabs to keep open
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:24.400]  and go on research later um now just referring to the snowden incident you know and picking up from
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:30.800]  where you guys left off um after watching citizen four um i believe in this and you know you guys
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:37.040]  can uh interject i believe that the way snowden went about releasing the information is what gained
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.080]  uh publicity for the whole idea you know with him keeping himself out of the picture and just
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.960]  putting the information out to the public in the news media um i think that created a successful
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:51.280]  reaction from the public and you know to get everybody worked out what do you guys think
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:59.200]  well i i think you're right it was managed very very capably the real question and again one of
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.000]  the one of the tenants and i used to be very very good at covert operations i actually wrote the
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.560]  script for the el salvador story in the 1980s for for the entire world i was allowed to bypass
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:16.640]  headquarters and send the message out to 17 stations worldwide the key to a successful
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:23.440]  information operation is to use the truth is use the truth to hide the truth and i think that's
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:30.400]  part of what's happened here um i have no problem with the actual outcome of the snowden operation
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:35.680]  so far but i do have a problem with the fact that we still have an intelligence community that's
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.960]  costing a hundred billion dollars a year that produces less than four percent of what a major
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.080]  commander needs according to general tony zinni so one of the things i would like to do is create
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:51.760]  an open source agency which on b has approved twice at three billion dollars and then i would
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:59.200]  like to cut the secret world back to 20 billion at most because well an open system keep everybody
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.400]  won't i mean it it's common sense an open system is what'll keep people honest not a closed system
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.760]  that will breed corruption right i mean it's very simple i'm in on a rocket scientist to know that
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.960]  so what do we do roll back to 1947 national security act well i i think not only the national
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:22.080]  security act but title 10 needs to be redone because the the military services are out of
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:29.840]  control and totally dishonest the army now has a new monograph out on how lying is endemic to the
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.000]  officer corps and that goes all the way to the chief of staff of the army all right robert stay
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.920]  there we got to come right back in 70 seconds of robert david steel stay with us thank you for

[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:22.080]  on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones this is a short five
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:25.520]  minutes segment we got a 12 minute segment coming up to that and then our guests will leave us and
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.760]  i'll hit all the other news we haven't gotten to yet some of the breaking news and some special
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:36.800]  reports on this live friday edition i want to go back to your calls clarence dug mic
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:44.560]  matthew kato and others in the next segment going back to mr. steel our guest working in the cia i
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:48.640]  know in the middle east and actual operations with the army and others you know the different
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:53.200]  groups and in earlier you pointed out very succinctly what you think is going on with ices but
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.600]  recapping that and expanding are they losing control of the situation or is it just a general
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:06.400]  muslim sectarian war they want a religious war what is the goal looking at this is there a real
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:14.000]  split with saudi arabia with the u.s. to iran or is that all show is this cover so net yahu can hit
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.600]  iran and then the u.s. doesn't get blamed what's what are the smarter people saying in washington
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.280]  well it's i'm very lucky to have gotten to know many of the smarter people most of them don't work
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:30.240]  for the u.s. government um let me explore this at three different levels number one
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.200]  israel's influence in the united states is going to take a sharp downturn
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:41.280]  garith porter has an excellent piece out on how israel has been gaming the iranian threat for
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:46.640]  decades and what i am starting to see in this this last visit by the prime minister to congress
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.240]  may have been the straw that broke the camel's back there are six million jews in the united states
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:58.720]  and the amount of financial and political influence they have is grotesque when you compare that to the
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:07.280]  larger population of 300 million and more six million okay so i think that israel's ability to
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.560]  manipulate the u.s. government is about to take a sharp downturn and the lies that israel zionist
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:18.640]  israel not the good jews of israel have been telling are are about to take a hit number two
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:25.360]  iran is not a threat it never has been a threat it is not a threat uh it is a long-term strategic
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.680]  player and one of the most popular slides uh graphics on my website is the one that shows the
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:40.000]  shunishia split the united states of america dick cheney felt prey to chalabi who was an iranian
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.160]  asset and it was dick cheney that created the turmoil in the middle east the shiites of iraq
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:52.720]  were under saddam hussein's thumb so we have basically created this opportunity for iran to
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:58.800]  reassert itself as a major power and turkey is also reasserting itself as a major sure can you ever
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:04.400]  get rid of iran and iraq once they're in what's that i mean once you let iran into a place how do
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:09.440]  you ever get them out well i'm not sure that's our problem i would like to get us out of the middle
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:15.280]  east uh ambassador mark palmer wrote an excellent book called breaking the real axis of evil and
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:21.840]  what the american taxpayer has to understand is that in our name and bill blooms uh booked on
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:28.400]  killing hope and his latest book on on american nemesis is very important we are best pals with
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:35.600]  42 of the 44 dictators on the planet and most of those dictators are in the middle east um the
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:42.000]  united states government in our name supports dictators and part of the thing people don't
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.600]  understand is that the reason nato is so out of control is because nato is how the u.s military
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:54.880]  industrial complex uh sells arms subsidized by the u.s taxpayers to dictators who are screwing
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:02.880]  their own publics in order to buy larger palaces um and last but not least i think it's extraordinarily
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:09.440]  important to understand uh that we have been grossly irresponsible the department of state under
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.360]  carrie under hillary clinton going all the way back to um madeline albright who once described
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.000]  herself as a gerbil on a wheel which i think is an accurate description of the average u.s
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.240]  secretary of state these people are are insane they're criminally insane and they're very uninformed
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.800]  and they're very unethical and hypocritical and they're not representing the public interest in
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.480]  the middle east i can't disagree with the word he just said we'll be right back with some phone

[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.440]  you after he leaves us but i wanted to throw one more big question at him we see the secretary
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.560]  of defense before hagel was basically kicked out saying the world's more dangerous now than it's
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.880]  ever been lord jacob rothschild came out yesterday and told members of nm rothschild and others the
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.400]  same thing and i'd press release we've got the former fed chairman greenspan saying similar things
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:12.560]  what are they trying to warn us of or do they want to look like
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:18.400]  like they were trying to help if things go south what do you make of the proxy war
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:24.640]  in ukraine where is that going the situation with china geopolitically just give us a brief
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.480]  assessment well the brief the brief assessment is that they're lying to us the world is only
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:36.400]  more dangerous to the 1 percent it's not more dangerous to the 99 percent the bricks and
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:42.560]  particularly russia india and china and iran and indonesia which most people overlook but indonesia
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:48.960]  is easily one of the future superpowers in the 21st century these countries are all committed to
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:56.480]  to peaceful growth they can't afford a war and they don't want a war um and last but not least
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:03.360]  it breaks my heart that for less than five percent of what the one percent have under
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:08.560]  management the trillions and trillions of dollars in false wealth i mean it's obscene
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:13.760]  that the cox should be making three million dollars an hour in interest under digital money
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.560]  for less than five percent of what they have under management i can give every person on this
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:25.280]  planet a full-time salary a house that does not leak running water free energy and an internet
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:31.520]  connection that's right the studies have been done they're legion a literal renaissance a platform
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:36.880]  to the stars instead you read all the globalist finance futurist they're saying humanity's dumb
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:41.600]  are going to merge with machines humanity's crap the elite are going to live forever i mean this is
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:47.120]  really a very uh sickening maria entoinette let them eat cake uh type world view by these
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:52.880]  inbred crazy people well not only that but i i frankly consider the people who worry about
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:58.480]  artificial intelligence as a as an existential threat to be inherently dishonest i worry about
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:04.160]  artificial stupidity the absolute last thing we want to do is automate the morons that we've
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:09.840]  gotten charged now i agree so that's the danger is creating automated autonomous systems that
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:14.720]  these people are in control of because then they don't even have generals or kernels or or operatives
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:21.680]  or the people to say no that's the best thing about humanity is it can learn how to say no in
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:27.200]  the moment i mean i love that movie war games where the two guys are told to do the the trigger or
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:35.840]  that submarine movie where denzel um washington uh stops the captain from launching a nuclear war on
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:42.880]  on russia now people don't remember but in the cuban missile crisis it was a soviet submarine
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:48.480]  commander that refused in order to launch a missile that's right people forget that i'm going to world
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:52.640]  war three tell that story folks that i don't remember they don't know about it well in the
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:57.920]  cuban missile crisis first off the cuban missile crisis was cia's first attempt to destroy john f
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:03.840]  kennedy um that was never intended the bay of the bay of pigs i'm sorry was cia's first attempt
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:09.120]  to destroy kennedy in the cuban missile crisis we ended up doing a blockade and there are two
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.560]  facts that matter the first is that unbeknownst to their governments kennedy and khrushchev were
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:20.320]  in direct private communication and they both agreed that their worst biggest problem and the
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:27.680]  greatest threat to human peace was their respective generals and second it was a soviet submarine
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:35.040]  commander that refused in order to sink a us navy vessel uh enforcing the blockade that kept cuba
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:40.720]  from going to world war three that's right and it was general kurtle slimmé that they famously
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:50.000]  have the part of his jack t ripper in the stanley cubrick uh movie who wants to start the nuclear
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.440]  war with plan r folks don't know but that it was later declassified that kurtle slimmé
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.960]  the head of the strategic air command wanted to do that yes and in fact we have operation northwoods
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:10.320]  which jim bamford has made famous look it is not possible to overstate the lack of integrity at
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.720]  the highest levels of the u.s government and particularly at the highest levels of our uniformed
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:21.600]  services and our senior executive service in the department of defense william benny has said it best
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:28.000]  these people exist to keep the problems going and the money moving they have a severe lack of
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.600]  integrity and they are not at all committed to the public interest but now they've got nuclear
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.360]  weapons when you think about all the mistakes dictators and people made like hitler starting
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:43.120]  a war with russia when he was already losing wars uh in north africa uh i mean that's what
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:48.000]  scary is the elite really could start world war three and are moving in that direction they're
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.840]  very unstable well i would i would also draw your attention to the damage being done every day by
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:00.080]  by industry i mean bo paul for example i was reading a very very useful piece in counter punch
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:07.040]  in which we ought to make it illegal for any industrial process to produce any poison for
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:13.120]  which we do not have a solution um there's a wonderful book by charles perot who wrote the book
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:18.240]  normal accidents dealing with high-risk technologies he's written a more recent book on catastrophes
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:24.240]  he he points out that there is a tank of chlorine sitting above the superhighway going into new york
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:30.960]  city in new jersey that if you can put a hole in that thing and light it on fire you will wipe out a
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:37.120]  good portion of brooklyn uh as well as portions of manhandle and by the way i mean i'm no former cia guy
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:42.240]  like you but i know how to read warfare manuals and and study warfare and the stuff people are
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.320]  worried about anarchist cookbook that thing's a joke there's nothing in there but what is important
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:52.720]  is what real sleeper teams and special forces like five guys per city could do dumping chlorine
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.880]  down skyscrapers uh blowing up chlorine tanks stuff like that which any real terrorists know about
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:03.760]  i mean real terrorists don't sit there and you know have 75 iqs and you know try to do a truck
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.800]  bomb at the fbi cooked it's just if there was real terrorism folks we would know about it and then
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:13.760]  there you are mentioning things that would kill hundreds of thousands you don't need a nuke let
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.920]  me give you two bottom lines first off there's a book called dying to win the people that we are
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:25.040]  confronting are not terrorists they're freedom fighters and we are invading their homeland the
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.760]  absolute stupidest thing the u.s. government could do is put ground forces into the middle east
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:34.880]  again we ought to get out of there we should close down the 44 bases that surround but instead
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:39.200]  the synthetic ices that you pointed out was trained by the cia it's been put in to do what
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:45.920]  be then projected on everybody else draw us into war yeah it's been put in there to draw us into war
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:52.560]  so that we can force the american taxpayer to pay for a new military to do a new elective war
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:16:00.800]  this is corruption this is treason well i mean it's so obvious that ices works for the west
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:05.280]  it's been admitted that's another thing why are the elite getting so reckless i mean used to
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.760]  i've studied you know different operations and things that they never seem to be this reckless
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:15.760]  or am i wrong i think you're right alex i think what you're seeing is the last spasms of of an out
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:21.040]  of control system i have a i have a guest review coming up with a of a new book and you know there
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:27.440]  have been a number of excellent books by by gur and others on on secrecy and the empire and and
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:37.840]  so forth what you have here is essentially a syphilic system firing its last round of machine
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:44.800]  gun bullets that's it is kind of like a syphilic fever of mental illness let's talk to russell
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:50.560]  in vermont you're on the air go ahead hey alex how you doing man pretty crazy doing this interview
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:56.160]  it makes you think about how just extreme everything is it really is yeah no kidding
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:04.320]  my question for your guest was how does all this these proxy wars and skirmishes with ices conflict
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:10.960]  with currency values in the world and when those skirmishes are over and the and the iraq comes
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:17.760]  back on a seat so to say um how does that how does the value of denar denar affects the value of the
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:26.560]  dollar because let me let me go back to mark lewis who wrote a book in the 1980s called liars poker
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:32.240]  and that was the first major book by an insider that essentially demonstrated that the entire
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:39.680]  financial system is rigged and it's still rigged i mean i personally think that not just greece but
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:45.600]  spain and portugal and everybody else should tell goldman sacks to take a hike um these people
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.800]  these bankers the debt that exists today is not actually debt it's interest the debt has already
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:56.240]  been paid off these people have made their money and more in fact they create money uh that they
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:00.640]  don't have a right to create uh and they charge us interest they don't have a right to collect this
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:06.240]  is all fraudulent what we need to do and and there's a lot of good stuff coming up from mikel
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:11.840]  bowens and collaborative economy and so forth richard wolf i've mentioned before we need to put
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:17.360]  workers back in charge of production we need to eliminate absentee landlords we need to eliminate
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.960]  private banking i love ellen brown's book on public banking that's absolutely huge and the long
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:28.800]  and the short of it is we need to restore local currencies and we need to restore value based
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:36.000]  based on people land and labor by the way this just ends seeing in feds prepare criminal charges
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.800]  against senator bob menendez for political corruption basically pushing deals as political donors
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:46.480]  they'll have to indict all of them but you do you see a purging starting to happen here
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:51.280]  why do you think that's why are they going after hillary for these fake emails and obviously
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:56.240]  breaks the law but a bunch of them do it i'm not defending her but why are we seeing this season now
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:01.360]  of political indictments political destructions is that trying to throw the public a bone that
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.640]  some reforms having happening well the the left and the right are starting to position themselves
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:11.600]  for 2016 i mean i personally think that the absolute best thing that could happen for
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:17.040]  democracy is jeb bush versus hillary clinton because that makes angus king and his coalition
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:22.560]  team an absolute shoo-in yeah i think that's why deeper groups in the deep state now want to get
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:26.960]  rid of jeb and hillary because they realize that'll that'll really cause an overthrow of their system
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.080]  i is that what you're getting at yes i am that's what i was gonna say earlier before you got on
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:37.520]  was they're going after the dirtiest people right now to try to make the system look clean
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.360]  because they realize right to you alex they're not going after the dirtiest people if they were
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:45.680]  going after the dirtiest people epstein would have been hung by now oh i mean i agree with you

[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:15.200]  before you slip into unconsciousness i'd like to have another kiss another
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:21.920]  kiss you've got senator menendez
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:28.160]  back in 2010 took some flights with one of his donors to the Dominican Republic and other areas
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.120]  in a federal investigation two years ago he agreed to pay back $58,000 so i agree with what
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:38.240]  mr. steel was just saying earlier that they're going after mid-level nobodies for small corruption
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.440]  i'm saying some of the worst nastiest people though like hillary clinton and and menendez
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:50.720]  people that are publicly there with bigger scandals like he has of a sexual nature and
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.920]  other things that have come out so what they're doing is throwing a few bones to the dog
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:03.600]  but it shows how they'll never go after folks for really big issues finishing up with your
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:10.560]  statement on that and then one final phone call well no i i believe that the governor of virginia
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:17.840]  was taken down because he was uh small enough to crucify sure and it's always for some little
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:23.280]  petty things some vitamin company or something it's it's just meanwhile giant huge levels of
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:27.520]  corruption are taking place i mean is it a war crime for our government to fund the syrian
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.280]  free syrian army mainly made up of al-qaeda and have them run around and engage in mass
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:34.640]  murder and then turn around three years later and say we've got to have a war with them now
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:40.000]  i think it's treason for the united states government to be engaged in a war that has
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.760]  not been properly sanctioned by congress sure and now we see an acceleration of congress
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.560]  advocating its authority handing it over to the executive is that because of blackmail
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:56.800]  or because they just want plausible deniability look all of the checks and balances have gone
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:02.080]  i mean i've got a i've got a video coming out soon but i brief a book called uh the power
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:08.000]  and the ambition it used to be that congress executed article one of its responsibilities
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.200]  as a balance of power but when newt gingrich destroyed speaker right he turned the members
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:18.720]  into a voting bloc that is sold to the highest bidder so congressman today don't actually
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.920]  read legislation they vote the way they're told because their vote has been sold by their party
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:28.880]  that's what we have to get rid of that's right that's why they laugh and say we don't read the
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:35.600]  bills we don't read our emails from you either yeah we just go play golf and you know we make
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:41.440]  money part of the problem that you learn is that congress has to spend 75 percent of its time begging
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:46.480]  for money and then when they get caught actually getting the money to be in congress they get sent
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:52.320]  to jail to scare the rest of the herd to play ball uh let's go to one final caller i'll take the
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:56.720]  rest after our guest leaves us clarence in texas thanks for holding her on the air with robert
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:03.760]  david spiel thank you uh you're talking to a former optimist who basically and uh pessimist is a
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:09.600]  optimist with experience but uh i just very pessimistic about uh taking our country back
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:16.720]  and i view the ones that are truly in control of our system or our uh electorate electoral system
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:23.680]  and everything else as the uh crude analogy of the alien facehugger on the uh human host because
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.800]  when you go to try to take that thing off it's going to kill you and until it's done it's dirty
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:35.200]  work and so uh my thought is to you what is your thought on if we do if they see that we're starting
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:40.160]  to take back and truly have a constitutional republic where actually our vote means something
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.360]  don't you think that they're going to basically say okay we've lost control of america so uh
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:50.320]  we're going to release the whatever well you know the facehugger wants to lay more bushes
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:56.080]  in in in clinton's in our stomach and then scurry off itself and die i think if it sees enough people
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:00.560]  waking up it may actually go scurry and hide before it lays its eggs uh but that but you've
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:06.160]  got a good point that's a great question to end with with mr steel look the bottom line is these
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.840]  people are not completely stupid and i think it's really really critical to make the observation
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:18.960]  that we're offering them an exit strategy we're offering them a nonviolent truth and reconciliation
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:24.160]  exit strategy and if they don't want that if they want to have it's not this is not about burning
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:30.800]  down their mansions this is about shooting their lear jets out of the sky okay i don't think they
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:36.000]  understand how many pissed off veterans are capable of shooting down a lear jet today
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:43.120]  so they have a choice they can get out of the way and accept an exit strategy that is nonviolent
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:49.920]  that does not go after their existing wealth or not well it's it's certainly going down that road
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:54.320]  what do you make in in 60 seconds of the russia ukraine situation who's really behind it where is
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:29:00.960]  it going i think the united states government is behind it because we actually uh fostered a uh
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:07.520]  a revolt there we've substituted a corrupt fascist government for a corrupt communist government
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:13.360]  we broke our word to russia in expanding nato into eastern europe the bottom line is the united
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:19.360]  states as martin luther king said long ago is the single most destabilizing toxic force on the
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:27.440]  planet wow powerful interview mr steele thank you so much for your time today it was very enlightening

[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:36.720]  my eyes when i get allergies and just feeling like i had 20 martinis last night and i didn't have one
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:43.440]  i mean that's what it feels like i feel like i had 20 vodka martinis last night or it's college
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:48.800]  and i had like 10 shots tequila or something i mean i feel like i've been run over and almost
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.000]  everybody else i know feels like this i was talking to my grandmother who's lived her her whole life
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:59.280]  89 years old she has allergies the last decade she never had them and i think it's the gmo the
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:05.520]  stuff in the year the a lot of the jet stream that dumps in out of china comes into over texas i
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:12.400]  i don't know what it is but even though i've done mitigating things to try to feel better
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:19.280]  i'm a little bit sluggish that's why you might hear me slur my words because it is just i just
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:27.040]  feel hammered sometimes and you know i don't feel so bad till i get on the year but man you spend
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:31.760]  two three four hours really focusing and you got allergies that wears your brain out and i didn't
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:38.000]  mean to go off into some whining sector there i was just letting folks know why you hear me coughing
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:45.520]  and sniffling a little bit here and there because mold elm and things like that do that to me
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:51.760]  separately though the answer is drinking more water more purified water i would have allergies
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:56.400]  even worse four or five years ago before i started drinking more water and you know things like that
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:02.400]  but it's a point for a larger discussion why are allergies and in food allergies thank god i don't
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:08.800]  have any of those why are so many allergies just exponentially increasing in the population to where
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:14.240]  epi pins in public and private schools are ubiquitous now and so many kids carry them in their
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:19.600]  pockets because they might die if they didn't is it just that we're getting more contact with
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:25.040]  things that hype up our immune system i never growing up and then i'll go to your calls and
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:33.360]  cover the news we would do things called uh wasp fights with ping pong paddles and water guns
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:38.480]  we would go into barns and houses and garages and yellow jackets would get these little bushes
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:42.320]  in the neighborhood and we would run up and stir them up and then sit there and not kill them but
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:47.120]  have fights with them and i'd run home with all these things on me and my mom would put bacon
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.400]  stood on me and say alex stop playing that game uh one time my dad was he was a kid playing a similar
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:58.320]  game and they were in a barn and uh he was with his friend his friend had his you know head shaved
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:05.680]  to a burr haircut they were like 10 years old it was actually uh mike caps former cnn top anchor
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:10.400]  my dad grew up with him really nice guy he's also been a voice of the rangers and bunch of the stuff
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.560]  i don't know why mice call me a few times i need to call him up he's a really nice guy but side
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:19.920]  issue he goes up the top of the barn and the whole thing a red wasp sticks on his head but
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:28.640]  but i had been stung by honeybees and stuff let's not exaggerate 30 40 times in my life but one time
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.880]  i got changed by a swarm of partially africanized bees because they sent people out there after it
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:39.760]  happened it was at my parents house and they stung me like 15 20 times i held these stingers in my
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:43.280]  head and neck i ran in their house it was like they followed me in the house it was like a cartoon
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:52.640]  where the big big black swarm of bees and man i swelled up almost i'm going to the hospital so
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:57.760]  i'm digressing it's just the larger question is once you get the allergy because i've been
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:02.160]  stung by honeybee since then and i start swelling up again so it's kind of like what is it in our
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.760]  environment where we never had allergies it's triggering them now because you start getting
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:12.240]  dominated by these allergies you start getting really sick of it but so much of it is in the gut
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:15.760]  so i'll just turn this into a plug didn't do this on purpose one thing would sell me my
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:21.520]  allergies is oxy powder it's a higher level of oxygen meaning it breaks down it's almost the
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:28.320]  level of um so i'm not a scientist we have videos that explain it of ozone and that's just a super
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:33.200]  high level of oxygen and it breaks down in the upper and lower intestine and is dramatic how it
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:39.360]  scrubs all the garbage off the walls and it just peacefully comfortably will then leave the body
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.600]  that's been my experience you've heard the rave reviews from listeners and quite frankly
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:50.320]  this is not a sales pitch i mean it is but it's the truth i don't know how everyone out there
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:59.440]  doesn't buy this right now because you want dramatic results you're going to get it in my
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.240]  experience i mean maybe i'm wrong maybe somebody isn't i don't i don't people that have gone on
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:09.520]  at six seven days or backed up like going to the bathroom once a week that they call me friends and
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.400]  family they go you know i spend five days and i and then also they call me go oh my gosh and then
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:18.320]  a month later oh i go i go to the bathroom twice a day now it's all fixed thank you so much this
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:24.320]  is really amazing can you imagine me and backed up for a week a lot of people are not me but this
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:31.840]  stuff is just unbelievable it's just oxygen but time released those through your stomach into the
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.320]  upper and lower intestine releases you take four or five capples when you go to bed at night and get
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.240]  ready to rock and roll about two three days later some people that's in one day if your
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.680]  gut's already in pretty good shape you're going to see a big result the next day but if you're
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:52.080]  kind of moderately messed up like me two three days later holy Toledo but and then after you've done it
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.240]  then you once a month every couple months do it and it'll absolutely in my experience change your
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:03.920]  life oxy powder info warslife.com had a bunch of other specials that are about to expire on a free
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:10.880]  bottle of ancient defense we've got 30 off superfuel vitality that will end as soon as it sells out
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:19.360]  there could be any minute info warslife.com or 888-253-3139 let's go ahead and take a call
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:26.800]  let's talk to Matthew in Alabama you're on the air hey Alex how's it going i'm doing pretty good
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:34.320]  Matthew well i want to talk about CPAC today i don't know if you watched it but it absolutely
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:41.360]  made my day to see Jeb Bush getting booed before during and after his speech it was fantastic
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:45.120]  i thought he got booed a couple days ago there in CPAC to be speaking in
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:50.320]  it was it was the same same period there in CPAC
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:55.760]  okay well i gotta be honest with you i've been following it but i haven't been watching it i just
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:00.800]  read the headlines from you know the Ron Paul websites and ours are you saying that Jeb Bush
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.600]  got booed again have you seen me guys look up Jeb Bush being booed i should have played that days
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:12.720]  ago did he get booed again before he gave his speech i think it was like the 27th of February
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:19.600]  multiple people mentioned him before he came on stage and he got booed several several times
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:24.560]  that's beautiful yeah we don't need him we don't need Hillary none of these scumbags think of the
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:31.840]  arrogance of the anti-gun pro open border slime ball trying to get up there and tell us to accept
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:38.240]  him again i mean no not hillary not jeb no no no and baner you can go with him
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:46.320]  what i really wanted to ask you about is if you happen to have seen a speech given by newt
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:55.360]  dingridge in CPAC that was probably one of the best speeches out of the whole event and i highly
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:02.080]  recommend you watch it or get some of your people to watch it because he took several jabs at the
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:07.200]  clinton foundation for accepting money from countries that consistently fund terrorism
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:15.600]  he took a slightly veiled jab at the bush family i think for funding funding hitler
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:22.560]  during the second world war amazing it was it was fantastic and i recommend you look into it
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:28.400]  all right matthew we'll get on and i gotta tell you this up a little rhetoric saying obama's
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:34.000]  becoming a dictator saying the bushes are garbage they've intimidated everybody to not speak up but
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  what do they do when everybody starts speaking up you see they can't stop us we're reaching
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:44.960]  that critical mass there it is on the boston globe conservatives bootjeb bush at maryland
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.720]  gathering so it wasn't was that c-SPAC was c-PAC in maryland this year scroll down please
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:56.800]  or just print me the article and i'll look it's just too much information i'm just overwhelmed
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:03.600]  but we'll get on it i'm sure if it's there the video is available and that says february 27th
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.400]  yeah that was another event i think the caller must have just seen something that yeah it's c-PAC
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:15.040]  and that was last week all right thank you thought it was a time warp or something
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:19.600]  mike in illinois you're on the air hi alex how are you i'm all right
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:27.280]  i'm the antithesis of an earlier caller who said that they're a pessimist i am an optimist
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:32.720]  because i believe in the american people and i believe in our system of government our system
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:37.600]  of government if you really understand what it is is probably one of the most beautiful
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:41.920]  creations of government that have ever existed that's right it's designed so that all these
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.080]  agencies and governments fight with each other and and then it can ever get together to create a
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:52.000]  dictator well the original premise was is that the power that was held within our system of
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:58.880]  government was held within the states in order to keep it decentralized yes so because once the
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:05.120]  country became too big and our founding fathers knew this our job as citizens in this country is
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:10.080]  to micromanage our states it's a manageable segment that's right the founding fathers were
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:16.160]  geniuses among geniuses it was true brilliance and it's really important that people understand
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:20.480]  that you guys everybody that here's my voice right now you hold the key to the solution of this but
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:27.520]  you have to stop paying attention to all of this tv stuff you can tell me who's up for a vote on your
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:32.960]  next reality tv show but you can't tell me what politicians are going to be voting next you can
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:37.840]  tell me the record of your favorite sports teams but you can't tell me the voting record of your
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:43.920]  politicians we are the reason that the system is the way it is right now and it is still fixable
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:49.760]  until they turn around and openly tell the world that that system no longer exists and it's really
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:55.120]  important that everybody understand that because the checkmate to all of this federal encroachment
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:00.000]  is to reinvigorate our i know that's why i called for the second american declaration of
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:04.080]  independence a few years ago i got a lot of circulation it's a plan to do just that and
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:09.280]  i'm glad that you're so positive in your prognosis i agree if you want to know where the problem is
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:16.880]  look in the mirror as v says and we can blame ourselves that's why george soros wants us to
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:22.640]  scapegoat the cops if we take control of our legislatures in our cities you won't have bad cops
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:27.440]  out there getting away with bad stuff that is a manifestation of us degenerating so i'm not going
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:33.200]  to just sit here and scapegoat the cops or scapegoat a race of people or no no no we're the problem
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:38.560]  we let this happen look in the mirror realize it and have optimism that if we just stand up and take
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:43.520]  action it's over i bless you mike i want to go to kato and others but first let me hit some stories
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.440]  i mentioned we actually have a newscast clip about this cps charges parents with neglect
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:55.040]  for allowing kids a 10 and six year old to walk home from the playground neighbor called police
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:00.480]  at responding children just a mile away from home what a good neighbor meanwhile reports children
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:07.520]  taken away from parents by cps wind up in sex trafficking trade and then i mean i've had members
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:12.480]  of the what was it it was the georgia senate she was about to expose this and they came to her
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:16.240]  house and killed her and her husband i mean and i'm not saying all the cps are involved
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:21.200]  no no no but this is this is where all over the place at penn state or in england it doesn't
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:26.720]  matter they get them out of the cps out of the foster care system because no one will
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.960]  then believe them because they're in the system now let's go to the newscast about the children
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:36.000]  being taken away by cps winding up in sex trafficking trade protective services that i
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:45.040]  mentioned a little while ago in orange county last year they had a bust for this traffickers
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:55.040]  they got 105 people victims of trafficking human trafficking 65 of those 65 percent of
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:03.520]  those victims were wards of child protective services not only were they wards of child
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:10.160]  protective services but check this out they were never reported missing child protective services
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:16.480]  and that's buzz saw shan stones tv show it's excellent and we'll put up on screen the lady of
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.800]  that the name of that lady who we should get on as a guest who's the national director and founder
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:28.240]  of national safe child all over the world they use the child welfare grid as the spotting and
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:33.680]  venting zone to then disappear children and this has just come out so many so many times time and
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:41.680]  time again we played this clip yesterday and didn't notice that it was going on but then listeners
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.560]  called us and pointed it out and sure enough bright bart had it whoops john urnus refers to
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:52.320]  president clinton while explaining hillary emails that's because they they see hillary as the president
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:57.280]  of the democratic criminal operation and that she was co-president for eight years with uh
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:03.520]  with billy boy and it's such a good thing to see her in so much trouble and such a good thing to see
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:08.400]  jeb bush being booed and and going down in the polls because we are just sick of all these snot
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:15.040]  nose establishment punks uh let's go to that clip of where uh the reporter uh is talking to him and
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:20.320]  the press secretary calls her president clinton here it is so okay josh if they were held to the
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:26.640]  same standard after dozens of questions over two days why can't you just once say secretary clinton
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:33.040]  did not follow that guidance because the guidance that has been given to these individual agencies
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:37.520]  is to ensure that they are in compliance with the federal records act which actually indicates
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:43.840]  that uh when personal email is used for official government business it's required for that personal
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:49.520]  email to be stored properly maintained and preserved at the agency and that according to
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:55.520]  president's clinton clinton's team is exactly what they did which would you're yeah president clinton's
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:00.400]  team we're gonna break and come back and take some more calls i meant to start the show with
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.880]  us today but i didn't do it yesterday i talked about imagine you're watching the nba and then
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:10.480]  there's psas with lebron james sponsored by google and facebook telling you men you don't do enough
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:15.200]  work clean up more around the house as if men inherently are bad or didn't do something being
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.160]  lectured by the very sports system that turns them into couch potatoes and as they live through
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:27.920]  other men's action in a fake game that doesn't matter for the elite we covered that yesterday

[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:17.280]  last two articles that i just mentioned so people get it in context it's part of a larger operation
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:22.720]  eating three meals a day declared racist by mother jones nba launched a feminist campaign to lecture
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:27.920]  men not doing enough housework and their new campaign on their time to play it's gonna take
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:36.240]  a few phone calls men are losers says new feminist campaign i mean you cannot make this stuff up
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:43.840]  these people are out of their minds they want women to think that all problems on earth are
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:52.320]  because of men at their level not globalist not criminals but just men the ultimate form of divide
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:58.480]  and conquer and so many women you run into they really are just convinced you're bad and and men
[02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:02.960]  in period of the problem and they'll tell you and then you get right down to it they're not
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:07.680]  politically correct and it's all just something they say to try to sound like they're in the
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:14.800]  end crowd and they go no i hate it you're right it's it's terrible i following fads following the
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:23.120]  system will get you nowhere blame it on hormones men are the cause of today's problems another
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:32.480]  article out of uh huvington post i mean it's just an onslaught men are inherently bad part of the
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:39.120]  species imagine if you said women were inherently bad see these are the race pimps promoting racism
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:44.640]  in the name of fighting it so the new thing that's kosher to be racist against is men it is
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:51.360]  racism you're against the race of men really these are just women that want to boss around and
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:58.320]  dominate other women as their leaders really sick of very jezebelian time to be alive and you know
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:06.640]  when a society goes on the road to jezebel the collapse is near you see women record unemployment
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:11.360]  record debt record unhappiness and they just dig deeper into feminism thinking it's going to give
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:17.680]  them valhalla they're like spanish conquistadors wandering around till they die over thousands
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:23.440]  of miles of the southwest looking for the fabled gold temples and the natives just kept saying
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:30.080]  the gold's that way the gold temples are that way no no not here gold over there was that

[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.520]  okay yeah i want to talk about the huge elephant in the room of mankind it's religion
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:03.840]  my opinion religion is the poison that is destroying the world i agree with you not not
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:10.160]  true spiritual issues but what else is religion carbon taxes feminism racism there are thousands of
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:14.800]  things that are religions uh you know people like race cars i mean it's a religion that i tend to
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:20.560]  almost follow i understand it i like to drive them not wash them uh but i get what you're saying but
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:24.480]  it there's more than just saying christianity is the problem because it's not real christianity it's
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:32.800]  a christianoid fake thing well christianity is immoral it's uh uh let me guess though that's
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:40.960]  what you got your big problem with them it's it's treason the values and um uh it dismisses this world
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:47.520]  in favor of an expected next one and a lot of people are uh going mankind and the world under
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:54.880]  the bus for their next world fantasy and uh well i do agree that modern i'm going to hold you over

[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:04.800]  but you're right that fake modern i'm going to be raptured christianity becomes a cop out to ever
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:08.960]  fight tyranny because oh the devil did that i'm not going to warn anybody i'm going to hide my
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:14.560]  church till i get beamed up by scotty but that's not real christianity brother we gotta put the

[02:59:59.920 --> 03:00:06.240]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents the alex jones show because there's a
[03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:15.840]  war on for your mind all right kato i think i heard what you have to say uh they're the
[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:22.800]  problems of the christians no the problem is the fake christians hiding in their megachurches
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:29.280]  glitter bugging about andrew in iowa you're on the air thanks for holding oh alex thanks for
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:40.960]  taking my call welcome brother um yeah my main issue today is the middle east situation with
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:49.600]  israel and iran heating up i think that we need to pay close attention to this and other issues
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:57.360]  domestically but we need to pay attention to this situation because deep down in my gut i have a
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:03.280]  gut feeling that this is going to be the next huge war i think that we're going to team up
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:09.920]  with net and yahoo behind the scenes that attack iran and bring the middle east into another
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:17.120]  bigger war oh i agree and and we could wake up any morning and reactors have been blown up and
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.360]  the iranians are attacking back and then we're in a huge war and we'll be diverted with that
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.720]  war while they open the borders and everything else that's happening you're absolutely right
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:33.200]  good point thank you andrew joshua in texas you're on the air go ahead joshua yes hello mr
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:39.680]  drones how are you good okay let me give a little background information before i ask my question i
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:44.400]  promise i'll be quick i'm interested in going to dental school but as you i'm sure you know
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:49.520]  dental school is quite expensive and my family didn't have a whole lot of money so i would have to
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:57.840]  take out loans but i'm not interested in $500,000 in debt and this economy so my grandfather who
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:03.840]  served in the military he's not in anymore he suggested i pursued through the army so i went
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:08.960]  so i went to the recruiter and went to the process i'm not signed on or anything yet but i was
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:15.840]  interested in joining and i was listening to your radio program one day and i heard how the
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:21.200]  military was putting microchips into soldiers and i did some research on my own and i found that
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:27.600]  the washington post and world net daily and i think it was new american they all had a report
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:33.920]  on the same thing like three years ago in 2012 but i want to see what the recruiter had to say so i
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:39.280]  went to the navy recruiter this time and i asked them about that information i presented the articles
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:44.080]  to them and they said they had not heard of that not that i'm saying you're wrong no no i believe
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:50.000]  them it's only special officers and the special forces types that have gotten the chips so far
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:55.120]  but i mean that's why it's in the news it's a fact okay so here's my question with all that being said
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:58.160]  i wouldn't be worried about the microchip i'd be worried about the vaccines they give you in the
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:03.360]  military i think it's great to have good people join the military and get get aid and go into
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:09.200]  college and stuff later in fact the military will put you through dental school sir if you promise
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:13.760]  to then enlist after you have the degree that's one of the best and then you're going to be an officer
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:18.480]  i want to take the vaccines little news flash for you i was good friends with the guy he moved
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:22.880]  moved away he actually went back to the army dr dillingham we used to go to competitive police
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:28.480]  shooting deals that had civilians involved and uh he was a great guy he'd been in the army come out
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:33.520]  and been a dentist went back on the army he liked it so much wasn't the air force that was the army
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:38.480]  and so i know at least when he went they put him through college before he was even in the army
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:43.680]  but he had the grades he had the grades i think he went to college for two years and then he went
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:48.720]  they have a program at least they did to put you through medical school to promise to then join the
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.400]  military so that might be a pretty good plan for you i don't know if that's still in place
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.840]  so you think it'd be a good idea for me to join the military to receive the industry or
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:02.960]  some other type of education it's one of the only ways you can do it not have a bunch of
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:09.840]  debts on you and uh you know i support our troops i don't support some of the illegal wars and i
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:13.200]  think it's an honorable thing to join the military the problem is they treat you so bad
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:17.920]  then say you're the enemy after you're out but if that's your path to try to get a dental degree
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:24.320]  uh that i'm not going to certainly look down my nose at you i mean i got a beam in my eye compared
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:29.520]  to you buddy i'm certainly not judging around here i was a bit concerned because i heard you
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:33.440]  talk about how the military is trained to take the guns away and the my yeah i would not join
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:37.200]  my i would tell my son don't join today but that's because he would have other opportunities probably
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:41.360]  uh but i don't but i get joining i mean i kind of wanted to people to join
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:45.920]  so we got patriots in there then they treat you so bad i say yeah they don't do it but then i get
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:50.880]  man i understand it there's a lot of different ways to look at it's what i'm saying hey i'm sorry
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:55.040]  josh i'm out of time chris slim dug around the time great job the crew see you back tonight
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:05:12.320]  seven o'clock central and friday four o'clock
