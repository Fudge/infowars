[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]  It's Wednesday September 13th, 2023. I'm your host Alex Jones. Parrots is supposed to be breaking massive news and covering big developments in the first hour, and I will begin in the second, third, and fourth hour again today, live.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000]  It's my second day of being deposed in the early morning, or again, right up until noon. I'm your host Alex Jones, very blessed and honored to be here with you. We have a lot of obviously very important developments.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  The major Black Sea port, Russian port of Sapastopol, was hit by British and US-made cruise missiles. It appears these are longer-range missiles that have just been being delivered to the Ukrainians, a massive escalation in the war.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  There are reports and, of course, footage that we're showing you now of what appears to be ships on fire and things like oil depots. This is a next-level development here on the Rand Corporation's threat continuum ladder.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  This is happening because Russia is winning the war in Ukraine, and NATO has told the world that they will basically involve the rest of the planet in any level of escalation that they see fit to, quote, kick Russia out of Ukraine.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  I'm not defending Putin. I wish he wouldn't have invaded, but the truth is the West overthrew Ukraine nine years ago, and is that a proxy war ever since? And Russia felt threatened, so they invaded.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  But who I do mainly blame is George Soros, the globalist who bragged that they've orchestrated this whole thing, while at the same time laundering billions and billions of dollars a month through Ukraine back into their pockets.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  Now, who in their right mind would support Russia putting hundreds of thousands of troops in, say, Toronto, Canada, and moving missiles up against the border, and then attacking Americans that lived along the edge of the border?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  You would never put up with that. We would go to war with Russia. We are in Russia's backyard. We are in the birthplace of Russia, and the Russians have said they will not allow this to happen.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  And they're a nuclear power. So on the threat ladder, if Russia starts to lose, as hundreds and hundreds of these 1,000-pound, 2,000-pound bomb cruise missiles are delivered, they can take out the Russian command control systems, they can take out their bunkers, they can take out their ships, if that continues, the Russians have said they're going to start hitting NATO targets.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  They said that a year ago. So this is, again, unprecedented danger to all of civilization and humanity, and we have madmen at the helm of the West.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  And by the way, they're madmen in their own words. Biden last year said if we give them Abrams tanks, that's World War III. Only a crazy person would do that. The head of NATO said if we give them F-16s a year ago, that escalates.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  They said if we give them medium-range cruise missiles, heavy cruise missiles, that's a massive escalation. We can't do that. But now suddenly, a year later, they can.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  So this is how wars escalate. It's been studied. Humans have been studied. We've studied how conflicts expand, and we're right now in the middle of it big time.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  So I'm going to be covering this more coming up. Obviously, now McCarthy says the impeachment of Biden is moving forward because Republicans threatened to remove him.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  There's a new indictment developments against Trump federally. Troyer was sentenced to 60 days in jail for the First Amendment, making him a free speech martyr.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  There are so many other huge issues. The border's completely dissolved, but Mayorkas is giving himself congratulations, saying it's the best border control we've ever had.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  So this is the de-evolution of our country. This is the breakdown of it for the great reset, the collapse of civilization to bring on their global system.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  But humanity is awakening, and we see major movement by leaders around the world, both corporate, religious, and governmental, saying no to the New World Order.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  But that's what makes them so dangerous because their whole program is being exposed. Their attempts at new lockdowns is falling flat on its face.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  But again, we've got to continue to press the attack and the information war, and we have a good chance of turning this around. If we don't, we are literally doomed.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  We'll come back from break with the great Harrison Smith, and I'll be back later. Thanks for all your support.

[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones just for a little while. He will be taking over momentarily, but in the meantime, we have some massive news to break.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  In a number of different topics, we have the out-of-control, full-on invasion taking place at our southern border and making its way all the way up into the formerly sanctuary cities.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  Now, people are regretting that quite a bit. I'll also be talking about the impeachment inquiry that has begun, thanks to Matt Gaetz pressuring Kevin McCarthy.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  We've got new information about the lab leak COVID cover-up and how the intelligence agencies were involved in that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  We've got employment and economic news that ties into the invasion and some real classic conspiracy topics as well.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  Aliens being revealed in Mexico, iPhone radiation being banned in France, the Magic Bullet Theory and the JFK assassination.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  We have just a heck of a lot to talk about, so we'll try to get to as much of it as possible before Alex takes over here in about an hour or so, but stay tuned for that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  Should we start with the alien stuff? No, we'll start with the actually important stuff first.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  That is the massive war that America started in Ukraine by overthrowing their duly elected government and installing a more friendly puppet regime in its place.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  The latest from infowars.com, Russia's navy port at Sevastopol on fire after massive Ukraine missile attack.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  In the overnight and morning hours of Wednesday, a major attack has ensued on Russia's key Black Sea naval port of Sevastopol.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  Multiple social media videos emerged showing massive blazes at the Sevastopol shipyard with possible deaths and at least 24 people being reported injured.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  And unless I'm wrong, this was the same port that they wanted to use Elon Musk's Starlink internet network to attack and he prevented them from doing so.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  This was a missile attack, or at least that's what the initial reporting says is strongly hinted at, based on statements by Sevastopol governor Razo Zevs.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  Based on statements by the Sevastopol governor, he said, our enemies attacked Sevastopol and our air defenses were at work.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  This is just the latest and perhaps most egregious escalation of the Ukraine war.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  The Ukraine air attack early Wednesday sparked a fire at Sevastopol shipyard in Crimea.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol announced this on the Telegram app.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  And yeah, as you just heard Alex point out in the first five minutes there, this is a predictable escalation because time and time again, we're told that sending tanks would be, that's over the line.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  Sending fighter jets, that's too far. That would be World War III.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  If we send long-range missiles, there's no way they'd attack, you know, places inside Russia.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  That would be World War III and then you give them six months or a year and suddenly that's exactly what's happening.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  There's no end in sight to the Ukraine war.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  There could have been, there should be.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  Peace is there if we want it, but that's not what the people in charge want.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  From the Gateway Pundit, 72,000 Ukrainian casualties in 110 billion dollar meat grinder.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  Ewan says the world cannot afford for this senseless war to continue and yet we keep funding it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  And in fact, the latest pronouncement from the powers that be is that they have funds to carry out the Ukraine war until 2032.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  So this is just another 10 year long endless quagmire of death and destruction.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  And you know, maybe once those 10 years are over, then it'll be our turn to go to war with like the Azov battalion.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  We'll call them domestic or international terrorists and go to war with them.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  That seems to be the pattern that these wars take over and over again.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  I have to say, since I've been in middle school and watching Infowars,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  Infowars has been firmly on the side of anti-war, anti-establishment divide in this country.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  And it's never been wrong. It's never been wrong.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  We never look back at the Iraq war and go, yeah, yeah, I was against that before,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  but now I really see the value in destroying Iraq and killing a million people.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  I thought it was dumb at first, but now I realize what a brilliant and wonderful thing that was.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  Nobody thinks that. Nobody looks back and says, you know, I should have supported that war when I had the chance.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  Everybody, on the other hand, looks back and says, we were tricked into that.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  That was a lie. That was a total fabrication. The weapons of mass destruction, that was a complete boondoggle.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  We should have never been in there and it's been nothing but disaster ever since.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  And I expect we'll have a similar reaction with Ukraine, why people can't recognize this pattern
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  and then take that into account when deciding whether or not they want to support the current war.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  It sort of baffles me. I don't get how they don't understand.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  This keeps happening. This keeps happening over and over.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  Of course, the major difference between now and the world back then, 2001 to 2003 and the build up to the Iraq war,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  is that back then you actually had to fabricate a reason to go to war.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  You actually had to do this whole weapons of mass destruction hoax.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  You had to carry out the September 11th attack. You really had to prime people to accept going to war.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  Now we're just at war, no vote. In fact, the only thing that's happened is there's been a symbolic vote.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  The only thing they voted on is, should we check how the Ukrainians are spending our money?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  And that was voted down. So no authorization of war.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  And they can't even pretend like this is authorized by the NDAA or this is a war on terror.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  They're just doing it now. The same thing with COVID.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  They got all of these restrictions put on us because of COVID, similar in style and application to what happened after 9-11,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  only they just told us that it was happening. They just said, trust us.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  The flu is called COVID now and you all have to stay inside for two years.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  And everybody did. That shows you what 20 years of psychological terrorism does to a population.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  And it continues. So this war is advancing. It is continuing.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  It is well funded by your tax dollars. And it is an absolute meat grinder. 72,000 Ukrainian casualties,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  to the extent that they're running out of people in Ukraine.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  And now Poland is actually deporting Ukrainians back to Ukraine so that they can go fight on the front lines
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  and be shoved into this meat grinder.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  U.S. Funds for Ukraine stands at $110.97 billion, Fox News reported on Tuesday.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  That seems low to me. That seems a bit low.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  It seems like we sent them $110 billion last week, so I'm wondering where the rest of that money went.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  Of course, we have no idea and we're prevented from finding out.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  Citing a document by the Office of Management and Budget of the White House,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  the UN disarmament head called on the world to make every effort for peace.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  U.S. Chief of Staff Mark Milley believes Ukraine may have only 30 days of fighting weather left this year.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  In the week of September 2nd through 9th, Ukraine lost nearly 6,000 casualties in its slow-moving counter-offensive.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  In other words, it's failed counter-offensive. In other words, it's complete boondoggle that they call a counter-offensive
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  that has achieved absolutely nothing except to kill or maim thousands of innocent people.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  Oh, wonderful stuff, isn't it? And it's not just that.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  The overall geopolitical effect of this is to drive our enemies closer together,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  to drive the Far East into a unified economic bloc, empower Russia economically and militarily
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  as they combine forces with China and North Korea.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  In fact, Kim Jong-un toast Putin wishing great victory over his enemies.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  The meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  in the far eastern city of Vladivostok was all that it was expected to be
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  with the North Korean strongman praising a heroic Russian army,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  which will be led by Putin to a great victory over its enemies.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  So, North Korea, China and Russia combining together with probably Iran as well.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  These are the fault lines for World War III that have been slowly but surely drawn over the last several years.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  And in fact, China is making extremely aggressive, really unprecedented moves against Taiwan as we speak.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  Will that be the next Ukraine? Will that be the next step towards World War III?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  How long can this charade continue before the nuclear weapons start to fly?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  We'll answer some of those questions on the other side and we'll get into what exactly China is doing.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  But stay tuned, there's a lot more still to come. The world is in absolute chaos.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  The New World Order is being really foiled at every pass.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  Things are not going as smoothly for them as they want.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  But one thing we know about these people is that they are ruthless and do not give up
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  and they are willing to burn the world rather than lose.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  So we're entering a very dangerous time period.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  Stay with us. This is Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  Alex will return very shortly. Stay tuned.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:32.000]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost 3 years back in stock.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  Here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even a lower price.

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at M4Store.com.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  exclusively at M4Store.com right now.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]  You'll find them exclusively at M4Store.com and they fund our operation.
[00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:07.910]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:30.350]  Alright, welcome back. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show. I'm Harrison
[00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:36.430]  Smith sitting in for Alex momentarily. He is in the building, just in the other room,
[00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:42.630]  being deposed, as it were. So as soon as he's done there, he will be here behind the desk.
[00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:48.550]  He's asked me to hold the seat for him while he's gone. We have a lot to talk about, really
[00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.670]  too much to talk about. We'll try to get to as much of it as possible. Talk about
[00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.510]  the Ukraine war right now. Of course, one of the biggest stories in America is
[00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.390]  the fact that Owen Schroyer has just been sentenced to two months in prison. Now he's
[00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:07.070]  going to appeal that. Yesterday he went on Timcast with Tim Pool and we'll show you some of those
[00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:14.510]  clips later. Absolutely killed it. Shows why he's a danger and a threat to the establishment. Of
[00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.270]  course, we've pointed it out before, but it's not just about the information that we cover.
[00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:23.070]  Obviously, that's the most dangerous thing, right? That is the weapon that we're wielding against
[00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:29.670]  the empire of lies that we're contending with. And it really, I mean, it is gaslighting world
[00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:35.190]  out there, folks. It's wild. I mean, we'll get to some of the lies of the Democrat Party here
[00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.590]  in just a second, whether it's Alejandro Mayorkas saying that the border is perfectly secure and
[00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:49.310]  everything's fine or the impeachment bonanza that's kicking off or COVID-19 or just anything
[00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:55.230]  you choose to mention. It's just endless, an endless cacophony of lies we're surrounded with
[00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:00.710]  constantly and it is very annoying and we have to confront it at every pass and we have to
[00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.390]  explain how all of these things are lies, why they're lying about these things and what they
[00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:11.110]  really intend for humanity. As you may have heard, it's a global government, open air
[00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.910]  concentration camp, neo-feudal slave system. We'll get to all of that, but it's not just the
[00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.870]  information that makes Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones dangerous. It's the fact that they aren't
[00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:26.950]  just commentating. They aren't just mentioning what's going on. They actually get involved and
[00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.110]  want you to get involved as well. You are the resistance. That's the motto that makes
[00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.470]  Infowars so dangerous. So I hope you can support us in this mission, not just by sharing
[00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.790]  our links, sharing the information, getting involved yourself, being a true Infowarrior and
[00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.790]  taking this information to the streets, taking it to protest, always, of course, being
[00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:51.430]  peaceful, political, but not sitting down and just taking it as the Democrats take a jackhammer
[00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:57.230]  to the foundations of our country, our way of life and freedom itself. We want you to get
[00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:03.190]  involved. We ask that you get involved. We try to make it clear that it's imperative you get
[00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:09.030]  involved without your involvement. They have victory. Your quiet submission to them is really
[00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.590]  their ultimate desire. This is the way the globalists work. First, they offer it. It's
[00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:20.190]  like the scene in 300. It's almost cliche at this point. First, it's a request. First,
[00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.070]  they want to ask you. First, they want you to come along with them willingly, but
[00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:31.070]  if you don't, then they use force. It really is as simple as that. Force or trickery,
[00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.830]  because they see human beings as children. If you have children, you know at a certain
[00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:41.150]  point you have to resort to force or trickery. If your kid doesn't want to do something
[00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.590]  that's good for them, that you know is good for them, yeah, you have a right as
[00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:50.230]  a parent to make them do what they have to do, and that's the way they feel about
[00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.910]  us. See, we're not children. We're thinking individuals. We're human beings. We have
[00:23:54.910 --> 00:24:00.390]  a mind and a soul, and intelligence is equal to or greater than these people, and
[00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:08.390]  we have the morality that means that we don't use our intelligence or capability to
[00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:16.030]  oppress and confuse other people. So anyway, obviously we don't have to exaggerate
[00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.930]  about the attacks that we're under. We don't have to pretend like we're being
[00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.990]  censored when we're not. We clearly are, and we've had to make massive changes
[00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:32.670]  to deal with the attacks that we're under, and at the same time, my god, have we made
[00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:38.230]  a lot of incredible strides. Just thinking about when I started here seven years ago,
[00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:44.230]  and we had one studio, and one Daily Show, and like a handful of reporters, and now
[00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.790]  we have this massive command center here. We've got the American Journal studio. We've
[00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.910]  got the War Room studio. We have Band.video. We have, I mean, the amount that Infowars
[00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:59.910]  has grown and expanded and just gotten more powerful in the face of all of these attacks,
[00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.910]  it is absolutely a credit to you going to Infowarsstore.com. We so appreciate your support.
[00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:11.550]  We could not do it without you. And again, what we're doing here is fighting in a
[00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:17.130]  existential war for the fate of humanity, and that's really not overstating it.
[00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:22.950]  It's really understating it, if anything. After all, we know what these people have
[00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:30.190]  intended for us. In fact, we have a clip of Errol Musk, Elon's dad, breaking it down as well.
[00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:37.430]  So you know when elite people get together, you know they don't talk about football,
[00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:44.150]  right? You know they don't talk about what AOC said on Twitter. When billionaires and the
[00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:50.870]  world elite get together, they talk about immortality techniques, immortality technology
[00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:56.670]  that's coming out. They talk about just unheard of warfare capability technology.
[00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.750]  They talk about psychological operations, like this is what these people are actually
[00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.190]  interested in. They want you to think that it's insane to talk about any of these things.
[00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.150]  All these things are conspiracy theories, and you're a nut if you talk about these.
[00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.630]  And then behind closed doors, they're all talking about all of this,
[00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.830]  whether it's the ultimate plan of depopulating the Earth to be able to live in balance with
[00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:23.670]  nature by doing the climate change hoax, or whether they talk about some of the things
[00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.910]  that I've even heard personally. They really think they're going to live forever.
[00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.390]  And when you understand that they really do think that they are going to live forever
[00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.310]  in some form, whether it's by uploading their consciousness or by perfecting age reversal
[00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:42.390]  technology that's already in testing phases, that's already being utilized by human beings
[00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:49.070]  in unapproved scientific experiments, you realize that they're getting very close to
[00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.830]  their ultimate revolution, their ultimate plan, where they're going to live forever,
[00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:59.470]  and they will wield immortality as the ultimate prize for the obedient.
[00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:03.510]  Because obviously you can't have people being born and not dying endlessly,
[00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.390]  that's unsustainable. So they want to set up a system where a very small elite get
[00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.670]  immortality, and everybody else is vying for acceptance into that vested class.
[00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.510]  That's the ultimate goal. The billionaires all know it,
[00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.310]  and they don't talk about it openly because they realize
[00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.790]  how the regular people of the world would feel about that.
[00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:30.270]  But here I've just been rambling this whole time when we do have some very,
[00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:37.870]  very important information to get to, including very disturbing developments in Ukraine,
[00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:43.310]  but also in China. We're going to show a couple of videos in the next segment about Ukraine
[00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:48.070]  in particular, but just so you know, China has deployed over 40 planes to Taiwan Strait
[00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:56.110]  and is massing its forces at coastal military bases. Taiwan has warned at a muse on Twitter.
[00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.230]  He says, this is a wake-up call. China's unprecedented naval maneuvers
[00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.430]  in a move that should send chills down the spine of every freedom-loving individual.
[00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:10.990]  China's People's Liberation Army Navy, aka PLAN, has embarked on its most audacious military
[00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:17.230]  exercise yet. The Shandong aircraft carrier group, along with two surface action groups,
[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.950]  has entered the waters east of Taiwan for what can only be described as an alarming display
[00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.950]  of military might. As of yesterday, China deployed a record-breaking 20 warships around Taiwan.
[00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:33.230]  This follows a staggering 202 naval activities detected in August, another record-setting number.
[00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:38.070]  The trend is clear. China is ramping up its naval activities at an unprecedented rate,
[00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:44.750]  and the world ought to take notice. This, of course, is not a legitimate confrontation
[00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:51.310]  between the West and China. It is a managed, very useful confrontation by the elite who are,
[00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:57.190]  at this moment, actively moving the center of power from the West towards the East as part
[00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.230]  of their globalist plan.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:04.500]  Let me remind you folks to go to infowarsstore.com to keep us on the air and in the fight.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.000]  We really do make it easy for you to support us by having really incredible products.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.200]  One of the most incredible I have to say is DNA Force Plus and it's one of these supplements
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.159]  that you really don't know what the effect it's going to have on you is until you
[00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.159]  try it.
[00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:21.200]  And it's different for everybody but it's always positive.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.159]  Essentially it helps in a variety of different ways and whatever way that your body needs
[00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:26.159]  it'll help in that way.
[00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:30.060]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.720]  your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.280]  That's why DNA Force Plus has exactly what you need to provide yourselves with protection.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.460]  By taking something like DNA Force Plus you're just upping the game on all of your body's
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.680]  functions in a way that is holistic and complete and really incredible.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.760]  Go to infowarsstore.com and of course best of all you keep us on air and in the fight
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:53.080]  and fighting back against the mental, spiritual and physical poisoning that we contend with
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  on a daily basis.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.480]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.760]  has not been available and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.520]  and the quality had gone down some.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.080]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us but now we have brought back
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:21.399]  the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran
[00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:22.399]  operated.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.480]  Powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.

[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]  ever drank.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.000]  It is game changing, all you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.440]  I know you're going to be hooked which will then fund our Operation A360 win.

[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.720]  Omega 3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength and they can only be obtained through
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]  diet.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.720]  They can be found in grass fed beef which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.920]  it and they can be found in fish which are arguably the best source of omega 3s.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.520]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:32.280]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at infowarsstore.com.

[00:32:40.879 --> 00:32:45.760]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.

[00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:12.490]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.430]  The program leftists failed to silence.
[00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.630]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:23.790]  Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones just for the next few minutes.
[00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:28.150]  Alex Jones will be taking over momentarily.
[00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:34.550]  He's in the office, he's in the building, being deposed, so as soon as that ends he will take
[00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.550]  over.
[00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:41.750]  We'll continue to break down the news for you here until then.
[00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:47.750]  Talking about World War III and the fault lines that are developing, the battle lines
[00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.310]  that are being drawn.
[00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:54.950]  Looks like Africa is going to be a major theater in the coming conflict.
[00:33:54.950 --> 00:34:03.430]  Ukraine, of course, is where it's centered now, but Taiwan seems to also be a point of contention
[00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:08.830]  that could flare up into chaos at any moment.
[00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:14.230]  A really fantastic sort of breakdown of this from a muse on Twitter.
[00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:19.610]  When it comes to Taiwan, he says, Taiwan under siege, in the last 48 hours alone Taiwan
[00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:29.970]  has tracked 48 PLA aircraft nearby, 33 PLAN warships surrounding the island, 24 planes
[00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.650]  crossing sensitive lines.
[00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:37.050]  These operations include unusual and never before seen flight paths, a clear indication
[00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.050]  that China is testing the waters, literally and figuratively, Beijing's displeasure.
[00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.010]  He says this, the military flexing is a response to a series of events that have irked Beijing.
[00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:52.550]  The G20 summit in India, strengthening of U.S. Vietnam relations, U.S. Navy exercises
[00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:59.410]  in the Yellow Sea, U.S. destroyer transiting the Taiwan Strait, a delegation of U.S. reps
[00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.230]  meeting Taiwan's president, and U.S. support for Philippine resupply missions.
[00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.430]  He says the Biden regime needs to wake up and smell the gunpowder.
[00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.770]  Their lackadaisical approach to China's rising aggression is not just foolish, it's dangerous.
[00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.110]  It's time to rally the troops, both metaphorically and literally, and stand up against this
[00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.110]  looming threat.
[00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.630]  Of course, they're going to have trouble doing that, as there is a recruitment crisis
[00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.230]  in America right now, with some mainstream media reporting that even veterans are telling
[00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:30.710]  their families not to join the army, which really says something about the state of
[00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:35.630]  morale in this country, not just for the armed forces, but for everybody, really.
[00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:41.750]  That people look at the idea of sacrificing your life for this government, you think,
[00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.150]  why the hell would I do that?
[00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.670]  I don't even like paying my taxes.
[00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.510]  Why would I actually put my life on the line for these people?
[00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:48.510]  What?
[00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.150]  So Joe Biden can make a couple extra million dollars in Ukraine on the way down my life
[00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.150]  for that?
[00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.150]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.310]  So the same people that have sold out our entire economic system to China can then
[00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:01.110]  send me to fight and die China on their behalf?
[00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.490]  I mean, this, why?
[00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.490]  Why would I do that?
[00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:10.490]  Of course, they're making up the difference by allowing foreign citizens to take over
[00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:15.650]  the army because apparently we're just following the downfall of Rome playbook to a T point
[00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.650]  by point.
[00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.570]  We're doing it all and it's really not looking good.
[00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:24.790]  I mean, I don't want to go to war with China, which is why I liked somebody like
[00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:30.330]  Donald Trump, you know, with the impeachment of Joe Biden being, being floated, being
[00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.330]  investigated.
[00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:36.570]  You know, they're starting committees to ask questions about potentially ultimately impeaching
[00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.330]  somebody for something like they're, they're doing it in the most Republican way they
[00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.730]  can, but they're talking about it.
[00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:48.530]  So I thought I'd take a look back at what, what was being said when the first impeachment
[00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.850]  of Donald Trump took place.
[00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:59.290]  And at that time, you know, you go back to like the end of 2019, middle of September,
[00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.290]  October, 2019.
[00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:07.370]  And the headlines on CNN are like, China's economy is slowed down to its lowest point
[00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.650]  since 1990.
[00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.930]  The trade war against China, having massive dividends as Trump brings them to the table.
[00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.130]  We were actually having massive success against China in an economic way.
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:25.050]  When Trump was president, he of course, presided over maybe the only four year stretch
[00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:31.250]  in the last five decades, maybe even longer that America has not started a new war and
[00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.690]  in fact wind down many of the conflicts that we are in.
[00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.490]  And of course, the whole time we were being told that Trump was a warmonger and he was
[00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.610]  going to start World War Three.
[00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:43.410]  Now here we are on the cusp of World War Three and all the same people that warned
[00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.210]  us about Trump are celebrating it and or totally blind to it.
[00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.490]  I can't tell what I mean either.
[00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.570]  They don't know what's going on and they're ignorant and they don't care because now
[00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.170]  the adults are back in charge so everybody can go back to sleep or they know exactly
[00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:00.010]  what's going on and they're psychopaths that are driving us towards global destruction.
[00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.050]  It's one of those.
[00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.730]  I'm not sure which one, but yeah, it's not, it's, it's China, it's Taiwan, it's Ukraine
[00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:13.290]  and Russia combining with North Korea and Iran, Saudi Arabia normalizes relationships
[00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:19.970]  with them as well, just massive fluctuations in the geopolitical setup that we have to
[00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:20.970]  deal with.
[00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:25.690]  And I want to go down to a couple of clips about Ukraine in particular.
[00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.010]  Let's see, I have time for one of these.
[00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.310]  Let's go to clip five here.
[00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:36.250]  This is Elon Musk talking about how the Ukraine government requested he turn on Starlink to
[00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.410]  assist in its attack on Russia.
[00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.690]  This is his refusal to expand the Starlink coverage to allow them to carry out a sneak
[00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:43.690]  attack on Russia.
[00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:48.010]  It's now being used to call him a traitor to America apparently.
[00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.530]  Now we've never declared a war on Russia.
[00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:56.130]  There's been no even attempt to justify our conflict with Russia, but apparently you're
[00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:01.810]  a traitor if you don't help kill thousands of Russians and bring us even closer to
[00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.570]  the precipice that is nuclear exchange with that country.
[00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:10.650]  Here's Elon Musk yesterday at the all-in festival, conference, whatever it is.
[00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.250]  He was asked about this Starlink scandal.
[00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.250]  Here's his answer.
[00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:23.490]  At the time this happened, the region around Crimea was actually turned off.
[00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:30.890]  Now the reason it was turned off was because the United States had sanctions against Russia
[00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:36.730]  and we were not allowed to actually, and that includes Crimea in the sanctions, and
[00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.970]  we were not allowed to actually turn on connectivity to a country without explicit
[00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:49.930]  government approval, which we did not have in the US government.
[00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:56.610]  So basically the Ukraine didn't give us any advance warning or heads up or anything.
[00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:03.090]  We just got these sort of urgent calls from the Ukraine government saying that we needed
[00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.090]  to turn on Crimea.
[00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:06.090]  It's like in the middle of the night, basically.
[00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.170]  And we're like, what are you talking about?
[00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.170]  You lost?
[00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.170]  Which of four?
[00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:22.330]  You know, and then we basically figured out that this was kind of like a Pearl Harbor
[00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:28.330]  type attack on this festival, on the Russian fleet's festival.
[00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:35.730]  So they're really asking us to really take part in a major act of war.
[00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:42.090]  And you know, while we certainly have huge support for the Ukrainian government,
[00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:47.450]  the Ukrainian government is not in charge of US people or companies.
[00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.450]  That's not how it works.
[00:40:50.450 --> 00:41:00.090]  But I should say that, you know, although I'm not a president by any big extent, if
[00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:05.130]  I had received a presidential directive to turn it on, I would have done so.
[00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:09.370]  Because I do regard the president as the chief executive officer of the country, whether
[00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:14.850]  I want that to be the president or not, I still respect the office.
[00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:21.170]  And so, you know, if I got a request from the president type of thing, from this American
[00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:28.370]  president, which is right there, then I would have turned it on.
[00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.610]  So no such request came through.
[00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.730]  That's a really interesting point.
[00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:38.450]  And I mean, what Chamath is referring to is you're now being attacked.
[00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:44.570]  I saw there was Jake Tapper the other day on CNN interviewing our secretary of state.
[00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.410]  He was all lathered up, basically attacking you for this.
[00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.410]  David –
[00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:55.290]  I mean, to his credit, Secretary Blinken was actually quite supportive, despite the
[00:41:55.290 --> 00:42:01.730]  sort of, you know, accusations and the questions of Jake Tapper on CNN.
[00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.730]  Yeah.
[00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.730]  He didn't take the bait, to his credit.
[00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:14.410]  Well, to me, this is an example of –
[00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.410]  No good deed goes unpunished.
[00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:17.410]  Because if you had never given –
[00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:24.050]  I hope some good deeds don't go unpunished.
[00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.330]  That's the exact right way to put it.
[00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:31.190]  I mean, the guy activates Starlink for free, providing Ukraine with millions, if not
[00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:35.050]  billions of dollars of free service, and now they're calling him a traitor for not
[00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.050]  giving them more?
[00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.290]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.529]  And then it also reminds me of what's happening with SpaceX.
[00:42:39.529 --> 00:42:41.690]  I mean, they're going after Elon with everything they've got.
[00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.290]  It's because he's pro-free speech, it's because he's against their agenda.
[00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.170]  Just like they went after Trump, they don't actually care about these things you're
[00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.170]  going after him for.
[00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.810]  But in the same way that he actually isn't allowed to activate Starlink because of
[00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:55.050]  the sanctions, he's not allowed to hire foreigners, but they're investigating
[00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.050]  him for that, too.
[00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.050]  It's a lose-lose situation with these people.
[00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.529]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:43:00.529 --> 00:43:01.529]  I thought it was next week.
[00:43:01.529 --> 00:43:05.890]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.170]  Body's ultimate generic formula.
[00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.890]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.930]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:18.170]  Look how full this model is.
[00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.210]  Right to the top, folks.
[00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:25.930]  Right to the top with these 95% humanoids.
[00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:31.050]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.810]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:37.890]  This is 95%.
[00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.890]  Super constant.
[00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.529]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:43:42.529 --> 00:43:43.529]  It's that powerful.
[00:43:43.529 --> 00:43:44.529]  Or more.
[00:43:44.529 --> 00:43:48.890]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.250]  Hey, what's better?
[00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.250]  Knockout.
[00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:13.970]  What's better?
[00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.970]  Down and out.
[00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:15.970]  What's better?
[00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:16.970]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep eggs?
[00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:21.370]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.370]  people.
[00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.570]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.770]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.770]  They're all very diverse.
[00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:33.330]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.290]  Which is caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:18.110]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.450]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:26.650]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:32.610]  keep the soil rich with iodine and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:38.950]  of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the

[00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:07.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:21.730]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:27.090]  This is the Alex Jones Show, infowars.com, band.video, madmaxworld.tv.
[00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:35.009]  Lots of options for you to share this message, share these links, and awaken the world.
[00:47:35.009 --> 00:47:36.009]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.770]  I'm the host of the American Journal, the morning show here on Infowars.
[00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.650]  We broadcast live each and every weekday morning, 8 to 11 a.m.,
[00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:47.930]  taking your calls for much of the time, as I find that is one of the most
[00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:54.810]  expedient ways to find information that, even with my endless trawling through news,
[00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.170]  I still happen to miss.
[00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:01.210]  And the callers will call in and let me know about stuff that flies under the radar.
[00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.770]  So thank you for tuning into that.
[00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.690]  And of course, Alex Jones will be here.
[00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.450]  This may be my last segment with you.
[00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.049]  He should be finishing up his deposition here momentarily,
[00:48:11.049 --> 00:48:13.610]  and we'll be in to cover today's biggest news.
[00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.970]  But we're going to keep covering some of this until then,
[00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.930]  and we're going to move on from the war stuff now.
[00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.330]  Although I got to show you this video.
[00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.529]  I got to show you this video.
[00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.250]  I know there's so many other things to cover, and we'll get to.
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.810]  We'll show you some videos of Owen on Timcast yesterday, talking about his experience
[00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.170]  being a political prisoner and a martyr for free speech.
[00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:39.210]  We'll talk about the economy and just the pure, unadulterated gaslighting
[00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.569]  that's going on there and how that is affected by immigration,
[00:48:42.569 --> 00:48:44.170]  which is another big topic that we'll talk about.
[00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.569]  Oh, and also Mexico has alien corpses, apparently.
[00:48:48.569 --> 00:48:50.730]  Apparently, we live in an M. Night Shyamalan movie,
[00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:54.009]  and Mexico just gave a presentation with a bunch of aliens,
[00:48:54.569 --> 00:48:55.529]  and that was weird.
[00:48:55.529 --> 00:48:58.730]  So we'll get to that as well.
[00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.490]  So I'm sorry to stick on this one topic,
[00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.130]  but you know, it is World War Three.
[00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.730]  It is, you know, tens of thousands of people dying or being maimed
[00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:10.490]  and left for dead as we race headlong towards nuclear catastrophe.
[00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.810]  So maybe it's worth spending a little extra time on.
[00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:17.049]  But this should give you like this video.
[00:49:17.049 --> 00:49:19.290]  I'm about to show you this really sort of says it all
[00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.529]  and it really tells you everything you need to know
[00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.770]  about the current conflict in so many different ways.
[00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:27.290]  Let's go.
[00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:28.490]  Excuse me.
[00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.850]  Let's go to clip number six here.
[00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:36.170]  Very important, very serious message from the Ukraine military.
[00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.970]  Okay, let's watch.
[00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:44.009]  Russia hates the truth that their obsessive focus on a Ukrainian volunteer
[00:49:44.009 --> 00:49:48.569]  is simply allowing the light of the Ukrainian nation's honesty to shine brightly.
[00:49:49.529 --> 00:49:53.930]  Next week, the teeth of the Russian devils will nash ever harder
[00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.370]  and their rabid mouths will foam in uncontrollable frenzy
[00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.009]  as the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist
[00:50:00.569 --> 00:50:01.930]  pay for their crimes.
[00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.529]  And this puppet of Putin is only the first.
[00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.690]  Russia's war criminal propagandists will all be hunted down
[00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:14.009]  and justice will be served as we in Ukraine are led on this mission
[00:50:14.009 --> 00:50:17.529]  by faith in God, liberty and complete liberation.
[00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:24.890]  Well, what did we just see, folks?
[00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:25.770]  What was that?
[00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.170]  Well, that was globalism in action.
[00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:33.529]  We were just talked down to about the truth by a man in a wig
[00:50:33.529 --> 00:50:35.690]  with fake breasts in a dress.
[00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.330]  It's really critical.
[00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.650]  Think about the number of ways that video just embodied everything
[00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.370]  that there is to know about the Ukraine war.
[00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.330]  First of all, it's an American transvestite
[00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:52.730]  who's delivering what essentially amounts to a threat against a journalist.
[00:50:53.130 --> 00:51:01.610]  It's just a very chilling promise to eliminate a Kremlin propagandist.
[00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.569]  They mean journalists.
[00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:04.330]  They mean a Russian journalist of some sort.
[00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:05.130]  I don't know who that is.
[00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.810]  Maybe it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:07.450]  I don't know.
[00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.690]  They think Tucker Carlson, he's on the hit list.
[00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:14.009]  Maybe it's any of the people, any of the great journalists
[00:51:14.009 --> 00:51:19.370]  that are actually opposed to the ongoing meat grinder writ large
[00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.130]  that is the Ukraine conflict.
[00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:21.690]  Maybe it's me.
[00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:22.890]  Maybe it's me.
[00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:24.410]  Maybe I'm a Russian propagandist.
[00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.970]  After all, I don't mindlessly repeat the obvious lies from the Ukraine government,
[00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.650]  from the American government about Ukraine.
[00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.450]  So that makes me a Russian propagandist, according to these people.
[00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:38.650]  Maybe it's me that he slash she, you think that's Zelensky?
[00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:43.930]  Zelensky, he puts a wig on, mimics an American accent.
[00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:45.930]  No, that's some sort of American.
[00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.930]  That's some sort of American person.
[00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.609]  So again, it's like an American speaking for Russia.
[00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:54.970]  There's that whole aspect that they're a puppet of us.
[00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.890]  It's them talking down to us about the truth and how Russia hates the truth,
[00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.810]  says the man dressed as a woman.
[00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:07.130]  It's just, it's mind boggling, threatening journalists and just vicious.
[00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.529]  And yet they try to spice it up.
[00:52:09.529 --> 00:52:15.210]  They try to make it flowery and sound like epic and biblical,
[00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.210]  like the gnashing of teeth, whatever he said.
[00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:22.330]  And it just comes across cringey and weird and upsetting and bizarre.
[00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.569]  And again, they're literally sitting there going,
[00:52:24.569 --> 00:52:26.810]  we are going to kill journalists.
[00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.009]  So you watch out.
[00:52:28.009 --> 00:52:29.930]  It's like, all right, we get it.
[00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:30.330]  We get it.
[00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.290]  You're the evil side.
[00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:37.210]  My takeaway from that is just you're just radiating evil at us
[00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.970]  and expecting us to go along with it.
[00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:39.850]  So no, thank you.
[00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.330]  No, thank you.
[00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:46.410]  You can keep your truth to yourself, you murderous weirdo.
[00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:53.529]  Trans spokesperson says Ukraine will hunt down Russian propagandist around the world,
[00:52:53.529 --> 00:52:55.210]  Sarah Ashton Cirillo.
[00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.810]  So it's a man dressed as woman with a hyphenated last name from America,
[00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:08.970]  speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian military to threaten journalists who don't support the war.
[00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:12.890]  So that I think really sums it up, doesn't it?
[00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:15.370]  Just incredible.
[00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:16.330]  So there you go.
[00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.370]  All right, now we're moving on.
[00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:21.370]  Now we'll move on from the World War 3 clown world gaslighting madness,
[00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.970]  but not really because that's just all we have these days.
[00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.609]  That's all that there is to talk about in the mainstream media,
[00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.890]  because we have moved beyond conspiracy theory into just,
[00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.009]  it's all out in the open.
[00:53:34.009 --> 00:53:35.690]  It's all happening right in front of you.
[00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.330]  It's just whether you have your eyes open or not.
[00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:43.130]  It says World War 3 is here from toxic culture.
[00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:48.490]  That's a video you can find in sharedband.video published yesterday.
[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.650]  Let's talk about one of the other just massive,
[00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:57.609]  hugely deadly scams being pulled on the world,
[00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.850]  but in particular the American people.
[00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.009]  This time, not World War 3, but COVID.
[00:54:02.009 --> 00:54:06.090]  COVID-19 and the lab created, released on purpose,
[00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.130]  bioweapon designed and deployed to
[00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.930]  psychologically terrorize and enslave humanity.
[00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.130]  From the Daily Mail, though this story actually comes directly from Congress,
[00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:26.330]  CIA whistleblower claims agency bribed their own analyst to say COVID did not come from Wuhan.
[00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:30.410]  CIA whistleblower claims agency bribed their own analyst to say COVID did not come from
[00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.890]  Wuhan.
[00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:35.930]  Bombshell Republican report exposes alleged virus origins cover-up.
[00:54:36.009 --> 00:54:40.330]  Six of seven members of a CIA COVID discovery team were given, quote,
[00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:45.690]  significant monetary incentive to change their position, according to a whistleblower.
[00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:54.490]  This actually comes from a letter, a memorandum straight from the Congress of the United States
[00:54:54.490 --> 00:55:00.009]  to the honorable William J. Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:55:00.009 --> 00:55:03.529]  Says, Dear Director Burns, the select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic
[00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:08.009]  and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, together the committees,
[00:55:08.009 --> 00:55:12.569]  have received new and concerning whistleblower testimony regarding the agency's investigation
[00:55:12.569 --> 00:55:14.650]  into the origins of COVID-19.
[00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:19.290]  They say a multi-decade senior level current agency officer has come forward to provide
[00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:24.170]  information to the committees regarding the agency's analysis of the origins, or into,
[00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:26.009]  rather, the origins of COVID-19.
[00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:29.850]  And they lay out what I just said to you, that there were seven members.
[00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:37.770]  The one most senior member seemed to think beyond all reason and explanation that COVID
[00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:42.569]  came from an animal of some sort, jumped from a pangolin, apparently, or something
[00:55:42.569 --> 00:55:42.970]  like that.
[00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.970]  Only one of them, and it happened to be the most senior person, believed that.
[00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:51.210]  Everybody else thought that there was good evidence that it came from a lab, you know,
[00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:55.290]  because of, like, the receipts that they had, you know, because of how they created
[00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:58.890]  it in a lab and thought, hey, maybe that's that thing that we made and then released.
[00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:05.770]  Here's the thing, the intelligence agencies have been involved in COVID-19 since before
[00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:06.970]  it existed.
[00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:07.770]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:12.810]  Peter Daszak, according to a whistleblower that worked at EcoHealth Alliance, was approached
[00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:18.250]  by and perhaps recruited by the CIA shortly before the release of COVID-19.
[00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:25.290]  Event 201, the little game they held, the little exercise, the tabletop exercise that
[00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:29.450]  was held by John Hopkins University and the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda
[00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:37.050]  Gates Foundation in October of 2019 happened to be headed by and orchestrated by Avril
[00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:42.730]  Haynes, who happens to be the current head of the DNI, the head of the head of the
[00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:43.850]  intelligence agencies.
[00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.890]  They've been at this since the beginning.
[00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:48.810]  They've been involved in this since the beginning.
[00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:55.050]  All of COVID was and continues to be an intelligence operation coordinated and orchestrated
[00:56:55.050 --> 00:57:00.890]  by American intelligence with cooperation from the Chinese Communist Party, with cooperation
[00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:07.370]  from these private NGOs such as World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:11.850]  And they even have, I should have gotten this clip, maybe we can find it here if
[00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:16.810]  Alex is stuck in his deposition for any longer, where they actually, it's a Chinese
[00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.650]  guy going, what happens if they think it comes from a lab?
[00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:26.170]  And it's Avril Haynes, current director of the DNI, head of the DNI, saying, well, we
[00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:27.290]  have ways of covering that.
[00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:31.210]  Well, we have ways of stopping that type of speculation.
[00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.170]  Don't you worry about that.
[00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.050]  So they've been involved in Corona since the beginning.
[00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.130]  They carried out Event 201.
[00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:41.609]  They worked with Peter Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance to create the virus, and they helped
[00:57:41.609 --> 00:57:44.730]  cover up the origin as revealed by this whistleblower.
[00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.090]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:47.690]  Alex Jones joins soon.
[00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:50.650]  Bodies is back.
[00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:56.490]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market has returned to m4store.com and is now 25%
[00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:58.009]  off for a limited time.
[00:57:58.009 --> 00:58:02.650]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs
[00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.450]  today.
[00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:07.930]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.450]  and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:16.569]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[00:58:16.569 --> 00:58:22.330]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.

[00:58:27.609 --> 00:58:33.529]  but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[00:58:33.529 --> 00:58:34.250]  in tumeric.
[00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.770]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:41.609]  So if you want to put the true power of tumeric to the test, then look no further.

[00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:09.050]  quality tumeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:10.250]  It's about to sell out.
[00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.770]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:58.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:13.720]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, second hour of the Alex Jones show is on.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.800]  I'm Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones momentarily.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.320]  He'll be in studio this hour.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.560]  It won't be long now, we're just waiting for him to finish up his deposition to take over
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.960]  the show and get into some of the bombshell news that I know he has locked and loaded
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]  and ready to go.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.100]  Of course, one of the biggest stories over the last few days has been the sentencing
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.080]  of political prisoner and free speech activist Owen Schroyer.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.000]  He went on Tim Pool yesterday, and we have a couple clips of that I want to show
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  you now.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.960]  So number two here is Owen Schroyer on Tim Pool, Tim cast yesterday.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.400]  The personal level is I don't want to go to jail.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.840]  I don't believe I belong in jail.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.160]  I would even tell you that I believe that this case should be done and I've served
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.280]  my probation with good behavior.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.240]  Nonetheless, that's not the result that we got today.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.800]  Then there's the other side of me.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.160]  That's just an American citizen.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.880]  I remove myself from the picture and it breaks my heart.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.880]  It breaks my heart that future Americans may have to suffer through the same fate or
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]  worse.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.200]  It breaks my heart that somebody, a young journalist coming up or a talk show is coming
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.020]  up is going to have to censor themselves, chill their free speech or be afraid.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.020]  That's the thing.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.560]  Be afraid of what they're going to say.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.480]  That's the thing that people really have have missed with this whole situation.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.840]  And again, we talked about first order thinking earlier.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.000]  Everyone that's like, oh, it's fine.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.600]  They're all guilty of first order thinking because it's not their political party.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.240]  It's not something I agree with.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.120]  This is going to be used against first conservatives if the government gets away
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.120]  with it.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.120]  Right.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.740]  So they first, this is the test, the small little, see what we can get away with.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:57.760]  Every time the government successfully does something that is questionable or illegal, questionably
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.200]  legal or illegal, that only ensures that they're going to do more later.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.000]  This is not going to, there's never a time where the government says, oh, this is,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  this isn't a new power.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.080]  This is only in this case, they're going to look at this as, oh no, now we can go after
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.360]  people that say that, that, that skirt the line or whatever.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.080]  There's always going to be an escalation and this is going to turn around.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.680]  If conservatives get into office again, this will be used on the left.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]  Absolutely.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.160]  I mean, and I'm going to endorse it.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.440]  Well, it's going to be used on the left by the left.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.200]  What I just, just to reference, you know, like every communist revolution, the first
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.760]  group to be purged is the revolutionaries.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760]  Yeah.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.880]  Because the most people that die from communism are communists, thankfully.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880]  Right.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.440]  When, when we were talking about evil authoritarians who go around murdering people, we need that.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.620]  We want that to not be the case.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.660]  And in these revolutions, I mean, look at Robespierre live by the sword as it goes.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.860]  When a revolution happens, you now have factions vying for political power to have
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.100]  their vision come true.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.700]  And the meme is there's like a bunch of people standing around all with the same
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:09.320]  thought bubble saying, I can't wait for the collapse to happen so that my ideology will
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  take over.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.780]  Well, what happens when the system collapses is all these different groups now say, my way,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.340]  no, my way, no, my way.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.320]  And then someone gets slightly more political power and says, we've got to take out anybody
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.980]  who fomented revolution because there are only threat.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.820]  The regular people who sit by and don't do anything, they're no threat to the machine.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.140]  So if these antifa leftists and crackpots get their way, they're going to be the
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:37.060]  first to be locked up in in, you know, in federal prisons and kept away from sunlight and
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.180]  communications because they're the real risk to the new to the new machine.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.700]  Well, and we see where the financial elite, the global elite believe that they have the
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.740]  moral high ground and it's their duty to tell us how to live.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:54.020]  And what's what's what's what's really frustrating and I'm not a big historian, but I
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.260]  had you know, I've had people reach out to me and veterans and people and they say,
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:05.160]  Owen, in my day, we used to invade countries for what they're doing to you.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.660]  We used to go in to banana republics and we would shut that down and we would try to
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.420]  restore a constitutional republic.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.580]  And so what or maybe inform a democracy as they would at least used to claim.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:21.540]  And so what's frustrating is that we went through an entire century of testing this
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.540]  methodology.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.540]  Right.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.140]  What works better, communism or free market capitalism?
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.140]  Look at what was built in the West versus the fall of Russia.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.140]  Right.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.300]  Or if you want to maybe a better example, look at North Korea compared to South Korea.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:40.260]  Well, now it's like we have to learn the lessons of the 20th century all over again.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.260]  Yeah.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.980]  Apparently we do because we haven't learned them well enough.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.380]  That's own Troyer on Tim cast.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.260]  I suggest you go watch the full episode if you're interested.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.260]  He really knocked it out of the park.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.260]  It was incredible.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.540]  Remember, folks, support us and for store.com, we'll be back on the other side.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.660]  Alex Jones in studio very shortly.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.340]  Don't go anywhere, folks.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.940]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:07.340]  really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you love and
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.340]  people want it.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:13.660]  And it funds our Operation 360 win bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:18.900]  you're going to find anywhere, jam packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.580]  inflammation that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.740]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.740]  God gave it to us.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.980]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.420]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.820]  Most brands are 5% human.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.140]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:41.060]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.620]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.500]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.420]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:54.500]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula back in stock 25% off info war store.com or
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.060]  888-253-3139.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:16.040]  The show that rips apart the leftist agenda, Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:22.759]  Well, what an honor and privilege it is to be sitting in for Alex Jones today coming
[01:06:22.759 --> 01:06:27.839]  to you live from the Infowars headquarters here on this 13th of September, 2023.
[01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:32.160]  I'm Harrison Smith, host of the American Journal, sitting in for Alex momentarily before he
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.560]  or while he wraps up his deposition.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.380]  He will be in studio to take over very, very soon.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.380]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.240]  In the meantime, let's take a little trip back, shall we?
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:50.799]  Let's take a little trip back to October of 2019 before anybody in America really had
[01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:57.600]  heard the words COVID-19, or coronavirus, or lockdowns, or masks, or six feet to slow
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:04.520]  the spread, or any of the mind-numbing propaganda that we were surely to be assaulted with.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:11.279]  No, back in October 2019, it was the Trump impeachment was in full swing if you go to
[01:07:11.279 --> 01:07:12.279]  the Wayback Machine.
[01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:13.279]  So I was just doing this.
[01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:18.200]  I was just thinking what was going on while this cabal was gathered in New York City
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:27.080]  at John Hopkins Hospital to carry out event 201, the training and planning exercise that
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.160]  they were carrying out just ahead of the rollout of COVID-19.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:38.080]  If you go back to 2019, just go to like CNN.com for October 19th, 2019.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.720]  It's like, you know, breaking headline, new bombshell about Trump's impeachment.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720]  He'll never survive.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.640]  And it's just like chaos, madness.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.799]  Meanwhile, it's like stock market's hitting record high for the hundredth time this year,
[01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:54.960]  this stock market highest it's ever been, this stock market seeing gains it's never
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]  seen before.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.000]  Also, we're in the middle of a trade war with China, and China's economy is at its
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.160]  lowest ebb since 1990.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.160]  Literally, that's the headline on the day this was happening.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:10.839]  So while Trump is having massive success preparing for his upcoming 2020 election, which
[01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:16.360]  is about one year away at that point, as he's facing off against China, presiding over
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:22.000]  massive success on the economy here at home, he's being confronted by totally illegitimate
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.920]  and baseless impeachment inquiry that are then they're just like bombarding him continuously
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]  every hour.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.080]  There's some new headline about this.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:35.360]  And while he's in the Oval Office trying to juggle all of this and trying to keep
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.200]  the train on the tracks, meanwhile, there's a cabal of people, some of the most powerful
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.599]  people in the entire world gathered together in New York City, planning his demise planning
[01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:49.500]  the next phase of the attack, event 201.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.200]  And it's everybody, folks.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.840]  It's the head of the UN.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.080]  It's the head of the former head of the CIA, who's the current head of the, she's
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.880]  the director of national intelligence, meaning she's the tip top of the pyramid.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.440]  I mean, you have the entire IC, the entire intelligence community is all under the office
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.000]  of the director of national intelligence, who's Avril Haines, who happened to be the one
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.840]  presiding over event 201 when it was held.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:22.160]  Now she was the former director of the CIA, and just going to her Wikipedia here, she
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:28.240]  was the deputy director of the CIA from 2013 to 15.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.680]  Following that, she was the 27th United States Deputy National Security Advisor from
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.280]  2015 to 2017.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.080]  She was ousted when Trump got into office.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.800]  That's when she got busy behind the scenes at things like event 201, only to reassume
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:49.320]  her position of power in the United States government with a promotion, becoming the director
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.200]  of national intelligence on January 21st, 2021.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:59.780]  Now this is all in relation to the breaking headline that this massive bombshell story
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:06.080]  that you'll find on any media outlet worth calling itself one.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.160]  Whistleblower, this is from Town Hall, whistleblower CIA panel offered financial incentives to
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.600]  bury the COVID lab leak conclusion.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.160]  We just read the statement from the House Select Committee.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.559]  That's actually supposed to investigate the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:23.880]  But for now, I want to take us back to event 201.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:29.540]  I want to take us back to that October in 2019 and watch when this exact question
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:34.120]  is asked by a Chinese participant in this little exercise.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.720]  And the answer that he's given is very telling, and who it comes from is even more
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.540]  interesting, Avril Haines herself.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:43.320]  So let's go now to this video.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.340]  This is one of the participants in event 201 asking, what if people suspect it's a lab
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.600]  leak virus?
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.600]  Let's watch.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.400]  More cases in China and also death cases reported.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:01.260]  And also my staff told me that because there's misinformation and there's some belief, people
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:06.500]  believe, you know, this is a manmade, some pharmaceutical company made the virus.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.740]  So there are some violations and even, you know, death is because of this misinformation.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:17.620]  I said, you know, from the CDC and I don't know if Steve agrees with me, when you are
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:24.059]  doing the field work and you like to do some so-called TOT, training of trainers.
[01:11:24.059 --> 01:11:30.320]  So we really need to train the health workers, the health care workers, their access to
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.580]  the patients, to the public.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.260]  So make sure they got the right information.
[01:11:36.019 --> 01:11:41.580]  Sometimes the health care workers, they knew something, but if they are not well-trained,
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:46.460]  they might give the wrong information, but also they might say something, oh, I don't
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.460]  know.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.460]  I don't know.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.460]  That could hurt.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.940]  So when I remember, that's such a situation remind me.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:59.420]  When I was in Sierra Leone and I was interviewed by radio, the national radio, I was asked
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.180]  by one of the audience to say, okay, we believe Ebola was manmade.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.380]  It's transported from, you know, somewhere.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.860]  So this is, I think this is very important.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.540]  We do the TOT.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:15.420]  So make sure the health care workers have the right information.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.420]  Okay.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.420]  Thank you.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.420]  Gabrielle?
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.300]  I agree with a lot of what's been said.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:25.300]  I just add to it maybe by saying that I think one of the things we want to do is
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:31.019]  work with telecommunication companies to actually ensure that everybody has access to the kind
[01:12:31.019 --> 01:12:34.059]  of communications that we're interested in providing because that's going to be critical
[01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:40.700]  for dealing with, you know, obviously the explosion of the disease.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:46.220]  And then another issue I suppose is just through that, if you have a trusted source,
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:51.540]  I believe in the idea that we shouldn't be trying to control communication but rather
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.900]  flood the zone in a sense with a trusted source that then is influential community
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:02.019]  leaders as well as health workers, as Brad noted, and others on these issues in order
[01:13:02.019 --> 01:13:04.980]  to try to amplify the message that's coming through.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.260]  And I think Tim's absolutely right.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:11.420]  I've certainly seen the value of communicating constantly on these issues so as to continue
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:17.300]  to deal with, you know, sort of the vacuum that can be created in this circumstance.
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:21.940]  But then also with the comments made about the fact that for all of the disinformation
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.940]  that will be put out, it's going to be important to actually have a response to
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:29.059]  those questions and to those concerns, as Stephen said.
[01:13:29.059 --> 01:13:33.660]  And I understand from staff that actually there are also intelligence sources identifying
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.860]  multiple foreign disinformation campaigns and so on.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.139]  But it's all a part of a larger piece, which is to say that every time there is
[01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:44.139]  something that comes out that is in fact false information that is starting to actually
[01:13:44.139 --> 01:13:48.820]  hamper our ability to address the pandemic, then we need to be able to respond quickly
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820]  to it.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.260]  Yeah, false or true for that matter.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.220]  I mean, or if it's true information that you just don't want out there because it
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:01.740]  may point to implicating you in all of this, then that's another very useful reason to
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:05.980]  have the control over messaging like you just saw discussed.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:11.639]  So that again was Avril Haines, the current director of national intelligence, who the
[01:14:11.639 --> 01:14:18.059]  former CIA deputy director who was there presiding over eventual one and answering questions
[01:14:18.059 --> 01:14:25.059]  about what to do when people start asking the obvious questions as to where this virus
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.460]  came from and could it have been a lab leak.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.460]  And of course, she says, well, we don't want to censor anybody, but we do want to flood
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.460]  the zone.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.700]  We want to flood the zone of our information.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.360]  In other words, the information that we're providing from the intelligence agencies will
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.540]  all be coordinated and designed and they'll already have agreements and cooperative handshake
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:48.260]  deals in place with the mainstream media to say, you get this information from us.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.780]  Don't go ask your own questions.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.620]  And the crew just brought in this list of participants in event 201.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:15:03.260]  And it really is a interesting congregation of folks, senior vice president at the UN,
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.940]  president of the US Medical Group, president of the Global Development Division of the
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:12.040]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former senior director of health at the World Bank
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.480]  Group, director general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, George
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.480]  Gao.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:23.840]  It may have been who we were just hearing asked that question, ANZ Bank, former global
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.360]  chief operating officer of Edelman, head of crisis, emergency business continuity management
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:35.840]  of Lufthansa Group Airlines, the UPS Foundation, the CDC, NBCUniversal, Johnson and Johnson.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:42.800]  So just a who's who of supranational forces, international spy agencies, corporations,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:49.559]  medical establishments all coming together in event 201 to pre-plan what is now being
[01:15:49.559 --> 01:15:53.960]  revealed, which is the manipulation of and that's what they talk, they didn't talk
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960]  about how to stop the virus.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.480]  They talked about how to manipulate the media.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480]  That's what event 201 was about.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.480]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480]  I thought it was next week.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480]  I come in this morning.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.880]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.920]  Bonnie's ultimate memory formula and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.920]  boys overhead shot, please.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.160]  Look how full this model is.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.180]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:26.000]  Right to the top with these 95% of human.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.760]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.040]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.780]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.860]  This is 95%.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]  Super constant.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.500]  So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average bill.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:45.139]  It's that powerful or more.
[01:16:45.139 --> 01:16:48.860]  So they're available at info war store.com.

[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.380]  gone down.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.660]  So I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.

[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:51.300]  Plus they fund their operation, go to info war store.com right now we're selling out
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:20:01.420]  ultimate bone broth at info war store.com 40% off about to sell out leading a frontal
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.139]  assault on the lies of the new world order.
[01:20:05.139 --> 01:20:06.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:29.880]  All right, you found it folks, the most demonized, the most hated, the most misaligned, maligned,
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:36.200]  most maligned, that's what I meant, media outlet on the face of the earth.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:41.880]  We get up every day, we read mainstream media articles, we talk about fighting for humanity,
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.440]  for every race, color, and creed, and we get called conspiracy theorists, we get called
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:52.240]  racists, anti-Semites, and hateful, and, you know, the way you disprove that is watch
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.040]  like an hour of the show.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:59.480]  Watch like just a couple hours of the show, it's just everything we talk about is factual.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:04.840]  There's no speculation on my part, well, there might be a little bit.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:09.160]  There might be a little bit of interpretation here or there, but it's based on evidence,
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.160]  isn't it?
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.000]  You know, we don't just say COVID came from a lab because we want it to have come from
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  a lab.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.080]  It's because, you know, all of the money they spent to create it in a lab.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.880]  It's because of the little game they played where they laid out exactly what was going
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.580]  to happen, where it was going to come from, how they were going to impose lockdowns
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.580]  as a result.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:37.000]  Because when you have somebody who says, we're going to do this, and then they do it, it's
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.980]  not speculation to say that this was a part of a plan.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.660]  And their plan is, again, just it's on the open now at this point.
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:53.260]  So now we as former conspiracy theorists and now just reporters of the news have had to
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:58.900]  move from exposing what's going on to trying to make people care about what's going on.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.940]  That's somehow more difficult.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:01.940]  That's somehow harder.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.940]  Right?
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:06.380]  It used to be like they would have all these plans that were secret and you could find
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:10.019]  them out and then bring them to the American public and expose it and go, look what
[01:22:10.019 --> 01:22:11.019]  they're doing.
[01:22:11.019 --> 01:22:12.019]  Now they just do it out in the open.
[01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:14.820]  And you have to go, don't you get that this is bad?
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.100]  Don't you get that this is wrong?
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.420]  Don't you get that they're targeting you and your family?
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:23.160]  Don't you understand what's implied with what they're putting in place?
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.220]  People are just like, well, they're the experts.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.220]  I don't know.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.860]  I mean, they're the ones in charge.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.580]  The adult, they keep telling me the adults are back in charge.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.019]  So I guess that makes me a child better.
[01:22:33.019 --> 01:22:34.019]  Sit down.
[01:22:34.019 --> 01:22:35.019]  I don't get it.
[01:22:35.019 --> 01:22:37.540]  I don't get how people can't connect these dots.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.420]  I don't have any dots to connect.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.540]  Let me read just a couple of stories for you here.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.120]  Some headlines.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.140]  By the way, I've been to Alex Jones who will be in studio momentarily.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.220]  He'll take over the show for me, but there are some stories that I want to cover
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:55.700]  in the meantime, but stay tuned because Alex Jones is not en route.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.440]  He's here, but he's finishing up with his deposition right now.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.000]  I do want to ask you to support us.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.620]  After all, this is, well, it's a strange place to be in, I'll tell you that.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.640]  On one hand, it's an absolute dream come true.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.880]  I've been a fan of Alex since I was in middle school and the fact that I got to
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:21.920]  wake up this morning and actually text Alex Jones, so what's up with these aliens?
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.760]  What's up with the UFO alien Mexico thing?
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]  And he's just like, I don't know.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.760]  It looks fake.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]  I'm like, cool.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.720]  The fact that, I mean, literally, I feel like I'm in a dream.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.000]  I feel like I have to pinch myself.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.280]  It's just absolutely an honor and a privilege and something I really feel an obligation
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.600]  to live up to, so I so appreciate it.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.019]  On the other hand, I never thought I'd really be in a situation where my friends
[01:23:46.019 --> 01:23:49.040]  were being arrested by the government.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.880]  I always like to think like, yeah, I'm a rebel.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.880]  Yeah, I'm on the outside.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.800]  Yeah, the government's probably watching me.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.800]  They probably want to shut me up, but they can't.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.960]  I thought I was just in high school and the government probably didn't care.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.760]  Now we're in this position where like, am I going to be arrested next if I express,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.280]  you know, something about the election being stolen and somebody else goes and breaks
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280]  into a building?
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.800]  Am I going to be thrown in prison for that?
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:16.880]  I mean, so it's a privilege and an honor and just an amazing dream to be able to
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.240]  be here fighting for info wars, fighting for America, expressing my beliefs, trying
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.400]  desperately to wake up humanity.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400]  It's such an honor.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.440]  At the same time, it's so terrifying, the world that they're creating for us.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:36.920]  It's so real, the fact that, you know, half a dozen of my friends or more are behind
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.240]  bars for the rest of their lives in some cases, potentially, for decades behind bars
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.000]  for opposing this government.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  We really are in this dystopian hell world that we knew was coming for so long.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.280]  It's well, I'll tell you, there's nowhere else I'd rather be, and I'm glad that you're
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.680]  here with us at info wars, and I hope that we continue to expand and grow and represent
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.400]  the fly and the ointment for the globalists.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.280]  Wouldn't it be nice for the globalists if we all just shut up?
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.680]  Wouldn't it be so easy and pleasant for them to just enact their global takeover
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.960]  without the annoyance of having to be confronted at every pass by info warriors exposing
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.080]  exactly what they're doing?
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.519]  We will continue to be the bulwark against their plans.
[01:25:22.519 --> 01:25:26.080]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us in this mission.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.400]  We're not going to be intimidated into silence.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.800]  We're not going to be bullied into giving up our God-given rights.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.240]  After all, we've studied history, and we know where that ends up.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.160]  And if we have to pay the price for it, then we will.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:44.120]  We just hope that you can help us shoulder the cost by going to infowarsstore.com.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.760]  And yes, Alex Jones was right, continues to be right, and has always been right about
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.519]  what is coming down the pipe, because he wasn't making it up, he was just reporting
[01:25:54.519 --> 01:25:55.519]  on what he found.
[01:25:55.519 --> 01:26:00.240]  Now it's out in the open, it's being publicized, it's being implemented as we speak from the
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.240]  Epoch Times.
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:09.320]  G20 announces plan to impose digital currencies and IDs worldwide.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.019]  The group of 20 leaders have agreed to a plan to eventually impose digital currencies
[01:26:13.019 --> 01:26:17.740]  and digital IDs on their respective populations, despite fears that governments will use them
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.500]  to monitor the people's spending and crush dissent.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.340]  It's like, well, what else would it be implemented for?
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.059]  What other purpose do you have to implement this stuff other than surveillance and the
[01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:31.500]  crushing of dissent?
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.180]  That's why CBDCs are a thing, you know.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:39.140]  The G20, which is currently under India's presidency, adopted a final declaration on
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.300]  the subject over the weekend in New Delhi.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:45.800]  The meeting, which included the world's leading economies, announced last week that they had
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.800]  agreed to build the necessary infrastructure to implement digital currencies and IDs.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.480]  The group said the discussions were already underway to create international regulations
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.380]  for cryptocurrencies, but claimed that there was no talk of banning cryptocurrency at
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.380]  the summit.
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:02.019]  Many critics are concerned that governments and central banks will eventually regulate
[01:27:02.019 --> 01:27:06.740]  cryptocurrencies and then immediately replace them with central bank digital currencies,
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.180]  which lack similar privacy and security.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.100]  So they're doing it.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.100]  I mean, they're making the agreements.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.100]  They're putting it into place.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.980]  They're outlawing cars.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.019]  They're building 15-minute cities.
[01:27:17.019 --> 01:27:23.780]  They're buying thousands of AI war-fighting robots.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:29.300]  They're indoctrinating you into submission to this globalist scheme.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:36.640]  And they're weaponizing and funding the decentralized power structure that will enforce
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640]  these edicts.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:44.519]  20 million dollars to police, mental health networks, universities, churches and school
[01:27:44.519 --> 01:27:48.680]  districts to help identify Americans as potential extremists.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.160]  This from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.519]  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced on September 6th that 20 million dollars in
[01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:59.600]  federal grants, that is your tax dollars, will be handed out to 34 organizations
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.480]  to, quote, prevent targeted violence and terrorism.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.960]  Since today is the anniversary of the 9-11 attacks, you might think that these 34 organizations
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.080]  will be focused on Al Qaeda, ISIS or the Iranian Republic Guard Corps.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.080]  But you'd be wrong.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.519]  No, they're focused on Americans who dissent from the prevailing narratives coming out
[01:28:15.519 --> 01:28:19.720]  of the federal government and its collaborating partners in the corporate media and major
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.559]  social media platforms.
[01:28:21.559 --> 01:28:26.880]  So whether it's COVID-19 vaccines, the war in Ukraine, immigration, the Second Amendment,
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:35.260]  LGBTQ ideology or gender confusion, this will get you labeled as an extremist and now
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:42.740]  beyond just the overwhelming and pro, you know, incredibly prolific spy states that
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.740]  already exist.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:49.180]  They are now weaponizing churches and schools and hospitals and medical providers to be
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:54.980]  their de facto decentralized Stasi to enforce the liberal hegemony.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.700]  It's coming.
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:57.700]  It's happening.
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.700]  It's here.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.580]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.580]  I thought it was next week.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:02.580]  I come in this morning.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:08.180]  It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll body's ultimate formula.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:13.940]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot, please.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.180]  Look how full this model is.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:21.200]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.139]  Right to the top with these ninety five percent human life.
[01:29:26.139 --> 01:29:29.780]  Again, most turmeric formulas are five percent.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:31.059]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:29:31.059 --> 01:29:33.820]  The other strongest brands are seventy five percent.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:37.900]  This is ninety five percent.
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.900]  Super constant.
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:43.860]  So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average pill, it's that powerful
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.860]  or more.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.059]  So they're available at info war store dot com.
[01:29:49.059 --> 01:29:53.820]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula sold out for almost eight months back in stock at
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:59.360]  info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360]  Body's is back.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.720]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to info war store dot com and
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:10.080]  is now twenty five percent off for a limited time utilized for thousands of years.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.040]  Turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.420]  Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:21.300]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:26.240]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:32.020]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system and so much more.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:36.320]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about one to five percent of the active ingredient
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.100]  curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over ninety
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.020]  five percent of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:47.540]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:05.960]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength and they can only be obtained
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.440]  through diet.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.360]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360]  it.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.600]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:24.100]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:02.520]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:07.720]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720]  us.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.240]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:18.940]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and we look at Harrison Smith
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:23.220]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.220]  a week.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.580]  It's really just incredible.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:29.580]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:35.020]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.020]  us.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.020]  I know you spread the word.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.500]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.500]  Keep doing it.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.800]  Most viewers and listeners, never go to infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.559]  and empower your life, while at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:32:47.559 --> 01:32:51.600]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.400]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.400]  will be over.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.639]  Please take action now.
[01:33:00.639 --> 01:33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:27.180]  Alright folks, yes, I am still here, we are still awaiting Alex Jones to emerge from the
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.180]  deposition.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:35.700]  He is, he should be, any moment now, we'll continue to cover these bombshell stories
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:41.140]  that are, really should lay out to everybody exactly what the globalists are up to.
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:46.460]  I'm Harrison Smith, the host of The American Journal, and yes, we are, we expect Alex already
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.080]  before this, but apparently the deposition is taking a little bit longer, but it should
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:54.000]  not be long now, so stay tuned, Alex Jones will take over and give you the breakdown
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:01.020]  of today's biggest news, but again, I want to cover a couple different stories,
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:06.260]  and if I have, I shouldn't even have to, but I'll try to illuminate how these are intertwined.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:13.300]  You know, this is the thing we talked about yesterday with the clip of Greg Gutfeld actually
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.780]  starting to connect the dots, actually sounding like Alex Jones, he was like mimicking and
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:22.340]  like kind of mocking out, but it's only because it's like it's inevitable, you
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:26.340]  have to realize what's going on here, you have to realize that there's a reason
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:30.860]  why all of these various things are taking place at exactly the same time, and how they
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:36.540]  all fit in together, and how the people that are responsible for this have announced their
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:41.380]  intentions for decades at this point, so there's really no excuse for not realizing what's
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:48.820]  going on, and for not fighting back against every one of these encroachments on your
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:58.060]  rights, whether it be private property or privacy, ownership, free thought, free speech,
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.700]  I mean, these are the things that are going away, because at the end of the day, it's
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:07.780]  all about control, it's all about control, how they can keep you in a permanent state
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:13.140]  of submission, which is why they love China so much. Do you think that China will
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:19.580]  experience a revolution anytime soon? Do you think it's even possible for a grassroots,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:26.580]  ground-up revolution to take place in China? Or do they have a system through the social
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:33.420]  credit score that utterly precludes that possibility? It's really not possible for
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:39.860]  an average Chinese person to, like, gain the momentum that they need, it gets snuffed
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.740]  out in the beginning, see, that's why they don't care about China being unfriendly
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:51.780]  to LGBT, not having open borders, and being actually super racist officially, destroying
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:56.340]  the earth wholesale, like, almost to the extent that it seems like it's on purpose,
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:03.100]  where they're just destroying entire, like, causing to go extinct entire species of fish,
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.540]  and pouring plastic into the oceans at a rate 100 times any other country, like,
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.300]  this is the country that all of the World Economic Forum, who's shutting down the
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:17.280]  Western world, who's shutting down the first world out of supposed concern for climate
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.760]  change and pollution, they allow China to be completely unencumbered by these restrictions,
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.440]  because they don't care about those things, those things are means to an end,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.600]  those things are being used to bring about total control, and once you have total control,
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.720]  none of the excuses that they use to get it really matter at all.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:39.480]  So what are they doing now? Well, the G20 is announcing a plan to impose digital
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.480]  currencies and IDs worldwide, that's what they announced during their recent meeting in India,
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:52.320]  with the European Commission chief re-emphasizing the need for digital IDs, which of course they
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.840]  got you used to through the COVID-19 vaccine passports, and those things.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:04.240]  The European Commission president Ursula Van der Leyen called for an international
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.560]  regulatory body for artificial intelligence digital ID systems, similar to coronavirus
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.280]  vaccine passports, and advocated for global cooperation to address challenges presented by
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.200]  AI. She called for the United Nations to have a role in AI regulation, and called for the European
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.640]  Union's COVID-19 digital certificate, a perfect model for digital public infrastructures, which
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.960]  would include digital IDs. So yes, they used vaccine passports, they are using digital
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:38.520]  vaccine passports as the blueprint to establish the literal mark of the beast, okay? Let's not
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:43.680]  beat around the bush. Meanwhile, you have Homeland Security awarding 20 million dollars
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.160]  to police, mental health networks, universities, churches, and school districts to help identify
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.000]  Americans as potential extremists. Why? Well, because they question the government, don't you know?
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.440]  The money for this comes from the Department of Homeland Security Center for Prevention
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:05.800]  Programs and Partnerships, or CP3. The program was started in fiscal 2020, and has to date
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.920]  awarded 70 million dollars in grants to private nonprofits, state, and local government agencies.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.680]  The following is from the DHS press release announcing the 20 million dollar new grants,
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.160]  and it has to do with public health, of course, because gun violence now is a public health
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.800]  threat. Racism is a public health threat. Misinformation is a public health threat.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.880]  Gathering together in groups is a public health threat. It turns out you can implement a lot of
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:36.120]  unconstitutional and liberty-destroying measures if you just call them public health
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:42.560]  threats, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're saying that this grant funding will
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.640]  provide prevention training and promote greater awareness and understanding of TVTP,
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.760]  targeted violence and terrorism prevention strategies. So this will be, again, behavioral
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.680]  and mental health providers, educators, faith leaders, social service providers, nonprofits,
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.960]  law enforcement, and other state and local community partners to address systemic factors
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:08.280]  that can lead to violence, while strengthening protective factors at the local level that support
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.360]  the safety, well-being, and resiliency of communities in the United States. So that's what
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.520]  we need, isn't it? We need people who are going to, you know, some sort of care center to deal
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:22.160]  with their mental health. What we need to do is co-opt their psychiatrist in becoming a snitch
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.400]  for the state. That's essentially what they're saying. They are deputizing mental health
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:36.200]  professionals, counselors, people in schools and libraries and churches to be the Stasi, to be
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:44.440]  the decentralized surveillance agents who will then report to DHS and FEMA. And they're already
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.080]  funding it, and they're already doing it. At the same time, they're expanding to Capitol
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:55.840]  Police, who now have extremely advanced surveillance technology, including drones and balloons in
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.440]  American cities thousands of miles from the Capitol. They happen to be the only police
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.280]  force that is not under obligation under the Freedom of Information Act, so they can do a
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.120]  lot of stuff and not have to tell you about it. Meanwhile, the FBI is kicking in the door of
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:19.840]  abortion protesters and have also killed three Americans in late-night raids in the last month
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:25.320]  or so. There's a man in Henderson, Tennessee, a disabled veteran, who was killed when
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.360]  the FBI raided his house. There was another guy in, I believe it was New Mexico. His name
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:36.360]  was Ahmed. He was killed by the FBI during a raid, which his mother and brother were arrested.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.080]  Then the FBI was in the house for a little while. Then they come out, and the guy's dead.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:48.880]  And then you had the 400-pound, totally disabled and immobile troll on Facebook saying,
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.160]  maybe I'll get my ghillie suit on and go shoot Biden, when it's like, he can't get out of his
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.600]  chair. So is it really that big of a threat? Well, regardless, he's dead now because the FBI
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.880]  raided his home. So you've got like FBI kill squads on the rampage. You've got them
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:12.680]  weaponized through the FACE Act and all these other various programs designed to make illegal
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:18.400]  the ability of Americans to petition the government. They're imprisoning free speech
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.920]  activists and journalists for crimes that other people committed. They're sending the leaders
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:29.960]  of right-wing dissident groups to prison for decades at a time. They are banning guns
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:36.920]  in every way they possibly can, while letting the criminals run the streets and making everything
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:43.840]  less safe overall. At the same time, they're flooding our country with millions upon millions
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.000]  of people every single, I don't know, how long does it take to get a million people across the
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.840]  border? A month? Two months? Is it two months we get a million people? Since Joe Biden has been
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.320]  in office, a population equal to and greater than the biggest cities in America have crossed
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:06.200]  the border. And of course, that has wreaked havoc on the economy when it comes to the
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:11.440]  buying power of the average American. And so as they destroy the economy, and you're forced
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.920]  to drain your savings, and you'll have nothing to fall back on, you certainly won't have enough
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.600]  for a down payment for a big purchase. So no more buying houses, no more buying cars, no more
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:26.080]  speaking out, no more protesting, no more doing anything without permission as the biometric
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.120]  technocratic control grid is slowly but surely being built around you. And if you want to
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.160]  wake up and break out, now's the time because once they complete it, once they put in those
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.560]  final bars and slam the door and lock it, that's it for humanity, not just in America,
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.600]  but around the world. These types of systems, we're used to thinking that they're self
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.800]  defeating, but they're not necessarily. These types of systems can go on not just for a long
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:54.280]  time, but forever, if they prevent you from even being able to fathom the idea of
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.640]  resistance against it, let alone speaking out against it. We'll be right back.

[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.320]  in the world of many wicked. For the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.840]  upholds the righteous. The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:36.600]  inheritance will endure forever. In times of disaster, they will not wither. In days
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.040]  of famine, they will have plenty. But the wicked will perish. Though the Lord's
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.160]  enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed and they will develop in smoke.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:46:03.080]  For everything the global has hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.120]  answer. I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible things
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.800]  it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.920]  particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible. It works. We have the strongest, best CBD oil
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.360]  you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price. Yes, you can find this same CBD oil
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:31.000]  for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from, made right here in Central Texas.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:38.120]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:42.280]  or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.920]  you at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.800]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are. So this is the highest rated,
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:57.720]  already the lowest price, now even a lower price. Rebels in, get yours at m4store.com now.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:17.080]  New World Order bombers, dead ahead. Let's give them a reception.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.000]  Red 2, follow my lead high side.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.360]  Good hit.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:35.720]  I'm set for kill.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:43.720]  Hammer down.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.680]  Red 2, you have fighters on your tail.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  You're taking fire. I'm coming. Red 2, get the hell out of there. Hammer down. I got them.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:20.040]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:50.040]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:49:03.400]  I pledge to you that whenever the establishment keeps on being on air with these globalist
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.480]  depositions they just had me do the last two days, they just ended 10 minutes ago and they
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.440]  promised more that I will only do more shows for every hour of broadcast time they take.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:18.280]  I will produce three more hours of resistance and whistleblowers information against them.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.120]  They don't just cut off one head and two sprout. They cut off one head and three sprouts.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.760]  We're lining all that up right now, but I'll be here now until the end of the transmission
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:34.280]  coming up here in the next two hours. So thank you so much. It's 1249 central standard time.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.280]  Harrison Smith did a splendid job. I caught pieces of them when we were on breaks.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.280]  And here we are. All right. Owen Schroyer's plane has not gotten back yet
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:47.720]  with his sentencing for thought crime. But I'm sure they're gonna have a great guest host
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.440]  at 3 p.m central for you. But we have other political prisoners popping in Zach
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:59.000]  Real and Ethan Nordin of the Proud Boys with huge president sentences for doing absolutely
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.680]  nothing. They'll be popping in, but because we've got to recognize these folks from the
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.800]  deep state gulag. Obviously Congress has released all treasure trove of documents,
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:16.680]  just their gravy on top of the Chinese espionage and the pedophilia and the corruption and the
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:22.120]  money laundering and the Russian money and the Ukrainian money. The Bidens are not Chinese
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:28.680]  agents, not Russian agents. They are vending machines. You put money into them and you get
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:35.800]  back whatever you paid for as a foreign government or organization. Harrison did a great
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:41.160]  job, but I got to say this. He did not symmetrically stack the papers in here. And I
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.680]  did not have time to go over all my articles. I normally do that, but I've been up since
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:51.800]  five a.m. But I am extremely blessed and honored to be here with you today.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.240]  But I almost like coming in here unprepared. I mean, I did a lot of preparation last night
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.520]  and said this morning, but not the normal preparation to go through all the articles
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:05.640]  here before we go live on here. I mean, look at this humdinger right here. This fish story.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:12.680]  DHS Secretary Mayorkas, Biden's open border policy
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:19.640]  that's allowed 7.2 million illegal aliens in the US has been a model approach that's proven to work.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.000]  I mean, I'd laugh. I am laughing and I shouldn't laugh if it wasn't such
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.120]  a serious situation. I mean, I have to tell you what's going on the border,
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:34.200]  the human trafficking, the mass death, hundreds of thousands dead in the last decade,
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.840]  the hundreds of thousands died here, a fentanyl.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:47.019]  It is a bloody nightmare. And there's the video of him saying this is a model approach.
[01:51:47.019 --> 01:51:51.180]  You believe me, he said that. Do you want to see the CNN clip? You want to hear him
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:57.160]  say it's a model approach? You know my rule. If I tell you somebody said something, I got
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:01.400]  a clip, I should play it. But I really don't want to listen to Mijorkus. But you
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  know what? Let's follow the rule. Go ahead and play Mijorkus.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.920]  Within that broken immigration system, we are challenged by an unprecedented level of displacement
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:18.900]  in the Western Hemisphere of historic proportions. We have responded with a model approach that
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:25.200]  has proven to work, which is to build lawful pathways for individuals to arrive in a safe
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.599]  and orderly way and to deliver consequences for those who don't meet them.
[01:52:30.599 --> 01:52:39.840]  It's a model system. Oh, and it's unprecedented. After three years of globalist lockdowns, it
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:43.840]  was three years in the third world, forcing them all up here, the U.N. controlling it.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:52.680]  Biden saying if I win the election, immediately surge the U.S. border. But oh, no, it's
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:53:00.860]  not their fault at all. It's not their fault in any way. They are wonderful people. Really,
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:05.040]  what is the big news today that I'll be covering after our political prisoner guests
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:13.800]  join us and leave us? And that is that England starting four months ago sent medium
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:22.280]  range, large, heavy is the term, cruise missiles, 1000 to 200,000 pound bombs.
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:30.960]  Guided bombs to the Ukrainians. And now the U.S. is sending even more advanced,
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:37.480]  even longer range missiles, 100 mile range missiles. You just see how a year ago we can't
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:42.400]  ship cruise missiles. That's World War Three. Oh, we can't get Abrams. That's World War
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:48.120]  Three. In fact, get the clip of Biden saying we can't send Abrams tanks. That'll be World
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:54.760]  War Three. And now it's like, hey, World War Three never sounded better, did it? I
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:54:01.440]  cannot even calculate to my own brain the danger we're in. I would like it a few times.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:07.320]  I've been in like Colorado or. Other parts of the country, the mountains, and you'll
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:13.400]  be going up to someplace you've never been. All of a sudden you're on a road with no guardrail
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:21.160]  and it's a little bitty two lane road with like a half foot towards 5000 foot drop off 10. You
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.480]  know, you're dead. And all of a sudden you're driving laws and you're like, whoa,
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:30.639]  I'm on the edge here. Guys type in photos of dangerous mountain roads. Most people that
[01:54:30.639 --> 01:54:33.760]  have driven around like, you know, you know how it is, you're driving along a pretty good
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.160]  size road. All of a sudden you're going to see some national park or state park or some
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:45.680]  and all of a sudden you're like, whoa, holy hell. I am literally one foot from total death
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:51.000]  and you get real focused. You tell the wife and kids zip it and they look and zip it too.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.960]  And then you're almost guilty. Like, why did I get on a road like this? And I'll be honest,
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.519]  I've been on a few of those roads with my family a few times on trips covering things.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:09.440]  We kept on the destination. But with the family, they'll have little turnarounds. And you know
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:15.320]  what I do? I turn around with my wife and children are in the car. Of course,
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.920]  we're showing you some mountain roads here. They're rocking the rest of it. It seems
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.000]  scary, but the ones we're showing are nothing compared to what's out there.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:28.440]  And that's all part of the animating contest of liberty.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.640]  But the point is, is that...
[01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:59.790]  That's an allegory, that's an analogy of, I realize, you realize, we are on a very dangerous two-lane road, going up a mountain, and there's thousands of foot drop on the side, and the great part is, when you're coming back down, it's so much less scary. Because you're not on the edge. But you're still just a few feet away from total death. So...
[01:55:59.790 --> 01:56:29.790]  That's how I feel doing the broadcast. Like, we're on a mountain road with 10 inches of median, of shoulder, and you're just like, wow, this country used to be really free. Because if you know the leftists were in full control back when those roads were built, you wouldn't be going up those. In fact, it makes you say to your family, man, I can't believe our government even does this. And I'm like, again, the roads the crew's showing right now look scary.
[01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:59.790]  But it's not their fault. I just said this, they didn't know I was going to do this. That's like an India they're showing. That's nothing compared to what's in Colorado and West Texas and stuff. Because that's got a shoulder, folks. You've all bet on them. On the roads that don't have any barrier, and you're looking down 3-4,000 feet, it is crazy. So I'm done talking about that, let's move on with the analogy. In post, I'm going to find the really scary ones, because we've all bet on them.
[01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:29.790]  At least most of you have. And again, you're driving along on a main road, you exit, don't say, man, this is scary as hell. And you can't wait till you get where you're going because you cannot believe that you're there. I'm simply trying to get people to realize that they are in this position. I'm simply trying to get people to understand that this is white knuckle time. But you look at the globalists, I mean, they're just delusional.
[01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:39.790]  Absolutely out of their minds, because they think we're the problem? Overpopulation's the problem? How about nuclear war and bioweapons and all the things they proliferated? That's the problem.
[01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:44.790]  Our number three with political prisoners, a ton of breaking news and more, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:52.940]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.259]  really, really, really good news.
[01:57:54.259 --> 01:57:58.900]  Because it's a great product you love and people want it and it funds our operation
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:00.299]  of 360 Wind.
[01:58:00.299 --> 01:58:05.380]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere, jam packed,
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:10.860]  a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:12.019]  system, you name it.
[01:58:12.019 --> 01:58:14.019]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[01:58:14.019 --> 01:58:17.420]  God gave it to us and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.940]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:25.660]  Most brands are 5% human and that still does a great thing for you.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:30.460]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.019]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:58:33.019 --> 01:58:34.660]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:38.139]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[01:58:38.139 --> 01:58:43.860]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula, back in stock 25% off info war store.com.

[01:58:53.809 --> 01:58:54.809]  fight.

[01:58:58.790 --> 01:59:03.570]  One of the most incredible I have to say is DNA force plus, and it's one of these
[01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:07.790]  supplements that you really don't know what the effect it's going to have on you is until
[01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:10.969]  you try it and it's different for everybody, but it's always positive.
[01:59:10.969 --> 01:59:14.349]  Essentially it just, it helps in a variety of different ways and whatever way that your
[01:59:14.349 --> 01:59:15.349]  body needs.
[01:59:15.349 --> 01:59:16.349]  It'll help in that way.
[01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:19.809]  DNA force plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting
[01:59:19.809 --> 01:59:22.450]  your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:26.929]  That's why DNA force plus has exactly what you need to provide yourselves with protection
[01:59:26.929 --> 01:59:29.929]  by taking something like DNA force plus you're just upping the game on all of your
[01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:33.490]  body's functions in a way that is holistic and complete and really incredible.
[01:59:33.490 --> 01:59:37.210]  Go to info war store.com and of course, best of all, you keep us on air and in
[01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:42.330]  the fight and fighting back against the mental, spiritual and physical poisoning that
[01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:46.030]  we contend with on a daily basis.
[01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:59.990]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:01.309]  Zach, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:00:01.309 --> 02:00:05.389]  St. Norada has declared DEFCON 3 Scramble All Alert Aircraft.
[02:00:05.389 --> 02:00:09.070]  I repeat, Scramble All Alert Aircraft.
[02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:13.769]  The WAPR spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[02:00:13.769 --> 02:00:14.769]  Target selection complete.
[02:00:14.769 --> 02:00:16.769]  Time on target sequence complete.
[02:00:16.769 --> 02:00:23.130]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlov, turning south out of North Cap.
[02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:25.330]  Bearing zero nine five degrees.
[02:00:25.330 --> 02:00:29.610]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:33.250]  From the front lines of the information war.
[02:00:33.250 --> 02:00:36.330]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:00:36.330 --> 02:00:38.330]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:42.190]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:00:42.190 --> 02:00:43.190]  You bet!
[02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:47.190]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:47.190 --> 02:00:51.190]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:52.190]  Three.
[02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:53.190]  Two.
[02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:54.190]  One.
[02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:55.190]  Impact.
[02:00:55.190 --> 02:00:58.190]  Shall we play a game?
[02:00:58.190 --> 02:01:04.190]  How about global thermo nuclear war?
[02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:09.049]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:09.049 --> 02:01:12.049]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[02:01:12.049 --> 02:01:14.049]  We are in launch mode.
[02:01:14.049 --> 02:01:18.049]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[02:01:18.049 --> 02:01:23.049]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:01:23.049 --> 02:01:24.049]  We're in!
[02:01:24.049 --> 02:01:26.049]  Russia is still denying everything, sir.
[02:01:26.049 --> 02:01:28.049]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[02:01:28.049 --> 02:01:31.049]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[02:01:31.049 --> 02:01:33.049]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:37.910]  The only winning goal is not to play.
[02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:54.910]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:01:54.910 --> 02:02:02.910]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:02:03.769 --> 02:02:10.769]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:02:10.769 --> 02:02:16.769]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:02:16.769 --> 02:02:22.769]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:02:22.769 --> 02:02:26.769]  We came, we saw, we died.
[02:02:26.769 --> 02:02:30.769]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:02:31.630 --> 02:02:34.630]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:43.630]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:02:43.630 --> 02:02:48.630]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:02:48.630 --> 02:02:56.630]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:02:56.630 --> 02:02:59.630]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:03:00.490 --> 02:03:02.490]  There's a really loud noise.
[02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:07.490]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:09.490]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:17.490]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:34.490]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:37.490]  I watch Infowars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:39.490]  You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:03:39.490 --> 02:03:42.490]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:46.490]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year and a half.
[02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:48.490]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:51.490]  I watch Infowars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.490]  You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:03:53.490 --> 02:03:56.490]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:03:57.349 --> 02:04:00.349]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:04:00.349 --> 02:04:04.349]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:04:06.349 --> 02:04:09.349]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:04:09.349 --> 02:04:10.349]  This is reality.
[02:04:10.349 --> 02:04:12.349]  It just pancakes.
[02:04:12.349 --> 02:04:14.349]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:04:14.349 --> 02:04:16.349]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:04:16.349 --> 02:04:19.349]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:04:19.349 --> 02:04:21.349]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:04:21.349 --> 02:04:25.349]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.210]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:28.210 --> 02:04:32.210]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:04:32.210 --> 02:04:34.210]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[02:04:34.210 --> 02:04:36.210]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:04:36.210 --> 02:04:38.210]  We're going to get fired up about the real things!
[02:04:38.210 --> 02:04:40.210]  The things that matter!
[02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:43.070]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:04:54.070 --> 02:04:56.070]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:05:10.210 --> 02:05:12.210]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:14.210]  The strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[02:05:14.210 --> 02:05:18.210]  Jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation.
[02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:20.210]  That empowers your neurological system.
[02:05:20.210 --> 02:05:22.210]  You name it.
[02:05:22.210 --> 02:05:24.210]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:26.210]  God gave it to us.
[02:05:26.210 --> 02:05:28.210]  And it's the strongest for humanoid out there.
[02:05:28.210 --> 02:05:30.210]  Other leading brands are like 70% for humanoid.
[02:05:30.210 --> 02:05:32.210]  Most brands are 5% for humidin.
[02:05:32.210 --> 02:05:34.210]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:36.210]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:38.210]  95% for humanoid.
[02:05:38.210 --> 02:05:40.210]  I am so glad this is back.
[02:05:40.210 --> 02:05:42.210]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:44.210]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:46.210]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:05:46.210 --> 02:05:48.210]  Back in stock.
[02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:50.210]  25% off.
[02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:52.210]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:54.210]  or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:06:16.580]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:22.259]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:34.019]  So last December, in multiple interviews, the puppet president Obama 2.0,
[02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:40.179]  O'Biden, said we can't send Abrams tanks and F-16s to Ukraine. That's World War 3 on the threat
[02:06:40.179 --> 02:06:45.379]  escalation chart. But that's all changed. And now they're sending something even above tanks
[02:06:45.379 --> 02:06:53.940]  and F-16s. And that's Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7, Mach 8, Mach 9, Mach 10 heavy cruise missiles
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:57.139]  with ranges of up to 100 miles.
[02:07:00.339 --> 02:07:06.740]  They fly at tree level and just blew up a large part of the Russian fleet in Sebastopol yesterday.
[02:07:09.219 --> 02:07:10.980]  Now again, don't believe Alex Jones.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:18.660]  Biden's told by the Pentagon, don't do this. It'll take it from a proxy war,
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:26.500]  a hybrid war, to a full-on escalation by the Russians who said, you start doing this,
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:33.059]  we'll hit NATO targets outside of Ukraine. And they announced the last few weeks that the
[02:07:33.059 --> 02:07:38.740]  British and the US are going to send, and I have sent, more powerful long-range missiles.
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:43.379]  And the Ukrainians agree to not hit inside Russia, but now they're doing it.
[02:07:43.379 --> 02:07:47.299]  Okay, there you go.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.920]  Go ahead and roll the clip, Biden.
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:57.400]  Look, the idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:03.200]  and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:09.400]  Just understand, don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say, that's called World War
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.400]  Three.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:11.400]  Okay?
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:16.160]  Let's get it straight here, guys.
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:25.560]  And last year, the Pentagon, working with Elon Musk, decided to not let those drone ships
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:28.320]  attack the Russian fleet.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:31.680]  That's in the fine print that in consultation with the Pentagon and the Russians, it was
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:34.280]  decided because the Ukrainians weren't supposed to use it offensively.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:38.520]  Musk, who's a total deep state guy, did that.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:43.760]  Now they're saying, oh, he's a traitor, he didn't go along with it because the wild-eyed
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:45.520]  war hawks are now in charge.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.200]  All right, he's the first step to join us.
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:53.600]  Zach Real was just sentenced to 15 years for, quote, provoking January 6th capital
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:09:01.400]  attack, says Main Street Media, and he joins us from a gulag here in America, DefendZach.com.
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.960]  If they can get Zach, they can get you.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.960]  They're totally innocent.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:07.240]  Meanwhile, Ray Epps admitted to Congress, he, quote, orchestrated the attack, told
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:10.400]  people to go in the building and help ram signs into police.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:12.880]  The New York Times defends him.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.600]  Zach Real did no such thing.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.280]  Zach, thank you for joining us.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:18.280]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:24.200]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex, appreciate it, really honored to be on your show.
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:28.000]  And yeah, you know, it's the travesty of justice that's going on here.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.600]  I mean, like you said, I was just sentenced to 15 years in prison and, you know, like
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:39.680]  they haven't been able to point to literally one instance of where we even discussed doing
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:40.680]  what they accused of.
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:48.160]  I mean, they acquired $1.5 million, and not one of those messages even mentions anything
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:55.720]  about stopping what happened on January 6th, which, you know, the transfer of power,
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.920]  and anything about just delaying the proceedings.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:06.960]  And you know, like the whole five-month trial was just nothing but a charade.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:15.200]  I mean, it was everything that the prosecutors wanted, you know, they were allowed to, you
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.800]  know, shove through.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:20.840]  And anything that we wanted to get through, the judge would just deny it, deny, deny,
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:21.840]  deny.
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:24.840]  You know, we had exculpatory evidence time after time again.
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:29.360]  You know, as you know, you've reported in the past about the undercover law enforcement
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:34.560]  agents that were, you know, infiltrated in our group, not only in our group, but also
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:37.280]  in the marching group as well.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.280]  And we weren't allowed to present any of that, we weren't allowed to present any of
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:42.280]  it.
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.960]  And, you know, these things are all going to be useful come appeal time.
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:50.920]  But I mean, it's crazy what they've been allowed to get away with.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:56.880]  I mean, you know, the first day I was arrested, I mean, I've watched as the federal government
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:02.040]  recorded by my legal calls right in front of my eyes, you know, and then, you know,
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:03.040]  they also, we also...
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:06.520]  And by the way, that's totally illegal, but they admit they do it, they should do whatever
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:07.520]  they want.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:08.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.520]  And, yeah, right.
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:15.200]  And, and in the middle of trial, we filed a motion about them reading my emails, which
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.840]  was also legal, legal emails, and they admitted it in court.
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  They're like, yeah, we do it.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:20.840]  No part.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:21.840]  Yeah, whatever.
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.840]  Say what?
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  And the judge just never...
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:27.200]  So it was a big deal 20 years ago when they did it to Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.840]  And I said that, hey, square Al-Qaeda, but it'll be used on us next.
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:30.840]  Now it is.
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:31.840]  Right.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.840]  Yeah.
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:36.720]  And now, you know, we're American citizens, you know, we're supposed to have the Constitution
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:37.720]  protecting us.
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:41.320]  And, you know, they, they just, you know, they work their behinds with it.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.400]  You know, they, they don't even listen to the Constitution.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.160]  The Constitution does not exist with the DOJ at all.
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:49.680]  Get everything off your chest here and I'll be able to support you, brother.
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:51.200]  I hope we get Trump in the party.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.200]  You're totally innocent.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:56.540]  But what do you make a ramp saying he orchestrated it in his text messages, ramming signs
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:59.400]  in the police, you did none of that, saying go into the Capitol and the New York
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.400]  Times says he's a darling?
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960]  Yeah.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960]  It's crazy.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.960]  Right?
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:05.960]  Yes.
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  I've seen Ray X multiple times.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.400]  He said he was next to me multiple times throughout the day.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.280]  And I've seen him antagonize him.
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  He would play both sides.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.440]  At one point, he would act like he was, he was on the police officer side.
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.640]  And then another, on the other hand, he was, he was rallying up people.
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:20.960]  He was getting people mad.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.800]  He was yelling at people, telling people that, you know, like this is stuff he was
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:26.800]  saying.
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:30.200]  Like, I've seen this with my own eyes, you know, and, and this guy, he's just,
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:33.960]  he's out there, you know, walking free, you know, it's, it's, it's crazy.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:39.240]  It blows my mind, you know, I, I don't understand it, you know, and, uh, the sooner we get,
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:44.680]  you know, the sooner we can, I mean, the better, but, uh, like, yeah, yeah, I got
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:45.680]  it.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:49.960]  Zach, let me ask you this, I mean, I've read about it, but what do they claim you
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:52.520]  did to get 15 years in prison?
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:59.720]  Uh, what they claimed we did, they claimed I was part of, uh, a leadership group that
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:06.480]  tried to stop Joe Biden from taking power, and they, they psyched the 12th amendment,
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:12.960]  uh, as, as the law that we're trying to stop, um, there's that, yeah, so basically
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:19.080]  they're saying we, we forcibly stopped the federal government from executing laws
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:26.200]  and not one point, like I said, and 1.5 million messages did we ever even remotely
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.240]  come close to discussing such a thing.
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:33.160]  Like we, we plan on going down there to support president Trump at the time and
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:36.360]  defend people from the attacks and the threats of Antifa.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:38.040]  That's what we always did, you know?
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.680]  And we marched around the city like we always did.
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.360]  So you never, you never invented government buildings.
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:47.760]  So, so, so the point is, then they break through, you get waved in, but, but
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.000]  that's all they're saying you did.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.680]  That's all they're saying I did.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:52.120]  Yeah.
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:58.480]  And, um, basically the other guys that, uh, the other guys that I'm, I'm
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.200]  co-defendants with, it's the same thing.
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.040]  Like they, they, what they, what they've done is they pointed
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.680]  to what other people have done.
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.480]  They said, well, you know, this, this random guy over here on the other side
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.000]  of the building, you know, they punched a cop, so you're responsible for it
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.320]  because well, that's right.
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.280]  That's what CNN, ABC news, and all of us say that, that you're, you're
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:19.440]  convicted for 15 years for provoking.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:20.880]  So now it's your speech.
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.520]  Well, that didn't ever put in evidence what your supposed speech was.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:27.960]  And now he's not facing as much time as you, but Owen Schroyer was there
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:30.320]  trying to stop it, 60 days in jail.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  Yeah, it's a disgrace.
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.200]  You know, and I'm just, that, that, that right there, that 60 days of
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.920]  jail right there just shows exactly what they want to do.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:40.040]  They want to silence the right.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:43.840]  Um, you know, two days after Enrique Tarrio was, was, uh, was
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:47.680]  sentenced, they were, they had us shackled and ready to, you know,
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:49.320]  ready to go on the first bus out of here.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.880]  You know, um, I was up my first year and a half.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:56.800]  I was in the BOP and let me tell you, after sentencing, you don't
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:59.080]  move for at minimum three weeks.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.120]  So there were, you know, really trying to whisk us out of here really quick.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:08.040]  And it was mind boggling how quick they wanted to do it.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.400]  But after seeing what they sentenced Owen to, I mean, it's clear
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:14.520]  as day at this point, we're far past bias.
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:18.600]  There's they're straight up trying to silence us and they're trying
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:24.480]  to crush our hopes and, you know, any chances of, uh, all about
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.200]  president Trump, but it's all about power with these people.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.360]  And I hope they, I hope they lose it and hope they
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:30.320]  don't ever get it back again.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:33.200]  It's about outlawing their political opposition and the time we have,
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:34.400]  what do you want to impart to the viewers?
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.560]  Um, I, I want to thank everybody for your support.
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:41.480]  Uh, it's, it's been a long two and a half years.
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.040]  I mean, most of it's been a solitary confinement.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:48.320]  Uh, just please, if you're listening, um, this, this, we are in, we
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.360]  are innocent of these crimes.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.360]  We did not do what we were accused of.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:56.920]  Um, we were convicted by a kangaroo court by a political jury
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:59.800]  and a bias kangaroo court judge.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.840]  And, uh, you know, just, just please, anything, anything you can do to reach
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.640]  out to your senators, please do.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:08.080]  Um, if you want to help, you know, donate to our legal
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.480]  fund, please do so, uh, fensac.com.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.360]  I really appreciate that too.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.440]  Uh, and just, just keep fighting for us for real, because, you know,
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:17.760]  this, this could happen to your kids.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:18.720]  This can happen to you.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:21.320]  I mean, we just showed up to a protest, you know, we didn't do
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.240]  anything, but yet we're being blamed for all these atrocious.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:27.680]  Well, if you need to burn down stuff and shot a police officer, Kamala Harris
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:30.880]  would have bailed you out and some Soros DA would have let you go.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:42.180]  Oh yeah, absolutely, of course. You know, BLM just won a $13 million lawsuit in New York City and, you know, here we are sitting in jail.
[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:48.180]  And all over the country, the rigged cities, Denver, you name it, are giving money to Antifa and BLM.
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:57.180]  Right. Yeah, yeah, all the celebrities and everything, yeah, they're all Twitter supporting this, you know, it's wild.
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:04.180]  Did something just happen with McCarthy's office where they invaded his office or whatever and, you know, I'm not happy with them too?
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:12.180]  I mean, if we did that, if we did that, we would have all been faced with felony charges. You know, it's just wild.
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:25.180]  Rules for the, rules for the, not for me, and obviously you're appealing this, I hate to come to lizards every day asking for support, but DefendZack, one word, DefendZack.com, how's your family doing, Zack?
[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:35.180]  They're hanging in there, Alex, I appreciate you asking. I still never met my daughter, my youngest daughter, my oldest daughter just graduated high school.
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:45.180]  I missed both her birth and her, my oldest graduation, but we're hanging in there tight. My wife's a trooper, she's been by my side the whole time.
[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:53.180]  She knows that this is, you know, this is an unjust thing and that I'm innocent of these crimes, otherwise, you know, we might have been having a different discussion.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:18:00.180]  But they've been strong, they've, like I said, been by my side from day one and, you know, we're, we're just, we're fighting this, man.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:07.180]  We're going to take it to the Supreme Court if we have to. We hope we don't have to, but, you know, we're ready and prepared to if we do.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:20.180]  And, like I said, just full speed ahead at the Court of Appeals and just expose this fraud for what it is, you know?
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:27.180]  Well, everybody says this. It's not just rhetoric, it's true. If they can do this to you, they can do it to anybody.
[02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:35.180]  And then this, they admit this is a beta test. They're on MSNBC, CNN saying, now that we've done this to the Proud Boys, we're going to arrest all the Trump supporters.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:47.180]  Yeah, and I think that's what their goal is. I mean, they keep requesting more money in Congress to prosecute crimes from January 6th.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:54.180]  And it's just like, there's not really that many crimes that happened on January 6th. I mean, there's some assaults that happened. I mean, yeah, sure.
[02:18:54.180 --> 02:19:02.180]  And they killed four, they killed four citizens, and a cop had a heart attack the next day, and it got pooped in Pelosi's office and drank her beer. Yeah, that's it.
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:13.180]  Yeah, exactly. And the rest is maybe misdemeanor trespass at max. But the left did that all throughout Trump's presidency.
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:24.180]  They attacked Congress during the Kavanaugh hearings, and they did similar things during the inauguration, when Trump was inaugurated in 2016.
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:30.180]  And you don't hear anything about this. You don't hear nothing. You hear nothing about it, and none of these people were charged with anything.
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:44.180]  And if they were, they were let go. They had charges dropped. But if you're a conservative, and you step on the wrong part of the grass, you have to look at felony charges and possibilities of going to jail for up to 20 years.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:47.180]  Well, let me ask you this, because we're going to cut you off soon.
[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:48.180]  It's absolutely unjust.
[02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:59.180]  It is. Let me ask you this. I was told by Enrique Tarrio and Joe Biggs that, though, the jail guards and everybody are overwhelmingly apologetic, even the prisoners realize you guys are political prisoners.
[02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:06.180]  Oh, yeah. And that's 100% accurate. Somebody just said...
[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:09.180]  You have one minute remaining.
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:16.180]  Sorry, Zach. You got cut off. You got 45 seconds. Start over. What's the response like? Go ahead.
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:25.180]  Yeah, so we literally just had a guy yesterday, a CEO, who said, hey, you guys are political prisoners. It's messed up what's going on over here with you guys.
[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:32.180]  You guys shouldn't be getting treated any worse than these guys over in the other building where the other prisoners are, you know.
[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:38.180]  And it's full on support, full on support from the guards. Same thing with the inmates. They, you know, a lot of love.
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:48.180]  And honestly, the black community really is trapped in 2024. It's going to be a huge wave of the black community as far as people voting for Trump.
[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:52.180]  Yeah, because the jail you're in is mainly black prisoners and black guards, right?
[02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:54.180]  That is correct. Yep.
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:56.180]  And they're awake now.
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:21:03.180]  Yep. Oh, they're awake. They're awake. They see what's happening and, yeah, they don't want anything to do with the Democrat Party no more.
[02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:07.180]  It's a refreshing thing to see. At least, like, some good comes out of this situation to be something like that.
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:12.180]  Zach, talk to us again. You're not forgotten. We love you. We know you're innocent, and God bless you, sir.
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:15.180]  Thank you for using Global Tell Link.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:21.180]  There he goes into the black hole. Man, I tell you, it's sick, folks. It didn't touch anybody, didn't attack anybody.
[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:25.180]  Fifteen years, federal pen.
[02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:31.180]  I'm not going to tell you about what happened to me today. I'm not going to make myself the center of this, but it was a lot of fun.
[02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:34.180]  A lot of fun.
[02:21:34.180 --> 02:21:42.180]  Man, I tell you, all these people in the establishment think they can do all this. They want repercussions. It's not even us that will come after them.
[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:53.180]  It's that when you pull stuff like this, it destroys any semblance of social safety net, of restraint.
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:22:04.180]  You turn us on to barbarians, well, you leftists aren't that tough, and you're entering a world that's not your playground.
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:15.180]  And I'm not trying to act tough, but let me just tell you right now, if I was an evil person, I would target leftists because they're so weak and stupid and gullible.
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:25.180]  I'd not go around in some conservative area and start fights with Christians, because Christians are real nice till they're not.
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:29.180]  Till they're not.
[02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:35.180]  And that's all part of the plan, the Rothschilds, the Glovels that are going to set off shore where we all kill each other and there's no point.
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:44.180]  Stop killing each other, stop engaging in crime, stop buying into the system, stop taking all the drugs and get close to Christ.
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:51.180]  I'm waiting for Ethan Nordin. By the way, pull up Ethan Nordin's famous knockouts, the Antifa.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:57.180]  When they attack him with a metal baton, he's just boom, like Mike Tyson sledgehammers.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:07.180]  And boy, they didn't like the idea of the Antifa burning things down and killing innocent citizens and cops and burning down black neighborhoods that people would stand against them, didn't attack them, let them attack them.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:23.180]  But boy, once the Antifa attacked all those college professors in black, it was just like one Proud Boy would take out like ten of those methods, politically, physically, in a fight.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:31.180]  And that's just who they are, the scum of the earth, and that's who we are, just regular people.
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:35.180]  Here we go, look at this. Try to hit him with a metal baton.
[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:41.180]  There's a whole bunch of these videos, but that's just one of them where the guy hits him, he grabs the baton and hits him.
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:46.180]  And so, that's the old days right there, folks.
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:59.180]  They attacked a bunch of women and children at a prayer rally, a thousand plus Antifa to sit on like a hundred Proud Boys, and the Proud Boys just literally like cleaned their clocks.
[02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:05.180]  And that's what the left said, no, declare them terrorists, they're the enemy, they're fighting back when we attack them.
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:11.180]  Ethan Nordine again. This is why he's spending a decade plus in prison.
[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:14.180]  There's stuff like this.
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:21.180]  And that's what they're scared of, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:28.180]  They are so scared of us not handing our children over to them and bending over and sticking our butts up in the air for them.
[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:39.180]  Ethan Nordine is set to call in as soon as he's able to get through. We'll get him on the broadcast.
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:56.180]  Look at this headline. Homeland Security awards 20 million, that means the ADL dead, to police, mental health networks, universities, churches, schools, districts to help identify Americans as potential extremists.
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:25:01.180]  That's the official government funding operation. Overhead shot, please.
[02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:09.710]  You're being listed for your views as a terrorist and they're passing laws in a whole bunch
[02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:14.090]  of states. They already passed with several that if your five-year-old comes home and
[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:18.070]  says, daddy, I'm not a boy anymore. I'm a girl. My teacher told me, and she told me you're
[02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:23.330]  bad and I can't be a girl. And you say, son, you're not a girl. They snatch your
[02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:27.570]  son and put him in a government home and they cut his pecker off when he's seven
[02:25:27.570 --> 02:25:32.010]  years old. Now that isn't a sick death cult. I don't know what it is. And they think we
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:39.290]  need to be lobotomized. I had a leftist operative. I'm going to say who just today. Tell me I'd
[02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:46.330]  love to see you lobotomized. So I put the floor on the waters. Why is a GMO? Exactly.
[02:25:46.330 --> 02:25:53.270]  You want to see me lobotomized the cerebral cortex, my brain cut so that I can't think
[02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:58.670]  and respond to you. That's why you teach two plus two equals five. They've been lobotomizing
[02:25:58.670 --> 02:26:03.070]  our children and they love it because they have a vision for the world and have a right
[02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:11.030]  to rule. And you're supposed to crawl in a ditch and die. You're supposed to just
[02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:21.990]  shut up and give them full control now, now, now, now. Well, is that your lot in life?
[02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:30.430]  Is Bill Gates right? You're a piece of trash. I hope that Ethan Nordin is able to get in,
[02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:35.350]  met him a couple of times, shook his hand, but we'll see what happens. We got to go
[02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:40.190]  to break here in a moment. These are local breaks. We can't skip those local station
[02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:45.190]  or advertisers. He's here, but we got to go to break regardless of three minutes
[02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:49.670]  and he's got to hold over and he can call back if he can. Well, Ethan Nordin,
[02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:56.510]  we're about two minutes from break. Start and we'll come back to you. Go ahead, sir.
[02:26:56.510 --> 02:27:02.950]  Okay. My name is Ethan Nordin. I'm one of the Proud Boy leaders. I was just
[02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:10.590]  sentenced to 18 years in prison, essentially for touching a fence and walking into the
[02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:15.590]  Capitol building and walking out. Was there anything that you guys wanted to ask?
[02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:18.590]  Well, we're going to break in two minutes. That'll cut your time. You can call back
[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:21.590]  in after that, but whatever you want to get out there, brother. We know you're innocent,
[02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:23.710]  but what do you want to say about being in this gulag?
[02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:29.350]  Well, you know, we're in the gulag right now and it's pretty frustrating. They're
[02:27:29.350 --> 02:27:33.710]  starting the COVID stuff again, which is taking all of our civil rights, our visits,
[02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:38.630]  our rec, everything. So it seems like they're kicking that up again, I'm assuming,
[02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:45.510]  for this whole election coming up so they can do the drop in mail-in ballots again.
[02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:51.870]  So, you know, that's how it is here in DC. But other than that, I think I'll just wait
[02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:57.070]  till after the break to fill you guys in. All right, let's talk about this. And call back
[02:27:57.070 --> 02:28:00.070]  in if you're able to right after this. We only have like eight minutes until we come back.
[02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:03.990]  But you're going to appeal this. You're going to fight this. We're all Ethan Nordin.
[02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:10.110]  Gibsongo.com forward slash support Ethan Nordin. You need support, don't you?
[02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:16.510]  Absolutely. Yeah, that's the biggest fight ahead is financial. Unfortunately, you know,
[02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:20.470]  this appeals thing is huge, not just for us, but for everybody fighting these cases. And
[02:28:20.470 --> 02:28:24.990]  for all Americans, really, we need to destroy the narrative. We need to destroy this,
[02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:30.590]  these accusations, because they're coming after everybody, honestly. So, you know,
[02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:33.470]  we're really fighting this hard. We don't care what you throw at us. We're just going
[02:28:33.470 --> 02:28:36.990]  to keep going. Stay there. And I want to say to the listeners, you hear us
[02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:41.110]  desperately calling for aid for all these people every day now. We're the men on the front line.
[02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:45.270]  We're the women on the front line. We're loyal Americans, loyal humans to God. And we are
[02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:51.870]  being persecuted hard. And because they're coming for everybody. So think about who
[02:28:51.870 --> 02:28:55.430]  you're going to support right now. Whatever you do, spread the word. We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.430 --> 02:29:00.430]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in
[02:29:00.430 --> 02:29:05.790]  this morning. It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll. Body's ultimate memory formula.

[02:32:56.470 --> 02:33:05.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.470 --> 02:33:19.470]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.470 --> 02:33:25.470]  Well, we are living in spectacular times of tyranny.
[02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:30.470]  We are living during the transhumanist, satanic New World Order take-off.
[02:33:30.470 --> 02:33:34.470]  Ethan Ordine hung up some call back in, hopefully he can.
[02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:40.470]  From federal prison, decades in jail, didn't touch a single person.
[02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:46.470]  But for his thought crimes, he is a bad person.
[02:33:46.470 --> 02:33:48.470]  And it's only going to get more intense.
[02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:51.470]  Here's what Vladimir Putin had to say, and I'm not saying Putin's perfect,
[02:33:51.470 --> 02:33:55.470]  but we can't criticize Russia anymore where they claim Russia does stuff like this,
[02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:58.470]  and Russia has had less of a legal system than us.
[02:33:58.470 --> 02:34:01.470]  But now, in many ways, if you're a Christian conservative,
[02:34:01.470 --> 02:34:04.470]  you're way safer in Russia than you are here, that's a fact.
[02:34:04.470 --> 02:34:06.470]  Now, let's play Club 4.
[02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:16.470]  Do this, I meant to tell you, sorry, it's my fault.
[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:18.470]  Start it over and pause it during each part.
[02:34:18.470 --> 02:34:22.470]  It's a short clip, I'm going to read what he had to say, go ahead.
[02:34:22.470 --> 02:34:24.470]  Here's Putin.
[02:34:24.470 --> 02:34:35.470]  As for the prosecution of Trump, for us, what is happening in today's conditions,
[02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:38.470]  in my opinion, is good.
[02:34:38.470 --> 02:34:45.470]  Why? Because it shows the rottenness of the American political system,
[02:34:45.470 --> 02:34:53.470]  which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy.
[02:34:54.470 --> 02:35:02.470]  Everything that is happening with Trump is the persecution of a political rival
[02:35:02.470 --> 02:35:08.470]  for political reasons, that's what it is.
[02:35:08.470 --> 02:35:14.470]  And that is being done in front of the world,
[02:35:14.470 --> 02:35:17.470]  the U.S. public and the whole world,
[02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:21.470]  they're simply exposing their internal problems.
[02:35:21.470 --> 02:35:30.470]  And that's true, you can't disagree with that statement.
[02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:35.470]  And now the U.S. government's given heavy, that means big,
[02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:41.470]  explosive thousand, two thousand pound cruise missiles
[02:35:41.470 --> 02:35:50.470]  that are directed on U.S. systems, satellites, GPS to attack Russian sites,
[02:35:50.470 --> 02:35:53.470]  and it's true that the U.S. legal system is rotten.
[02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:56.470]  Now they say you're a traitor if you say you have a rotten system.
[02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:58.470]  Oh, Putin says that.
[02:35:58.470 --> 02:35:59.470]  It doesn't matter what Putin says.
[02:35:59.470 --> 02:36:03.470]  If Putin sees a rotten apple on the ground, it's a rotten apple.
[02:36:03.470 --> 02:36:05.470]  If you see a rotten apple, it's a rotten apple.
[02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:08.470]  Our country is overrun, our country is controlled,
[02:36:08.470 --> 02:36:11.470]  our country is rotten by a bunch of lawyers
[02:36:11.470 --> 02:36:14.470]  that are so used to screwing everybody
[02:36:14.470 --> 02:36:17.470]  and so used to engaging in all these crimes
[02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:21.470]  that they think they're invincible.
[02:36:21.470 --> 02:36:23.470]  They think they can go on forever.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:27.600]  And just do whatever they want.
[02:36:27.730 --> 02:36:34.289]  While we're waiting for Ethan or Dean to get through, I hope he can. Here's Senator
[02:36:34.289 --> 02:36:41.650]  Kennedy reads passages from pornographic books, gender queer. This is one that teaches pedophilia
[02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:45.490]  and all boys are blue. You do this at city council, you get arrested anywhere in the
[02:36:45.490 --> 02:36:50.570]  country, but it's given to small children. That's allowed. Just don't read it in public
[02:36:50.570 --> 02:36:54.990]  for adults. You're not allowed to know what's happening. Here it is.
[02:36:54.990 --> 02:37:11.510]  Let's take two books that have been much discussed. The first one is called All Boys Aren't Blue.
[02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:20.310]  And I will quote from it. I put some lube on and got him on his knees and I began to
[02:37:20.310 --> 02:37:29.869]  slide into him from behind. I pulled out of him and kissed him while he masturbated. He
[02:37:29.869 --> 02:37:38.670]  asked me to turn over while he slipped a condom on himself. This was my ass and I was struggling
[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:47.910]  to imagine someone inside me. He got on top and slowly inserted himself into me. It was
[02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:55.189]  the worst pain I think I have ever felt in my life. Eventually I felt a mix of pleasure
[02:37:55.189 --> 02:38:06.670]  with the pain. All Boys Aren't Blue. The second is another much discussed book. I'm
[02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:12.869]  sure you're familiar with it. It's called Gender Queer. Let me read an excerpt from
[02:38:12.869 --> 02:38:24.630]  that. Quote, I got a new strap on harness today. I can't wait to put it on you. It will
[02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:32.270]  fit my favorite dildo perfectly. You're going to look so hot. I can't wait to have your
[02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:39.029]  cock in my mouth. I'm going to give you the blowjob of your life. Then I want you
[02:38:39.029 --> 02:38:54.109]  inside of me. End quote. Now, Mr. Secretary, what are you asking us to do? Are you suggesting
[02:38:54.109 --> 02:39:05.470]  that only librarians should decide whether the two books that I just referenced should
[02:39:05.470 --> 02:39:12.430]  be available to kids? Is that what you're saying? No. Okay, tell me what you're saying.
[02:39:12.430 --> 02:39:18.869]  Well, first of all, there's this- Don't give me a speech. Tell me what you're asking me to do.
[02:39:18.869 --> 02:39:23.510]  With all due respect, Senator, the words you spoke are disturbing, especially coming out of
[02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:29.189]  your mouth is very disturbing. But I would also tell you that we're not advocating for kids
[02:39:29.189 --> 02:39:33.789]  to report to Senator Booker's point. What are you advocating for? We are advocating for
[02:39:33.789 --> 02:39:42.150]  parents, random parents, not to have the ability under the guise of keeping kids safe to try and
[02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:48.150]  challenge the world view of every single manner on these issues. You're getting conceptual game.
[02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:53.390]  I'm not getting conceptual. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Because I want to know what
[02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:58.550]  you're recommending. It sounds to me like what- So that's the Secretary of Education defending,
[02:39:58.550 --> 02:40:01.390]  and by the way, that's nothing. I've seen both those books. We shot them on air.
[02:40:01.390 --> 02:40:07.150]  And stations got threatened to take us off. We showed them a seat down, Senate's covering,
[02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:11.430]  you're not going to stop us getting it out. It teaches kids to have sex with adults and get
[02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:16.350]  kidnapped. And you just heard them, we're not going to let parents, you heard Secretary of
[02:40:16.350 --> 02:40:21.430]  Education, we're not going to let parents dictate what's in these schools. We're not banning
[02:40:21.430 --> 02:40:25.350]  books. We're saying you don't give middle schoolers those two books are in schools
[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:31.430]  everywhere, including Austin, where I live. My own reporter lives here and went and found it.
[02:40:31.430 --> 02:40:34.830]  All right, Ethan Norton Dean, you've got about 12 minutes left. You just got in,
[02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:39.390]  back on another call. Political prisoner, if you were promoting pedophilia, you'd be just fine
[02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:44.550]  with these people. Talk about January 6th, Ray Epps, where you are, the show trial. This is
[02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:48.630]  your chance to talk to folks. Political prisoner, sent us to more than a decade in prison for
[02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:55.270]  not doing anything. Right. Yeah, you know, there's a lot that people don't know about
[02:40:55.270 --> 02:41:01.029]  when it comes to January 6. It's, it's one of those situations where, you know,
[02:41:01.029 --> 02:41:06.510]  the more evidence, the more video footage, the better in that unlike, you know, a lot of other
[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:10.510]  federal cases out there, usually you don't want a whole lot of evidence in this case,
[02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:17.670]  you want as much as possible. You know, the more video footage we found, we started to see
[02:41:17.710 --> 02:41:21.750]  a lot of questionable individuals doing questionable things. And it seemed like every
[02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:26.470]  time you'd see one of these individuals in a video that the government would show,
[02:41:26.470 --> 02:41:30.869]  they'd mute the video. So you couldn't hear what these individuals are saying. So those are
[02:41:30.869 --> 02:41:34.869]  some red flags that I started to notice. And this was, you know, it would have been nice
[02:41:34.869 --> 02:41:40.270]  if we had some time to actually look through our evidence and our discovery, so that we could
[02:41:40.270 --> 02:41:46.270]  properly combat, you know, the allegations. But literally, as we were going through trial,
[02:41:46.390 --> 02:41:50.630]  that was when we were allowed to look at our discovery. So, you know, nearly the two years
[02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:58.390]  prior, we were not able to look at our discovery view any videos. So I mean, as far as justice,
[02:41:58.390 --> 02:42:04.590]  as far as fairness goes, there was absolutely no sense of that whatsoever in our in our trial,
[02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:09.230]  from jury selection through the whole process, what we are allowed to bring in,
[02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:15.710]  what we used against us, it was just completely biased, unfair character assassination the entire
[02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:23.750]  time. You know, one of the things that really frustrated me was every time I felt like we got
[02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:30.830]  close to kind of, you know, I guess pinning the the FBI or the DOJ in a corner, you know,
[02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:36.029]  hey, here they are getting caught lying. Well, then we'd have to steal the courtroom. And we
[02:42:36.029 --> 02:42:40.710]  weren't allowed to talk about what we had found and what we were witnessing in the conversations
[02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:47.189]  that were being had between the FBI and the DOJ. Things that were extremely troubling, the fact
[02:42:47.189 --> 02:42:52.789]  that they were looking at our attorney client privilege conversations and strategizing on those,
[02:42:52.789 --> 02:42:59.910]  on that information. I mean, it was just in every sense of the word unfair. But not just
[02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:03.470]  unfair, but immoral, you know, just what they were kind of talking about how they were
[02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:08.070]  strategizing, kind of rubbing their hands together, like a bunch of greedy car salesmen,
[02:43:08.430 --> 02:43:15.109]  just trying to get a sale, you know, you can kind of you can feel it in in there, you know, and how
[02:43:15.109 --> 02:43:20.710]  they come across that they know that, that we're innocent, they know that this isn't true. But
[02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:25.510]  they're pushing the narrative anyway, and they're and they're exaggerating everything and, and
[02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:31.710]  being overdramatic about everything to, you know, a fake tear here. And it's just so
[02:43:31.710 --> 02:43:39.310]  disingenuous and disgusting. And it's odd, because what's funny, right after our conviction, my lawyer
[02:43:39.310 --> 02:43:44.670]  actually got some phone calls from federal prosecutors from other states, saying that they
[02:43:44.670 --> 02:43:52.189]  have they had lost faith in the justice system. I have never in all my years ever heard of
[02:43:52.189 --> 02:44:00.270]  federal prosecutors, basically railing on their own for, you know, a fail, a failure, a failure of
[02:44:00.270 --> 02:44:06.350]  justice being done. You know, you're not going to hear that story very often in feds. And so the
[02:44:06.350 --> 02:44:11.510]  fact that, you know, several prosecutors, federal prosecutors from other states outside of DC, were
[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:17.910]  looking at the situation and apologizing to my lawyer for this representation of justice, you
[02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:24.430]  know, pretty much speaks for itself. DC is a cesspool. I mean, there's just no way around
[02:44:24.430 --> 02:44:29.070]  it. They're all in it together. There's no fairness from the juror all the way up to the
[02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:35.910]  very tippity top. In DC, it is corrupt. It needs to be yanked out from its roots. There's no there's
[02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:41.029]  no voting it out. You need to you need to get the whole thing and just clear the whole thing
[02:44:41.029 --> 02:44:41.750]  out. That's
[02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:45.710]  Well, Ethan, I had dinner with you once in Austin when you guys came and visited with my
[02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:50.830]  wife. I remember barely talking to you at some of the rallies DC before. We're like, Hey,
[02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:54.550]  we're glad he was not attacking. We'll keep things peaceful. You guys are conservatives.
[02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:59.590]  You're not about attacking offensively. And then I think what you're saying is true. We know
[02:44:59.590 --> 02:45:03.670]  it. The world sees it. People say, is Elon Musk real? Look how they're coming after him.
[02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:09.310]  No, he's come to our side. Look at RFK Jr. Look at everybody. There is a giant awakening
[02:45:09.390 --> 02:45:14.990]  happening right now. And if we are able to take the government back, you will be freed. If not,
[02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:17.590]  we're all enslaved. So the calvary is coming, brother.
[02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:24.789]  Absolutely. You know, we have we have a lot of stuff. We have some websites out there 1776
[02:45:24.789 --> 02:45:29.869]  returns.com. That's got a lot of our stories on there, and written articles from genuine
[02:45:29.869 --> 02:45:35.270]  people. And, you know, it's interesting that you brought that up. But I mean, people start
[02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:39.189]  out going to these rallies for the, you know, just trying to protect people, or they're just
[02:45:39.189 --> 02:45:43.029]  trying to get their voice out. And they, they end up in the situation we're in, you know, I
[02:45:43.109 --> 02:45:48.590]  know, Owen just got sentenced, a crazy 60 day sentence, and he's, and he's literally the
[02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:54.830]  press. I couldn't, I couldn't believe that. So there's just all sorts of issues that are going
[02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:59.430]  on that people don't really realize. And I think that once we really start to get to get
[02:45:59.430 --> 02:46:05.590]  together and put our stories together, you know, it becomes really powerful. And so that's what
[02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:09.590]  we're trying to do, you know, just get the truth out there. I think a lot of people just
[02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:14.949]  share the Proud Boy name, and they kind of assume the worst, just because the reputation that
[02:46:14.949 --> 02:46:20.550]  people have given us. So once they really start to look at the case, I mean, you know, even even
[02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:26.350]  BLM, we have BLM leaders out here protesting for us now, which I feel like hell is frozen
[02:46:26.350 --> 02:46:31.710]  over now, if that's the case. But I mean, it's crazy that our persecution is is really
[02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:32.949]  bringing the people together.
[02:46:34.830 --> 02:46:39.029]  And the left got so mad when Antifa tried to hit you with a metal club, which was a deadly
[02:46:39.029 --> 02:46:42.590]  weapon could have killed you, that you defend themselves. They said then we want Ethan
[02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:45.789]  Nordin. They have your family, your family business, everything then.
[02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:55.710]  Yeah, the government loved using this quote unquote culture of violence. If you're an
[02:46:55.710 --> 02:47:00.830]  individual that stands up for yourself, that protects old ladies in the street, that walks
[02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:04.910]  them back to their cars after they were violently attacked by Antifa and the militant
[02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:10.150]  left, you will be labeled by the government as an extremist, and that you're perpetuating a
[02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:16.990]  culture of violence, just so you know. And it's, it's laughable at best, because, you know,
[02:47:16.990 --> 02:47:22.070]  I've never I have no criminal record. Like you were saying, I'm not a I'm not into
[02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:27.869]  political violence. I just I'm I'm kind of attacking women and swinging a metal baton at
[02:47:27.869 --> 02:47:32.109]  your head that you duck like an action movie. And then you knock his ass out. They
[02:47:32.109 --> 02:47:33.390]  literally call that terrorism.
[02:47:34.350 --> 02:47:40.189]  Yeah, exactly. You know, that's, that's violence. But when the government does it,
[02:47:40.189 --> 02:47:43.949]  it's, you know, that's what their that's what the job is. It's not our job to protect
[02:47:43.949 --> 02:47:47.550]  ourselves. It's theirs, apparently. But they don't do a very good job of doing it.
[02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:52.430]  Well, the time we have left, you've got the floor, how do people support you? What's
[02:47:52.430 --> 02:47:54.590]  it like in there? Where do you think you're going? How's your family doing?
[02:47:56.350 --> 02:48:00.590]  You know, this has been a huge struggle for my family. It's been just absolutely torture.
[02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:04.990]  I mean, this isn't like normal prison. We've been, you know, drug through the jails during
[02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:09.310]  COVID. And now they're trying to start it back up. We're hoping we can get out of here
[02:48:09.310 --> 02:48:13.550]  soon. We've already been sentenced and get to the DOP get out from under the thumb
[02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:17.310]  of the prosecution so that we can actually start, you know, living our lives a little
[02:48:17.310 --> 02:48:22.990]  bit. If people want to support me, that'd be greatly appreciated. Give send go.com
[02:48:22.990 --> 02:48:28.750]  forward slash support Ethan Nordine. We have a huge battle ahead financially. And
[02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:33.230]  obviously, you know, I have 18 years, so hopefully, hopefully Trump gets back in office.
[02:48:33.789 --> 02:48:35.789]  And I don't have to see that, you know?
[02:48:36.750 --> 02:48:39.550]  Well, how dare you not burn down buildings out there when a guy,
[02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:42.750]  because he tried to hit somebody in the neck with one of those thin batons that can sever
[02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:46.990]  the carotid artery and kill somebody easily. How dare you not just let him murder you
[02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:50.830]  so the Soros DA can let you out, let him out of jail?
[02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:56.189]  Yeah, well, you can call me stubborn, I guess, or old fashioned.
[02:48:56.510 --> 02:49:00.189]  Why don't you just say you're a woman? You can be sent to a woman's prison.
[02:49:02.350 --> 02:49:07.150]  Well, I've seen some of the quote unquote women here, and I'm not too thrilled. So
[02:49:07.150 --> 02:49:10.590]  I think I'm going to stick with the guys. How's your family doing?
[02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:16.590]  You know, they're getting by. It's been tough, you know, when you hear that your,
[02:49:16.590 --> 02:49:22.830]  you know, your son has been sentenced to 18 years for doing absolutely nothing. It's,
[02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:28.510]  you know, it can take a toll. So I'm doing what I can to keep them staying positive, you know,
[02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:33.789]  and don't look at this like it's real. It's not real. It's just make-believe. This is pretend.
[02:49:33.789 --> 02:49:38.270]  This is kangaroo court. So we're going to keep fighting until somebody has some,
[02:49:38.270 --> 02:49:40.910]  you know, some wherewithal to do something about it.
[02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:45.789]  And like, how are you doing with your lady? I remember reading she was there to support you.
[02:49:47.789 --> 02:49:51.869]  Yeah, you know, she's still at home fighting. I mean, she lost her job
[02:49:51.869 --> 02:49:56.910]  because of this whole thing. It's just, I mean, it's just like it was the second we stepped into
[02:49:56.910 --> 02:50:03.710]  the political arena, just just never it never ending attacks you and your family, no matter
[02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:08.910]  what you try and say or do. So they're hanging in there and adjusting the best they can.
[02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:13.310]  Gibson go dot com for less support, Ethan,
[02:50:13.310 --> 02:50:17.230]  more Dean and all the other sites won't let you guys do fundraisers just like we have
[02:50:17.230 --> 02:50:21.949]  defendjones.com defenddellen.com. I mean, it's a real war. We're here fighting.
[02:50:21.949 --> 02:50:24.830]  I hope the listeners realize they get through us. They're getting you. What
[02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:27.789]  do you make of all the indictments of President Trump and how strong he is?
[02:50:30.189 --> 02:50:37.789]  You know, I, I just applaud President Trump for continuing to keep his demeanor and keep that
[02:50:37.789 --> 02:50:41.710]  kind of gangster attitude. You know, I've never had more respect for him than I do now
[02:50:41.710 --> 02:50:46.109]  because I know how it feels, you know, obviously, you know, all the boys at the
[02:50:46.109 --> 02:50:50.670]  gulag. They want to salute him. They want to salute you as well, Alex, for staying in the
[02:50:50.670 --> 02:50:54.990]  fight. We, you know, we all know what the price, you know, what it costs to be in this thing.
[02:50:56.109 --> 02:50:58.590]  And obviously President Trump, he's going through it.
[02:50:58.590 --> 02:51:02.670]  Well, I want to put myself in the position you're in, but they're even today literally trying
[02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:08.109]  to put me in jail. And I know they're throwing there for a while, but now they're moving on
[02:51:08.109 --> 02:51:12.270]  to the journalists, which shows that they're insatiable because they know the people
[02:51:12.270 --> 02:51:17.869]  turn against them. Yeah, I was, again, I was surprised to hear the sentence that was given
[02:51:17.869 --> 02:51:23.150]  down to Owen. You know, I mean, obviously he was there, but you know, he had the protection of
[02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:27.470]  being a member of the press, even though they want to claim that, oh, he was banned from
[02:51:27.470 --> 02:51:32.270]  DC, whatever. You know, I would think at the very least that the press should have that
[02:51:32.270 --> 02:51:37.550]  past to be in a chaotic environment, no matter what the case to document properly what happened.
[02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:41.869]  But obviously they don't want that. They want to, they want to limit what people know and
[02:51:41.869 --> 02:51:46.910]  limit what people see of what happened on January 6th. So I'm surprised, but I'm not,
[02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:50.910]  you know, at the same time, but it's, it's pretty heartbreaking to see that not even the press
[02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:55.869]  can get a pass, you know, in these types of events. Well, I got to say this, Ethan,
[02:51:55.869 --> 02:52:02.350]  I am blown away by Joe Biggs and Enrique Tarrio and you and others, how strong you are.
[02:52:02.350 --> 02:52:05.710]  Cause I knew you before you were strong, but you seem stronger now.
[02:52:05.710 --> 02:52:12.510]  Absolutely. You know, just hard times makes hard men, you know, and I think honestly,
[02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:18.510]  at the end of the day, as much as this has been horrible and it's been trying, it's necessary.
[02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:24.189]  You know, men need to step up to the plate more than ever. We need leadership. We need,
[02:52:24.189 --> 02:52:29.789]  we need guys who can take on, you know, this tribulation and be headstrong and,
[02:52:29.789 --> 02:52:33.630]  and focus on God and focus on this country and what this country is founded on and,
[02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:37.789]  and just kind of let go of everything else. I think that's, that's what's needed more than ever.
[02:52:37.789 --> 02:52:42.270]  Well, in closing, I forget your whole story, but I know you're just there working in a family
[02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:47.150]  company. I think it was a restaurant. The point is, and you see Antifa all over Portland,
[02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:50.590]  just beating up men, women, and children. So you just went out there to protect them.
[02:52:50.590 --> 02:52:55.470]  And then now you're in prison. Yeah. You know, that's pretty much
[02:52:55.470 --> 02:53:00.270]  the long story short right there. Yeah. I saw what was happening. I went out to Seattle
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:04.910]  on May day. I got involved with the Proud Boys. We started going all over the West Coast and
[02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:09.230]  obviously Portland, you know, I came to kind of name, created a name for myself.
[02:53:10.590 --> 02:53:15.550]  These, these people are not passive people. They're not political individuals. They are
[02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:21.470]  violent. They're militant and they're malicious. They don't have rules or morals.
[02:53:21.470 --> 02:53:27.470]  You have one minute remaining. They'll attack women, children, grandma,
[02:53:27.470 --> 02:53:32.670]  it doesn't matter. And so, you know, if you're, you call yourself a real man, you see that
[02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:38.110]  happening. You're kind of faced with a decision and I believe I made the right one. 30 seconds
[02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:43.310]  left. I just want to say thank everybody for continuing to support us. I want to thank you,
[02:53:43.310 --> 02:53:47.949]  Alex Jones, continuing to fight this battle. Obviously I want to shout out to President Trump.
[02:53:47.949 --> 02:53:51.310]  You know, you're the number one gangster, man. Everybody loves you. All the boys here in
[02:53:51.310 --> 02:53:57.150]  the Gulag, we support you and we salute you. All the Infowars family, we love you guys.
[02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:59.150]  We're going to continue to fight this battle. Thank you.
[02:53:59.710 --> 02:54:02.990]  Thank you, Ethan. Again, I would have had all you guys on earlier. Your lawyers all didn't
[02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:06.189]  want to stir up the court. And so that's why we didn't have you on during this,
[02:54:06.189 --> 02:54:09.470]  but now we'll have you on a lot. As much as we can talk to you, give us updates.
[02:54:09.470 --> 02:54:13.869]  We love you so much. Gibsongo.com. Support Ethan or Dean. Godspeed,
[02:54:13.869 --> 02:54:17.869]  brother. We're with you. Thank you, Alex. Take care. God bless.
[02:54:19.230 --> 02:54:21.070]  All right. There he goes.
[02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:25.390]  Whew. Man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:54:27.789 --> 02:54:31.710]  Massive cruise missile attacks last night, hit the Russian fleet, sunk amongst their ships.
[02:54:32.270 --> 02:54:38.750]  They're going to respond. I'm tough folks, but I don't travel to Europe
[02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:40.910]  and take over Russian territories, start bombing them.
[02:54:43.470 --> 02:54:50.110]  These aren't Iraqis that just got AK-47s. They got submarines, they got cruise missiles,
[02:54:50.189 --> 02:54:52.750]  they got nuclear bombers, they got bioweapons.
[02:54:55.230 --> 02:55:02.110]  And look at Napoleon, look at Hitler. The Russians don't give up, folks. So
[02:55:05.230 --> 02:55:09.150]  I really blame the people that have done this in our government and our corporations,
[02:55:09.150 --> 02:55:14.430]  the lawyers, the politicians, the old families that think they're disconnected from this.
[02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:18.590]  You can't start a fight like this to survive. They're nihilistic.
[02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:23.150]  Most of these big dynasties that have trillions of dollars are totally inbred.
[02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:26.990]  I know a lot of them. It's inside baseball. I'm not going to get into it,
[02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:32.990]  but I've met with a lot of them. And they are completely divorced from their humanity,
[02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:40.349]  like the Metzger's up in Illinois. And they got death written all over them for us.
[02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:46.910]  They got failure written all over them for us. They got evil written all over them for us.
[02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:52.270]  All right. I was not here yesterday and today in the first few hours of show because
[02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:57.310]  they wanted to split my deposition in these show trials and the stuff coming up.
[02:55:58.110 --> 02:56:01.310]  Imagine Trump. I mean, I've got like four or five lawsuits
[02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:05.070]  and them trying to put me in jail with some criminal stuff they're trying.
[02:56:05.789 --> 02:56:11.630]  It's literally on a scale of one to a hundred of five. Trump's a hundred.
[02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:20.830]  And that's why I sit here and say, where are the benefactors? I know the average public
[02:56:20.830 --> 02:56:28.670]  gives us $10, $100. Thank you. Defendjones.com. Go to mfoolworthstore.com. You get great
[02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:33.070]  products like the body's ultimate turmeric formula and finally back in stock and DNA Force
[02:56:33.070 --> 02:56:37.550]  Plus. So incredible for your cells, your blood, your whole body. I think Nitrate Boost is great.
[02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:40.910]  It's amazing. You need DNA Force Plus. It does the same thing and more.
[02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:46.189]  That keeps free speech on the air. But if I told you the treachery going on and just how nasty
[02:56:46.189 --> 02:56:51.150]  stuff is, it would take the whole show over and you don't tune in for that. But I believe in God
[02:56:51.150 --> 02:56:55.070]  and I believe God will hold us in place with the gravity of his spirit.
[02:56:55.789 --> 02:56:59.150]  And I asked God humbly to keep me in the fight, but who knows? I've been in this fight
[02:56:59.150 --> 02:57:03.789]  29 years. Any day now they can clap me in irons or kill me because we're winning.
[02:57:05.470 --> 02:57:10.189]  And at a sick level and I don't want to die and not see my family. I'll never commit suicide.
[02:57:10.990 --> 02:57:16.590]  I do see the vision of I win if I keep fighting and if God lets me keep living,
[02:57:17.390 --> 02:57:20.990]  I respectfully ask God for that. I don't usually pray for things, but I would ask to
[02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:26.590]  stay here with my family now and I would ask people to continue on. But if it is God's will
[02:57:26.590 --> 02:57:31.390]  that I'll be killed or imprisoned, I will not blame God because it will wake a lot of people
[02:57:31.390 --> 02:57:38.270]  up. Our enemies are breaking all the rules because they're desperate and they know humanity is
[02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:43.630]  awaiting. Our number four, Owen Shoyer just arrived. He just got here. He's coming in the
[02:57:43.630 --> 02:57:48.910]  studio. Stay with us. Bodies is back. The ultimate

[02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:55.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:06.420]  It's called the great reset, tough guy. It's called the New World Order. It's called the
[03:00:06.420 --> 03:00:11.440]  big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat
[03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:15.660]  money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and the universal basic
[03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:20.340]  income. That's everything. That's the whole future of our lives. The whole world is
[03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:24.660]  going to be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything
[03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:28.900]  you do. It's all being officially announced. We have articles everywhere, their press releases
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:36.780]  saying, and then the crew asked me during the break, they go, are you all right? It really
[03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:42.500]  seemed to upset you. Are you feeling okay? They're going to starve a couple hundred million
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:47.660]  people to death. Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out. This is real. This is not, this is
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:01:10.660]  not a freaking game to me, man. They're dying right now. Because God tells us to get up
[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:19.140]  and take action. And then we don't do anything. And that paralyzes God. Yeah, God can do
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:24.740]  it. But God needs us to do it because God's not free will. Once again, not for
[03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:29.460]  the first time what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true.
[03:01:29.460 --> 03:01:33.460]  Yeah, I'm upset. I'm really, I told you last night, I said, what's wrong with you?
[03:01:33.460 --> 03:01:37.460]  You're really freaked out. I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out. I'm really freaked
[03:01:37.460 --> 03:01:43.140]  out. I'm really freaked out. You see, because this is real. The supply chain being cut off,
[03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:50.500]  the energy grid being cut off is real. And we're going into a time now where we're not going
[03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:54.580]  to be on the air. I mean, if we don't back this off, we don't get sane people to stop the
[03:01:54.580 --> 03:02:00.820]  bottomless coming. We'll be here in six months. You won't be here at six months.
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:15.300]  Who is the most banned news network in the world? Infowars.com. Infowars comes to mind.
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:22.020]  Infowars.com. Infowars. You watch Infowars? Infowars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:26.020]  Alex Jones. Nice guy. You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:31.060]  Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones is the greatest.
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:34.580]  He knows who Infowars is. I'm playing this joke over here. That's why the deplatforming
[03:02:34.580 --> 03:02:40.660]  didn't work. Alex has been right on for over a decade. You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:48.980]  In my first book, the great reset in the war for the world,
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:56.900]  I gave you a full analysis of the global elites international conspiracy to enslave humanity
[03:02:57.460 --> 03:03:03.140]  and all life on the planet. The great reset is a planned attempt to redistribute all the
[03:03:03.140 --> 03:03:09.540]  world's wealth and power into the hands of banks, corporations, millionaires, and the world
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:15.780]  economic forum. The only way this corporate fascist conspiracy can succeed is if the people
[03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:20.900]  of the world are not aware of it. For years, we've been laying out their sinister blueprint
[03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:27.220]  on Infowars. What we are witnessing is nothing less than the failed plans of social Darwinists
[03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:32.900]  to capture free market capitalism and turn it toward their fascist aims of controlling
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:38.020]  and depopulating the globe because of the tremendous success of the first book,
[03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:41.780]  which received tens of thousands of orders before it was even released.
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:45.380]  We're releasing a second book, the great awakening,
[03:03:46.020 --> 03:03:51.300]  defeating the globalists and launching the next great Renaissance. The people of the globalists
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:57.060]  fear the most are the members of their own systems of control who wake up and then decide
[03:03:57.060 --> 03:04:03.860]  to act against the machine. The globalists believe they've planned for every possible contingency
[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:09.060]  they hadn't counted on the conscience and love of truth, which lives in the souls of good
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:25.540]  people. Order the great awakening now to support Infowars and defeat the globalists.
[03:04:39.060 --> 03:05:00.180]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth,
[03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:05.700]  hands down, this is the most concentrated high quality bone broth there is. Concentrated
[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:11.460]  chicken broth, patented amazing. Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beef pollen,
[03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:17.380]  a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.

[03:05:58.260 --> 03:06:03.140]  Infowars host Owen Troyer has been sentenced to 60 days in prison.
[03:06:03.860 --> 03:06:11.620]  A couple hours ago, I was informed by my attorney that there is a warrant out for my arrest with
[03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:19.860]  allegations involving January 6th. I will have to turn myself in Monday morning.
[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:25.460]  The DOJ, the Biden administration announced is charging a host at Infowars, a man called
[03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:30.580]  Owen Troyer, with several federal crimes, including quote, entering a restricted area
[03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:34.740]  on January 6th. Well, that sounds bad. What did Owen Troyer do? He didn't go inside the
[03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:39.620]  Capitol building on January 6th. He stood on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other people.
[03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:45.540]  It was never my intention to become a free speech martyr. Yes, I am a free speech activist.
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:50.500]  Yes, I believe the reason why the first amendment is number one is because free speech
[03:06:50.500 --> 03:06:55.860]  is probably the most important thing to the foundations of having our country. But here I
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:07:03.300]  stand today, a free speech martyr. Make no mistake about it. Owen Troyer did not enter
[03:07:03.300 --> 03:07:08.020]  the Capitol building, but he did lead rioters and chants near the top of the building's steps.
[03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:14.740]  I don't want to go to jail. I don't believe I belong in jail. I would even tell you that
[03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:20.100]  I believe that this case should be done. And I've served my probation with good behavior.
[03:07:20.100 --> 03:07:24.340]  Then there's the other side of me. That's just an American citizen. I removed myself from
[03:07:24.340 --> 03:07:30.420]  the picture and it breaks my heart. It breaks my heart that future Americans may have to suffer
[03:07:30.420 --> 03:07:36.260]  through the same fate or worse. It breaks my heart that somebody, a young journalist
[03:07:36.260 --> 03:07:40.420]  coming up or a talk show is coming up is going to have to censor themselves,
[03:07:40.420 --> 03:07:46.100]  chill their free speech or be afraid. Troyer is one of two InfoWars employees arrested
[03:07:46.180 --> 03:07:50.100]  at the Capitol, but so far that has not included the founder, Alex Jones.
[03:07:57.940 --> 03:08:04.820]  And in studio at 207 central is the thought criminal, the free speech martyr,
[03:08:05.620 --> 03:08:09.460]  Owen Troyer. I don't want to, obviously you don't want to talk about yourself the whole
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:12.020]  hour. We got a lot of other news to cover and things going on, but
[03:08:12.020 --> 03:08:17.540]  it's next level to go after a journalist, have you on probation for wearing tape over your mouth
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:23.220]  a year before and defer to prosecution, you know, don't go in the Capitol. We weren't in
[03:08:23.220 --> 03:08:27.860]  the Capitol. You're there on the Capitol trying to keep people getting going in and
[03:08:27.860 --> 03:08:32.740]  now 60 days in jail. And where is the corporate press? They're celebrating this,
[03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:37.220]  Owen, like it's a good thing. Well, that's what you get in a fascist
[03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:44.020]  dictatorship, isn't it? And I think, and I, and I talked to some other people about this last night,
[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:51.540]  the timing of this is immaculate because what's happening to me has raised the alarm of many
[03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:57.300]  other journalists, many other independent media members, press members, obviously Tim
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:02.500]  Poole and his team last night. I mean, this is big and these people know who I am,
[03:09:02.500 --> 03:09:06.020]  Alex, we don't need to get into my character, but I'm a good guy. Everybody knows that I've
[03:09:06.020 --> 03:09:10.740]  got a good heart. I'm not a violent person. I've never encouraged violence ever. In fact,
[03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:15.300]  quite the opposite, but I am a journalist. And as much as the government wants to sit here and
[03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:18.260]  act like that's not the case, which is completely. Because you're not a traitor
[03:09:18.260 --> 03:09:22.020]  against the country. You're a bad guy. So this is what you get in a fascist dictatorship,
[03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:27.300]  Alex. And I think that that's the sound of the alarms going off as, as we play that
[03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:34.500]  coming into this segment, people realize, wow, they really will go after you for speech.
[03:09:34.500 --> 03:09:39.140]  They really will go after you for thought crimes. This is really where we're at in the
[03:09:39.140 --> 03:09:45.300]  United States of America. And there's one other, there's one other piece of evidence to put on
[03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:50.420]  display for this that I'm hoping we can have soon. We're of course, there's no media allowed
[03:09:50.420 --> 03:09:55.220]  in the courtroom. Nobody can record. There was one reporter there who just tried to do a sketch
[03:09:55.220 --> 03:10:00.500]  and they made this reporter rip it up and throw it out. Couldn't even do a sketch is how
[03:10:00.500 --> 03:10:05.940]  much censorship is going on in these courtrooms. We're trying to get the transcript of that
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:09.860]  proceeding yesterday released as quickly as pop. You haven't told the story yet. What happened
[03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:16.100]  in court? So, well, it was about an hour. They said in the filing for new listeners,
[03:10:16.660 --> 03:10:21.140]  he and in may still said the election stolen on his show on this date, gave it a quote.
[03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:24.340]  We want jail time because he said the election was stolen. Whether Owen's right or wrong,
[03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:28.340]  he isn't right. Which of course he's right. But man, these people got some big huevos.
[03:10:28.340 --> 03:10:32.020]  And there was a lot of misrepresentation in their filing. They misrepresented this whole,
[03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:39.460]  this whole idea that I was not remorseful after the indictment is not accurately portrayed because
[03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:45.460]  the quotes that they put in their sentencing memo all happened before the indictment. So the
[03:10:45.460 --> 03:10:49.060]  quotes that they're saying, look, Schroyer's not remorseful. All of them came before the
[03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:53.140]  indictment even happened. So, so what, what is, what is their argument really? Another
[03:10:53.140 --> 03:10:58.980]  misrepresentation was that I did not complete community service hours, which we filed the
[03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:02.500]  community service hours with the courts. So we had to submit that as evidence that that was.
[03:11:03.380 --> 03:11:06.340]  We know they lie. Oh, and so. But here's what I was getting at Alex.
[03:11:07.380 --> 03:11:11.380]  This is the strangest part that I wish people could have seen. And I don't know
[03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:16.660]  if it will be received as well with the transcription from yesterday's proceedings, but
[03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:24.100]  the court and the government, the presentation was, this is not about Schroyer's speech.
[03:11:24.100 --> 03:11:29.620]  This is not about the first amendment. And by the way, here's what Schroyer said. And that's
[03:11:29.620 --> 03:11:34.100]  why he needs jail time. I mean, I'm sitting there in the twilight zone. I'm sitting there
[03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:38.500]  in the twilight zone, listening to the, to the proceedings where they, here's where you
[03:11:38.500 --> 03:11:42.340]  get arrested. This is your original crime, wearing a tape on your mouth. That's right.
[03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:47.700]  Got arrested for a piece of tape on my mouth. When the day before, again, timing is everything here.
[03:11:47.700 --> 03:11:54.260]  The day before there were 40 anti-Trump protesters at that exact same spot in the Capitol,
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:12:00.020]  40 anti-Trump's protesters, exact same spot. They're allowed to do their little picket.
[03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:04.820]  But me with a piece of tape over my mouth gets arrested, which is funny because, okay.
[03:12:04.820 --> 03:12:06.820]  Well, it just shows people worse than the police all day.
[03:12:06.820 --> 03:12:15.220]  These guys. Well, and think about the juxtaposition the day before 40 Trump protesters allowed to do
[03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:17.860]  their thing, but one man with a piece of tape over his mouth gets arrested. Now,
[03:12:17.860 --> 03:12:23.220]  what happened yesterday? What happened this week, Alex? Oh, Owen Schroyer's speech,
[03:12:23.220 --> 03:12:26.900]  Owen Schroyer's speech, forget about even January 6th, because they cite speech from
[03:12:27.460 --> 03:12:32.500]  dozens of days. So Owen Schroyer's speech gets him arrested, but they say, oh,
[03:12:32.500 --> 03:12:37.300]  it's because of this activity. And then what happened in Congress yesterday?
[03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:42.500]  Democrats raided Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office. I forgot to say that. Guys, pull up
[03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:47.940]  Democrats break into McCarthy's office. I saw that last night. So pull up, pull up,
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:52.020]  just click news. McCarthy comes up right after he says he's gonna impeach.
[03:12:52.660 --> 03:12:57.060]  They then raid his office. So Democrats storm McCarthy's office, pull that footage up.
[03:12:57.060 --> 03:13:00.420]  And we're gonna have more of this too, just to show the double standard. It couldn't be
[03:13:00.420 --> 03:13:04.900]  more obvious. David Hogg disrupts Congress. They disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings. They
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:09.220]  had their abortion protesters disrupting. They have climate change protesters disrupting.
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:13.780]  There's their video yesterday going into Kevin McCarthy's office and disrupting.
[03:13:14.420 --> 03:13:20.100]  But Schroyer's speech, Schroyer's speech is worthy of incarceration plus probation,
[03:13:20.100 --> 03:13:24.580]  which I'm not even sure if that's legal. So the juxtaposition here in the timing is
[03:13:24.580 --> 03:13:27.380]  just unbelievable. But getting back to the courtroom yesterday, Alex,
[03:13:28.180 --> 03:13:31.380]  they're arguing, the government argues that this is not about speech.
[03:13:32.020 --> 03:13:36.260]  And then the next words out of their mouth are Owen Schroyer said. So they say-
[03:13:36.260 --> 03:13:39.780]  Sure, but that's all part of the, it's in the federal filing. So that's all part of
[03:13:39.780 --> 03:13:43.620]  the gaslighting. So what is the timeframe of you going into jail or what's gonna happen?
[03:13:44.180 --> 03:13:48.420]  So there's still a lot of nuts and bolts and there's more unknowns than knowns right now.
[03:13:49.060 --> 03:13:55.540]  Our plan is to appeal. This could be unsuccessful. If so, we want to-
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:59.220]  People can say, it's not like you ran over somebody's dog while you're drunk driving
[03:13:59.220 --> 03:14:04.580]  and you get a month in jail. We can't just have you not appeal. This is precedent setting.
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:09.860]  Absolutely. And it's a very unique situation. There's so many unique factors-
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:13.460]  By the way, I didn't just tell people four years ago we got deplatformed, you're next.
[03:14:14.340 --> 03:14:18.820]  They wrote the Wall Street Journal, we're gonna censor Julian Assange and Alex Jones.
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:21.540]  The left won't defend him, the right won't defend Jones. Once that happens,
[03:14:21.620 --> 03:14:28.180]  we'll take everybody's rights. They said it. I mean, it's a plan. This is a plan.
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:32.100]  So what happens when somebody else questions the results of an election or denies the results
[03:14:32.100 --> 03:14:36.020]  of an election on a talk show, on a sidewalk in Washington DC? Do they get arrested?
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:37.380]  Well, if you're a Democrat, you're allowed to.
[03:14:37.380 --> 03:14:42.420]  Of course. And so that's the double standard that's on display here. But we will appeal.
[03:14:42.420 --> 03:14:46.020]  And if we have to, and maybe this is what needs to happen,
[03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:51.220]  this will go to the Supreme Court. And I do believe that this is that important-
[03:14:51.380 --> 03:14:54.900]  It is. And there's a lot of other factors-
[03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:57.860]  I have a feeling the Supreme Court's gonna take this cuz this is so brazen.
[03:14:57.860 --> 03:15:00.580]  And there's a lot of different factors here too, Alex, of
[03:15:01.140 --> 03:15:09.940]  can the judge give me incarceration and probation? Can the US government take a plea deal
[03:15:09.940 --> 03:15:14.020]  and then insinuate in their sentencing memo that they're charging me or convicting me of
[03:15:14.020 --> 03:15:20.740]  something beyond what I even pled to? Can they bring up a situation or a case
[03:15:20.740 --> 03:15:26.260]  that they agreed would not be on the docket and that would be tossed from the conversation
[03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:29.940]  and to say, no, this is proof of- No, it's all total weaponized
[03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:34.100]  fraud. There are a bunch of weak lawyers that all are just empowering each other to do this.
[03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:37.860]  Well, and I'll just say this too, Alex. And maybe you and I had some philosophical
[03:15:37.860 --> 03:15:41.220]  differences over the time and that's fine cuz we both believe in free speech and this
[03:15:41.220 --> 03:15:46.660]  isn't a controlled operation. But I made sure throughout this process that I was
[03:15:46.660 --> 03:15:49.780]  always operating in good faith. I mean, to a T.
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:52.660]  That's how we disagree. To a T. Well, sometimes you were like,
[03:15:52.660 --> 03:15:55.700]  hey, maybe throw a punch here or there and maybe I'm like, hey,
[03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:58.020]  cuz I'm just gonna back off and be the good boy.
[03:15:58.020 --> 03:16:00.740]  Oh, you mean stand up to the judge? Yes, yes. And I said, no,
[03:16:00.740 --> 03:16:03.060]  I'm gonna be totally good faith. I'm not gonna talk about it.
[03:16:03.940 --> 03:16:08.900]  Whereas I call my judges tyrants and goblins. Maybe something like that. But the point
[03:16:08.980 --> 03:16:17.140]  is that was me exhibiting 100% good faith. So that when we get stabbed in the back
[03:16:17.140 --> 03:16:21.700]  and the opposite side of the table doesn't operate in good faith, we can say, see,
[03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:28.420]  there it is. There it is, right there. I operated in good faith. We held our
[03:16:28.420 --> 03:16:33.460]  side of the bargain. They did not. And so it's just more proof to me-
[03:16:33.460 --> 03:16:36.740]  We just already know they're dishonorable. At a certain point, you don't test it anymore.
[03:16:36.740 --> 03:16:40.900]  It's just, let's just keep proving it, Alex. And it needs to be proven. People need to see this.
[03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:45.860]  I think that this case has shocked the world, really. I mean, this has made international
[03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:51.060]  news. And so, of course it is, of course it is. When there's four sections in my sentencing
[03:16:51.060 --> 03:16:56.500]  memo, all pointing to my speech, all pointing to my speech. I mean, seriously, like cue
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:17:00.420]  the Twilight Zone music. They put in the sentence memo that we tried to deescalate.
[03:17:00.420 --> 03:17:05.140]  That's a quote that we tried to deescalate. So they're arguing that I amped up the crowd,
[03:17:05.140 --> 03:17:13.300]  but that I was deescalating. They also put a quote in there that I said, we are here to
[03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:18.100]  peacefully, we are here to peacefully send a message. They put that-
[03:17:18.100 --> 03:17:20.820]  And you didn't go on the Capitol. So shifting gears off, you're going to come back and take
[03:17:20.820 --> 03:17:24.980]  over the next 30 minutes. You'll host your own show, 3 p.m. Central. But you still have
[03:17:24.980 --> 03:17:29.220]  no idea when the sentencing comes or when you might be in, putting the go-log. And where
[03:17:29.220 --> 03:17:31.460]  will you be put? The same place where the roaches were all over you?
[03:17:32.180 --> 03:17:36.740]  I doubt that that's where I would go. Again, there's still more unknowns than knowns at
[03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:39.380]  this time. I mean, quite frankly- You should describe DC though. You
[03:17:39.380 --> 03:17:41.140]  said you would wake up and there's roaches all over you.
[03:17:41.140 --> 03:17:45.300]  I can't even believe that that was a legal jail cell. Yeah, I mean, I can go back into
[03:17:45.300 --> 03:17:49.300]  that, the 36 hours or whatever I spent in jail for having a piece of tape over my mouth in
[03:17:49.300 --> 03:17:54.420]  the Capitol. It was like roach motel. There was no moving air. It was like 90 degrees,
[03:17:54.420 --> 03:17:58.100]  dead roach, like thousands of dead roaches, thousands of alive roaches.
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:17:59.780]  You said roach guts everywhere.
[03:17:59.780 --> 03:18:03.460]  Literally it's like, well, yeah, I mean, people smash roaches on the wall and nobody comes
[03:18:03.460 --> 03:18:07.860]  and cleans it up. And then there's live roaches too. I mean, you wake up, you move and roaches
[03:18:07.860 --> 03:18:12.580]  fly everywhere. I mean, if you're on the bottom bunk, they're flying off the top bunk. They're
[03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:16.340]  landing on you in the bottom bunk. I mean, it's insane. I mean, I couldn't even believe
[03:18:16.340 --> 03:18:19.140]  that that is a legal situation to be in right there.
[03:18:19.140 --> 03:18:20.020]  Oh my God.
[03:18:22.260 --> 03:18:24.900]  But yeah, there's still more unknowns than knowns at this time.
[03:18:24.900 --> 03:18:27.540]  I'm not going to lock Biden or Obama in one of those cells.
[03:18:28.260 --> 03:18:32.500]  I'm not a sadistic person, but they do that. Like this isn't a fight though. You think Democrats
[03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:37.300]  run? It's like the worst thing ever. Yeah. Look at their cities. Look at their cities.
[03:18:37.300 --> 03:18:40.100]  This one example. I mean, we got a story we're going to cover today.
[03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:45.700]  New York city is literally falling apart. There's these, there's these holes in the sidewalk.
[03:18:45.700 --> 03:18:49.620]  You walk down New York city, there's these like holes. You step into one,
[03:18:49.620 --> 03:18:53.220]  the whole thing concaves and you're like staring into the subway.
[03:18:53.220 --> 03:18:56.180]  You're like looking into the water mains and the gas pipes
[03:18:56.180 --> 03:19:01.060]  just on the streets of New York city, rats running around everywhere. It's all plenty of
[03:19:01.060 --> 03:19:05.380]  rats in DC too. And I'm not talking about the politicians. I mean, physical rats running
[03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:08.260]  around. Yeah, there it is right there. You just, Oh yeah. I'm just walking in New York
[03:19:08.260 --> 03:19:13.060]  city and Oh, there's a concave hole. Oh, there's a water main and there's the pipes in the
[03:19:13.060 --> 03:19:17.140]  subway. That's what you get in Democrat run city. And look at the country, Alex,
[03:19:17.140 --> 03:19:20.740]  look at the country under Joe Biden's quote unquote leadership.
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:24.660]  It's falling apart right in front of our eyes. And this is what we tried to avoid.
[03:19:24.740 --> 03:19:30.500]  This is what we tried to warn about, but Hey, like I said, you know, this, this case
[03:19:30.500 --> 03:19:36.100]  of criminalizing speech and a thought has sent major alarm bells. I mean, I can tell you
[03:19:36.660 --> 03:19:40.900]  friends and family of mine that maybe you thought I was a little zany with my politics.
[03:19:40.900 --> 03:19:44.660]  They might've thought I was a little out there with my politics. They saw this story.
[03:19:44.660 --> 03:19:48.660]  And I mean, and for the last three days, I haven't, I haven't slept in three days.
[03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:52.660]  I haven't sat down for a meal since Monday night, but my phone has not stopped blowing
[03:19:52.660 --> 03:19:57.380]  up with words of support and encouragement and love and kindness and prayers. It really means
[03:19:57.380 --> 03:20:03.940]  a lot to me. It's it's, it's, it's really given me a sense of renewed energy, but it's
[03:20:03.940 --> 03:20:08.020]  been a major awakening. I mean, it's to see this because people can't believe this happens
[03:20:08.020 --> 03:20:12.180]  in America. You couldn't believe that this is what's going on in your country. And it's a,
[03:20:12.180 --> 03:20:14.980]  but no one ever spoke to the left. They feel unlimited power.
[03:20:16.820 --> 03:20:20.500]  They once said, somebody once said you give liberals or you give progressive,
[03:20:20.500 --> 03:20:25.380]  you give Democrats a symbol of power, they'll find a way to abuse it. And that's what we see
[03:20:25.380 --> 03:20:30.820]  here today. And if we don't have a justice system, cause I mean, I said this yesterday in
[03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:34.900]  the press conference, the first amendment, a cornerstone, the second amendment, a cornerstone,
[03:20:34.900 --> 03:20:41.540]  but the justice system is a cornerstone too. If, if you can't get a fair trial or you can't
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:47.300]  even get a fair process where let's say that, let's just, let's just,
[03:20:47.300 --> 03:20:51.700]  well, next we become Mexico where you go, there's not a, it becomes rogue gangs.
[03:20:52.500 --> 03:20:58.420]  If you, if your case has already been decided before you even step into the courtroom,
[03:20:58.420 --> 03:21:04.020]  then we have no justice system. And that's what's happened with you. And now that's what's
[03:21:04.020 --> 03:21:08.260]  happened with Rudy Giuliani. And I'm afraid that some of Trump's legal team is going to have
[03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:12.420]  to learn this the hard way. Folks that don't know, they default you or they, they block,
[03:21:12.420 --> 03:21:16.740]  you can't defend yourself. They have a show trial. And then I, I think that they're
[03:21:16.740 --> 03:21:21.940]  going to do similar things in some of these Trump cases too, where I hear Trump's lawyers,
[03:21:21.940 --> 03:21:25.780]  all excited that they're going to do discovery and they're going to get to go through this
[03:21:25.780 --> 03:21:32.500]  whole process. And I'm just sitting here like, you know, you're probably not, you're probably
[03:21:32.500 --> 03:21:36.500]  not going to get to go through all the things that you normally would and the normal legal
[03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:43.460]  process and the normal justice system. It's gone under Merrick Garland, the justice system
[03:21:43.460 --> 03:21:48.660]  is gone. It is now an injustice system. And I don't know if he's-
[03:21:48.660 --> 03:21:51.140]  Yeah, it might be Merrick Garland that actually kills the country.
[03:21:51.140 --> 03:21:54.180]  I don't know if he's the puppeteer of all of this stuff, but-
[03:21:55.060 --> 03:21:59.380]  I used a front man. It's been a long time going. Well, let's shift gears out of your case
[03:22:00.100 --> 03:22:06.100]  into all the other news. US cruise missile attack. That's who runs them and flies them
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:09.860]  and drills them. You'd have to fight at the terminal, aim it, but it's run by the US
[03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:14.100]  government blowing up the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. Major escalations.
[03:22:14.100 --> 03:22:17.940]  Well, you know what? I'm glad you bring this up, Alex, because I've got,
[03:22:19.380 --> 03:22:24.180]  the Spidey senses are going off. I think something big is coming. A cyber attack,
[03:22:25.380 --> 03:22:28.820]  something big I think is going to hit us in the next couple-
[03:22:28.820 --> 03:22:33.140]  I agree. They're saying UK storm shadow, but it was also US cruise missiles. Keep going.
[03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:37.940]  There were a bunch of cyber attacks or cyber issues in Las Vegas this week. There was a bunch
[03:22:37.940 --> 03:22:41.780]  of stuff going on at DC. There was like some mystery in DC, actually. You couldn't find a
[03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:46.420]  rent a car. You couldn't find a hotel room. I'm asking a bunch of people, including some people
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:50.820]  that might know a thing or two at the Pentagon. And they're saying, yeah, there's some cyber deal
[03:22:50.820 --> 03:22:53.540]  this week, but it's kind of a hush-hush thing. Not everybody really knows about it.
[03:22:53.540 --> 03:22:59.140]  So that has my ears perked up that something big is coming. And when you see what they're
[03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:03.700]  now trying to do to Elon Musk and Starlink, I mean, that just shows you they're committed
[03:23:03.700 --> 03:23:07.780]  to- I mean, a nuclear war is what it seems like. They are committed to a nuclear war.
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:12.820]  Jones, you're a traitor saying Elon Musk is good. No, he's turning towards us and damaging
[03:23:12.820 --> 03:23:16.180]  the globalists. He can't deny a bunch of stuff he's now done has been good.
[03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:20.580]  Yeah. It's like, okay, well, if I'm not allowed to be back on Twitter, but Elon Musk
[03:23:20.580 --> 03:23:24.740]  stops World War III, you know what? I think I'll be okay with that. I think I'll take that
[03:23:24.740 --> 03:23:29.860]  trade off in the meantime. I'm not saying he's perfect, but I mean, he's coming out
[03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:33.780]  against transgenderism, coming out against the shots, coming out against censorship,
[03:23:33.780 --> 03:23:38.340]  coming out against the ADL, coming out against World War III, blocking the attack on the
[03:23:38.340 --> 03:23:43.300]  fleet we just saw today. And it's just like, okay, well, but there's these holier
[03:23:43.300 --> 03:23:47.220]  than thou folks that just want to say, you know, you're not as good as me. Okay, great.
[03:23:47.220 --> 03:23:52.100]  Then Elon Musk should be sent to Mars, shot out of a cannon. Fine. Let's go back to
[03:23:52.100 --> 03:23:56.420]  the way Twitter was before, 10 times worse. I agree. Elon Musk is horrible. Now I'm
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:24:00.340]  better than everybody else. Well, maybe that's what he'll do. If they try to go
[03:24:00.340 --> 03:24:03.860]  after him or who knows, maybe we'll just try to arrest him. He blasts off on a Starship
[03:24:03.860 --> 03:24:07.700]  rocket and just orbits, orbits the planet and just says, yeah, come and get me.
[03:24:07.700 --> 03:24:10.260]  I don't think he's going to save us. I don't totally trust him. The point is
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:14.180]  we have to admit he's getting better. Now we've done two and a half, three and a half
[03:24:14.180 --> 03:24:18.500]  hours, three hours, 24 minutes, technically. I'm not plugged. I'm not going to bitch

[03:26:26.580 --> 03:26:31.380]  going to move off your case into other issues. And then finally, I'm done with
[03:26:31.380 --> 03:26:34.740]  the Deep State depositions. I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central. Myself,
[03:26:34.740 --> 03:26:38.580]  Harrison Smith, 8 a.m. Central, doing a fabulous job. Yourself, The War Room,
[03:26:38.580 --> 03:26:42.420]  you're going to host today at 3 p.m. But Owen, what else is on your screen?
[03:26:42.500 --> 03:26:47.220]  What else is on your agenda coming up? Well, I've been a little busy the last
[03:26:47.220 --> 03:26:51.220]  three days. As I said, I haven't slept much. I haven't even sat down for a meal since Monday
[03:26:51.220 --> 03:26:56.020]  night. I do have some plans for the show today. But there is some big news breaking
[03:26:56.020 --> 03:27:01.940]  that we're going to be covering. But I will say that we got a lot of new audience members
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:08.340]  because of the case that happened this week with my name. And I was on Tim Pool last night.
[03:27:08.340 --> 03:27:12.500]  I've done a bunch of different interviews since then as well. And this is such a historic
[03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:16.900]  precedent setting case for free speech that people are tuned in. They're saying, well, gee, why,
[03:27:16.900 --> 03:27:21.700]  why does the U.S. government want Schroyer so bad? Why is this why is this guy such a
[03:27:21.700 --> 03:27:26.180]  marked man? Well, we're going to we're going to show you why. We're going to show you why.
[03:27:26.180 --> 03:27:30.180]  What I believe is the reason that I have this target on my back. And
[03:27:30.740 --> 03:27:36.020]  it's not just the affiliation to person one here, person one sitting.
[03:27:36.020 --> 03:27:39.540]  I love that nickname. Was that you or Tim? Oh, that was the U.S. government.
[03:27:40.580 --> 03:27:44.180]  No, I know the document is personal. Yeah. Well, no. Last night we were, you know,
[03:27:44.180 --> 03:27:47.540]  we were getting a little we were getting a little campy on Tim Pool. And we said,
[03:27:47.540 --> 03:27:51.540]  oh, you know, Alex should just embrace person one. Gosh, show the tweet from.
[03:27:56.100 --> 03:28:01.700]  Alex Jones, new nickname is person one. So you're now person one. But, you know,
[03:28:01.700 --> 03:28:07.860]  you had a long body. You've got a long career of work, Alex. And people know why you've got
[03:28:07.860 --> 03:28:13.780]  a target on your back. I haven't had such the long career as you yet. I'm not as long in the
[03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:19.780]  tooth yet. But you know what? I've got a pretty extensive resume and I've got a pretty impressive
[03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:25.460]  rap sheet. And so for people that don't know who Owen Schroyer is or what I'm all about or
[03:28:25.460 --> 03:28:29.940]  why I might have this target on my back, we're going to explain that a little bit more with the
[03:28:30.020 --> 03:28:35.700]  video evidence today, not to mention a presidential candidate giving a shout out to this case,
[03:28:35.700 --> 03:28:40.340]  because, again, it's not about me. It's about free speech. And so that's right. And in first
[03:28:40.340 --> 03:28:44.660]  interview, New Mexico governor doubles down on her raise an unconscious tax. That's wild.
[03:28:44.660 --> 03:28:48.500]  It's a second moment. She says, I'm focused on everyone's conscious of rights, not just
[03:28:48.500 --> 03:28:52.500]  those the NRA. Well, it's not the NRA that gives you the Second Amendment. It's the
[03:28:52.500 --> 03:28:59.140]  Second Amendment. Right back. A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[03:28:59.140 --> 03:29:03.700]  that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available. And that's because the prices went up
[03:29:03.700 --> 03:29:08.660]  too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies
[03:29:08.660 --> 03:29:15.140]  that wanted to work with us. But now we have brought back the coffee. And it's even better

[03:30:03.780 --> 03:30:09.780]  through diet. They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying
[03:30:09.780 --> 03:30:16.100]  to ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[03:30:16.900 --> 03:30:21.060]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[03:31:57.140 --> 03:32:00.500]  I thought it was next week. I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse ready to roll
[03:32:02.260 --> 03:32:06.820]  body's ultimate turmeric formula. And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys
[03:32:06.820 --> 03:32:15.700]  overhead shot, please. Look how full this model is right to the top folks,
[03:32:17.380 --> 03:32:26.340]  right to the top with these 95% of humanoids. Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%. Some are
[03:32:26.340 --> 03:32:35.700]  maybe 10. The other strongest brands are 75%. This is 95% super constant. So like taking one
[03:32:35.700 --> 03:32:42.420]  pills, like taking 10 of the average bill, it's that powerful or more. So they're available at
[03:32:42.420 --> 03:32:48.820]  info war store.com bodies, ultimate turmeric formula pulled out for almost eight months

[03:32:55.400 --> 03:33:04.119]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:16.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:17.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:18.360]  Well, it's nice to be back home.
[03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:19.360]  I'll tell you that.
[03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:36.720]  It's nice to be back home here at the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[03:33:36.720 --> 03:33:45.800]  And while the big story for me has obviously been the First Amendment, which we have addressed
[03:33:45.800 --> 03:33:55.160]  extensively here, dealing with my case, the censorship, and everything else, but the Second
[03:33:55.160 --> 03:34:01.440]  Amendment is also under direct attack from the Democrats.
[03:34:01.440 --> 03:34:07.460]  And it's an interesting phenomenon to watch some of the most far-left radical anti-gun
[03:34:07.460 --> 03:34:14.980]  Democrats like Ted Lieu and activists like David Hogg speaking out against the New Mexico
[03:34:14.980 --> 03:34:27.400]  governor who still is refusing to back off her claim and attempt that she wants to disarm
[03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:30.100]  American citizens.
[03:34:30.100 --> 03:34:35.580]  In first interview, New Mexico governor doubles down on her unconstitutional attacks.
[03:34:35.580 --> 03:34:39.060]  It's not for the police to tell me what's constitutional or not.
[03:34:39.060 --> 03:34:49.040]  You know, that's ironic, Governor Grisham, because it's not on you, the governor, or
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:57.440]  any politician, or the government to tell us what's constitutional or not, or that
[03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:02.280]  we can have a firearm or not.
[03:35:02.300 --> 03:35:09.700]  So it would seem that you need to apply your own logic here to yourself.
[03:35:09.700 --> 03:35:18.620]  But I guess self-awareness is not something Democrats really possess now, is it?
[03:35:18.620 --> 03:35:25.400]  Not just fellow Democrats calling her out for her unconstitutional aggression.
[03:35:25.400 --> 03:35:30.540]  New Mexico's attorney general announces he will not defend Governor Grisham's, Governor
[03:35:30.540 --> 03:35:37.380]  Grisham against lawsuits filed in response to her unconstitutional gun grab.
[03:35:37.380 --> 03:35:47.780]  Now her doubling down is interesting to see, because I guess that means she's gonna actually
[03:35:47.780 --> 03:35:51.640]  attempt to disarm American citizens.
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:35:55.860]  Now how is she going to do that?
[03:35:55.860 --> 03:35:59.100]  Obviously the police aren't going to cooperate.
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:01.620]  Obviously the attorney general's office is not going to cooperate.
[03:36:01.620 --> 03:36:09.640]  Is she going to go door to door and request firearms be handed over to her?
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:14.900]  Now let's get a broader focus here.
[03:36:14.900 --> 03:36:23.080]  And let's just think philosophically or what happens when the rubber meets the road.
[03:36:23.080 --> 03:36:28.680]  And let's say that the governor of New Mexico actually is able to get a law even.
[03:36:28.680 --> 03:36:31.900]  You do not have the right to possess a firearm.
[03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:38.920]  And she claims that this is for the safety, but actually let's go to her first.
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:42.720]  And then let's dig in to what this might actually mean or look like.
[03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:45.960]  Let's first go to clip 13.
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:49.900]  Why does she want to take your guns?
[03:36:49.900 --> 03:36:55.360]  If you're not going to stand up for these kids and really test as hard as you can,
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:37:00.360]  getting fewer guns and dealing with gun violence in a meaningful way, then you're basically
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:04.600]  saying that you won't be responsible to protect the citizens of the state.
[03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:10.360]  Well, I will, and I will do everything in my power to turn the tide and to make
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:13.680]  sure every New Mexican, particularly children, are safe.
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:16.360]  So we got a couple of problems here.
[03:37:16.360 --> 03:37:25.120]  One, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to listen for one second to a liberal progressive Democrat
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:30.400]  talking about protecting the children when this is the very group of people that murder
[03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:32.520]  them in the womb.
[03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:36.680]  This is the very group of people that if they had their way, half the children born
[03:37:36.680 --> 03:37:40.680]  in this country would become eunuchs by the time they hit puberty.
[03:37:40.680 --> 03:37:46.360]  So the same group of people that is okay with you killing your baby in the womb,
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:54.160]  the same group of people that promotes genital mutilation of children are now telling
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:56.640]  you they want to stand up for the children.
[03:37:56.640 --> 03:37:59.920]  Give me a break.
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:03.000]  Give me a break.
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:04.480]  But what about this philosophy here?
[03:38:04.480 --> 03:38:08.240]  See, there's a misunderstanding, Governor.
[03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:12.720]  When you say you're going to do everything in your power to keep people safe, you must not
[03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:14.760]  understand.
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:16.840]  You must not get it.
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:20.080]  This is a constitutional republic.
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:30.360]  It's on us, the citizens of the United States of America, to do whatever we feel is necessary
[03:38:30.360 --> 03:38:36.080]  under our own power to keep ourselves or our families safe.
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:40.160]  That is not your job.
[03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:42.560]  And it never was.
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:49.040]  And in fact, there is a very important document that I'm sure this governor hates so much.
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:52.000]  In fact, there's a few documents that I'm sure she hates a lot.
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:58.720]  But you see, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution actually specifically lets you
[03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:06.360]  know, Governor, that no, you don't have the right to decide how we are going to defend
[03:39:06.360 --> 03:39:08.480]  ourselves or our family.
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:13.280]  And this is the philosophical problem that the American left has.
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:16.440]  It's not your job to raise our families.
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:20.000]  It's not your job to protect our families.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:25.600]  It's not your job to make sure we don't get sick or don't get a virus.
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:29.040]  None of that is your job.
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:39.120]  The Bill of Rights and the Constitution explicitly explains that that is not your job.
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:44.120]  Your job is to make sure that we have the rights and the freedoms to decide what
[03:39:44.120 --> 03:39:47.120]  we need to do for self-defense.
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:51.280]  But you see, this is the liberal philosophy now that the government needs to be your
[03:39:51.280 --> 03:39:57.200]  daddy and the government needs to be your big brother.
[03:39:57.200 --> 03:40:03.600]  And I guess that's the very foundational issue with modern day liberalism is they
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:11.040]  believe that the government has the exclusive right to decide how you protect yourself,
[03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:15.160]  how you stay healthy, what you think, what you do.
[03:40:15.160 --> 03:40:18.040]  And that is obviously wrong.
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:22.940]  Now here she doubles down saying she's going to test this right and she's going to try
[03:40:22.940 --> 03:40:28.320]  to go full tyrant and take your firearms in clip 15.
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:33.120]  Also have, Governor, the Constitution of New Mexico and the Constitution of the United
[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:34.120]  States.
[03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:35.120]  And you're an attorney.
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:40.240]  Do you think you're on solid constitutional ground here?
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:41.440]  We're going to see.
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:44.160]  I mean, look, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I had the right.
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:45.160]  I have the right.
[03:40:45.160 --> 03:40:46.160]  Where is the right?
[03:40:46.160 --> 03:40:50.080]  In the state of New Mexico, public health, it's a suspension.
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:51.080]  It's not a ban.
[03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:54.040]  And we'll see what all of these court actions do.
[03:40:54.040 --> 03:41:00.320]  And I did say publicly, Poppy, look, I got a Supreme Court that says my personal
[03:41:00.320 --> 03:41:03.360]  bodily autonomy can be restricted.
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:09.060]  And yet NRA and other issues on the Second Amendment keeps getting broadened.
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:15.380]  The Bruin case in New York, right, that deals with concealed carry and cases.
[03:41:15.380 --> 03:41:18.500]  And that's actually, Governor, what I'm talking about.
[03:41:18.500 --> 03:41:21.660]  You bring up the Bruin case, the Supreme Court last year.
[03:41:21.660 --> 03:41:25.700]  Let me just ask you this, because the Supreme Court last year totally changed what we're
[03:41:25.700 --> 03:41:28.100]  allowed to do, what you're allowed to do.
[03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:32.100]  And they said, unless you can base it in the history and tradition, you don't have
[03:41:32.100 --> 03:41:34.480]  grounds to do something like this.
[03:41:34.480 --> 03:41:39.420]  The New Mexico Constitution, I looked last night, Article II, Section 6 says this, quote,
[03:41:39.420 --> 03:41:43.680]  no law shall abridge the right of citizens to keep and bear arms for security and defense.
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:48.800]  No municipality or county shall regulate in any way any incident of the right to keep
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:50.160]  and bear arms.
[03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:56.200]  Are you not in violation of both the U.S. Constitution and your state's constitution?
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:57.880]  I don't believe that we are.
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:42:03.800]  And it's that narrow reading of the Constitution which has been tested in the state, we wouldn't
[03:42:03.800 --> 03:42:05.960]  have universal background checks.
[03:42:05.960 --> 03:42:07.880]  We wouldn't have a waiting period.
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:09.920]  We wouldn't have a red flag law.
[03:42:09.920 --> 03:42:13.080]  We wouldn't have prohibitions for straw purchases.
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:15.640]  None of those would have been deemed constitutional.
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:17.960]  And today, all of them are.
[03:42:17.960 --> 03:42:20.240]  They were before the Supreme Court ruled that.
[03:42:20.240 --> 03:42:25.800]  These absolute right discussions, fair, but they haven't been tested again.
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:29.320]  And so for law enforcement, and I understand there.
[03:42:29.320 --> 03:42:32.240]  Folks, this is very key.
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:36.760]  And again, not that we're going to rehash my case here, but you understand, they're
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:40.720]  testing the limits of the First Amendment and they're testing the limits of the Second
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:42.320]  Amendment right now.
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:43.880]  That's what this is about.
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:47.720]  And they're now, they now have a working legal theory that, you know what, actually
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:53.280]  you don't have an absolute right to free speech, assembly or address of grievances or
[03:42:53.280 --> 03:42:54.280]  even self-defense.
[03:42:54.280 --> 03:43:00.200]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:04.320]  really, really, really, really good news because it's a great product you love and
[03:43:04.320 --> 03:43:05.320]  people want it.
[03:43:05.320 --> 03:43:07.760]  And it funds our operation of 360 Wind.
[03:43:07.760 --> 03:43:13.160]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere, jam packed,
[03:43:13.160 --> 03:43:18.440]  a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation that empowers your neurological
[03:43:18.440 --> 03:43:19.440]  system.
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:20.440]  You name it.
[03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:21.440]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:22.440]  God gave it to us.
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:25.120]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:28.680]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[03:43:28.680 --> 03:43:31.160]  Most brands are 5% human.
[03:43:31.160 --> 03:43:33.200]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:38.000]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% for humanoid.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:40.560]  I am so glad this is back.
[03:43:40.560 --> 03:43:42.240]  I have been out of this myself for months.

[03:43:54.100 --> 03:44:01.260]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[03:44:01.260 --> 03:44:07.300]  or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:13.500]  companies and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine. The allowable
[03:44:13.500 --> 03:44:16.980]  level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to
[03:44:16.980 --> 03:44:23.180]  sterilize you and basically turn your sun into a feminized mutant. Look it up. Don't

[03:45:13.180 --> 03:45:18.020]  every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:45:18.020 --> 03:45:23.220]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:28.780]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.

[03:45:34.340 --> 03:45:40.420]  but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[03:45:40.420 --> 03:45:44.980]  in turmeric. No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system. So if

[03:46:09.580 --> 03:46:15.380]  it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega 3s.
[03:46:15.380 --> 03:46:22.780]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content. Your best option is our

[03:46:55.100 --> 03:47:04.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:35.600]  So it's as clear as ever,
[03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:46.460]  I mean, I just look at the warnings that have been issued. I'm a 34-year-old man here. I've
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:53.120]  been involved in media, I mean, jeez, really since I was in high school. And I've been
[03:47:53.120 --> 03:48:01.100]  following media, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Alex Jones, Andrew Breitbart, the list goes
[03:48:01.100 --> 03:48:08.860]  on and on, and it's amazing sitting here now, living in the world that they warned me about.
[03:48:08.860 --> 03:48:15.180]  Facing the consequences and the punishments for my thoughts and my speech that they warned
[03:48:15.180 --> 03:48:22.500]  would come. And now it's the Second Amendment. And so we have to have a deep understanding
[03:48:22.500 --> 03:48:29.500]  fundamentally of what's going on, and that the attacks on the First Amendment and the
[03:48:29.500 --> 03:48:36.580]  Second Amendment, coordinated happening at the same time, is not coincidental. And that's
[03:48:36.580 --> 03:48:44.740]  not to say that the governor in New Mexico is collaborating with the justice system in
[03:48:44.740 --> 03:48:49.980]  a pincer attack against our country consciously, but they're all on the same page, they're
[03:48:49.980 --> 03:48:54.860]  all on the same message, and that message is clear. The First Amendment and the Second
[03:48:54.860 --> 03:49:00.100]  Amendment are not absolute, and we will test new legal theories and practices to make
[03:49:00.100 --> 03:49:07.160]  sure that the next generation of Americans know that these rights are not enshrined and
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:14.660]  not their birth rights. The most egregious assault on the foundation of this country,
[03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:23.340]  the most egregious assault on our birth rights that I have ever witnessed in my life.
[03:49:23.380 --> 03:49:29.540]  So, okay, but let's just think rationally. Let's think what happens when the rubber
[03:49:29.540 --> 03:49:38.740]  meets the road. Okay. How many examples do we have of the criminalization of free
[03:49:38.740 --> 03:49:44.140]  speech? We've talked extensively about my case. I don't need to relitigate right
[03:49:44.140 --> 03:49:52.340]  now that, but there's a case study right there. One that might need to go to the
[03:49:52.340 --> 03:50:01.860]  Supreme Court. But what does it look like if any governor, but in this case the New
[03:50:01.860 --> 03:50:09.900]  Mexico governor, decides, yep, we're going to disarm American citizens. Okay. Well,
[03:50:09.900 --> 03:50:17.780]  you've defunded the police. You have released the most hardcore criminals, violent
[03:50:17.780 --> 03:50:25.300]  criminals, repeat offenders, from jail. So you have no police and the police that you
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:29.900]  have left are now hamstrung and have their hands tied because if they actually engage
[03:50:29.900 --> 03:50:35.860]  in law enforcement, they might go to jail. And the criminal that they arrested is going
[03:50:35.860 --> 03:50:40.780]  to be released. So no law enforcement, no police on the streets, criminals roaming
[03:50:40.780 --> 03:50:46.540]  the streets, committing violent crimes, getting released from jail. And now you, the Democrats
[03:50:46.540 --> 03:50:55.660]  would say, don't even have a right to self-defense. How do you think that goes?
[03:50:55.660 --> 03:51:02.180]  How do you think that goes? Well, I guess we could take a look at the crime statistics
[03:51:02.180 --> 03:51:09.740]  in Chicago and get a pretty good idea. In fact, hell, I haven't done this exercise
[03:51:09.740 --> 03:51:17.260]  in a while. In the gun-free zone of Democrat-run Chicago, how many murders do you think took
[03:51:17.260 --> 03:51:22.640]  place this weekend? It's not a fun game to play, but it certainly shows you a good
[03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:28.360]  example of what happens in a gun-free zone run by Democrats where criminals are released
[03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:33.820]  back on the streets. So let's go over, under, let's see, mid September. I'm thinking over
[03:51:33.820 --> 03:51:43.980]  under, over under four, over under four murdered, four gun homicides in Chicago last weekend.
[03:51:43.980 --> 03:51:51.460]  I'd say four homicides and then probably, probably, probably 10 shot. So, so guys, let's
[03:51:51.460 --> 03:51:55.840]  go ahead and let's go ahead and pull that up. It's sad that if you watch Infowars
[03:51:55.840 --> 03:51:58.900]  a lot, you notice like, wow, how is he able to do this? How is he able to do these odds
[03:51:58.980 --> 03:52:05.920]  making stuff? Like, is he a sports bookie? Is he an odds maker at MGM and the casinos?
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:11.700]  Look at that. This weekend in Chicago, 22 shot, five killed. So if you had the over
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:18.180]  today, you won. Wow, Schroyer said four, it was five. How, how did he know that?
[03:52:18.180 --> 03:52:23.820]  Because I follow the news. It happens every freaking weekend. So there's your gun-free
[03:52:23.860 --> 03:52:30.460]  zone of Democrat run Chicago where the police get defunded and the criminals get released
[03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:35.700]  on the street. Five shot dead, 22 shot. How many of them women, how many of them
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:39.660]  children, how many of them innocent, not even involved in anything, just trying to
[03:52:39.660 --> 03:52:48.140]  live their life happens every weekend. That's just a taste though. That's just a taste.
[03:52:48.140 --> 03:52:54.500]  What about historical reference? Well, Hitler took the guns from the Jews. Pol Pot took
[03:52:54.500 --> 03:52:58.220]  the guns. Mao took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Lenin took the guns. We all know
[03:52:58.220 --> 03:53:07.220]  the story. All fascist tyrants, all authoritarian, totalitarian regimes take the firearms, every
[03:53:07.220 --> 03:53:12.340]  single one. And so it's nice to see the Democrats living up to that standard. It's
[03:53:12.340 --> 03:53:19.140]  nice to see the Democrats carrying on that history. So I guess we didn't learn from
[03:53:19.140 --> 03:53:24.940]  the 20th century. Now we're going to have to learn for ourselves in the 21st century
[03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:33.300]  that fascist dictatorships disarm the public. Now there is a bit of a difference now. There
[03:53:33.300 --> 03:53:37.860]  is a bit of a difference because in the United States of America, what do you got?
[03:53:37.860 --> 03:53:39.260]  200 million gun owners.
[03:53:39.400 --> 03:53:44.859]  200 million gun owners.
[03:53:44.859 --> 03:53:52.840]  And I'd like to ask, because the liberal gun grabbers, which by the way, since when was
[03:53:52.840 --> 03:53:58.080]  the second amendment not a liberal civil right?
[03:53:58.080 --> 03:54:06.240]  It used to be that liberals believed in civil rights.
[03:54:06.240 --> 03:54:08.720]  Like should black Americans have guns?
[03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:10.240]  Yes, that's their civil right.
[03:54:10.240 --> 03:54:11.980]  Oh, but wait a second.
[03:54:11.980 --> 03:54:12.980]  Not anymore.
[03:54:12.980 --> 03:54:16.880]  Should women have the right to self-defense so they can protect themselves on the streets
[03:54:16.880 --> 03:54:18.160]  if they're walking alone at night?
[03:54:18.500 --> 03:54:26.900]  Isn't that a civil right of self defense? Isn't that just common sense? What happened
[03:54:26.900 --> 03:54:32.760]  to liberalism and civil rights? Not anymore. Modern day liberalism is now oppression. Modern
[03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:40.380]  day liberalism is now authoritarianism. Modern day liberalism is classical fascism and they
[03:54:40.380 --> 03:54:43.960]  want to disarm the American people. So you have to ask yourself though, because I haven't
[03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:54.680]  heard anybody ask the governor of New Mexico one simple question. Governor, how do you plan
[03:54:54.680 --> 03:55:02.880]  to disarm your citizens? Are you going to go door to door yourself all alone? Is that your
[03:55:02.880 --> 03:55:09.900]  plan? You're just going to, yes, hi, this is your Democrat governor here to take your
[03:55:09.900 --> 03:55:17.100]  guns, hand them on over, and then what, snatch your kids too? Should they take your kids next
[03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:23.420]  to you so they can chop them up, mangle them, have their way with them? No, it's the governor,
[03:55:23.420 --> 03:55:27.460]  oh yeah, just here to take your guns, please voluntarily turn your guns in. Is that how
[03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:37.760]  this goes? Does the governor of New Mexico have to show up maybe with a gun on her hip?
[03:55:37.760 --> 03:55:47.240]  Maybe she's got a long arm over her shoulder. So she shows up? Yes, I'm here to confiscate
[03:55:47.240 --> 03:55:53.880]  your firearms, I'm here to disarm you. Governor, is that a pistol on your hip? That's
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:56:02.120]  a gun, isn't it? Governor, is that a rifle over your shoulder there? I'm just a little
[03:56:02.120 --> 03:56:07.400]  confused because you're taking my firearms but yet you've got a firearm right there.
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:16.240]  Or maybe it's even more egregious. Does she need to have police with her,
[03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:22.240]  armed police, when she shows up at your door to take your gun? Here to take your
[03:56:22.240 --> 03:56:26.200]  firearms and my friends with the police are here in case you don't cooperate so go
[03:56:26.200 --> 03:56:32.760]  ahead and hand them over. Is she gonna have the military with her? Are they gonna be pointing
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:39.460]  guns at you? Are you gonna have to turn over your firearm at gunpoint? Maybe it's
[03:56:39.460 --> 03:56:48.240]  even more egregious. Maybe the Democrat governor of New Mexico shows up at your door with
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:57.600]  her own private security paid for by you, the American taxpayer. Just like the Democrats in
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:04.440]  Chicago, just like the Democrats in California, just like the Democrats in New York, just like
[03:57:04.440 --> 03:57:12.000]  the Democrats in St. Louis, they all want to disarm you and defund the police but they get
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:22.280]  private armed security. You know what that is? That's a fascist authoritarian dictator and these
[03:57:22.280 --> 03:57:28.160]  are now your Democrat governors, these are now your Democrat mayors, these are now your Democrat
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:34.640]  members of Congress and yes even your Democrat President Joe Biden who says he wants to ban
[03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:40.200]  assault weapons. A total assault on the Second Amendment, a total violation of the Second
[03:57:40.200 --> 03:57:43.680]  Amendment. That does it for The Alex Jones Show. I'll be hosting the Info Wars War Room
