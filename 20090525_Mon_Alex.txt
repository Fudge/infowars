[00:39.320 --> 00:45.760]  Chuck Baldwin constitutional party presidential candidate 2008 who was basically listed as
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.880]  a terrorist leader by the state police propaganda document put out in Missouri written by the
[00:50.880 --> 00:57.200]  feds and that's what the document does don't let them spin it also we've got commander
[00:57.200 --> 01:04.460]  David K Robin of the American Legion joining us outraged by the fact that they're gonna
[01:04.460 --> 01:11.120]  make all veterans pay for their own health care now that's CNN ladies and gentlemen
[01:11.120 --> 01:15.640]  and they put a spin on it and say it's good so basically you have to get your own insurance
[01:15.640 --> 01:21.840]  when your arms and legs get blown off or you breathe nerve gas or you get shot you know
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.960]  more than 15,000 troops have died in Iraq they just changed the rules seven years ago
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.640]  as they were building up for the war we've now passed of the what six year mark for being
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.120]  an Iraq but seven years ago they changed the accounting rule kind of like they've changed
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.560]  up all the other federal statistics that were always somewhat fraudulent but now even more
[01:43.560 --> 01:48.360]  fraudulent to where if you're not looking for employment anymore and you just dropped

[02:04.240 --> 02:13.200]  I haven't looked at it in a year have died of their injuries since they left Iraq and
[02:13.200 --> 02:20.200]  I mean they can die on a jet medical aircraft flying them to New York City or to DC or to
[02:20.200 --> 02:28.880]  Virginia or to Romstein in Germany and it doesn't count so when I say 5,000 died in the Obama
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.400]  deception I'm just going with what they're officially spinning and saying not even counting

[11:26.240 --> 11:31.640]  all true it's all real can we stop the denial and do something about it instead of debating

[12:47.160 --> 12:53.960]  that's why it's called a duty in subsection b six the legislation states that a commission
[12:53.960 --> 13:03.280]  was will be set up to investigate whether a workable fair and reasonable mandatory mandatory
[13:03.280 --> 13:10.840]  service requirement for all able young people could be developed that's a quote mandatory

[26:16.800 --> 26:23.920]  to health care really who would have thunk it now they will go ahead and ram this through
[26:23.920 --> 26:28.400]  they're going to go ahead and they've all almost made it impossible for veterans getting
[26:28.400 --> 26:32.480]  anything other than pills any real surgeries you name it and they've got people that don't
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.360]  even have a real you know proper medical licenses from india in places i'm not saying they don't
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.080]  have some real medical schools over there very smart folks just as smarter smarter than westerners
[26:42.080 --> 26:46.120]  among top scientists point is they have a lot of quack schools over there like mexico
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.400]  does and there's a bunch of quack doctors and come out in the news people don't even
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.920]  have real medical degrees you know cutting off the wrong leg or leaving tools inside
[26:53.920 --> 26:59.960]  people you know russian doctors you name it so that's going on and so they'll just make
[26:59.960 --> 27:03.720]  it very hard for you to get health care and then say you just need to have your own insurance
[27:03.720 --> 27:10.560]  okay that's how this works so as huge opposition mounts when they introduce it they then back
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.160]  off and they'll be right back in a month with it again and then they'll deny they ever set
[27:15.160 --> 27:18.240]  it again and then they'll come right back with it again and then they'll deny and then
[27:18.240 --> 27:21.720]  they'll about the third or fourth time we'll go ahead and do it they'll just get you sick
[27:21.720 --> 27:27.640]  of talking about it and you acclimated every time the outrage grows to a crescendo that's
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.000]  about to spill out and actually hurt the establishment they back off and say we never
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.640]  said that or well we're not going to do that now and they come right back with it after
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.880]  see they don't want you to organize and so as people start organizing against us they
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.600]  go okay we're not doing it now organization falls apart they're right back kind of like

[34:57.320 --> 35:01.000]  it's been around for years that's what the media called it i want to get his take on a lot of things
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.200]  including senator dot admits adding bonus provision to stimulus package while he was the guy bad
[35:06.200 --> 35:09.960]  mouthing it and blaming it on republicans and we're not defending republicans they were a party
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.280]  to it the point is they're all controlled by the same people and then meanwhile dod is now blaming
[35:14.280 --> 35:19.160]  obama administration for bonus amendment well yeah because the bonus amendment mirrors the
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.000]  executive order so when you see obama go we're gonna get these people i am his administration
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.840]  is literally run by the people that engineered the current banking system bush just continued it
[35:30.840 --> 35:36.680]  just is guilty but he wasn't the author of it it's just so outrageous uh the level of their
[35:36.680 --> 35:41.400]  lies but it's being exposed it's coming out and by the way this is what the obama deception covers
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.960]  we go over all of this in the film not just his lies but the real agenda from their own
[35:47.960 --> 35:51.400]  documents we show video clips of them saying one thing and they're doing another

[36:00.440 --> 36:07.960]  you i'm seeing liberty the awakening to tyranny exploding well this Missouri fiasco i think is
[36:07.960 --> 36:13.800]  illustrative of what we're dealing with here whenever you can categorize people who vote for
[36:14.440 --> 36:20.760]  myself rod paul or even bob bar as potential domestic terrorists and make that part of an
[36:20.760 --> 36:26.840]  official state police agency report we are in deep doo doo there's no doubt about it
[36:27.880 --> 36:30.760]  yeah that's the main reason we got you on but there's a host of other issues i want to go over
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.440]  with you but let's let's cover that first the myac report i've had a state rep on to confirm

[36:46.680 --> 36:53.240]  this up chuck now you didn't make it up but uh but i thank you for reporting it now of course
[36:53.240 --> 36:59.240]  it's all over the media even rush limbaugh talked about it the other day uh the Missouri state of
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.160]  papers have been carrying it quite a bit in the last couple of days as you can imagine
[37:03.720 --> 37:08.600]  and this thing is now beginning to get a life of its own uh thank you Alex for helping to
[37:08.600 --> 37:14.840]  break this story uh whoever that police officer was in Missouri who first contacted you he's a real
[37:14.840 --> 37:21.240]  hero i don't know who he is but uh he sure did a great service to his country by alerting the
[37:21.240 --> 37:25.400]  public as to what is going on behind the scenes in the police department there in the state of
[37:25.400 --> 37:32.680]  Missouri this thing is it is unbelievable i mean to categorize voters of ron paul supporters of
[37:32.680 --> 37:39.480]  ron paul chuck baldwin bob bar as potential uh domestic terrorists not to mention the fact
[37:39.480 --> 37:46.360]  that if anyone uh opposes certain things and i listed that in my column that i put out earlier
[37:46.360 --> 37:53.160]  this week uh if if someone opposes for example the new world order uh if they oppose the united
[37:53.160 --> 38:00.440]  nations gun control the violation of posse com at all rfid rfid and they're part of in the fed
[38:00.440 --> 38:06.440]  or the liberty committee or the constitution party uh and they say oh these groups are bad too
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.000]  they have set kitchens and try to work with the local police talking about your group and others
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.040]  and i mean it's clear and they say but secretly they've got cell groups and they're really terrorist
[38:16.040 --> 38:21.960]  too yeah anybody that opposes any of the above abortion on demand illegal immigration etc is a
[38:21.960 --> 38:26.760]  potential domestic terrorist a potential threat to the police forces there in the state of missouri
[38:26.760 --> 38:34.040]  i mean can you imagine what the what the firestorm would be if instead of bob bar ron paul and myself
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.120]  had the let's say jesse jackson and al sharpton been named uh with the insinuation that people who
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.840]  support these individuals may be considered domestic terrorists i can you imagine what the
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.720]  mainstream press would do is something like that and yet this is exactly what that that report says
[38:49.720 --> 38:56.440]  there in the state of missouri uh we have sent uh the three of us ron myself and bob have co-signed
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.000]  a letter uh to the governor and to the respective parties in missouri demanding that they
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.840]  repudiate uh this report and apologize to the supporters of those who voted for us
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.000]  so let me stop you this is big news and of course we broke it here i have the original
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.120]  actual report here in my humble hands right now um specifically uh what did limbaugh say about it
[39:22.120 --> 39:28.120]  a and then b where is a copy of this letter i would like to publish it right now up at info
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.200]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com okay uh the letter uh i have a copy of course in my
[39:34.200 --> 39:39.240]  position as does bob bar and will you give me a favor and scan it or email it over and we'll uh
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.440]  post it and put a link over to your site sure sure we do that as to what limbaugh said i really
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.680]  don't know exactly what he said i didn't hear i very seldom listen to rush limbaugh but uh i've
[39:48.680 --> 39:52.840]  had several people call him tell me that he did bring it up on his program or maybe a call or
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.000]  did and they did talk about it for a few minutes the point is is that it's beginning to spread
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.440]  around the country yeah i knew it was in newspapers yeah oh absolutely the newspapers and talk radio
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.280]  of course are the ones that are breaking the story right now uh you were the first one to
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.360]  break as far as i know and i again i thank you for that but this this is incredible and the
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.120]  thing about it is the law enforcement agencies often share this kind of information uh with
[40:16.120 --> 40:22.840]  each other so all 50 states have this i actually have it from other states uh just state police
[40:22.840 --> 40:26.520]  have asked me not to publish the copies they've got because they're scared and i've gotten many
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.320]  similar reports i've seen a texas report on the same style letterhead a few years ago it just
[40:31.320 --> 40:37.320]  wasn't this egregious listing ron paul yourself and others correct as far as i know this is the
[40:37.320 --> 40:44.120]  first report such as this that has actually named names you know they did this back in the 90s uh
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.280]  when janerino uh was there in the clinton white house and uh but they they did some of the same
[40:50.280 --> 40:55.000]  you know kind of insinuations and broad brushing and so forth but they didn't actually name names
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.640]  but here we are now in 2009 and they've actually named chuck ball and myself bob bar and ron paul
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.080]  and saying the supporters uh of of those of us who ran back last year as as an independent party
[41:07.080 --> 41:13.240]  ticket uh are somehow considered dangerous and a potential domestic terrorist yeah well i need
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.080]  to get ron paul back on i don't like to bug him because he's so busy but last wednesday when we
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.360]  broke this thursday i got calls from listeners saying we call ron paul's office of course it
[41:22.360 --> 41:27.720]  wasn't ron paul yet and heard about it yet and they're saying it can't be real and uh so i had to
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.640]  explain to them send him to the site and i said i'm not going to call ron at home i've got his
[41:31.640 --> 41:36.760]  home number but i said give this to him we don't make stuff up you know that right and they said
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.200]  no no we all know you and like you alex i said good it's real the state police officers names
[41:42.200 --> 41:47.480]  are there call the number for yourself confirm it's real because i got i got slapped around for
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.000]  three or four days and folks are still saying i made this up chuck it doesn't matter if the state
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.760]  police and then state reps say they talked to the head of the state police and you know they're
[41:54.760 --> 42:01.480]  still the establishment still trying to deny this well that that's that's that's incredible because
[42:01.480 --> 42:07.080]  all anyone has to do is call the toll free number and talk to the state officials they're missouri
[42:07.080 --> 42:11.960]  and they won't deny it one bit in fact they will defend they'll just say that it's been
[42:11.960 --> 42:16.920]  misconstrued and people are recording some of it yeah yeah no when we've even played recordings
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.440]  of monair people say that's not real yeah yeah go ahead they don't deny but they don't deny it is
[42:22.440 --> 42:27.480]  my point i mean they they will readily admit that that it's legitimate and and for the most part
[42:27.480 --> 42:33.320]  they stand behind it uh as far as ron paul you're right at first uh you know i'm sure that that
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.360]  people in his office didn't probably believe it as when i first heard the story with somebody
[42:38.360 --> 42:42.040]  you know told me said hey have you heard the story of coming out of missouri and i said oh no they
[42:42.040 --> 42:46.040]  didn't they didn't do that i mean that's the first thing you think about but then whenever you start
[42:46.040 --> 42:51.400]  to look at it closely and you realize hey this it's real this does not make believe and then you
[42:51.400 --> 42:56.040]  can begin to do something about it and of course this letter that we have cosine bob barry ron paul
[42:56.040 --> 43:02.600]  and myself and uh i'm sure by now is on the way to the uh the governor's office there in missouri
[43:02.600 --> 43:09.320]  uh in which we give him three days to uh to come out and repudiate this document to take
[43:09.320 --> 43:15.320]  out the letter in front of you the important presidential candidate i do have a letter and i'm
[43:15.320 --> 43:22.360]  going to sit back here will you read that on air please well it's uh two it's uh a little over
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.120]  two pages you want me to go ahead read it yeah let's read it it's important let's all right
[43:26.120 --> 43:33.240]  first time here exclusive go ahead all right um dear governor nixon the three of us right you
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.720]  as former presidential candidates as concerned citizens and in the case of ron paul as a sitting
[43:37.720 --> 43:44.120]  member of the us house of representatives and bob bar as a former member 1995 to 2003 we bring to
[43:44.120 --> 43:47.880]  your attention the most disturbing document being circulated by the missouri information analysis
[43:47.880 --> 43:53.480]  center miac over the seal of your office and your name is governor respectfully demand that the
[43:53.480 --> 43:57.960]  following described document be immediately removed from any and all websites associated with or
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.720]  maintained by the state of missouri or any agency thereof including the miac that the said document
[44:03.720 --> 44:08.200]  no longer be circulated by the state of missouri or any agency thereof or associated therewith
[44:08.200 --> 44:12.840]  that the state of missouri repudiate its references to the three of us as contained therein the
[44:12.840 --> 44:18.440]  document to which refer is identified as follows in a copy enclosed herewith and of course uh
[44:18.440 --> 44:23.560]  it's the mic strategic report dated 2209 and it's entitled the modern militia movement
[44:24.360 --> 44:30.600]  forenames appear on the master of this document jeremiah wj nixon governor john m brit director
[44:30.600 --> 44:40.840]  dps james f keithy kernel mshp and van godsey director miac the fore said report is imprinted
[44:40.840 --> 44:46.120]  at the bottom of each page thereof with the following designation unclassified law enforcement
[44:46.120 --> 44:51.400]  sensitive close quote it would be difficult governor to recount in any letter of reasonable
[44:51.400 --> 44:56.520]  length the nonsense and inaccurate information contained in this so-called strategic report
[44:56.520 --> 45:01.560]  which concerns purported analysis of the modern militia movement in quotes the report draws links
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.600]  between white supremacist anti-immigration persons people opposed to gun control those who do not
[45:06.600 --> 45:10.920]  favor the federal reserve banks and much more where the report nothing more than a nonsensical
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.080]  diatribe pinned by some uninformed person we would certainly not take our time writing this letter
[45:15.640 --> 45:19.720]  although we might respectfully suggest you might want to question why such nonsense is of interest
[45:19.720 --> 45:25.080]  to and being disseminated by an agency connected to save missouri our concern which we believe
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.600]  warrants your attention over is found at the top of page four of this document after the
[45:28.600 --> 45:33.800]  heading political paraphernalia as follows quote militia members most commonly associated with
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.680]  third party political groups is out in common for militia members to display constitutional and
[45:38.680 --> 45:45.000]  that's a missed spell because it's constitution not constitutional party campaign for liberty or
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.640]  libertarian material these members are usually supporters of former presidential candidate
[45:49.640 --> 45:56.680]  rod paul chuck baldlin and babar closed quote if it is the intent of the state of missouri to link
[45:56.680 --> 46:00.840]  these three excuse me to link three legitimate former candidates for the office of the president
[46:00.840 --> 46:04.040]  united states who also happen to be a sitting member of the u.s. house a former member of the
[46:04.040 --> 46:09.400]  u.s. house and a baptist minister and this document clearly does so and this is the basis for our
[46:09.400 --> 46:14.280]  demand that the document be removed its distribution and the actual implied adoption by the state of
[46:14.280 --> 46:19.240]  missouri stop if it is not the intent of the state of missouri to make such a lake or implication
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.560]  by and through the appearance and distribution of this document then we similarly demand the
[46:23.560 --> 46:27.400]  document be removed from any and all websites maintained by our associated with the state of
[46:27.400 --> 46:32.040]  missouri or any agency connected there with that's a state issue an immediate and unequivocal
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.760]  repudiation of the document and view the fact that there are indeed real criminals present
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.520]  in missouri and many legitimate matters of public safety on which your office the department of
[46:40.520 --> 46:46.120]  public safety to highway patrol and even the miacy should focus their attention and resources
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.520]  respectfully assert that spending any time resources or effort on the nonsense contained in
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.560]  or about this mii strategic report constitutes an irresponsible and inappropriate use of
[46:55.560 --> 47:00.120]  official resources we stand ready to discuss this matter with you your convenience however the
[47:00.120 --> 47:03.720]  action respectfully demanded in this letter is requested within three days that you receive
[47:03.720 --> 47:08.680]  this letter in the meantime with common guards we are virtually yours ron paul member of congress
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.440]  public encounter for president 2008 bob barb member of congress 1995 2003 libertarian party
[47:14.440 --> 47:19.160]  nominee for president 2008 chuck balvin minister crossword baptist church constitution party
[47:19.160 --> 47:27.240]  nominee for president 2008 okay i would just add to that that they start out with a page
[47:27.240 --> 47:33.720]  listing cop killers and then they demonize the militia connecting into that then they connect
[47:33.720 --> 47:39.080]  violent militias which basically don't exist in our constitutional you know the nonviolent ones
[47:39.080 --> 47:45.320]  to basically the majority american people pro second amendment pro sovereignty pro border
[47:46.920 --> 47:54.520]  just you name it they basically say people with these bumper stickers are dangerous they may
[47:55.160 --> 48:02.360]  put a hole in you you know that's the totality of it and it's a guilt by association broad brush
[48:02.360 --> 48:09.000]  demonization right and it's slander and libel of the highest order and that's why they that's why
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.400]  they kept this secret if they and if i actually if they do not repudiate this forthwith uh i feel
[48:15.400 --> 48:20.520]  confident that there will be legal action uh ensue and i can tell you this too that the constitution
[48:20.520 --> 48:25.560]  party and hopefully the libertarian parties in the state of missouri are likewise sending off
[48:25.560 --> 48:32.200]  similar letters uh with just those exact uh implications in mind in other words and representing
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.520]  you know we're reput the letter that we wrote was uh representing the three of us because we were
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.680]  named so that was how this letter tell us how this letter got wrote i mean you got bob bar
[48:40.680 --> 48:44.520]  ron paul and yourself on the phone you know the declaration of independence was supposedly written
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.000]  by a bunch of people that we know was mainly written by thomas jefferson so i mean who was
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.720]  the thomas jefferson writing this letter of the three of you i think uh it was primarily bob bar
[48:53.720 --> 48:58.600]  bar okay so bob bar is the thomas jefferson here uh in this but you guys uh you and ron paul
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.600]  congressman paul and yourself uh dr baldwin agreed with this uh did they in the conversations on
[49:04.600 --> 49:10.280]  the phone talk about uh carrying out legal action themselves if this isn't repudiated because
[49:10.280 --> 49:14.200]  you know i'm glad you guys are doing this you have to this endangers the tens of millions of
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.920]  ron paul bob bar and chuck baldwin supporters and fans uh and and when we've got confirmed reports
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.320]  on video police pulling people over for ron paul bumper stickers in los vegas in places
[49:25.880 --> 49:32.440]  so this is dangerous oh absolutely i mean this this you know talk about the essence of freedom
[49:32.440 --> 49:39.000]  this is the essence of freedom whenever uh state police agencies begin pulling people over for
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.640]  political opinions and that's exactly what what this is if you support bob bar chuck baldwin ron paul
[49:45.640 --> 49:49.480]  that's a political opinion and that's what the point is for those that don't know i'm keeping
[49:49.480 --> 49:55.400]  them running because it's key this is given they say my act report is for them when they
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.560]  pull people over this this is too profile this is for harassment go ahead yeah and and so when
[50:01.560 --> 50:07.320]  we start profiling people because of political thought political ideology uh i mean this is
[50:07.320 --> 50:12.280]  what they did in nazi germany what they did in stylans russia mails china the the whole nine
[50:12.280 --> 50:19.560]  yards you know is is your your identification with a particular thought or particular idea uh

[54:49.400 --> 54:54.280]  off the air in about 10 15 minutes and we'll do a story on it very very exciting to see you guys
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.200]  standing up and finding back but I go back to the question we ran out of time talking to Ron Paul
[54:58.200 --> 55:02.760]  talking to Bob Barr are they saying that they may do legal action if this is not a reverse and
[55:02.760 --> 55:11.640]  and and retracted I think I think I could safely say that the sense of of each of us is that this
[55:11.640 --> 55:18.040]  is serious enough that the state of Missouri does not respond appropriately uh that we should
[55:18.040 --> 55:23.560]  consider legal action I think that is certainly a consideration right now so that was discussed
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.840]  yes that is that is very important news right there good because instead of putting up with
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.520]  the southern property law center and the adl who go after you know groups that are obviously bad
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.320]  and are constantly mixing good people in with it I'm sick of this slander and they've lost lawsuits
[55:39.320 --> 55:45.320]  before uh over this and uh now the police are putting this out secretly this is outrageous
[55:46.520 --> 55:51.240]  it is outrageous and it threatens the liberty of of every American I hope that your listeners
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.920]  understand that even though they may not have voted for myself or Bob or Ron Paul or perhaps
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.760]  they don't live in Missouri that they think what that this doesn't affect them but the fact the
[56:00.760 --> 56:06.520]  matter is this affects every single American citizen uh if when police agencies can begin to
[56:06.520 --> 56:14.040]  profile Americans on the basis of what they believe we are in serious trouble we don't have
[56:14.040 --> 56:20.360]  freedom if we don't have the freedom to think the freedom to speak the freedom to express our
[56:20.360 --> 56:26.920]  ideas and our convictions publicly when we don't have that freedom without being considered an
[56:26.920 --> 56:32.520]  enemy of the state or domestic terrorist however you want to say it we don't have the most basic
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.960]  fundamental freedoms uh in this country and that's what's at stake for every American
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.880]  yeah this is a showing effect I mean this is a Soviet Union Nazi Germany this is classical
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.760]  tyranny to have the police turning into secret police with these reports demonizing the very
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.640]  people that are defending the republic yeah and think about it you know that the people that
[56:53.640 --> 56:58.680]  that they mentioned there you know bob bar the libertarians uh Chuck wall in the constitution
[56:58.680 --> 57:03.640]  party of ron paul the you know if you want to say the constitutional wing of the republican party
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.920]  you know these are the people that for the most part are the most adamant defenders of of the
[57:08.920 --> 57:15.320]  constitution of freedom the of the very principles that the law enforcement personnel around the
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.800]  country are sworn to protect let's remember that every law enforcement officer in the country
[57:19.800 --> 57:25.160]  takes an oath to the constitution as does every military officer of course every public official
[57:25.160 --> 57:31.080]  so you know and we are the ones who are promoting uh the the law that each of these law enforcement
[57:31.080 --> 57:37.160]  personnel have sworn to protect I mean if there's any group of people that they should
[57:37.160 --> 57:42.440]  appreciate it should be the people they're trying to support and defend the constitution that the
[57:42.440 --> 57:48.360]  law enforcement personnel have sworn an oath to absolutely and and they might as well list
[57:48.360 --> 57:53.560]  Lou Dobbs in here because it the whole document looks like a Lou Dobbs CNN TV show I mean North
[57:53.560 --> 58:00.440]  American Union the SPP RFID tracker chips the second amendment I mean they just demonize everything
[58:00.440 --> 58:05.800]  that this country stands for this this absolutely yeah that's a good point this document is treason
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.520]  they should they should have mentioned Lou Dobbs because how often does he talk about the many
[58:10.520 --> 58:15.400]  of the things that you just listed there Chuck Baldwin I'm going to talk a little bit more

[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:36.520]  week has just gone huge another story that is massive comes to us from the head of the american
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:42.040]  legion the largest veterans association here in the united states and the website is legion
[1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:47.800]  dot org they really need no introduction we have commander david k reyban on what this he met with
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:52.600]  the president on monday seeing in another's reported that they were saying that they wanted to basically
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:57.240]  make the troops have their own insurance and pay for their own medical care instead of going to the
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  v a so joining us is commander david k reyban head of the american legion sir thanks for taking
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:08.520]  time out i appreciate the opportunity that news sir thank you you bet give us some background
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:13.400]  your meeting with the president and now they look like they're backing off well this issue really
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:18.680]  came to light about three weeks ago hi and while some testimony was being given in in front of the
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:24.920]  house veterans affairs committee we didn't expect that it was that serious an issue at that point
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:30.440]  but we did think it was serious enough that a dozen veteran service organizations got together
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:36.440]  and jointly wrote a letter to the president opposing opposing this idea thinking that maybe
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:41.640]  it wouldn't go very much farther but then we were all invited to a meeting at the white house
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:47.560]  last monday afternoon and that's when we discovered that this truly was a serious proposal
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:53.160]  the administration and at that meeting was was the president himself his chief of staff rome
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:59.640]  manual v a secretary erik shinseki and a and a representative from the office of management
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:05.800]  and budget at that meeting they told us that they had identified five hundred forty million
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:13.320]  dollars that they thought could be recouped back into the v a by billing private insurance
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:20.920]  carriers for treatment of service connected disabilities at that point that and and i
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:25.880]  want i want everybody to understand that the president didn't president never threatened
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:31.320]  to cut off treatment if this was simply a method of how that treatment would be paid for whether
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:36.040]  by the government or by or by private insurance that would certainly start a big precedent towards
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:42.040]  that though it would it would it would start us down a road that we didn't want to go the
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:49.240]  the organizations all felt every one of us that the government has a fundamental fundamental
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:55.800]  responsibility not just to provide that treatment but there shouldn't be any there shouldn't be
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:11:01.160]  any financial burden borne by the veteran or by the veterans family for that treatment oh yeah
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.800]  they're going to raise insurance rates on them if the insurance companies learn that ensuring
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:11.320]  a veteran separately that they're going to have to pay and come on and insurance premiums would go
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:18.680]  up there are annual and lifetime caps maximums on the benefits that are paid one of the things we're
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:23.000]  really concerned about is once that been once that maximum benefit cap is reached
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:27.640]  then the entire family loses their health insurance coverage for the rest of the year
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.760]  and with the with the state of the military right now many of our many of our military
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:38.120]  people are married many of them are parents and the last thing we need to do is to have
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:43.000]  more young children out there uninsured that's just that's just not acceptable and then there's
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.320]  the added load of this on the entire insurance system the type of catastrophic injuries associated
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:56.200]  with military service as you just said this would bankrupt the entire family's cap very quickly
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:01.160]  very quickly very quickly when you when you start to talk about the state of the art prosthesis and
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:06.520]  we expect state of the art prosthesis for those folks that have that have undergone amputations
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:13.720]  loss of limbs you know those costs are very high and then they and on top of those two there's also
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:19.320]  the effect on the employability of the veteran himself and and what the and the effect on the
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:24.120]  company if this disabled veteran is is running his own small business they're just they're just way
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:29.560]  too many dangers here to take a chance on on implementing implementing this proposal i didn't
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:34.760]  think of that we're talking to the commander of the american legion david k raymond i didn't think
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:40.200]  of that businesses guaranteed if they knew i'm going to take a veteran on with a job who's going
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:45.640]  to have huge insurance cost on our whole plan with small businesses especially uh that would
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:50.280]  prejudice people against hiring veterans it's certainly what it's certainly what we think
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:54.520]  we think that if the if a veteran walked into the business even if he was the most qualified that
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:13:00.440]  would be that that might be the deciding factor as to who gets the job just through the potential
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:05.480]  the potential effect on that on the employer's insurance costs now you were in the meeting with
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:10.680]  the uh sorry go ahead no right go ahead right now you're in the meeting with the president he was
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:16.120]  trying to who was doing the selling the president or as chief of staff a manual or was it shinseki
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:22.200]  who was who was who was pushing this in the meeting all of the discussion at the meeting the primary
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:27.000]  the primary discussion came from the president chief of staff a manual carried part of the
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.080]  discussion the v a secretary uh general shinseki said very little during the meeting he was he
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:39.560]  was present but there there wasn't much discussion coming from the general from secretary what was
[1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:46.520]  the body sorry go ahead the thing that did surprise us um and disappointed us frustrated
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:51.880]  frustrated those of us from the veterans organizations the president did not wish the
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:56.920]  discussion and he stopped the discussion a couple of times from addressing that fundamental
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:01.880]  responsibility of the government to to take care of not only to provide the treatment but to pay
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:08.280]  for it the discussion focused strictly on the money on the financial aspects and where the money
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.400]  was going to come from so i'm getting from what you're saying he didn't want to be on record uh
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:19.080]  seconding the fact that the military has always been promised continual health care and when you
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:25.800]  were saying you support that don't you mr president he was non-committal that's yes uh a couple of
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:30.760]  the folks in the meeting tried to try to address that issue and that discussion came to it came
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:37.080]  to a halt very quickly at the president's request strictly strictly the focus on the money aspect
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:43.480]  that is outrageous so he was dehumanizing the issue away from the troops uh i mean that is
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:48.200]  outrageous so that clearly gives us a bird's eye view into the mind of of where they're trying to
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:54.040]  take policy um any other little interesting pieces of intelligence for the meeting sir
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:15:02.600]  no not from that one in particular um we did there was there was the suggestion made that if the
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:07.960]  organizations if the organizations did not agree with this if we were strongly opposed
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:14.360]  that if the organizations would make some other suggestions as to where this money could be could
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:19.960]  be either saved or additional sources of income that the administration was willing to listen to
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:25.800]  those that left us a little uneasy left me a little uneasy because i don't see it as the
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:31.400]  responsibility of the veterans organizations to partner with the government in in making those
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.920]  kinds of plans i see you're lobbying i mean i'm in an organization a fraternal organization
[1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:40.760]  guardians of the veterans it's in so you and what you're saying i don't put where's your
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:45.560]  mouth is that there was an attempted co-opting going on here a little bit of stroking to get you
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:51.640]  to quote help them uh i mean well obama cut you know four or five smart bombs out of the budget
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:57.400]  that's your 500 million i think that's i think i think there's some i think that's an accurate
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:03.000]  assessment of what was going on uh the what they were asking for was strictly ideas based on veterans
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.280]  health care and the va and there's a couple of them out there uh the american legion has advocated
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:14.520]  for a long time that we don't see why a medicare eligible veteran that's going to the to the va
[1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:21.000]  medical centers for non-service connected treatment why medicare should not be able to be built and
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:24.760]  and to bring some money back into the va that way we think there'd be new money
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:31.160]  come into the va that's currently being spent out on on private doctors if that if that possibility
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:37.000]  was allowed for currently medic be the va cannot bill medicare that's that's why it's going that
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:40.840]  that would require a change in the law yeah and that's government money to begin with so i don't
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:47.560]  see the problem with that that we we don't either we've advocated that position for oh i would say
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:52.200]  probably somewhere between five and ten years now that's not a that's not a brand new idea that's
[1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:59.880]  okay that's more money that's more options for better care for the troops yes yes yeah uh any
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:03.080]  other key points that were going on in this meeting and then we'll go into chapter two here
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:07.720]  in the time we have left with the head of the video who's nice enough to join us here anything
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:11.080]  else in the meeting that people should be made aware of and was there anything good that you
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:17.080]  agreed with the that the president or chief of staff said only that the president was very clear
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:22.840]  that there would be treatment for these people but there was that there was never any doubt that
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:28.520]  treatment for service connected disabilities would happen in the in the va medical care system and it
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:32.920]  would and it would be very good treatment the president the president vice president biden
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:39.720]  and and mrs obama have all been very clear about how much they care about military and the military
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:44.760]  and the military family so he wanted us to understand this that there was never any question
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:50.360]  that about whether or not treatment would happen in the va it would but it would take it away from
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:56.840]  their families with the cap that's that that possibility exists yes there was there was
[1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:04.120]  some discussion of a test program a pilot program and maybe in maybe two states to see what the effect
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:10.120]  would be on premiums and lifetime caps and employability but frankly those of us in the
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:16.200]  organizations myself as commander the american legion i'm not willing to take that risk well
[1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:20.360]  we know what they do that have those veterans have that have service connected disabilities
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:25.560]  they and their families have sought have sacrificed enough we don't need to run a test
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:31.400]  program and run the risk that they would be sacrificing even more to find out things that
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.800]  that we're pretty sure we're would be going to happen well we know that's a government trick
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:40.840]  all over the world to just say it's a test to kind of kill opposition and then they roll it out saying
[1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:46.840]  oh our tests work great now we're going to do it yes yeah you've and you've and you've seen things
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:52.120]  you've seen things studied and studied and studied and again you know the study never seems to get
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:56.280]  over what was his body language or what did he you know he was saying hey i don't want to talk about
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:19:02.680]  this being you know a you know right or something and not wanting to commit to that but then saying
[1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:06.760]  i won't take their health care away sounds like double speak what was his body i mean how was he
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:11.960]  trying to co-opter you know get you guys what it sounds like to sell out the veterans in a way to
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:17.320]  will help me cut their benefits somehow or help me save this money somehow yeah that was
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:25.800]  i'm not good at reading body language i i i know they're given interpretation there because
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:31.640]  there's there's a chance that i might be mistaken but he was very it was very clear this was about
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:37.960]  the money and can you can you as organizations come up with ways to help supply this money
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:42.040]  all right sir we've got a break for a quick break come back with five more minutes with
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:49.240]  you to talk about the good news from talking to the congress and now with a new statement today
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:55.400]  by gibbs the uh white house press secretary they're claiming they're backing off of this for now
[1:19:55.400 --> 1:20:01.560]  so we'll finish up with the head of the american legion commander david kate attention gardeners
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:07.000]  this is an urgent gc in self-reliance update gc in has just discovered a new bioactive superfood
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.080]  for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing
[1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:15.560]  rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any
[1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:19.960]  soil and light conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:24.680]  proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:29.640]  bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys
[1:20:29.640 --> 1:20:33.400]  which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:37.160]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:41.320]  enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:45.640]  or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's
[1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:50.120]  now easy gc and listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfood should visit the proto grow website

[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:11.560]  strange days
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:21.960]  all right folks thanks for joining us commander david k raymond the american legion
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:31.320]  is on with us i just can't believe they're trying to nickle and dime veterans treatment when we
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:37.320]  have a trillion plus dollar defense budget uh and they're not worried about trillions of the
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:42.360]  private banks but it's it's it's just amazing your thoughts on that and then the good news
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  that they are backing off this plan sir yes sir there was an invitation back into the white house
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:53.800]  uh yesterday the president could not be there he had prior commitments but chief of staff
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:58.440]  around the manual led that meeting to bring the veterans organizations back in we had
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:03.000]  we'd all expressed our opposition the american legion put out a very strong press release
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.960]  and we've been talking about it for the two days expressing our opposition and and involving the
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:14.040]  citizens and and our membership around the country at that meeting which only lasted about 15
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:20.360]  that's uh the chief of staff received the opinions of the veterans organizations the opposition
[1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:25.880]  and made the made the promise that he would consult with the president and be back with an
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:32.040]  answer yet yesterday afternoon when that answer came back to us it was that the president was
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:39.080]  withdrawing that proposal we also heard that uh all coming from second speaker speaker the house
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:46.040]  Pelosi and house veterans house appropriations chairman chet edwards they both made the statement
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:51.400]  that this proposal had been withdrawn and would not be involved in the budget for this coming
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:56.760]  fiscal year which was very good news but the issue is that they're proposing it it shows
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:02.360]  the mindset as you said what was the i mean i know the outrage was here that we saw on the
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:07.240]  internet and the phone calls we got to the radio show uh i mean to this issue on a scale of one
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:14.440]  to ten uh how hot did veterans get and veteran supporters over this oh i think uh some people
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.680]  we were hearing from i would i would put it up around the eight eight to nine this you know this
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:28.600]  this really when you tell people that have worn the uniform in the united states about this idea
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.480]  you get about three two-thirds of the way through the description of what's being discussed here
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:38.760]  and the head starts to shake no right just that quickly because because they understand this fundamental
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:45.640]  responsibility they understand understand the reason that those folks were injured uh why
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:51.960]  they're coming home with that disability and they understand that fundamental responsibility is not
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:57.560]  to be not to be trifled with plus they were promised they were promised they signed contracts saying
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:07.720]  this yes yep exactly exactly so that's a that's it it hits very high on the radar screen when you
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:11.640]  start to talk about it with the with the members of our organization with the veterans around the
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:15.800]  country and and frankly with a large with a large percentage of the population around this country
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:21.880]  even those that even those that haven't been closely involved with the military does this uh
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:28.040]  have did this put a check do you think in the uh obama administration's image with veterans who
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:34.360]  are already in a lot of areas not not too pleased with him well it certainly didn't help uh we in
[1:27:34.360 --> 1:27:40.120]  the american legion have been very pleased the last couple of years about budgets we're very we're
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.640]  very happy with the with the budget request that the president had has put in all we've seen is
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.960]  the bottom line number there we don't know the details so what we're looking for the details
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:54.680]  we're anxious to see them but we've been very pleased with the bottom line number but yes this
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:28:01.240]  could go this could go a long way to this could go a long way to her effort for what's what tends
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:06.920]  to be a favorable first impression in my mind that was one of the things that was that was said by
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:13.400]  one of the other representatives in that meeting to the president that this was not really this
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:17.640]  this wasn't something he needed this early in his administration because at this point
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:24.840]  things were going reasonably well all right well commander david k reagan of the american
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:29.800]  legion probably the biggest veterans organization not just in the u.s but on the planet and the
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:39.480]  website is legion dot org legion dot org and we appreciate you not being a lap dog so many other
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:45.320]  groups that represent people have been kind of seduced in to all these hundreds of meetings
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:51.080]  they've been having trying to co-opt everybody and so we're really glad to hear that you that you
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:55.400]  and you're saying the other veterans groups that were with you that none of them were rolling over
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:02.840]  to this first seduction well i would call it a corruption into the white house machinery so
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:08.520]  we commend you commander david k reagan for that thank you very much and it was very good to see
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:14.760]  so many of our of our colleagues in the in the organizations feeling the same way uh that wasn't
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:19.960]  that wasn't an absolute necessity we we in the american legion will will form our opinion and
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.920]  we'll act on it based on based on what we think is right all right commander thank you so much

[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:24.680]  in 2001 and i would just do the live tv shows and then we've got warehouses well not warehouses
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:31.800]  three portable buildings filled with videotapes rotting of all these tv shows and all these
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:37.480]  reports i did locally and then this is this video went viral all of the internet i was i put it up
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:44.360]  for free on my server got a four thousand dollar bill for it and had to pull it actually crashed
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:48.920]  our servers then i got a four thousand dollar bill and i learned that i couldn't put videos out for
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:35:03.240]  free um this was back in uh 2001 and it's up on info wars dot com payoff of anti-gun testimony

[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:15.000]  signal so i can make this congruent with the video that gets made of it okay we're going live right
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:21.240]  now at uh 1235 signal standard time at presentplanet.tv we'll be simulcasting from the show here on out
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:29.080]  back in 2000 2001 i had two employees and so tapes got stacked up they didn't get labeled right
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:35.320]  they went everywhere hundreds of important tv shows i did and it's just gold the information
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:40.040]  that's in these and we're trying to go through these now to get them on the web to you know get
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.760]  them out at presentplanet.tv but mike hanson who did camera work for me around the local tv show at
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:49.320]  the time i've asked him to dig through his stuff he's done that uh and because i've been unable to
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:56.680]  find this particular tape he was able to find it uh in um his store of tv programs i did pay off
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:04.600]  for anti-gun testimony caught on tape by alex jones is the headline up at info wars dot com
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:11.560]  and the reason this story is important we're going to play the video here is that
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:19.400]  jews the preservation of firearms ownerships local director we were there testifying against
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:23.800]  shutting down the gun shows ending private sales shutting down four eight shooting clubs
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:29.320]  uh ymca shooting clubs for for for young people and children that was the bills
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:34.280]  and this is when i really woke up to the n r a seven years ago now
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:42.360]  i guess eight years ago coming up this was in early 2001
[1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:49.640]  because the n r a was calling us extremists for not wanting to shut down the gun shows and
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.600]  things this was in the dallas morning news attacking me and others and then when we caught the bribery
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:59.400]  they said get out here the you know they're what looks like bribery being paid off and the house
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:03.160]  ethics committee said that he should have been registered lobbyist that it that it was improper
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:07.800]  but then the investigation stopped there and in a hosa the committee chairman did get reprimanded
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:14.040]  but they get up and they say yeah basically there's dangerous gang members everywhere uh and
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.960]  and we've you know you need to restrict guns you'd restrict gun shows and then they go outside and
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:25.720]  this gun control group sits there and pays them off at least 300 a piece the uh three guys that
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:31.560]  testified and then the statesman called me the next day after we put the video out on local tv
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:36.360]  i was live that night and said why don't you like black people and i said what are you talking about
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:41.320]  well if those were white men being paid and testifying against the second amendment would you
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.440]  have done your story and i said i wouldn't care if they were green i mean what this is a non-issue
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:52.440]  so the the statesman headline was payments made to backers of gun bills and it was the cover of
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:58.440]  the metro and state local section of the aust american statesman and i said i i said are you
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:02.840]  kidding and that was in the article i said are you kidding sir are you joking with me
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:06.840]  and i said put you know don't don't don't don't say that in your article that's not what this is
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:11.880]  about but no they did it was all this alex jones racist because he showed black guys being paid um
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.320]  so it's an important article in that respect and and this literally there's hundreds of reports
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.720]  just this is important and i'm trying to make enough money to hire a person full-time just to
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:27.080]  go through all my old videos because this is stuff that needs to be seen needs to flood youtube
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:31.960]  everywhere else we'll use prism planet on tv to do that but i want to thank mike for digging
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:35.720]  through stuff i'd ask him to do that more he's got his mike hanson archive page
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.680]  up on youtube and this video has been out for a few weeks it was just emailed to me this morning
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:45.400]  and i saw it so we're going to go ahead and play that here some of the testimony audio isn't the

[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:56.920]  where where they're testifying basically demonizing the second amendment and go you know playing
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:00.520]  the part of really it makes black folks look bad the racism was putting them up there and going
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:04.280]  yeah we're gang members yeah you know we've been gang members yeah the second amendment you know
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:10.200]  we need to get rid of these gun shows is dangerous it was really sick what they did that was what was

[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:25.240]  from people who go to the gun shows and get guns at large quantities you know i mean i know all
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:32.920]  these people i live there where all this is going on and i mean you guys might think that there's
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:37.640]  already a they already have a they have everything under control but it's not i mean regardless
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:45.880]  if we pass this law or not um i mean things might change but this this right here this bill
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:51.240]  after these bills this is just the beginning because it's bigger this bigger threats out there
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:57.560]  and there's bigger laws that we need to focus on that are being enforced in america but these three
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:04.040]  these three these three house bills right here this is just the beginning and i'm off board
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:11.080]  and like i said you guys are looking most of you guys are looking out from the outside
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:16.200]  but because i'm there i'm there every day you've gone into researching i don't even want to know
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.520]  where where these companies are located at none of that but well then what makes you think that
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.160]  they're selling because i'm here because i thought who else is going to get they don't have a
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:30.760]  factory in the hood where they're making guns you don't think some of those guns might be stolen
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:38.440]  they're not man how how can where are you going to get some money stolen guns from 200 houses
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:44.920]  every year 10 houses and i see nobody nobody said all right nobody thank you so i'm sorry
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:49.880]  this just wanted to clarify i think what i'm hearing you saying that at least one source of these
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:57.480]  guns on the street is the gun show yes thank you first question i'd like to ask is do we have
[1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:01.960]  an epidemic of gun violence because of the performance of the legislation in the ways
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:07.240]  of the very well-intentioned and sincere testimony from many of my march members and others
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:11.160]  would lead to believe we have an epidemic of gun violence that is not the case
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:15.400]  texas in the united states are safer than they've ever been i won't go into detail
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:20.200]  that the public for the clothing file here that has uh information from the national
[1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:27.800]  senator health statistics and senator zeezo call um us gun deaths at the lowest since mid 60s
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:32.200]  we'll say that we do not have an epidemic of gun violence and we might be in a situation where
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:39.960]  we have a solution seeking a problem payments made to backers of gun bills questions arise
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:45.240]  over cash given to three witnesses who support gun show background checks proponents of gun owners
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:50.680]  rights ask lawmakers friday to investigate cash payments made to three houston men who appeared
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.480]  before a house committee this week to support bills that would require instant background checks at
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:46:01.720]  gun shows dav smith president of houston based texans for gun safety a known front that is funded
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:07.080]  by hand to control incorporated said he gave the three members of young texans against gun violence
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:12.520]  nina butz's group is texas against gun violence about 300 each to cover their expenses and lost
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:19.640]  wages for the trip all three men however said they are currently unemployed so they can't get
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:25.880]  their lives straight that's lie number four right there um it was reimbursement for their jobs but
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:30.760]  they're unemployed otarius kelly 20 one of the witnesses said is ridiculous that someone would
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:36.680]  raise concerns about their testimony it's against my morals kelly said an admitted gang member by
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:42.440]  the way uh in the sand uh in the houston chronicle there's another story about this in there another
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:48.280]  witness agreed the money that was given to us was not to change our testimony said bruce brown 18
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:51.960]  who did not speak to the committee but submitted a witness forum that showed he supported the
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:57.560]  bills smith who gave them in the cash just outside the committee hearing room said young texans
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.600]  against gun violence is an arm of his group the subsidiary group receives donations from the catholic
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:08.520]  campaign for human development and the alliance for justice those groups encourage young people
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:14.600]  to get experience in the political process smith said yeah right reimbursing witnesses for travel
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:19.640]  expenses is not unusual since susie woodford of common cause texas a group that monitors
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:24.520]  government ethics but she said other witnesses using cash and paying for witnesses time raises
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:29.960]  ethical questions it's totally undermines the witnesses credibility woodford said
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:38.280]  i got here i said how will this look it says complaints about the payments began circulating
[1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:44.040]  after austin base talk show host alex jones who was at the house criminal jurist prudence committee
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:50.920]  meeting tuesday aired videotape interviews with smith and the young men they told jones the money
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:57.080]  was reimbursement stipends and campaign contributions so three different stories it's like the famous
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:02.520]  scene in a movie where are you guys going or where what are you doing going to see my mother uh going
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:09.080]  to get something uh going to the moon it's just making it up head of gun owners alliance has asked
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:13.800]  his thousands of members to seek a house investigation of the payments and have the
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:18.440]  hearing disregarded smith said complaints are being raised because the young men are minorities
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:22.760]  jones a strong supporter of gun owners rights and smith was trying to cover up his dirty
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:27.480]  activities by making accusations of racism he's sitting here caught on tape throwing out different
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:31.640]  stories and giving out money said jones who mentioned the payments during his testimony
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:36.840]  against the proposal to require background checks at gun shows how dare he tried to divert attention
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:42.040]  by saying i'm a racist committee members rick green are dripping springs and want henna hosad
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:46.120]  mcallon said they were uneasy about taking jones seriously because of other inflammatory
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:50.360]  comments he has made henna hosad the chairman of the committee said that although he didn't know
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:54.760]  details about the payments he is not concerned that the witnesses are compensated for testifying
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:59.080]  henna hosad said lobbyists are compensated for their work to influence policy on behalf of other
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.400]  interest maybe these kids were paid for their travel but i don't see anything improper about it
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:08.280]  henna hosad said it is part of the process it is part of open government state law requires people
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:13.240]  who are paid more than one thousand in three months or who spend more than fifty uh five hundred
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:17.560]  a quarter trying to influence legislation or agency action to register as lobbyist so you broke
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:23.000]  the state election laws bud you're not a lobbyist we checked smith said not reimbursing witnesses
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:28.760]  for lost wages would mean average texas would be left out of legislative debates and he said cash
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:34.760]  made sense all right we're back live at prison planet dot tv simulcasting uh on the radio here

[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:07.560]  reports they've had what other officers are saying and what it's like to see this have blown up so big
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:11.800]  we appreciate his courage because they do have retribution against officers and they talk about
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:16.840]  that in here if it gets out uh sir we appreciate you upholding your oath to protect and defend
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:20.440]  the bill of rights and constitution that somebody have fought and died for thank you so much officer
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:27.800]  you're quite welcome alex okay uh tell us when you first got this and what it was like
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:35.560]  reading it and what other officers are saying but they even emailed it to all the aerial officers
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:43.240]  and officers and it's like a training thing you know and when i pulled it up on the screen
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:49.640]  at first i was in disbelief after i read it and i had to read it a couple times to understand
[1:55:49.640 --> 1:55:56.200]  what are they saying i thought it was a spoof but when i read it when i ran it passed a few
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:02.760]  other officers you know and they had the same twist that i had on it that they were actually
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.840]  saying that some of us were militia members that we belong to a militia group just because
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:16.520]  as myself i have a wrongful sticker on my car some other officers they believe that gun control
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:22.440]  is not correct and that we shouldn't be marking up bullets ammunition act that they're trying to
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:29.480]  pass through and we're saying wait a minute this is like a big net taking in everybody you know it
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:36.840]  just doesn't it didn't appear right and it seemed like this thing was just anti-american all the way
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:44.680]  it really it really made me mad so the majority of other officers that you talked to in in your
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:51.400]  state police office they were upset by it just like you yes they were and i'm telling you i'm
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:58.360]  talking about officers that are cool a drinking officers i mean officers that back pushed all
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:04.840]  the way even they were very upset by this document they said it's not this can't be true you know then
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:11.480]  uh a few of them looked at the author of the article and they said well part of the course that
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:19.800]  this is probably what comes out of this agency yeah we decided to go with your cell phone because
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:23.960]  it doesn't have a good connection and kind of distort your voice but it's doing its job too
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:29.320]  well right now so just i guess maybe speak a little bit louder for us officer i don't want to give
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:33.880]  that any details about where you are how senior you are but we just appreciate again your courage
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:38.600]  coming on how long ago did you first get emailed this you know came out in the 20th of february
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:46.520]  wasn't around that time it i guess i got it about a week after the 20th that's when i opened and it
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:54.360]  took me that long to digest what was actually on this document and really interpret what they
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:58:00.120]  were trying to tell us well it's a guilt by association document i mean do you agree they mix
[1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:05.960]  white supremacist and cop killers in with basically every libertarian or conservative or
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:11.480]  anti-corruption group under the sun and three popular presidential candidates in a sitting congressman
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:22.280]  yes i do agree exactly amazing guilt by association and then they show american flags and they don't
[1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:26.760]  tread on me and that's used by most of the military is bad if you got that on your car look out for
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:30.600]  folks with these bumper stickers um we're gonna come back in one minute sir 70 second break and
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:35.160]  get into is this profiling on you know what is this meant to do when they give this to the state

[1:59:47.800 --> 1:59:58.760]  horrible food waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:04.840 --> 2:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:21.160]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:27.960]  we are back live now already into hour number three in about 15 minutes we've got uh
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:31.880]  oathkeepers a group for police military and others are saying we're gonna uphold the constitution
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:36.360]  bill of rights very well written very well done side because it's a constitutional lawyer that
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:40.520]  started it a lot of police and military have joined and pledged their oaths protecting the
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:44.680]  constitution bill of rights we've got a gentleman on the line right now state police officer we'll
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.480]  just call him david that's not his name uh his name has been changed to protect the innocent
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:53.640]  those defending the bill of rights the constitution um we're talking about the my act strategic
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:58.440]  report here's the report he sent me got it up on screen right here for you as well this story is
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:04.360]  now huge uh profiling i mean they admit this is sent out to state police it was sent to your state
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:12.200]  police um this is going all over the country that's confirmed we're not going to get into that
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:18.520]  though because that can get into where you're at and i mean what is this meant to give patrol
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:23.080]  officers this because they talk about when they pull you over if you see these bumper stickers if
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.960]  you see this if you see that they start the whole page out with cop killing i guess to prejudice
[2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:32.920]  the police but it doesn't look like it's working too well so is this is this profiling and demonizing
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:40.280]  anybody that disagrees with the government it's actually i i believe it is i believe that it is
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:48.280]  the intent but i don't think it's going to work i think i think the officers in my agency can see
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:55.240]  through this ruse and they understand that this document is meant to enslave the american people
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:02:03.400]  and i don't think it's going to work i i think it misses more it's so obvious it's so obvious to
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:09.880]  lean one way to be a net that encompasses everybody like i like i said even even though i don't have
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:16.920]  that right wing left wing false paradigm but even the right wingers in my particular area office
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:23.240]  see through it clearly and they understand what it is so as a profile document as a document meant
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:31.560]  to teach police officers to profile i think they lost well they're certainly losing now
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:36.440]  congressman ron paul former congressman bob bar and uh presidential candidates uh are
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:44.760]  are saying they're gonna sue if they don't retract this right and you know you know what i think
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:51.400]  what they're trying to do they're trying to train the young officers i mean the really young
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:56.360]  impressionable officers but they don't understand these young officers that are coming into these
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:03:01.000]  departments a lot of them are really smart and sharp they're coming in with four-year degrees
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:07.320]  i know a couple of attorneys that have just started the department and they can see through
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:14.200]  this alex i think these people are running scared now i think you and your office is office and people
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:19.720]  like you have done such a great job in forming an american public that people are seeing through these
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:25.720]  people the american citizens are seeing through these people what type of things where the state
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:34.360]  police officers in your office saying when they read this they were in this this police they said
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:41.240]  hey i like guns just like any other american like guns and i'm not letting nobody take my gun
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:49.560]  and and the ammunition and you know like the two to three round and the three oh eight that
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:54.760]  obama wants to get rid of they say no it's not going to happen they said when they come to get
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:58.920]  well i mean the statements are getting really bad they said they're going to have a hard time
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:05.880]  getting my weapon from me and i say the same you're not getting my weapon unless you try that
[2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:14.200]  my cold dead hand i'm not giving it up i mean would you say 90 percent of the police uh the
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:17.960]  the other state police officers you work with are like this are 50 percent and and and you're
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:22.520]  saying if the statements are getting like sounds like you're saying bordering on we're going to
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:34.360]  resist this i would say 80 to 90 percent of the officers that i spoke to and that's that
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:43.160]  of like 80 officers 90 officers are saying no this is not going to work stay there let's recap
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:46.680]  that when we come back and get anything else you want to cover and your take on this story

[2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:16.840]  foreign offshore banks are engaged in a corporate takeover the united states just
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:20.040]  like they've done to hundreds of third world countries that's all that's happened they're
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:26.440]  announcing i got lawyers world taxes on everything you do to private banks it's all over the news
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:31.800]  there's a new world order so what happens when the state police and police open up these federally
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:38.120]  written reports saying none of this exists you're a violent cop killer if you talk about it if people
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:41.960]  have these bumper stickers look out and we have out of los vegas the footage of them pulling somebody
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:46.040]  over what's that ron paul sticker on your car i guess that's the 10 percent the officer's talking
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:50.520]  about that i guess by this we've got abby newman being pulled over to checkpoint she's got a pocket
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:55.000]  constitution and they grab it and say is this legal and on the squad car video they have a
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.200]  discussion about if she's allowed to have it when all it is is what this country's founded on what
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:05.880]  they swear an oath to uh officer specifically you know the new world order is becoming big news now
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:10.600]  i would imagine the officers you say are getting upset i mean are they going wait a minute this
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:15.240]  they're admitting there's a new world order why are they then saying you you're a cop killer basically
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:22.520]  if you talk about a new world order i don't know exactly why i think that they're reaching i think
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:29.000]  they have during desperation right now they understand that they're being exposed it it's
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:33.800]  like the obama deception i watched it the other day and i can't even make enough copies i have
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:40.840]  officers coming up to me and saying hey job david i understand that you have this this uh
[2:09:40.840 --> 2:09:47.640]  film about obama and you know and i can't even keep copies i gotta make copies constantly over
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:54.680]  of the obama deception and by the way i wish i you guys sent out my dvd so i can make better copies
[2:09:54.680 --> 2:09:58.120]  we have they're shipping right now but imagine we had thousands of orders we got four people back
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:03.800]  there you know since monday just packaging packaging so it's it's on the way and it's one
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:08.680]  and another thing alex you know um since i've been listening to you i've been listening to you
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:15.560]  probably since the end of 2005 and luckily i have because you have saved me in literally hundreds of
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:22.840]  thousands of you got me out of the stock market so for your guests you i sold my own before the
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:29.720]  market crashed and all of these things the other officers realized and i tell them you know alex
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:36.280]  jones has saved me money and so that pushes them to you and now the obama deception and now this
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:43.160]  this my document is further pushing people towards your show so your your radio show because they
[2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:49.720]  know that you're giving out the truth why do you think people were in denial even state
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:53.400]  reps and people that know i tell the truth when they when they first saw it they couldn't believe
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:57.000]  it then they called the state police and they said yeah that's our document we're proud of it
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:06.120]  well but it was so over the top you know it's like there's a quickening developing right now
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  you probably can feel it i can feel it they know it's tipping over right now and we were getting
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:20.680]  the right amount of people waking up where it's going to have a deluge effect on on this country
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:27.720]  america is going to wake up and improve well what happens you know with tipping points in history
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:32.360]  is it can tip into evil or tip into good and because we've done the groundwork and warn people and
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:36.200]  because we were right about what was going to happen and what was going to develop and people
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:41.480]  have seen that in hindsight with my 22 films and the work we've done but countless others out there
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:45.800]  fighting that we have a fighting chance in this but people need to know the enemy will stage terror
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:50.360]  attacks the enemy will release bioplagues i mean these people are hardcore killers they
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:57.160]  funded hitler stalin mal lennon poll pot is a big new brzezinski obama chief advisor
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:03.240]  brags in two books he wrote about how they do i mean these people are sick and so just because
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:08.600]  people are waking up i don't people think we're out of this this is deep this is serious and the
[2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:12.200]  new world order is going to hurt everybody out there you know i i've made mistakes in the past i had
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:25.400]  by the police that have been brainwashed and been militarized and then i lash out instead of
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:29.880]  historically reach out to police and military and they are waking up now look ron paul got
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:34.360]  more contributions from the military anybody else and that's how we're going to defeat this
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:39.080]  as jack mclean says we've got to have the police on our side because the truth is we're all on the
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:42.520]  same side even if we decide to fight with each other when we fight with each other the new
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:50.680]  order wins your comments on that officer well i i agree with you i know what side i'm on and
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:57.240]  a lot of the police officers i talk to they know what side they're on and i tell them that you
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:01.320]  know you're going to have a choice to make one day you're going to be asked to do some horrible
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:06.120]  things and you have to think about it right now are you going to take people's guns away from them
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:13.080]  are you going to force people into cattle cars remember what hitler did i impressed this upon
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:18.200]  at least the young officers the old officers they understand what's going on where this country is
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:22.920]  going and they understand they have to wake up and they have to be on the side of american
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:33.160]  and we took an oath and i remind these people that this oath is for our country we have to defend
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:38.200]  this constitution this is the best constitution in the world we have to keep it enforced
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:45.240]  now basically this report takes the constitution the bill of rights everything good and wholesome
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:52.520]  and then just spray paints white supremacist cop killer all over it in an attempt to demonize
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:58.680]  the very heart of this country it's it's it's asinine it's a fraud and i am just buoyed by the fact
[2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:04.200]  that so many police and military are waking up not from my information but from the over the top
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:12.920]  nature of the criminal fed government's propaganda right and in couple with what obama's doing right
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:20.280]  now he's doing what you predicted he would do i mean with his gun control he he's doing exactly
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.920]  what you're saying he's trying to stop us from having two to three rounds from having 308 rounds
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:32.440]  and this is not it's not going to work well i mean i i'd like to brag and say i'm real smart but
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:36.920]  i'm really not i just go off what the white papers in government and corporations say they're
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:41.880]  going to do versus what they publicly say on the news i mean my job's like reading the tv guide
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:49.160]  i mean the un on july 7th 2001 at the uniter meeting in new york with thousands in attendance said
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:56.200]  we're going to take every civilian owned firearm period single-shot black powder we're going to take
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:03.240]  all of it so you know that's their goal and so we're just laying it out i mean now the veterans
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.880]  found out that obama was planning to make them get their own insurance i mean the people are
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:13.640]  finding out that that it's a bunch of made-off criminals the state police in your organization
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:19.880]  i mean are they aware of the banker takeover and how that's a scam as well well not quite that's
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:25.880]  a little too esoteric for them i try to explain to some of them some of them get it some way some
[2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:33.400]  portions of it but they don't get it total totally you know um that's a little bit of
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:35.880]  difficult row to hoe
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:44.040]  but you're saying on the second amendment issue and because of document cop killer white supremacist
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:48.520]  we've got to restrict guns you know they they mix that in they saw through that right they
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:55.160]  seemed clearly through that because like i said a lot of them almost majority of them you know we
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:16:03.000]  they have guns they have rifles they go to ranges that we shoot and i guess there's some of them
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:07.720]  were called gun nuts you know and they're not going to get their guns they're not
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:14.120]  but they are trying to they are trying to hire a bunch of social worker mainline liberal types
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:19.160]  who are anti-gun to be police but once they get into the culture it is a pro second amendment
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:23.960]  pro self-defense culture it i mean the 10 percent that our brainwash what do they like
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:32.600]  uh a few of them are obama supporters and a couple of my nose mainly because they're white
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:42.840]  and they get harassed for it um you know it's kind of hard to have a cookie cutter for them
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:47.240]  they run runs again it you know they could be left and right but
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:56.040]  well but i mean you're saying that 10 percent though are just buying this i mean they get a
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:00.040]  thing saying basically ron paul supporters or terrorists libertarians or terrorists and they
[2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:07.800]  just they buy that they buy it about 10 percent but they get harassed wake up you know
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:15.320]  by you know the other officers they harass them about it come on you guys gotta wake up this
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:22.520]  one article and actually it sits right on my briefing table in the briefing room and so
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:30.200]  people view it every day and make fun of it you know this is this was i think the coup de grace
[2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:37.880]  for the new world order at least in this little battle because this is is waking a lot of people
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:44.440]  up as to what's really going on in this country well i think the police i talked to are starting
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:48.920]  to realize too that's it's not going to be a fun job trying to disarm the american people because
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:55.560]  10 percent of gun owners are a lot of them are veterans they're not happy about life the economy
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:18:01.960]  if 10 percent of 140 million gun owners fight back we're talking about 10 million 14 million
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:06.520]  people i mean do the police ever talk about what it would be like to try to go out and confiscate
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:15.720]  guns no no not specifically i i i don't think they it's going to come they don't think it's
[2:18:15.720 --> 2:18:21.480]  gonna come to that but i try to put that little thought in their head so they at least think
[2:18:21.480 --> 2:18:29.080]  about it so when that decision does arrive at least they have thought about it well they'll
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:33.000]  keep doing it incrementally and and and but uh you know i just hope that officers are supposed to
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:38.040]  judge the law as well as the facts have a wide discretion uh because i mean i've read over the
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:43.320]  law and i just i just you know i know most police are pro second amendment because they understand
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:47.640]  guns are not stupid but then you've got that other type where you can be in the countryside now in
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:52.200]  east texas walking across the road to your land to go bird hunt a couple pull up and say what's
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:57.080]  that shotgun for so there's certainly that percentage that 10 percent well i mean i'm sure
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:01.480]  you've heard about ron paul supporters that have been harassed and now we know why now well why do
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:08.920]  you have a ron paul sticker well why are you asking yes i have heard about ron paul supporters
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:16.280]  since i am one being harassed and so look forward and like you said i i want to uh jason
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:20.120]  bermas said keep a tape recorder with you and i do keep a tape recorder in my car and
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:26.440]  and yeah and i do carry a badge and everything but i still keep a tape recorder because

[2:24:09.880 --> 2:24:19.320]  i fell into a curtain ring of fire i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burned
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:25.080]  kirk nemo's got the story of balvin paul and bar send letter in opposition to myant report
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:30.360]  the missouri officials good job kirk nemo on that one letter up there soon but we need to add in here
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:36.520]  that they're considering suing that needs to be in the headline you know they're considering
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:43.000]  litigation if lies not retracted or demonization not retracted something like paul uh you know
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:52.760]  ron paul bob bar bald one write letter to my report demonizing uh you know their supporters
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.560]  and the needs to be in the first line i'm doing editing even here on the air ladies and gentlemen
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:00.520]  it's insane we're joined the rest of the hour and i apologize for getting him on light but we said
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:05.400]  i have a state police officer on but it's a perfect segue into this he steward roads created a great
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:10.760]  website it's constitutional lawyer but masses of military and police have been uh saying they
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:15.160]  pledged to be oath keepers and i violate the bill rights constitution and and and to follow their
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.440]  oath uh and it's it's when i read it i said this person has a deep knowledge of what's going on
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:23.640]  because this is how i would have written it probably better than i would have written it
[2:25:23.640 --> 2:25:27.880]  so uh steward roads thanks for coming on sir well you're welcome and you're absolutely right that
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:36.440]  was a fantastic segue that officer is an oath keeper and that's exactly what we are here to do
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:42.280]  is to bring more men like that out and most of the members of our of our organization don't use
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.840]  their real names or we don't even want to know who they are because just like that gentleman
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:50.840]  they're just dead uh we want them to be able to continue in their job and continue doing
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:55.400]  the good work for the american people but because the federal government is so out of control and
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:59.480]  criminal uh i mean that's a sad testament that these officers don't even really have their own
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:04.600]  first amendment to say they don't appreciate the country being destroyed that's right and standing
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:09.160]  up and saying you might might actually obey the constitution it gets you can so that's that's the
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:13.480]  world we live in right now but uh you've you've probably been to our site you can see the the
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:17.720]  four testimonials we have in from veterans most the veterans are not afraid to put their name
[2:26:17.720 --> 2:26:21.960]  on it because they're you know they're uh no longer within reach of being punished for it
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:26.200]  and um they're standing up and saying no we're not going to do this and and the veterans are
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:32.040]  very important because the veterans are there to teach the young bucks how to behave to show them
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:35.640]  what they're supposed to be doing and so that's our that's our mission is to remind them of the
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:41.080]  oath to teach them what it was they swore an oath to defend and then to steal their resolve to do
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:46.120]  what's right and that officer is correct you've got to do that in advance you got to do it ahead of
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.920]  time so that when you draw your own lines in the sand and prepare yourself mentally to do what's
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:58.360]  right and then you'll do it absolutely um just amazing testimonials on the site what gave you
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:03.080]  the idea to create this and how many people have come on the site and pledged in just a few weeks
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:08.040]  it's been up that they're going to stand by the constitution bill of rights well i was working
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:13.560]  for uh in congress paul's uh campaign here in Nevada i used to work in his dc office and but
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:17.400]  i was so focused on the campaign but about a year and a half ago i had the idea that you know what
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:22.920]  do we do next and uh if this campaign is not successful what's our next move and my thought
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:29.480]  was as well what's what's our focus of effort beyond the men with the guns if you're going to have
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:34.760]  an awakening of one million people so you're going to have a chance to awaken one million people
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:39.480]  to be constitutionalist would you want to focus on the military and and and those are the men who
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:47.560]  are supposed to be our guardians exactly if they're the guardians of the republic that's what they are
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:51.640]  yes if tyranny if tyranny is going to come it's going to come in the form of a uniform
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:55.800]  the ron paul revolution's probably woken up the even maitre media says probably 20 30 million
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:01.480]  americans identify now imagine if we focused on the police and military game over for the new
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:05.960]  world order go ahead exactly precisely it's like maneuver warfare theory you go to the
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:09.480]  you go to the rear of the enemy you go to the heart of their strength it's kind of like in one of
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:13.560]  the rings how the ring of power they think the ring of power is that these guys are going to do
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:17.960]  whatever they say they think the oath is their ring of power but it's not true the oath is to
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:22.680]  the constitution and even more fundamentally it's to the people and so we're going to take that
[2:28:22.680 --> 2:28:28.440]  like the mount doom and toss the right you know right up their chute oh man that analogy is just
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:35.080]  pure gold you are something special let me tell you something i i write for swat magazine and
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:39.640]  here's what actually got me thinking about this is is about a year and a half ago i wrote a column
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:46.120]  and in response to that column we got a letter from a us uh jr yule colonel us army retired
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:49.960]  and he said the constitution and our bill of rights are gravely endangered today
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:55.320]  and this community of military and veterans of law enforcement is where they will be saved
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.280]  if they have to be saved at all and he had the same insight you did is look if they can't do it
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:04.200]  without those guys game over if you like the end of the movie v for vendetta
[2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:08.440]  that you know the military stands down and there's nothing between the people
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:13.560]  and the vultures nothing and that's what our goal is well i mean police are going to lose
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:17.240]  their houses they already are they're going to lose their future in this new world order that's
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:20.760]  right they're going to lose their second amendment yeah next year we'll be indentured
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:26.600]  servants for the rest of their lives that's right yeah the globalists have overplayed
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.360]  their hand i keep telling listeners the phony churches on government payroll i told you this
[2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:38.600]  a decade ago now it's declassified are telling you to stand down so there's several rings of power
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:43.880]  one is the police and the enforcers the others is the churches got to take those back stay there
[2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:52.680]  sir run tell folks how they can visit the outkeepers website when we come back we're on the march

[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:11.720]  when it comes to heroes renegades are mine and we're going back to the mordor analogy you have
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:16.520]  the tower the mountain of power with the all-seeing eye with its armies moving across the world but
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:25.800]  right here in its command base right here in empire us it is distracted looking looking everywhere
[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:32.040]  for the ring it's that's what this my act report is is they're counting on the police and military
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:39.080]  being urakai or orcs or black ships from the east they're they're planning on them going along
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:46.040]  along with this evil and being seduced by the dark side by by by being played and manipulated
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:50.600]  and maneuvered into war with the american people as they destroy their own futures as they burn
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:57.000]  their own beds their own nest it's going to fail it is going to fail you have to first
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:02.040]  believe that and know that and reach out to the police and military now so they understand
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:06.440]  and educate them waking up one police officer one activity military persons like waking up
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:12.840]  a thousand regular americans now we have to also understand that the key here is is there's people
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:20.840]  like steward rode's over there with oath dash keepers dot blogspot dot com oath dash keepers
[2:35:20.840 --> 2:35:25.240]  dot blogspot dot com or just google his name steward rode's oath keepers and it'll come up for you
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:30.200]  we've got it up on screen right now prism panna dot tv the fact that there is ron paul and alex
[2:35:30.200 --> 2:35:36.040]  jones and steward rode's and jesse ventura and thousands of other prominent people fighting
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:40.680]  not just millions waking up and fighting they they killed me and only makes my information grow
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:44.200]  that much faster if i was the only guy doing this though i'd be dead if steward was the only guy
[2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:48.600]  doing this they go set him up or something but there's too many of us now they can't target
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:52.760]  intimidate they had the ron paul girl in here last night i didn't know that she was on my show last
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:59.320]  time they were waiting for her outside you know amy allen with crowbars stealing nothing just
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:04.600]  put her in the hospital breaking bones that is the type of intimidation i've been physically
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:08.360]  attacked and they've told me shut up or you're dead next time but i fought back and fought him
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:12.040]  off and they didn't like getting hurt real i got hurt bad too but they were you know they were
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:17.080]  surprised that i wasn't a sheep and i actually went absolutely ape because i'm not a slave folks
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:21.880]  you attack me i attack right back quite frankly the time enjoyed it you know i mean that's just how
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:26.440]  i am uh that's living there you know you don't really live until four people are pounding on you
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:30.920]  but sad for her she's a little girl they hurt her bad but you can't let that scare you got to say
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:35.720]  oh that means i'm hurting you that means i'm getting close to the crack of doom to dump this ring in
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:40.040]  you have to dare great ladies and gentlemen and you can succeed okay i'm gonna shut up i made those
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:44.200]  points it's just that they're also trying to divide our movements trying to demonize trying to say
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:47.800]  don't trust this leader don't trust that leader that's the operatives that's what cointel pro does
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.960]  this person's a mason that that you know that person's a vatican assassin this person works for
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:57.080]  israel it's the information that's key bill of rights constitution liberty second amendment
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:02.440]  national sovereignty cut the size of government kick them out of the states you know a tree by its
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:09.880]  fruits so the other attack is to divide us now go ahead and comment on those points to our roads
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:16.520]  and let's get into the outkeepers we're absolutely right and that's why both keepers we always stress
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:22.520]  that this was this was this was uh first um contemplated in first plan before the election
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:25.960]  we didn't care who got elected it didn't make a difference who was going to be president
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:29.880]  we saw the growth of executive power and we're talking about active duty military
[2:37:29.880 --> 2:37:34.760]  and veterans and and these gentlemen don't care who's who's president we're looking at the big
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:40.120]  picture and we're also we stay neutral on uh on politics we stay neutral on the iraq war
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:45.480]  in fact i'll be i'll be um speaking at possibly speaking at a big event in june a big pro troops
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:51.240]  rally in june i was invited by uh former navy seal captain larry bailey of gathering of eagles
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:55.560]  so one of the more hardcore conservative groups who might not have listened during bush
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:00.120]  are starting to wake up and understand what the what the great danger is and so we're seeing an
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:05.320]  awakening like the officer said it's a quickening and it doesn't make a difference forget about
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:09.400]  left and right and forget about that kind of stuff like you said before it's about liberty
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:13.960]  or tyranny that's the only that's the dividing line and so we go back to the basics we go back
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:19.160]  to the first independence we go back to the bill of right we go back to the constitution those are
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:27.080]  our all those are common bond absolutely that's all we care about and you swore an oath to defend
[2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:31.400]  the constitution and you swore an oath more fundamentally to defend the people of this
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:36.040]  country and that's all we care about that's what really matters and their interest their
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:40.040]  interest is with the american people too of course well you know what they don't belong to the
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:45.400]  mordor and the petomac they belong to us they're our fathers they're our sons they're our sisters
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:52.200]  they're our uncles they are us they don't belong to them they belong to us we're taking that's right
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:57.400]  that's right they don't belong to mordor do they no they don't yeah and then we're taking them back
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:03.640]  and they belong to mitis chereth that's the whole thing and you know and that's and that's why they
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:09.240]  have to demonize people that's why you saw hr 1955 with a bipartisan assault on the american people
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:15.000]  first thing you do is you label someone the enemy you you you make them the other dehumanize them
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  and then if you turn the forces against them and so but we're fighting back and uh i think
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.920]  i think your short your show is important in that you know what i think what the military and
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:28.840]  police are the biggest and we've confirmed this with state police and military everywhere and
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:33.080]  it's even been in the news but we knew about it before it was me i mean the point is before it
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:37.160]  was in the news they're telling them the you know mainline americans are about to start bombing
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:41.240]  police stations we've got to do ied training the army is going to be on the streets of america
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:44.040]  there'll be a new world order but it's good and those that are against their bad
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:49.160]  right that they're now seeing the whole apparatus that was supposedly to fight al qaeda
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:53.720]  has now been swung around like a cannon and aimed at the american people and the police and
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:59.560]  military are going whoa that's right yeah in fact we just we just now put up on our our site
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:05.400]  an article on uh on how enemy combatant status was first proposed during the clinton administration
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:11.000]  most folks don't realize that but that idea of using tribunals for even american citizens was
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:16.200]  first proposed during the clinton years to be used against migraine the militias and what clinton
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:22.120]  didn't do bush unfortunately put into put into full effect and now obama's got it and it's very
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:26.440]  likely he'll turn around around and apply it domestically you know to average to average gun
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:30.120]  owners that's the big that's what we think might be the next spark you know going back to the
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:36.120]  mortemortor analogy it's just too good remember when the keeper of the fortress goes insane and says
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.600]  no we're all dead and starts pouring oil on himself saying we can't beat him there's nothing
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:46.280]  we can do and sets himself on fire that's that that's the spirit more than just waking up police
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:53.880]  military it's the change is an inside job it's all of us have to decide victory is ours and when
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:58.920]  and it's not just it's not just a spirit or an idea it's the truth we have incredible power
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:05.240]  but we have to prepare ourselves steal ourselves as you said like steel to understand this work
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.080]  and just commit and when you commit and aren't worried if they demonize you set you up kill
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:12.760]  you whatever they're going to do you just commit it's like a million pound weight goes off of you
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:17.800]  and you're truly alive and you're now and you're now in communion with the founding fathers
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:22.600]  and every other rebel against tyranny in history that's right we're all gonna die anyway no one
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:27.240]  gets out of here alive so what counts is whether you leave your children free that's all that matters
[2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:32.280]  that's all that matters that's really it and and take back your analogy there you know they want
[2:41:32.280 --> 2:41:36.440]  you to think it's hopeless you know that yeah it's like you're like you're staring into the
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:40.280]  you know the end of the you're seeing only their propaganda if only you all you do is
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:44.520]  is is look at what they want you to see you'll think it's hopeless that's right he's staring
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:49.560]  into the crystal and that's only what it's a tv set it's only what mordor wants them to see
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:54.440]  that's exactly right they're like well said break your tv you know break that break that
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:58.520]  stuff and get on the get on the web and and communicate with your fellow man and here's
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:03.080]  the thing about oak keepers it's positive that's why people respond to it so much it's positive
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:07.960]  it's not just more negativity they're starting to see the other side of the look you know like
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:13.080]  you said we have we have the strength and we have the power and you can't just assume the
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:17.320]  military is your enemy you can't just assume police are your enemy they want you to think
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:21.640]  that they want to know i have fallen i have fallen into that i mean over the years i've also
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:26.120]  got to reach out to them when i see the outrage i was wondering about five years ago why does the
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:30.040]  media show the worst police brutality over and over again why do they focus on it so much and
[2:42:30.040 --> 2:42:35.160]  then i realized they want to split us apart which puts the police more in their gang mentality and
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:39.800]  the people more in their mentality and that's why they're advertising and i'm actually helping them
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:44.280]  when i point when i make a big deal out of it right well you know you gotta have a
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:48.280]  truth like Patrick Henry said you gotta see the truth and you know know that we know exactly we
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:53.400]  put the truth out but but but we have to also add understand they're encouraging officers to act
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:57.560]  like this and understand they're not all like this and if we fall in to just hating them and
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:43:01.960]  being threatened by them that's what they want that's right and and and that's that's one of the
[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:06.360]  dogs having a man like he just had on where he tells you that look not all officers like this and
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:11.000]  and you'd be surprised we have a testimony look on our site by a police officer i'm gonna find
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.920]  it here what we're talking and i'll read it to you but he just basically says look the majority
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:20.520]  of the guys in my force agree we won't do these things and and so i'm getting i'm hearing that
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:24.120]  from marines too i got a marine sergeant the other day i talked to on the phone he's like
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:27.800]  i talked to my guys about this stuff all the time and i make sure they know they're out
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:31.640]  a lot of the young guys they first get to his unit they think that they're up as to the president
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:35.640]  and they have to set him straight you know but but but now more and more are talking about this
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:39.880]  stuff and that was going on you know before we we thought it was keepers it was going on already
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:43.400]  so we're just kind of tapping into what's already happening i'm looking for that right now
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  here we go uh this officer says uh he's a texas police officer because after serving the navy
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:54.680]  from 90 to 93 on board the uss blue ridge i became a police officer i'm still on the force
[2:43:55.240 --> 2:43:59.320]  not only will i refuse any unlawful order that violates the constitution that will
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:03.640]  fight the tyrants that give the orders rest assured that me and my brothers in law enforcement
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:09.880]  talk about this subject on a regular basis about 80 till the same way i do i ask the rookies that
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:15.960]  when it comes down to nut cutting whose side will you be on founding fathers made this country so great
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:21.720]  or the tyrants that are in power now i took the oath twice and will uphold it twofold god bless
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:26.440]  america and you signed his name call him commonly some some people are willing to put their names
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:31.240]  on it uh other folks understandably or not so but that's the that's the sentiment we're getting
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:36.600]  we're getting flooded emails like that saying yeah we're we're we're we're with you you know
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:43.160]  well i would add to this that you're getting into the spiritual angle of this standing up for liberty
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:49.560]  and goodness you know as as marlithar king said the universe bends towards truth towards justice
[2:44:51.080 --> 2:44:56.120]  that it's provenance and if you don't understand that folks when you decide to fight evil and and
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:44:59.880]  really get your head straight and and you really are fighting evil not being manipulated into
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:03.640]  fighting some red herring the establishment gives you they're very good at that it's like a
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:08.840]  electrical connection it it's spiritual and then when i said that earlier you literally then connect
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:13.560]  in to the founding fathers and everybody else that stood up for goodness you you know you can
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:17.080]  you literally connect into the disciples who were fighting the corruption of rome
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:23.480]  you literally it it's it's like a barrier a dam is removed when you start standing up for freedom
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:27.400]  because that's that's all that matters in the world that's always a struggle between good and
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:31.400]  evil there's always evil trying to take over there's always evil trying to dominate this
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:36.200]  is what life is all about is you know defending liberty and freedom and building things and making
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:41.720]  life better that's right and you know first thing you gotta do is you gotta not let fear control you
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:46.680]  you gotta say you gotta you look at the big picture and realize that that's what that's the value of
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:52.520]  of the oath is that everyone has taken that oath in the military you know they did so understand
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:58.520]  and they could mean their life and and these men they take it so seriously still i've gotten letters
[2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:03.000]  it's i can't read them i'll start i'll start following but letters from vietnam veterans
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:09.480]  and korean war veterans and and they still take that oath serious to this day and and they understand
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:17.960]  that they have a line going all the way back to to you know the men of april 1917 75 even before that
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:23.880]  you know that they understand that the line of men who have fought and bled and died for freedom
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:30.760]  and they understand that all those men gave them the sacred trust and now it's it's it's their watch
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:37.240]  that's why our motto is is not on our watch because now it's our turn to make sure that the
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:43.560]  white of liberty does not go out because if america falls the world will fall into an age
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:48.600]  of darkness and that's the truth and these guys they know it and they're they're waking up well
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:54.360]  look at north korea look at china look at mexico they're all falling into total corruption mass
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:47:00.520]  murder and open sewage running down the streets that's what evil does it just it just in and very
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:04.600]  few nations in history we haven't been perfect here in the u.s but compared to others it's been
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:09.160]  amazing four percent of the world's population half the world's wealth until the bankers took
[2:47:09.160 --> 2:47:13.720]  over now they're taking it from us and that was produced here and again that's what a little bit
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:19.400]  of liberty we haven't been perfect but it's a lot compared to other countries the jewel of liberty
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:24.840]  as thomas jefferson said must be guarded it is the engine of everything good that's it i mean
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:29.480]  that's it freedom is all that matters and as as franklin said those who would give up freedom for
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:34.280]  for perceived security will have neither and so you can't give up freedom and it's the it's the
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:39.080]  fundamental what you just said it's the engine of all that's good and and so that the uh the secret
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:45.160]  is is not to let fear control you and since 9 11 people have been so afraid they've allowed
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:50.520]  all the infrastructure but with the talent for an estate to be put into place and as you know
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  and so now now what we have to do jeffa stop it you don't stop it in the courts
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:57.160]  and you and apparently you don't stop it in congress either they'll go ahead and do whatever
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:02.840]  they want anyway what you do is you stop it at the base level of the people to sing no and that
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:08.440]  includes an example i was on 93.7 fm for an hour yesterday downtown during south by southwest
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:16.040]  and i walked by three police and they were all fans of the show i wanted to shake my hand so
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:21.880]  you know that's an example that's an example even after all of my you know ranting and raving
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:25.800]  you know they've told me hey we don't like what's happening either and we don't like how the media
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:31.560]  just totally focuses on the bad cops and so i could see i was i've also been fooled by that spell
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:36.520]  you know as i get older i learn more and more how this sophisticated mind control system works
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:41.240]  all of us you know are waking up together and i agree i mean when i say on there i feel a quickening
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:47.000]  i see a quickening it's like i just you know jumped off a 300 foot cliff into cold icy water you
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:51.640]  know i mean it's invigorating it's bracing it's like whoa and then to realize that myself and
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:59.800]  others are at the very center of a crossroads that is the future destiny of humanity that's right
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:05.640]  people look back on this time it's going to dwarf the importance of 1776 i believe it might well it
[2:49:05.640 --> 2:49:10.200]  might well and that's that's the key is to break the spell you know if they've been under a spell
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:15.560]  and we've been under a spell and it's time to break it absolutely and so what what we did is we
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:20.920]  issued a declaration of 10 orders we will not obey and that's what's kind of causing that kind of a
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:25.160]  lot of controversy and firestorm and when i go around the web i look at different forums are
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:30.760]  discussing it it's what's happening is exactly what we wanted to happen we want we wanted veterans
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:35.560]  and current serving military to have discussions about where their line is each person has
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:40.600]  their own i mean every serve every service member has an obligation that just not just that they
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:47.480]  can refuse it a legal order or an awful order they have an obligation to they have to and so they
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:52.360]  have to make a decision for themselves where that line is and so as the office said a minute ago
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:56.760]  you have to do it ahead of time so that's our declaration of 10 orders we carefully crafted
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:50:02.520]  these to tie into american history because the history is repeating itself much of the causes
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:06.760]  of revolution are happening again and also the history of the 20th century with it with the
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:13.320]  deaf camps and mass internment and what we see happening today it all flows together so do you
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:17.880]  want to go down to the 10 orders or yeah let's do that in the next segment and if you can stay
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:21.400]  five minutes the next hour that our next guest is coming on i want to invite you back routinely
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:25.000]  i know you're a busy guy but you need to talk to an Anderson maybe get a genesis radio show or
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.280]  something you're very very eloquent when we come back we'll go over the 10 points but what i like
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:34.440]  is that you know that huge romp whole revolution at first people like oh it went nowhere and i said
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:39.080]  no it's a delayed explosion like in force 10 navarone when they bomb the dam and they're like
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:43.640]  where is it he's just said just just sitting there smoking a pipe just wait a moment uh you know
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:48.120]  that's how and then suddenly it starts breaking boom and and and now we're seeing that and then
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:52.360]  people realize they can defeat the enemy in the info war and now they're just blasting they're
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:57.400]  picking up arms in the revolution of the mind people are taking the red pills they're waking up
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:01.240]  and i'm seeing people like you from the ron paul campaign and others disperse out and start did

[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:25.800]  conscription of the american people bill and i happen to have the army code that the pentagon
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:32.920]  has issued saying it will be forced military service i mean the the hour is late but that's
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:37.720]  okay it is dark before the dawn and so i think i think uh i think it's pretty clear that we're
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:41.800]  going to stand tall that's why that's why we bumped up our program we're going to do a
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:46.760]  you know a regular site but we saw that things were happening in fact i called the colonel half
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:52.680]  good also of the isle of national guard and he lied to me like he lied to you they have a dedicated
[2:55:52.680 --> 2:55:57.000]  mouth facility 80 miles berth of that town they're going to do the exercise and and he just flat
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  lied to us and so that's one thing that got us got us hopping mad and decided to put it up on
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:05.640]  blog spot first one thing i do want to say i want to i want to let folks know that i'd write for
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:10.360]  swat magazine and i want to make clear that that's a magazine and that's you know most people think
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:14.280]  it's just for law enforcement it's not and the gentlemen who run that magazine are dedicated
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:18.920]  patriots and they're going to get both keepers uh free ad space so i encourage folks to check
[2:56:18.920 --> 2:56:25.560]  out swat magazine uh run by true patriots um so that's my plug for them now yeah give out the
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:30.760]  website because no that's good we have to take the high ground here that's right yeah you bet
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:34.520]  just and and their mission has always been that's why they ask me to write that column he's got
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:40.120]  clear wolf right it you know clear wolf is correct yes right she's to write it the enemy the gate
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:56:44.360]  column and she has to take it over when she got gonna burn out but their mission is to make sure
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:48.840]  that there's the separation between law enforcement and and the people is broken down they don't
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:54.280]  believe there should be a separation and so rich lucid bellow the man in own swat um has has stood
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:59.160]  up and dedicated that that entire column every month to the mission of of uh defending the
[2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:04.040]  bill right well we knew this would come when the new world order emerged and admitted everything
[2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:07.720]  we've been warning people about that's why i said even if we get laughed at tell people the documents
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:11.320]  tell them the truth because when they finally emerge when they make their big move which is now
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:16.280]  happening uh then people would have been warned and then they would wake up but also as the police
[2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:21.480]  and military are being twisted in their mission now to carry out the globalism that would be the
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:27.400]  big wake up call there i think the enemy trying to program them right now is the is is waking police
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:33.000]  and military up faster than even the patriots absolutely and of course obama is is acting
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:36.920]  like a complete fool with what he did with it with the uh with the veterans and forced them to
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:41.400]  to care for them pay for their own medical care it's just a huge wonder to show the arrogance
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:46.680]  you know the hubris oh yeah and so the the anger and outrage they're blind they can't see
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:51.320]  certain because they're almost autistic in some ways they just we're about to break we're only
[2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:55.320]  having like five yeah they're they're they're delusional uh we're about to break but start
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:58:00.520]  with the 10 points you betcha well the 10 points are just what we think are the most likely uh
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:05.960]  hot points and trip wires and what we uh think officers should be considering and soldiers
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:11.160]  as the lines in the sand they will not cross number one is we will not obey any order to
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:15.480]  disarm the american people and that was like you know that was the cause of the first american
[2:58:15.480 --> 2:58:21.560]  revolution and they're only the final part lexington and concord continue number two
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:24.840]  number two we will not obey orders to conduct worthless searches of the american people
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:28.200]  and they're again the rip of the system for worthless searches for one of the causes the
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:32.760]  american revolution and number three is we will not obey orders to detain american citizens
[2:58:32.760 --> 2:58:37.320]  that's unlawful enemy combat or to protect them the military tribunal stay there we've

[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:52.920]  that's what that's kind of a reflection on the uh the initiatives that come out recently where
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:57.320]  states are standing up and say we're going to impose ourselves between the federal government
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:01:02.280]  and our own people yeah and that was an issue back in the 1770s because they would remove
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:07.480]  governors or legislatures and put in puppets but go ahead exactly number six is you will not obey
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:12.280]  any order to blockade american cities with us turning them into giant concentration camps
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:16.200]  and that was first done to boston at the time of the american revolution as you just said
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:21.400]  boston was put under military uh dictatorship with general gauge and then when the fighting
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:26.360]  started the people of boston were told you turn in your guns will give you safe passes out of the
[3:01:26.360 --> 3:01:30.520]  city and they turned their guns in and then they were told they could not leave and they were kept
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:36.040]  there and then it was turned into a concentration camp until until until the uh militia showed up
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:41.160]  and can take the British out of boston so number seven is we will not obey any order to force american
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:46.680]  citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext and we fight the history an unfortunate
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:51.240]  history of the japanese internment here at home and also the history around the world oppressive
[3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:55.560]  governments when they make war on their own people they put them into camps in part that's done
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.640]  to they put women and children into camps so that the men who are fighting will will turn
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:04.120]  themselves in um on behalf of their children women and the schools public schools admit they've
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:09.080]  been drilling to grab kids without asking on fema buses and then tell parents to report so their
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:12.520]  tyranny does the same thing over and over again continue that's right number eight we will not
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:17.560]  obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on us soil against the american
[3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:22.680]  people to keep the peace or to maintain control and as you know these uh we've you've been hearing
[3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:27.480]  rumors of this for for decades but we're now hearing the same rumors once again from very
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:32.680]  credible sources that the obama administration is even considering bringing in foreign troops
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:38.920]  the agreements have been signed toronto star canadian mexican trips to be used i4 trips to
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:43.560]  be used those are not rumors i have hundreds of mainstream articles if you'd like them absolutely
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:50.920]  the email to me go ahead no go ahead go ahead no no it's just that no i mean i've had colonel
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:55.480]  craig robertson others on who have had like their nephews at west point and they and you know they
[3:02:55.480 --> 3:02:59.240]  send in famous generals to tell them we're going to use foreign troops but it's a good thing so no
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:03.560]  that is going on that's not a rumor so i i know i just i just like that i don't like to have my
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:07.800]  bath with people well i mean it's true they're planning it the rumor is they may bring them in
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:12.360]  i see what you're saying go ahead right exactly we will not obey any orders to confiscate the
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:16.280]  property of american people including food and other essential supplies that's number nine
[3:03:16.280 --> 3:03:19.800]  that's in the public executive orders they're planning that so that's probably go
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:24.760]  yep we will not obey any orders which are fringe on the right of the people to free speech
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:29.080]  peacefully assemble and petition their government for redistributed i mean all these are basic
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:35.480]  they should be common sense you know you know no brainers but unfortunately as you know you have
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:39.400]  to remind people of the basics sometimes we can't take it for granted that someone's gonna
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:43.640]  be thinking about this stuff ahead of time we could print it out you know we're hearing now that
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:48.200]  a lot of that was caught because those guard troops and those those uh those officers
[3:03:48.200 --> 3:03:51.640]  hadn't thought about it ahead of time they're kind of like caught flat footed when they were
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:55.560]  told to go do these things and so we want them to think about it in advance and we don't think
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:03:59.480]  it's going to go down the same way again that's right Iowa was a gun confiscation drill that's
[3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:04.840]  admitted and then they sent out 22 mps and a colonel to the alabama shooting and now they're
[3:04:04.840 --> 3:04:09.720]  looking at charges of positive commentators violation that's right that's a good sign it's a
[3:04:09.720 --> 3:04:14.520]  good sign that within the military there's still people who understand the the necessary
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:20.200]  walls separation between civil and military power and and take it serious so yeah we're very
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:25.000]  confident we feel very good about this one thing i do want to ask your listeners to do um we are
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:33.080]  going to be doing a tribute video to men who served and so we'd like to have them send us in photos

[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:31.080]  in just a few minutes we're going to go directly to our guest to apologize for reschedule twice last
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:34.760]  week so much has been happening so he's written an amazing book i've already read most of it
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:39.160]  somewhere in here in the office will somebody find me that new world order book corporatism the secret
[3:08:39.160 --> 3:08:43.000]  government of the new world order talking to this professor here in just a moment researcher
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:50.200]  but finishing up with steward roads of oath dash keepers dot blog spot dot com let me tell
[3:08:50.200 --> 3:08:57.000]  you everybody here how they're gonna attack what you're doing and it's with fear again um intimidation
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:00.920]  to police and military that speak out but as more and more speak out it's kind of like in
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:04.280]  those famous you know historical things where we have a church full of people in the revolutionary
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:07.960]  war and they'll say who stands with us it takes about a minute and one guy steps forward and
[3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:12.600]  then two step forward then everybody steps forward same thing with the alamo in 1836
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:18.440]  the enemy and i bet if i google this it's already out there it's gonna say don't sign up for this
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:25.240]  it's feds getting your name in the list and they're gonna get you you have to be i've always said this
[3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:30.440]  out in the open resisting the new world order speaking out he involved that we are the majority
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:36.760]  we have to shatter that illusion that we're not the majority and we have to get past the mind game
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:41.640]  of fear and so i think it's a great idea whether it's anonymous you write letters and post things
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:47.480]  or other people should start other oath keeper sites more groups lots of people but it's good
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:52.600]  in my experience just to go past the point of return and to commit we're only saying we'll
[3:09:52.600 --> 3:09:56.280]  follow our oath you know i mean that's how i got the city of austin was saying they were gonna vote
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:10:02.120]  against the patriot act repudiation they were gonna vote for the patriot act and keep it and i went
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:05.720]  in there and i gave them an impassioned the most powerful speech i probably ever get because it
[3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:10.680]  was directly from my soul and i explained to them their children had no future i explained them all
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:16.040]  we were doing had no future this continued that all they were doing was reaffirming the
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:19.480]  bill of rights constitution all they were doing was saying they follow their oaths of office
[3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:25.800]  for the city council the police the firemen the workers and that they had to do it and they did
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:29.800]  vote to overthrow it and people that were saying they were going to vote against voted for because
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:34.520]  i i mean i i poured everything into literally trying to reach in and grab them you know grab
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:38.680]  you know just literally brush up against their souls and i did you know literally bending my
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:42.600]  will with goodness towards them and believe me that's what humanity is all about folks you've
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:47.480]  got power you don't know you have it's a survival mechanism with the truth to literally be able
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:51.320]  to reach out to people when you're telling the truth it's unstoppable the globalists are going
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:55.960]  to pull a lot of other tricks but i wanted to just enclosing uh steward rhodes get your take on
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:11:00.440]  that enemy attack angle and has that already happened well not yet and here's what we're
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:04.200]  going to do we're going to do the same thing that that's uh constable to this campaign we're
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:09.160]  going to let the fuse already got an officer uh in houston who's volunteered to run our facebook
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:14.600]  operation and we encourage folks to start up meetup groups i mean the website we'd like
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:18.440]  people to send a testimony to the websites everyone can go there and read the testimonials
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:22.520]  and we don't screen anything we post them they send them we post them and uh but but as far as
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:29.160]  for local and by decentralizing by by decentralizing with meetups it turns the enemy the engine
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:34.440]  loose we're no intelligence unit no group in the government could track or trace or stop what we're
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:39.880]  doing or try dirty tricks anybody because there's too many of us and agents that are assigned to
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:45.560]  try to infiltrate or cause problems will convert over to our side i'd say 80 of the time exactly
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:50.280]  here's the other thing we do we do encourage active duty to uh stay anonymous unless they're
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:54.680]  uh short timers are going to be getting out soon or you know a few people standing up and
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:58.680]  making a convicted statement is fine but for the most part we do think it's probably wise
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:03.160]  for most of them just as an anonymous statement well that's their decision i'm just saying most
[3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:07.560]  of this is anonymous i'm saying we need more i think to go all the way because that's that's
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:12.760]  what's going to shatter the illusion of the establishment i agree but it's up to them i
[3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:17.080]  i thought that the know they can do it anonymously they go on there and any any discussion and
[3:12:17.080 --> 3:12:21.880]  dispose the anonymous comment and we'll turn it into an anonymous post and the veterans
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:26.840]  definitely should stand up and be counted for sure yeah i mean they'll charge machine gun nests
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:31.160]  and fly helicopters into hell but you know that they won't stand up in the country's imploding
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:37.000]  no they are standing up sir we can we commend you now the website again is oath dash keepers
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.480]  dot walk spot dot com or just google oath keepers and folks will find it that way we'll talk to you

[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:56.200]  identity and people are unhappy until they find what the identity is fight for freedom fight for

[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:02.920]  central up in northern indiana which is a branch camp to the preview pretty university and i had
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.920]  requested to teach in the prisons because they have a little program where they teach in
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:11.720]  teach prisoners inmates in the prisons and i was on my way to i've been doing that for the last
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:17.000]  18 months or so and i was on my way to work i think was february 24 so rushing around like crazy and
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:21.480]  you know in a big i'm really busy writing books taking care of my family working two jobs etc
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:27.240]  i forgot that i had no you're just like jimmy johnson who twice has tried to take his handgun
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:31.960]  because he gets death threats and stuff and why couldn't he you know onto the airplane and he and
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:35.560]  they open you know they scan the briefcase and there's the gun so similar thing happened to you
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:40.200]  yeah they got these anti you know the nation's full of these anti second amendment zones and
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:43.880]  you know i tell someone i mean i forgot to take my gun out of my school supplies because i had it on
[3:15:43.880 --> 3:15:47.000]  me because i was running errands in the morning before you know during the morning before i went
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:51.320]  up to teach at the prison and you know of course then the media they won't report on you know depleted
[3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:55.080]  uranium and the burning of the rainforest and all this kind of stuff was they want to do is report
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:15:59.880]  on me a professor well actually i'm called a lecturer forgot to take my gun out of my school
[3:15:59.880 --> 3:16:04.600]  supplies you know it's in the indian apple star and the chicago tribune and they get the story
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:08.680]  all wrong they say you know i was trying to smuggle the gun and all this crazy stuff and it's just
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:12.440]  it's just pretty amazing that that's what it just shows that that's what the media is all about
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:16.680]  the mainstream media that's what they're going to fail you know the future is is us is this this
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:20.680]  voice you know against the new lord i think a lot of these universities are going to you know
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:24.200]  there we're just beginning this economic crisis and that's you know a lot of universities when
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:28.280]  this economic crisis really gets going you know later this year in the next year the lot of them
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:32.200]  are going to fail and i think eventually with american revolution two starting here we're
[3:16:32.200 --> 3:16:36.040]  going to get new universities or the ones that exist are going to be heavily modified and i think
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:40.600]  our information our voice i think is the future there so i mean i don't you know that i got fired
[3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:45.240]  for my job really i don't care i've been teaching for eight years you know all summer a lot of
[3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:48.840]  classes i'm anxious to take some time off and plus i don't really know where i fit in these
[3:16:48.840 --> 3:16:53.640]  schools anymore i mean these universities that don't they're not teaching empirical information
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:56.760]  i mean it's hard for people to understand this if you're not really in the university system
[3:16:56.760 --> 3:17:00.280]  paying attention what's going on but they're not you know you don't get in a class and sit there
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:04.520]  and tell your students okay i got this scientific article from this top journal and this scientific
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:08.120]  article from this article from this top journal we're going to just debate these and we're going
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:11.880]  to get to the bottom of things and we're going to be empirical researchers that almost never
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:17.320]  they teach you the german 200 year old model of not learning how to think and learning how magical
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:22.760]  the world is and how things connect it's all just by rote regurgitating information
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:27.720]  yeah exactly well they got these agendas like when i was teaching bioethics at indian
[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:31.960]  university northwest which i was fired from i was teaching they wanted me to teach this
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:35.640]  bioethics class and i said okay that sounds great i'd love to because it didn't have a whole lot
[3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:39.240]  of background in it but i said i'll do it because i could use and it was really a eugenics class they
[3:17:39.240 --> 3:17:43.480]  wanted to teach you yeah yeah they wanted me to teach eugenics which you know it doesn't really
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:47.240]  by the way we've never talked before i just knew that because that's what they teach but go ahead
[3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:51.800]  yeah no right well they they wanted me to teach about youth and asian all this stuff and i said
[3:17:51.800 --> 3:17:55.400]  you know it's not really relevant you know i'm wasting the student's money not really teaching
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:59.240]  them relevant information so what i did is they just on my own got rid of that section of the class
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:04.920]  and yeah it's brainwashing you you you pay 30 grand a year or whatever to go be brainwashed and
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:10.120]  taught a bunch of propaganda instead of informant go ahead yeah yeah it's it's absolutely unbelievable
[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:14.120]  that people don't just wake up and say what am i doing here i mean i take a calculus class
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:17.960]  we really only learn about four concepts the whole semester and i never use any of this stuff ever
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:22.280]  that's why i dropped out of college i was made i mean it was like i'd go to math class and it'd
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:26.680]  be how we've got to get rid of the most the population guns are bad i'd go to uh you know
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:30.920]  philosophy class it was all new world order i'd go to texas history and all be new world order
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:35.000]  i'd go to u.s history and all be new world order it didn't matter what class art class
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:39.160]  had been new world order i mean just everywhere it's brainwashing yeah people don't pick up on
[3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:43.000]  this because they do it in a hidden way you know they won't some classes won't talk about eugenics
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:46.680]  so what they'll do is talk about global warming and they'll act like everybody's an agreement
[3:18:46.680 --> 3:18:50.040]  you're and you know you get the two students in the back who question it and then you know
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:54.520]  all the rest of the students gang up against them it's just you people don't know i mean
[3:18:54.520 --> 3:18:59.560]  brainwashing in the university is is really their reeducation camps their reeducation
[3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:03.720]  military same thing shaved head sleep deprivation and this is what people don't understand this is
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:08.360]  all 200 years old it all comes out of germany in england and and then before education wasn't like
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:11.800]  this but i mean everything you're saying is true just because i've researched it myself that's
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:15.000]  what's great about talking to somebody else who's researched this with your perspective but
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:18.680]  we're gonna come back get more into your book and i'm gonna try to shut up and get into your

[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:50.920]  all right let's go back to our guest Jeffrey Grubb Jeffrey continue let's get into your book
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:57.800]  corporatism the secret government of the new world order yeah that book was written from 2003 to 2007
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:02.040]  I when 9-11 happened I was deep in my academic studies getting my master's degree and I really
[3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:06.200]  didn't even pay attention I actually tried as best as I could to ignore all politics
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:10.360]  but I would ignore everything about the world I just thought it was a complete joke I didn't want to pay attention
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:16.440]  just wanted to do my academic work but then 2003 happened March 20 or I forgot exactly the
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:20.920]  19th when we invaded Iraq I was sitting there and Appleby's with my father having a happy little
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:26.680]  lunch watching people in Baghdad get blown to bits and that completely shocked me unbelievably and
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:30.760]  from that point on I've been distracted my academic work has been distracted
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.040]  all I can really focus on is what exactly is going on in the world and
[3:25:34.040 --> 3:25:37.560]  the book corporatism is my process of trying to figure out what's going on
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:41.160]  in the world and I took me four years to write I basically researched it you know
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:45.800]  100 hours a week or more it took to get in that book to be completed of course you're
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:49.640]  quoted in the book about 30 times Alex playlist I've been listening to you ever since 2003
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:53.880]  and I've you know been listening to uh I mean we're ultimately going to get this information
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:57.400]  you know I mean you guys report all this stuff I mean nobody it's really hard to find any
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:02.520]  other good information so um but the book is uh I think there's only one problem I think
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:06.680]  well you know like you said the other day about the Obama deception you you know after you finish
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:09.800]  something you find out things you wish you added later there's a couple things I wish I added later
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:16.120]  but the book basically to sum it up is about how the secret government works secret government is
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:21.720]  basically invisible I mean people like Rockefeller and stuff um are getting close to the core of it
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:26.280]  but uh you know the people we see on tv what I call the visible government who are showing these
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:30.840]  people on tv you know Obama you know you remember the election was happening and we were basically
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:34.600]  told to vote for the public didn't even know who Ron Paul was until late in the game yeah they spent
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:40.120]  billions manufacturing this guy that's prima facie evidence he's new world order then all his
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:45.320]  advisors now the policies now the betrayals I mean you know he comes out and says I am against
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:50.040]  these bailouts and these bonuses I'm fighting it and it turns out he specifically signed an
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:56.920]  executive order to allow it and had Dodd put it in the law and that's now mainstream news well I
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:00.440]  knew that months ago we put it in the Obama deception it was just released uh but that's
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:05.560]  now mainstream news today yeah he's specifically Obama's specifically doing the neo kind agenda
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:10.920]  where you say one thing and that you're you say purposely stay exactly the opposite of what you're
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:15.720]  implementing so he'll say I'm against the IG and the banks and you know go on the tv and scold them
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:19.080]  and stuff but then you know he's like you say in the bomb you're showing the Obama deception he's
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:23.480]  the guy behind the whole thing as far as the uh you know the puppet government goes but then
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:27.640]  behind the puppet government the books discusses there's the new world order which is basically
[3:27:27.640 --> 3:27:33.000]  corporate and uh it's a basically satanic government is largely invisible and it's
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.480]  bent on setting up a world of concentration camps that's the last chapter of the book
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:44.040]  and basically torturing and uh killing people for some sort of enjoyment or pleasure that they have
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:48.360]  it's sort of some sort of relief so that's the summation of your research which is true you
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:52.200]  could be an atheist and come to that realization you people like I don't believe in that I'm an
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:57.080]  atheist or I'm an agnostic point is the globalist believe in it I mean they are into this stuff they
[3:27:57.080 --> 3:28:02.120]  are out of their minds actually actually Alex I used to be an atheist I even published an academic
[3:28:02.120 --> 3:28:07.240]  article in a top philosophy journal called Sophia I'm trying to prove that God didn't exist that
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:11.960]  because of that way back deep into the 90s I was so angry with my upbringing and my you know the
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:16.760]  horrible church that was raised and I just became this fiery bitter atheist but I read a book in
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:21.720]  the last few years called beginning sacred design by Bonnie Gaunt they pretty much I can't believe
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:25.400]  that nobody's talking about the information and the churches are on tv well that's why a lot of
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:29.640]  tight well and we're gonna talk about it now but a lot of top scientists who have been atheists when
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:34.680]  they finally look at DNA under electron microscopes and the layers and how there's you know in there
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:39.960]  like my god this is designed I mean this this is didn't come out of a cabbage patch it's everywhere
[3:28:39.960 --> 3:28:43.880]  look at the solar system it's when you look at the numbers of the sources from the diameter of the
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:48.600]  sun moon earth the ratios of all these diameters where we have to be in the galaxy where we have
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:53.240]  to be go through that where we had to be in the galaxy it's all perfect well I mean take
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:58.600]  take new grains up in Ireland that that ancient temple's about 2000 BC it's estimated to have been
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:04.280]  created the the sun and the at I think it's the winter solstice there's one beam of light that
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:09.160]  channels down the center central column of the middle of the temple because these people knew
[3:29:09.160 --> 3:29:13.720]  so much about the sun back then so they designed it so at right at the winter solstice the sun you
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:17.800]  know just at that one day you'd have a beam of light that went down because the way the temple
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:22.360]  is oriented to the sky now the thing that happens is that night the full moon does the exact same
[3:29:22.360 --> 3:29:28.120]  thing now what does that tell you that tells you that the sun and the moon at those specifically
[3:29:28.760 --> 3:29:33.640]  those very precise days are traveling exactly the same trajectory through the sky without any
[3:29:33.640 --> 3:29:38.840]  deviation now there's that can't be a coincidence that's unbelievable and there's I could name
[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:43.480]  20 of those coincidences if you want to come back now let's do if you want let's get into the book
[3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:48.120]  and a lot more with our guest folks the book is corporatism the secret government of the new

[3:33:55.240 --> 3:33:58.680]  corporatism the secret government of the new world order but i want to he'll be on hold a
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:04.840]  few minutes i want to bring ted anderson up right now because every time the gold goes down and the
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:09.400]  graph goes like this you know it's the last five years going up but every time it dips
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:14.680]  ted buys it when it's low and then he doesn't raise the price to the current rate he passes it on to
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:20.920]  you because ted understands psychology for some people buy once high i buy once low well he passes
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:24.920]  that on you're buying it at the low price when it's gone up one of 30 bucks yesterday it's gone up
[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:29.880]  like 15 today skyrocketing back upwards i don't know what the future holds but i know golden
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:34.120]  silver is real i know they're devaluing the dollar they're openly talking about abandoning the dollar
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:40.200]  if that happens you know i got articles here in fact i meant to get to 750 billion dollar green
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:45.560]  investment could revive economy u n says they're calling for a world tax on all fuel and if you
[3:34:45.560 --> 3:34:49.800]  think 750 billions big that's just how they're going to start the income tax started at 1 percent
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:56.360]  it wasn't widely adopted till the 50s though they passed it in 1913 so i mean this is insane
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:01.000]  the stuff i mean here's london telegraph where they're talking about yesterday issuing their own
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:05.720]  global super currency and then another article said oh they're already doing it so ted anderson
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:11.640]  you've got silver you've got golden insane deals out of the gates because we always run out of time
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:17.320]  give folks the group of coins you're offering today at the insane price of what you buy and buy
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:21.880]  this one it was down by 70 dollars yeah right it does now alex is right when the the market
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:27.080]  dipped there i took advantage of those low prices and now we have gold trading around 960 which is
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:33.000]  up again today uh that news that the feds going in there buying us treasuries is just driving
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:37.720]  gold up through the roof and then of course that means the private bankers are selling themselves
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:43.160]  treasuries taxpayer back the foreigners aren't buying enough of it to keep us afloat and they're
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:46.920]  moving away fast if folks don't know what that means why don't you tell them to well it just
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:35:51.240]  means that we're going to see inflation i mean you think you've had an assault on your stocks and
[3:35:51.240 --> 3:35:57.720]  bonds and your 401k plans and not your ira is now just wait till inflation starts coming everybody
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:03.560]  knows now that we're looking at some huge inflation in the future here and now they just said yesterday
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:08.520]  record inflation record inflation the last 20 years just came in yeah that's what everybody's
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:12.600]  pointing at right now because when the federal reserve system buys us government treasuries
[3:36:12.600 --> 3:36:18.040]  it means it means they're printing money that's what it means folks and inflation means the the
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:22.840]  dollars are worthless so i know this sounds stupid but some people are elementary i'm going to be
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:28.760]  simple here when there's inflation commodities especially those that have true values currency
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  gold and silver historically only go up it's the most active time in trading for gold and silver
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:41.160]  that you can ever hope for i mean back in 1980 gold went from 40 dollars an ounce to 800 dollars
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:47.160]  an ounce in about six years and now we're we're starting at a level at about 300 and if the same
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:50.840]  movement comes along we're going to be looking at four five thousand maybe even six thousand
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:56.360]  dollar gold and this is this is this is the answers that our government and the federal reserve
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:01.240]  system has for us and and you're right the un is trying to get away from using the united states
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:07.000]  currency as a world reserve currency that's going to kill us we have to have foreigners buying our
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.680]  debt in order to survive this is a slow slide into depression but if the dollar gets dumped
[3:37:12.680 --> 3:37:18.280]  which is openly being discussed it will be an overnight crash well alex when i was up in the
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:23.960]  air just at the very end of the show yesterday i i told you i had some deals in here i have frank
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:29.000]  still i have the same price i had him yesterday even though gold is up again so much today i have
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:34.600]  frank still from the time when gold was sitting here at its bottom at 218 i've got british sovereigns
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:42.920]  at 272 silvers up i still have the frank the the franklin halves at 869 a piece or 173 per roll of 20
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:48.600]  and i have some of the us eagles and some of the you know the various different coins that you can
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:51.960]  find in the gold market you're gonna have to ask for those because i just don't have enough quantities
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:38:00.280]  to go out we have 20 dollar gold pieces and tens just you know call 1-800-686-2237 and take advantage
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:05.640]  of this the market is going up right now and it'll continue to go up as the fed steps in and
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:10.680]  inflates away of the you know they're trying to they're trying to deficit spend our way you know
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:16.920]  are we out of our problems and explain to people what's going on you have gold at is it 60 or 70
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:21.400]  dollars under what it's currently well that's the thing alex it was what round 890 when it hit
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:27.240]  its low here last time that's a 70 dollar under buy you made you're passing those savings on you
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:32.920]  cannot beat this deal tell them the coins dead yeah again the frank coin right now is at 218
[3:38:32.920 --> 3:38:41.640]  the sovereign coin right now is a 272 the franklin uh the franklin half is right now at 869 that's a
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:46.280]  silver coin i mean people should be buying gold and silver right now inflation is going to throw
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:51.080]  it push this stuff up through the rough and the silver coin is eight dollars and any something
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:55.880]  sense cannot beat i mean silver dollars you can find them or over 20 dollars a piece dead i know
[3:38:55.880 --> 3:39:00.680]  it's they've been trading for more than 20 dollars here for almost the last year every now and then
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:06.360]  you're lucky to get something for 18 you know and here this thing is eight dollars and 69 cents
[3:39:06.360 --> 3:39:18.440]  i mean it is really a good buy it is 800 686 2237 1800 give them the number folks yeah 1800 686 2237
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:25.480]  again it's 1800 686 2237 man pull your head out of the sand get as much gold and silver as you can
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:32.040]  at this time i i can't say that enough it's not just 100 1800 686 237 did you hear that state
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:36.760]  police officer who broke the myack report here on last hour and he said he said alex you told me
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:41.320]  go to the stock market two and a half years ago at the top i did it you told me get out of my house
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:44.600]  two and a half years ago i did it i've made hundreds of thousands of dollars everybody else
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:49.640]  you know is losing their butt in his uh state police office he's senior and he told them all
[3:39:49.640 --> 3:39:53.880]  then and they laughed now they're listening you know told him again the gold they did did well
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:58.280]  is gold perfect the goblas can manipulate things but they can't do it for long
[3:39:58.280 --> 3:40:03.960]  and historically there is not a better investment than gold and silver you are insane if you don't
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:09.000]  convert a lot of your liquid cash or stocks and bonds in the golden silver i i can't say it better
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:13.960]  than that alex at this time if you're sitting in annuity stocks bonds mutual funds you have 401k
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:21.880]  is ira is you should be calling us at 1800 686 2237 the only excuse is is that you're out of
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:27.400]  paper currency you don't have anymore i just i i can't say it enough the united states dollars
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:32.600]  under attack and you better do something about it and if you can't see the tidal wave coming

[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:45.800]  dollars 267 an ounce and it's been above a thousand it's going back that way now and Ted's selling it
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:50.760]  to you at the 8 890 level so i mean you do the math he's selling at the 890 level you know he has
[3:40:50.760 --> 3:40:55.240]  his tiny markup in there and things he's selling to you at the 890 level when it's when it's uh

[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.080]  real government the shadow government works in your book corporatism the secret government of
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:53.080]  the new world order available from progressive press dot com progressive press dot com go ahead
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:58.840]  okay and before i had a show alex i gotta read you a Samuel Adams quote about the second amendment
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:04.280]  but an al-qaeda quote oh you're gonna mention a terrorist on my show okay go ahead i guess i mean
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:09.560]  can i read that right now read the terrorist yes okay this is specifically in reference to um you

[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:42.680]  property together with the right to support and defend them if you were defend them in the best
[3:42:42.680 --> 3:42:47.880]  manner they can okay the key to that quote is the best manner they can now what that means is
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:54.200]  if if it's best for us to defend our property in pursuit of happiness with an ar-15 which of
[3:42:54.200 --> 3:42:58.280]  course uses 223 most of the time then that's what we should that's specifically what we should use
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:03.160]  according to this funny this key founding father so when somebody like obama says that oh no we
[3:43:03.160 --> 3:43:09.720]  want to restrict something like 223 ammo they're breaking the law they the people should act accordingly
[3:43:09.720 --> 3:43:14.840]  to what they're doing and basically not cooperate we should pre-perform civil disobedience against
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:21.240]  this administration in every way that which is what i think is the best way to uh eliminate these
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:25.400]  people but that comes from i'm reading out of a book called the second amendment by david barton
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:30.200]  that's page 24 and then he's got the site to the reference in there exactly where isn't no i know
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:36.280]  that quote i know it well your website by the way is abstract adam dot com abstract adam dot com
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:40.520]  please continue yeah that website is mostly just my academic work there's probably not a whole lot
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:45.320]  that um it's probably not what the listeners are thinking of just basically an academic site but i
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:50.120]  continue not um let me tell you another story about what happened at um pretty essential i think
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:53.480]  you're really like this one this is different than the story of trying to you're forgetting to take
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:57.400]  my gun out of my stuff when i entered the prison that i was teaching at um but this
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:03.160]  that happened last summer i was uh teaching ethics class and you know these ethics classes in college
[3:44:03.160 --> 3:44:06.600]  you know it's just a lot of fluff you can get the concepts over pretty easy so you got to fill in
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:09.800]  with interesting concepts in the meantime so of course i'm bringing up the second amendment all
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:14.120]  the time but a couple days into the class we were talking about evolution before that and
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:18.840]  i was talking about how it's just the theory and you know really that the uh a lot of it the research
[3:44:18.840 --> 3:44:22.680]  they say out there that improves evolution is just a joke you know these four million-year-old bones
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:27.400]  how do we know those are connected to our lineage and you know they say that there's um all this
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:32.200]  evidence in the junk dna of the retroviruses to uh show that we've got the exactly
[3:44:32.200 --> 3:44:37.320]  what i want to make but i mean is i want to be clear about this the way the phony churches have
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:42.360]  made the debate i think is unscientific too and not in the bible uh you know claiming you know
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:46.520]  things are you know however many years old i mean clearly i believe we have an old earth
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:51.800]  you know it bible talks about creations before that regardless of that uh they you know they
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:58.120]  try to set all religion or spirituality against science when the science is showing that there
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:45:02.600]  is a master builder but go ahead yeah we can go look at a fossil record it seems like there's
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:06.280]  something you know step by step going on through the millions years the problem is it's trying to
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:10.520]  say that we come from an age there that's what they have it yeah these are separate arms these
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:15.720]  are separate arms of development you know you don't have a fish turning into a human or you
[3:45:15.720 --> 3:45:19.480]  don't have a chimpanzee turning into a human these are separate divergent they have the
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:26.520]  continual fossil record that doesn't have you know uh uh these connections if there's these massive
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:32.440]  jumps like overnight go ahead yeah exactly it's called punctuated equilibrium this gradual evolution
[3:45:32.440 --> 3:45:35.960]  that darwin put forth doesn't really exist in the fossil record that's actually pretty mainstream
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:40.520]  among biologists and stuff these days but anyways i was trying to i was discussing that with students
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:43.960]  and i was trying to you know be empirical i possibly could have bring it up both sides of
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:47.560]  story and saying you know i don't really know and just the evidence for us coming from chimps
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:52.440]  is not there so i had a couple students just absolutely i mean i could just feel their anger
[3:45:52.440 --> 3:45:56.840]  here from the front of the room they were just okay you were committing heresy against the
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:01.400]  eugenicist religion exactly yeah i was i was trying you know i was basically making it look
[3:46:01.400 --> 3:46:05.720]  like humans were not stupid animals but were actually powerful spiritual creatures by doing
[3:46:05.720 --> 3:46:10.520]  that which goes against that whole eugenics program so then the next class um you know
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:14.040]  to fill in time we brought up some controversial issues to bring it to illustrate the concepts
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:17.560]  and philosophical ethics and those were the second amendment of course i'm always itching to
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:21.560]  bring up second minutes my favorite thing my favorite thing in the world besides reading
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:25.720]  there is guns i mean just the freedom that caring a gun gives you as thomas jefferson said he just
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:32.440]  can't it's just second to none that feeling but anyways um the uh so i started talking i had this
[3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:35.800]  incredible handout for the students i've got it right in front of me here it's called a lesson
[3:46:35.800 --> 3:46:40.040]  of the second amendment just incredibly well documented you know about a hundred footnotes
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.600]  of the thing and so forth and now we were just going through it and all of a sudden okay that
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:48.040]  lasted about you know 40 minutes and then we moved on to the next concept here's the topic
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:52.200]  in the class and then also there's a bunch of police outside the classroom door and i'm like
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:55.880]  okay that's strange why you just kept teaching and all of a sudden a guy in plainclones motioned
[3:46:55.880 --> 3:46:59.720]  for me to come out of the room and i get out there and there's always you know cops out in
[3:46:59.720 --> 3:47:04.360]  the hallway they said uh we got a phone call that you're carrying a gun in your pocket which of
[3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:08.360]  course i wasn't because i've been too afraid to of course carry it's a felony if you say
[3:47:08.360 --> 3:47:12.600]  anti-second amendment so just talking about the second amendment police came it was
[3:47:12.600 --> 3:47:18.520]  well it turns out it turns out i found out from other students that that student brag one of the
[3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:23.480]  students that was so angry at me for just simply questioning and using empirical evidence to question
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:28.440]  the theory of monkeys coming turning to humans through um evolution one of them called their
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:33.960]  mother text their mother and said i had a gun in my pocket and then the police came so it was
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:39.800]  basically a student did that because they were just so angry of well that's what these uh fake
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:44.360]  intellectuals do is is they try to shut down free speech by false reports whatever they can
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:49.560]  because it just i mean i mean if your information is so powerful and so true you should want to
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:53.400]  defend it it's kind of like you know tens of thousands of people they've grabbed over the
[3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:58.120]  years and say they can't have court trials with the enemy combatants act and and the military
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:02.520]  commissions act i mean if these are really terrorist and we've got proof let's see it
[3:48:02.520 --> 3:48:06.360]  but see that they always want to do everything they do in secret and they don't want to allow
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:12.600]  any debate well the whole you know war on terror and you know okay and everything if people are
[3:48:12.600 --> 3:48:17.160]  close there's no evidence for anything i mean if i should see a videotape on tv over someone
[3:48:17.160 --> 3:48:21.640]  along that's strictly speaking in the scientific sense not evidence that's nothing because i mean
[3:48:21.640 --> 3:48:26.360]  it looks like well it's turned out those videos are old videos re-edited that's been confirmed
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:31.800]  and fake videos i mean they've they put they put the classic morph computer head up you know with
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:37.000]  the one with him in the room i mean they put out admitted fake videos yeah i mean the dinosaurs
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:41.400]  in Jurassic Park sure to look real i mean but of course they're fake but you saw far as gum shake
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:50.120]  hands with kennedy exactly yeah good one but the um the i forgot i was gonna say i'm good at that
[3:48:50.920 --> 3:48:54.840]  no no no i mean we're going through they came after you for having supposedly a gun you didn't
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:48:59.080]  have one how did that oh yeah we were talking about yeah that nothing in the war on terror is
[3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:03.080]  verifiable see but americans are trained to just believe whatever they want you know not really
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:06.840]  just go look for evidence that the real if you really want to get real information about the
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:10.600]  world that is not about the spiritual domain but about the world you need to use your senses that's
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:14.600]  what science is based on but people don't know to do that so then they can put on tv all this stuff
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:18.520]  about how you know there's this bogeyman here this bogeyman there nobody asks for the verification
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:23.320]  for the evidence people just believe it and then you get this whole apparatus of society
[3:49:23.320 --> 3:49:26.600]  basically everybody's telling each other the why that's out of orwell you know everybody tells
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:30.440]  you to the lie nobody knows the truth so you see it on tv and then you go to work and talk about
[3:49:30.440 --> 3:49:35.400]  what's on tv and you talk about it at church and you talk about it at some feedback loop yeah and
[3:49:35.400 --> 3:49:40.120]  it's just always lie lie lie lie and then when somebody comes along and says oh hey diet coke
[3:49:40.120 --> 3:49:43.880]  isn't healthy it has aspartame everybody says i can't believe that nobody believes that you're
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:48.600]  crazy everybody drinks it it could never be and now they've gotten to the point of when we prove
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:53.640]  mercury's in the food and the shots they go okay mercury's good and we prove melamine's in the
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:58.520]  formula and they go okay we've always said it's deadly it's good for you mercury melamine lad it's
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:02.440]  all good now yeah but the denial is just so unbelievable just like that police officer you
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:06.920]  had on last uh an hour or whatever ago i've had the same thing happen to me when i started listening
[3:50:06.920 --> 3:50:11.080]  to you i got out of stocks i dumped my house got into gold did all the stuff you were saying and
[3:50:11.080 --> 3:50:15.080]  i've even made members of my family tremendous amounts of money but they'll still say oh you
[3:50:15.080 --> 3:50:19.800]  were just lucky you're just a coincidence they're blind you know it's like 20 i'm like 20 coincidences
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:25.960]  are just getting lucky but that's what they say about um all the predictions we make or what uh
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:29.800]  you know the the the guess said about oil prices that for the next year at least they were gonna
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:35.800]  drop down you know to below 50 uh lindsay williams you just you need oh alex you guessed they were
[3:50:35.800 --> 3:50:40.360]  gonna announce a new bank of the world where we'd pay our carbon taxes yeah it's all over the news
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:45.400]  now but you guessed that five years ago yeah that's exactly what people are just saying to me too
[3:50:45.400 --> 3:50:53.320]  oh well they like being slaves but uh you know i always say listen to this show is very profitable

[3:55:54.360 --> 3:55:58.040]  you i think you're out of this alex and probably a lot of listeners are too but i would just want
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:01.880]  to say that i think that it's beyond a shadow without to me that the new world order is now
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:06.840]  using our movement to carry out their agenda i don't when i you know like i heard um chuck

[3:56:22.040 --> 3:56:25.720]  and now all of a sudden they're disclosing all this information i don't buy it for one second
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:29.960]  there's a lot of other reasons why i don't buy it either they're i think that what the new world
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:34.840]  order is doing this stuff's getting too big you're getting too big everybody's waking up so what
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:40.040]  they're going to do is basically use the movement to carry out their ends you know i mean i think
[3:56:40.040 --> 3:56:44.360]  they're going to try to they're going to try to co-op to get people's confidence but be specific
[3:56:44.360 --> 3:56:47.880]  what are you what are you hitting out here well i think i mean look they're they're going to try
[3:56:47.880 --> 3:56:51.480]  to ban gardening i mean that reminds me of in robin hood when they banned the book robin when
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:55.720]  they banned hunt like oh you're saying they want to cause a revolution yeah they want they want
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:00.360]  rise they want to burn this place down oh i agree with you but we need that we need to expose that
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:04.280]  as well because that's what i mean i mean they're going to they're going to put in their own guys
[3:57:04.280 --> 3:57:08.520]  to for this revolution and you know they're going to have them their other guys waiting on the other
[3:57:08.520 --> 3:57:12.360]  side after they destroy the old war to set up their new world that they're they want i mean think
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:17.800]  about their they're doing crazy things they're all this foreclosure and inflation and homelessness
[3:57:17.800 --> 3:57:23.800]  and gun laws and banning gardening it they're people can't pay these taxes they're driving people
[3:57:23.800 --> 3:57:28.040]  into revolution it's i mean they're stepping it up unbelievably it just has to be the case
[3:57:28.040 --> 3:57:32.600]  they're trying to make everybody go crazy and if they're doing that then that's part of their agenda
[3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:39.160]  but the the ring as our earlier guest said that they're after is they want to cause the rebellion
[3:57:39.160 --> 3:57:43.720]  have to be violent have the military and police against the people that's going to backfire and
[3:57:43.720 --> 3:57:47.880]  they are not invincible and can be defeated but i agree they're they're they're positioning cells
[3:57:47.880 --> 3:57:54.040]  in case they lose to pose as the patriots to then take it over but we will expose that and we are
[3:57:54.040 --> 3:57:58.680]  exposing that yeah it should be easy to figure those people out you want to you know because
[3:57:58.680 --> 3:58:03.160]  like you say bear just people are their fruit but uh that's what i think is really going on i just
[3:58:03.160 --> 3:58:06.360]  don't buy it that all of a sudden glenn beck just doesn't about basically he was calling us terrace
[3:58:06.360 --> 3:58:10.200]  the year ago and now all of a sudden he's having run on and so that's why i went after him that's
