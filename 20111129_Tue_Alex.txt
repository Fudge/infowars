[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.120 --> 00:43.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen we've got another absolutely jam-packed critically
[00:43.320 --> 00:50.000]  important worldwide transmission today lined up for you Webster Tarpley fresh
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.360]  back from Syria and the front lines of the Al Qaeda NATO New World Order
[00:56.360 --> 01:02.720]  strike force is going to be joining us coming up in an hour and a half from
[01:02.720 --> 01:09.200]  now dr. Jerome Corsi is also going to be popping in he's got the same intel
[01:09.200 --> 01:12.720]  we've had over several months well actually several years but it's
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.120]  intensified that Israel England and the United States have been launching
[01:17.120 --> 01:23.400]  giant attacks blowing up entire areas of military bases rocket bases nuclear
[01:23.400 --> 01:30.640]  reactor systems and now the Washington Post is out today basically going oh
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.160]  look at satellite photos someone blew up the missile launcher bases somebody
[01:36.160 --> 01:42.160]  blew up the reactor area maybe maybe it was a leprechaun or something that did
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.400]  it sure it's just accidental explosions killing the different key generals and
[01:48.400 --> 01:54.120]  scientists so the war is already going on and they've got Al Qaeda attacking the
[01:54.120 --> 01:57.200]  Shiite country all over the map but again I'm not taking a side in any of
[01:57.200 --> 02:06.000]  this while hobbyist Shiite globalist it's all just big factions the issue is
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.160]  that this is being used to take our liberties here at home and it's totally
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.520]  manufactured and when you get all the different internal government documents
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.880]  we've covered here and that have made national news it's all about
[02:19.880 --> 02:25.760]  conservatives libertarians American gun owners landowners if you can skin a buck
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.280]  run a trot line you're the person the government doesn't like because the
[02:30.280 --> 02:40.520]  government is run by people like Ken lay Larry Summers Robert Rubin Bernie made
[02:40.520 --> 02:47.080]  off I mean this is a core sign this is just a bunch of crooks and it's the big
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.520]  mega banks that engage in all this fraud that have been trying to get rid of
[02:50.520 --> 02:55.160]  possecom and taught us trying to federalize local police and they've done
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.320]  a pretty darn good job of it and they've got the ADL and southern poverty law
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.640]  center literally demonizing if the founding fathers were alive today they
[03:04.640 --> 03:07.120]  would be attacked in fact they are attacked in these manuals and we've
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.160]  covered it we've gotten video of the FEMA training manuals and of the FEMA
[03:11.160 --> 03:17.360]  personnel giving the training but they clearly are like the bad guys in red
[03:17.360 --> 03:22.080]  dawn if you have any political understanding any geopolitical awareness
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.440]  any historical first-grade level the bad men come and criticize those that are
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.440]  for private property second amendment family national sovereignty I mean they
[03:32.440 --> 03:38.040]  sit there like like a Simpsons episode where the aliens take over the town and
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.800]  announce I am glob and this is Kolar or whatever you're the big slime creatures
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.480]  and we are here you will now do as we say you you know your freedoms are trash
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.240]  I mean it's it's that over-the-top cartoonish they don't even try to cover
[03:53.240 --> 03:59.640]  it with any sophistry it's just we're surveilling you you're watching you
[03:59.640 --> 04:06.520]  George Washington is a pig and we're gonna take your rights cuz al-qaeda will
[04:06.520 --> 04:09.960]  get you and you're you're like but you're funding al-qaeda look at all these
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.600]  examples you underwear bomber Christmas day got him in the plane this guy that
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.600]  guy you're protecting him look how you're using al-qaeda and Libya now Syria
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.920]  look how you used him against the Serbs look how the CIA created him this is
[04:21.920 --> 04:27.640]  wrong and they're just like be quiet America hater and you're like but I'm
[04:27.640 --> 04:31.640]  defending what America actually stands for freedom and liberty and the things
[04:31.640 --> 04:37.760]  you're attacking you notice mr. extremist that the public drinking
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.320]  fluoride is brain damage in a trance look at how weak and wanting and
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.440]  pathetic they are they're not waking up out of the trance we've got them where
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.480]  we want them and there's nothing you can do to wake them we're gonna have our
[04:52.480 --> 04:56.480]  our way with them you understand that you know that's basically the globalist
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.080]  attitude
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.800]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:05.800 --> 05:11.320]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[05:11.320 --> 05:13.840]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.840]  I've turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.600]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[05:23.600 --> 05:27.960]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.240]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[05:33.240 --> 05:36.880]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[05:36.880 --> 05:40.680]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[05:40.680 --> 05:44.520]  we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care right now in
[05:44.520 --> 05:50.520]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the
[05:50.520 --> 05:56.460]  Republic on DVD at info wars dot com or watching online right now in super high

[07:01.200 --> 07:06.000]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.360]  America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives

[07:22.120 --> 07:26.000]  predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Friday Mack and America's biggest small
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.280]  owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[07:30.280 --> 07:34.080]  prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[07:34.080 --> 07:37.520]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[07:37.520 --> 07:41.640]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[07:41.640 --> 07:45.360]  online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you

[08:04.480 --> 08:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.200 --> 08:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.720 --> 08:31.360]  Alex Jones all right this is a incredibly important broadcast today
[08:31.360 --> 08:36.760]  Webster Tarpley who just got back from the front lines of the NATO Al Qaeda new
[08:36.760 --> 08:41.440]  world order attack on Syria and if you're not for Al Qaeda you're unpatriotic
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.240]  now according to our media they've given Al Qaeda of course Libya and the
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.280]  missiles which is even better because now they can menace the United States and
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.680]  the system can take even more of our liberties away because of the menace of
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.320]  Al Qaeda that is completely manufactured just like the underwear bomber on
[08:58.320 --> 09:02.640]  Christmas Day being gotten on the airplane by the US government that's all
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.440]  public but we're supposed to just ignore that and let the system come after we the
[09:07.440 --> 09:13.080]  people so Tarpley is going to be joining us Dr. Jerome Corsi on the buildup his
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.800]  intel is that it is attack on Iran is imminent we certainly know there's been
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.840]  a buildup towards that Ron Paul came out today and said the sanctions against
[09:22.840 --> 09:30.200]  Iran are a clear indicator that war is imminent as well and we've also are
[09:30.200 --> 09:36.640]  going to talk to some other folks that are coming up here on the broadcast
[09:36.640 --> 09:42.720]  today there's also stories like this one and this has been coming out for 20
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.880]  years in fact even previous to cell phones but being popularized in the
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.200]  last 25 years or so major studies were published showing that the type of
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.240]  wireless RF and microwaves coming off of different variants of cell phone
[09:59.240 --> 10:05.240]  communications is vibrating the DNA at exactly the right frequency they could
[10:05.240 --> 10:09.880]  have chosen other frequencies that are damaging but not as damaging they they've
[10:09.880 --> 10:13.120]  chosen several different frequency systems that just so happened to
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.320]  vibrate DNA and break the DNA triggering cancer and infertility and
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.080]  there's a big report out from Reuters today because now they know this is
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.560]  ubiquitous now they know everybody's addicted to it and civilization is based
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.800]  on it and they know how humans operate that we will just go ahead and keep
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.760]  something even if it's killing us if we've formed a habit with it we'll fry
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.120]  our children will will live in it will will die because it's it's it's what we
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.160]  were brought up with and what we're accustomed to laptop Wi-Fi said to nuke
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.960]  sperm and that's out of Reuters and they're they're just you know pretty
[10:53.960 --> 11:02.120]  much letting you know what's going on they're just throwing the whole thing in
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.000]  your face so we're going to be going over that because it it it dovetails with
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.760]  just saying you know what radiations a couple hundred times higher than it
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.440]  should be on this isotope or thousand times higher with that isotope or 20
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.800]  times higher with this isotope we'll just raise each isotope the level that's
[11:21.800 --> 11:28.440]  safe we'll just wave a magic bureaucratic wand and say it's safe for you in 86 for
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.080]  at least six months they didn't let anybody drink the milk or the vegetable
[11:32.080 --> 11:35.480]  that grew on the surface because they would bioaccumulate the different
[11:35.480 --> 11:39.640]  radioactive isotopes because they you know cared about the school kids and the
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.320]  UN itself estimates about a million people died of related cancers in the
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.480]  20-plus years that transpired this time it's much higher and then they just wave
[11:49.480 --> 11:52.680]  a wand Europe's got radiation levels going up on its own they've got
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.520]  disasters in multiple countries France the main one and now they just say hey
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.240]  other schools nearby one one plant that had a big radiation release in France a
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.720]  few months ago and the locals said should we evacuate should we not eat the
[12:07.720 --> 12:14.760]  vegetables they said eat them enjoy it's like until 1991 they wouldn't let the
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.600]  troops use do you they had it had it since the 50s and they suddenly waved a
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.780]  wand and said you know what use it enjoy no decontamination needed you know in
[12:25.780 --> 12:29.080]  1991 they did some decontamination but it was still shocking use and then it was
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.960]  like by the mid 90s you know what who needs it let's serve it out and have it
[12:34.960 --> 12:44.840]  manufactured into every form of munition 223 308 NATO 50 cal every fighting
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.600]  vehicles main gun use it enjoy it and get in there with the maintenance crew
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.800]  with no mask on it just cleaned the barrel out just just breathe it all I
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.000]  mean you know what one micron of it 20 30 years off your life being on the
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.200]  study die die it's patriotic die die die don't care it's good radiate your
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.200]  children cell phones everywhere blast everyone wireless in your house
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.640]  wireless in your business shell towers on top public schools giant cancer
[13:12.640 --> 13:17.480]  clusters giant microwave fryers in the airports eight years at Boston Logan
[13:17.480 --> 13:24.920]  seven times increased cancer cluster cover-ups just so what say it's okay I
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.920]  was going through the Las Vegas
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.720]  airport and they try to put through the scanner and I said no this this portly
[13:38.720 --> 13:45.480]  archetypal TSA type comes over and says mr. Jones I know who you are I listen to
[13:45.480 --> 13:49.760]  your show it is not true this is one one billion to the radiation of a cell
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.840]  phone John Hopkins University and I started saying but the head of John
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.640]  Hopkins radiology said they didn't do that study and it does does is link to
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.040]  cancer I said the scans off this machine I knew the name of it you can see the
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.320]  bones and people's fingers and he goes I've done my research you're welcome to
[14:07.320 --> 14:14.240]  your opinion now if you are not going to I am going to do a pat down or you are
[14:14.240 --> 14:17.320]  going to go through the other process which I knew was fines arrest whatever
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.960]  and I'm sitting there looking at him and I didn't even hate him I felt totally
[14:21.960 --> 14:28.000]  sorry for him he's in there roasting roasting and it doesn't matter the
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.640]  remember the TSA lied to Congress about radiation they got caught what was it a
[14:31.640 --> 14:36.200]  year ago it was it was January so it was almost a year ago it was like nine ten
[14:36.200 --> 14:40.600]  love months ago look you know almost 11 months ago and they just get caught
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.440]  lying about it and they sit there and they tell them there the radiation is
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.840]  nothing do you understand and they're like yes I believe you do I get to
[14:48.840 --> 14:55.280]  grope everybody yes you do see it's it's magical thinking
[14:59.400 --> 15:04.000]  the Environmental Protection Agency four months ago we were read author
[15:04.000 --> 15:12.840]  website shuttered here on air raised the radioactive isotope levels in several
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.880]  isotopes because there's hundreds hitting us from Japan still melting down
[15:16.880 --> 15:27.360]  blowing up routinely right across the Pacific from 100,000 times now the
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.400]  isotopes in some cases were just a few hundred times higher you know one isotope
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.240]  was 27 times at this university study another was 200 something it was a
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.960]  fair they just say you know what we'll just raise it a hundred thousand times
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.400]  how's that sound no matter how much there is and then scientists of course
[15:42.400 --> 15:49.640]  wrote articles saying 100,000 times if you got just tiny amounts of this it
[15:49.640 --> 15:52.960]  would kill you in a matter of days and by the way it's in the news every couple
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.520]  days I didn't get to it yesterday mainstream Japanese news and US news
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.560]  that oh yeah there are some people dying that worked on the Fukushima and the
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.240]  and people are the head of its had to go to hospital and there is some
[16:07.240 --> 16:15.440]  radiation poisoning and yeah Tokyo's population has gone way down on many of
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.960]  them have raced to the south but everything's okay just just stay there
[16:19.960 --> 16:31.160]  and suddenly there's leaks in Canada the United States trance and I don't think
[16:31.160 --> 16:38.160]  all of this is on accident because if you read deeper the globalist and of
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.880]  course Dr. Busby has talked about this here on air a chemical engineer and
[16:41.880 --> 16:46.480]  chemical physicist many of his colleagues believe from the research that
[16:46.480 --> 16:51.760]  this is a strategic plan to reduce population because nothing destroys
[16:51.760 --> 16:58.080]  DNA and lowers fertility like radiation and you know these are guys with like
[16:58.080 --> 17:03.080]  170 IQs and that's the realization studying this he's advised the EU the
[17:03.080 --> 17:07.320]  British government BBC and they come to realization that there are many of my
[17:07.320 --> 17:14.280]  colleagues who believe this is a purposeful operation to lower fertility
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.080]  especially sperm counts worldwide the establishment is known for decades this
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.720]  course is taking place and is still proliferating the older systems of
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.880]  nuclear power and have changed their attitude completely towards the dangers
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.360]  of radiation we are slowly being cooked in a radioactive field that the ambient
[17:37.360 --> 17:46.720]  level is being increased at an alarming rate here I could just I guess I could
[17:46.720 --> 17:51.720]  just I could interview myself I could interview Busby for the next hour I mean
[17:51.720 --> 17:59.480]  you got to have some gallows humor here we are living in a system run by Madden
[17:59.480 --> 18:07.200]  in absolute total complete madmen okay I'm gonna stop right there because I've
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.120]  already digressed I read one headline and then ran off down a rabbit trail I'll
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.280]  get to that later I've got to get to the really big enchilada something we may
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.840]  be able to do something about but regardless a story that illustrates
[18:18.840 --> 18:24.960]  everything we're talking about and is another bonafide super hardcore
[18:24.960 --> 18:30.320]  confirmation of everything that we have discussed here and everything that we've
[18:30.320 --> 18:40.000]  historically researched and predicted it's here and we're gonna go over it when
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.160]  we come back from break and that of course is the NDAA National Defense
[18:47.160 --> 18:54.920]  Authorization Act of 2012 they're funding next year's money and as several
[18:54.920 --> 19:01.640]  congressman Ron Paul and others Mark Udall has comments on it but there's
[19:01.640 --> 19:09.200]  also Congressman Justin Amish I believe say pronounce it he says that it does
[19:09.200 --> 19:14.120]  affect us citizens and that the law is carefully crafted to mislead the public
[19:14.120 --> 19:24.680]  see that's the added the added core of it is that the is that I've learned their
[19:24.680 --> 19:28.360]  tricks so that's how I was able to look at it and say no it says it doesn't
[19:28.360 --> 19:33.640]  affect citizens unless they say so it's always the same with the globals it's
[19:33.640 --> 19:39.480]  like the UN Charter on Human Rights you've got 29 incredible rights not
[19:39.480 --> 19:46.120]  privileges and then the net the final two say you have no rights of the UN says so
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.640]  it's like oh you've got all these rights in the contract but then there's a
[19:48.640 --> 19:51.960]  provision at the end saying that you actually don't get them and so now
[19:51.960 --> 19:56.440]  they're trying to pass this as early as today or tomorrow and it says we will

[24:22.800 --> 24:28.040]  country for the last 15 years the military dressing in police uniforms
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.760]  raiding gun dealer shops running checkpoints and in the last decade or
[24:32.760 --> 24:45.520]  so they started just setting up real checkpoints where the military is just
[24:45.520 --> 24:53.480]  out in their own regular uniforms with sidearms and it comes out in
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.720]  California it comes out in Alabama it comes out in Michigan it comes out in
[24:57.720 --> 25:06.640]  Texas that this is going on and then the local news is take the case of Arcadia
[25:06.640 --> 25:12.000]  Iowa oh the army's coming to train to confiscate the guns all 600 homes have
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.960]  agreed to be part of it they're gonna start at the little gun shop and then
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.800]  search for the militias in their homes isn't it nice I mean I've been to these
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.680]  drills it's all about the American people and then we get the Homeland

[25:36.560 --> 25:41.040]  to get them on by the way go after that guest warns that bill has echoes of
[25:41.040 --> 25:51.760]  World War two style internment without charge now the entire true structure of
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.080]  this in the training in the manuals in the videos in the local police training
[25:57.080 --> 26:03.680]  with military in the countless newscasts we've gotten this is not hidden now 90
[26:03.680 --> 26:12.160]  plus percent of it I'd say 92 93% over nine times out of 10 the drill is to

[35:37.360 --> 35:42.360]  has all the photos it says the 14 and 15 year old Explorer scouts go into the
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.520]  warehouse and take out the disgruntled Iraq war veteran their training to take
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.560]  on disgruntled veterans I mean it's right there stuff I saw with horror 13
[35:52.560 --> 35:56.960]  years ago I would go to these drills and watch Marines training to kill
[35:56.960 --> 36:02.960]  Americans to to in one case they go watch this execution and they put this
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.000]  the militia guy on his knees and they're like don't film this don't film but we
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.440]  get them putting them on their knees to shoot them in the back of the head and
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.480]  I'm gonna get more into this in a minute but look at this ESPN reporter
[36:17.480 --> 36:23.200]  explains why fine tape wasn't released in 2002 ten years ago nine and a half
[36:23.200 --> 36:31.320]  years ago and of course they're talking about the latest situation with the
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.280]  wife being recorded saying she watched her husband rape boys and ESPN confirmed
[36:37.280 --> 36:45.240]  it was her and just said we're not gonna go with the story this is how the evil
[36:45.240 --> 36:48.160]  is taken over and of course we're watching on prison planet dot TV they
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.040]  did find the article in the photos of the New York Times put that back up on
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.320]  screen for me thank you I put up the headline I want to give people the
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.120]  headlines I forget the headline so they can actually find it scouts trained to
[37:00.120 --> 37:08.040]  fight terrorist and more literal Soviet or Nazi style you can the exact same
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.400]  crud and who are they training it is now kind of and this came out four years
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.640]  ago three years ago people like oh who's worried about 14 15 year olds oh
[37:18.640 --> 37:22.440]  really I'll guarantee you those guys are in the military right now almost all of
[37:22.440 --> 37:30.240]  them and they're gonna get out in four years training to take on the American
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.120]  people I can't tell you in my 16 almost 17 years on air how many times I've been
[37:37.120 --> 37:42.360]  sent documents are actually gone to the event when whistleblowers and ROTC in
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.960]  Texas and other parts of the country call me and they say yeah we're we're
[37:46.960 --> 37:50.680]  doing drills in the next month you know out in this national forest or out in
[37:50.680 --> 37:54.880]  this area and we're going to simulate taking on American militias and killing
[37:54.880 --> 37:59.480]  them and these are offensive we're going out to the log cabins to simulate
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.600]  killing American gun owners I mean ladies and gentlemen it's not just the
[38:04.600 --> 38:09.080]  video games and the movies and demonizing Ron Paul supporters and sitcoms and
[38:09.080 --> 38:14.440]  stuff it's everywhere and that's why I have footage of the state police in
[38:14.440 --> 38:18.720]  Virginia pulling a naval veteran no criminal record over she's at a
[38:18.720 --> 38:23.840]  checkpoint Laurel's checkpoint they want to search her she says no they get her
[38:23.840 --> 38:27.920]  out of the car she doesn't resist they charge her with resisting and they find
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.160]  a pocket Constitution and like they were sir hand sir hand brainwashed or
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.360]  something where you show a crazy person a tomato and if they're trained to fear
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.560]  it they'll cower in the corner they start going and you think it's a money
[38:42.560 --> 38:46.000]  python skit you're like you guys swore an oath to this a pocket
[38:46.000 --> 38:54.680]  Constitution and they're literally going she's in the squad car but this
[38:54.680 --> 38:59.560]  they're out front the squad car behind her car going to the trunk and they
[38:59.560 --> 39:05.040]  find a Harrison Ford Patriot games VHS they're like I mean it's in road to
[39:05.040 --> 39:07.880]  tyranny people always hear this and don't believe me and go watch road to
[39:07.880 --> 39:14.400]  tyranny and actually see it I mean imagine grown men going I mean this is
[39:14.400 --> 39:23.600]  it's like look a mouse and they're like ah it's look a burden of tree ah but
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.480]  they haven't been trained to fear that it's like well I've got FEMA on tape to
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.800]  a huge classroom of police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.480]  going who are the number one terrorists in our history and the cops are like
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.400]  George Washington he's like good you recognize the threat in the enemy that's
[39:40.400 --> 39:44.360]  right these are bad people they were bad and the people that like them are bad
[39:44.360 --> 39:48.560]  you see the cops are going that's right I'm good and you think you're watching
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.280]  the joke it's not a joke I mean these are red dawn enemies I mean these people
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.520]  actually believe America is bad they believe they're defending America by
[40:01.520 --> 40:10.120]  going after the heart of America I just can't believe we found this is is it
[40:10.120 --> 40:16.080]  legal to have this he says to the his supervising state police guy and he's
[40:16.080 --> 40:20.800]  like I don't know how she may be allowed to have that and then he starts
[40:20.800 --> 40:24.760]  thinking he goes that might be what she's talking about because well because
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.480]  one of the cops actually gets embarrassed he goes well maybe that's
[40:27.480 --> 40:30.960]  what she's talking about her rights maybe maybe she's allowed to have that the
[40:30.960 --> 40:38.960]  smart one says maybe she's allowed to have a pocket Constitution one of the
[40:38.960 --> 40:49.480]  ones we sell the radiation levels have gone up and instead of testing the milk
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.240]  and the food and destroying what's dangerous they just say we'll just say
[40:53.240 --> 41:00.440]  it's safe and we'll say George Washington's bad I mean look right now
[41:00.440 --> 41:04.000]  I'm letting that into my mind this is why I go this is why when that state
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.600]  police got pulled me over last week and was trying to search the car and stuff
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.520]  I just started not even yelling at him I was like you know the government ships
[41:12.520 --> 41:16.640]  most the drugs in you know that's a bottle of water sitting right there
[41:16.640 --> 41:19.640]  you're trying to act like I've done something wrong in some little mind game
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.040]  with yourself like I'm the bad guy and you're the good guy I said I want to
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.960]  search your car statistically governments the most dangerous group out
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.640]  there I said my god you know your whole future is going to be destroyed by the
[41:31.640 --> 41:35.720]  system you're helping bring in and at the end he just kept going I'm now
[41:35.720 --> 41:40.680]  going to test your tent if it's below 25 you get a ticket and it goes to 29 he
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.840]  goes I guess you're okay and he just keeps going and going and smiling at me
[41:44.840 --> 41:53.080]  and and then he goes I like your radio show especially the Sunday one bye-bye
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.080]  I mean it was twilight zone this I'm looking in this guy's eyes he's totally
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.400]  compartmentalized he has no future under the New World Order they're putting
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.280]  poison in your water buddy boy you think that's funny I guarantee if that state
[42:07.280 --> 42:10.600]  police guy let's say was in a restaurant he came out of the bathroom and saw me
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.640]  put something in his drink he would run and tackle me if I resisted punch me in
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.520]  the head and he should somebody do it to me I would they would drag me out put
[42:18.520 --> 42:23.280]  me in a squad car test it and if they even if it was not poisonous I'd get in
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.840]  trouble and should but if it was poisonous I would go to jail for 20
[42:27.840 --> 42:35.720]  years but the globalists do it and it's like well that's the government see
[42:35.720 --> 42:41.520]  that's why I say I can't play along with you anymore I can't play along like
[42:41.520 --> 42:47.040]  America's okay and everything's fine and let's all just go back to sleep this
[42:47.040 --> 42:52.640]  is not entertainment this this this the show is not about ratings and being a
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.240]  big shot and and all of this baloney you notice I haven't talked about Herman
[42:56.240 --> 43:01.520]  Kane and his zipper today because they're about to try to start war with
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.400]  Iran they're trying to get rid of posse commentatus they're openly moving to
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.120]  take people's bank accounts and pension funds they're GMOing all the crops I've
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.560]  got all the studies how it's hurting people just type in GMO linked to organ
[43:16.560 --> 43:21.360]  failure infertility you'll get all the major scientific studies we're being
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.560]  killed by psychopaths I'm right I've got the facts in triplicate stacked on
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.840]  triplicate stacked on triplicate and I I'm being pulled over just randomly or
[43:32.840 --> 43:39.640]  who knows they probably got GPS on my car I don't know and and given 20
[43:39.640 --> 43:46.720]  questions and being white glove inspected and I looked at the guy and I
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.800]  said I said I know full well you guys are told what he legals go or drunk
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.200]  driving no insurance you name it but you're told to throw the book at us and
[43:55.200 --> 44:01.120]  goes well I don't like that I agree with you I go you agree with me but you're
[44:01.120 --> 44:08.800]  you're here checking my window tint I went hey Bubba I bought this car at the
[44:08.800 --> 44:17.880]  dealership but so what so what if I had tinted was too dark while all these
[44:17.880 --> 44:22.240]  massive crimes are completely ignored the system is busy coming down the
[44:22.240 --> 44:27.240]  general public like a ton of bricks get your priority straight and I know the
[44:27.240 --> 44:29.920]  argument is well we're just following orders well that's what they said in
[44:29.920 --> 44:36.840]  Germany and the Nuremberg defense does not work it's just comical that I don't
[44:36.840 --> 44:42.480]  break any laws even the stupid ones I've got a pretty boring life outside of
[44:42.480 --> 44:49.440]  research and broadcasting and I get pulled over routinely and I see more
[44:49.440 --> 44:56.360]  cops than ever pulling people over and it's all a big joke it's all a big joke
[44:56.360 --> 45:00.040]  you're not doing anything for the safety and security of this country you're not
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.080]  peace officers you're Aaron boys you're not even there to raise money you guys
[45:04.080 --> 45:07.320]  are told you've got a run everybody in the ground and do all this to raise
[45:07.320 --> 45:10.520]  money folks the globalist can issue all the money they want you're there to
[45:10.520 --> 45:14.680]  train everybody to have constant interaction with uniforms and and to be
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.640]  searched and to have our bodies touched so we can be forcibly inoculated that's
[45:19.640 --> 45:24.200]  what all this is about it's all about acclimation and you know what you will
[45:24.200 --> 45:34.600]  pay just as bad as anybody else for what you're helping bring in you will
[45:34.600 --> 45:40.880]  because your wife and your children are gonna live in this world and look I get
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.040]  it I know society's degenerating it's not just the government the police that
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.520]  are degenerating the public looks like they've been shot by a mutation ray or
[45:48.520 --> 45:53.680]  something because they've been chemically biologically electronically
[45:53.680 --> 46:05.560]  absolutely hammered now getting back to the NDAA situation then I'll give the
[46:05.560 --> 46:08.560]  number out and take your calls we'll probably join us in about 50 minutes
[46:08.560 --> 46:17.520]  getting back into this within this story you learn so much the bill clearly is
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.360]  the classic Patriot Act or John Warren Defense Authorization Act or Enemy
[46:22.360 --> 46:29.080]  Commissions Act model it says in bold this will not be used on U.S. citizens
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.480]  and then you go down a couple sections when we have it in the article unless the
[46:34.480 --> 46:42.040]  government says so it's the fine print and that's why the ACLU Ron Paul in
[46:42.040 --> 46:52.000]  FullWars.com congressman Amish and others have all come out and quoted the same
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.400]  section and said no this affects citizens of course it does they use the
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.800]  previous acts to kill U.S. citizens they say well it's and we're all a lucky by
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.040]  the way I predicted they would quote say he'd been killed they said he'd been
[47:05.040 --> 47:10.280]  killed five times before that at least he's the number one in Al Qaeda he some
[47:10.280 --> 47:14.640]  argued he was number two number three who dined secretly at the Pentagon while
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.880]  he was on the FBI's most wanted list the guy that runs all the real nutcase
[47:20.880 --> 47:29.960]  Muslim extremist like Hassan like Mutalib the underwear bomber the Times
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.520]  Square bomber the shoe bomber yeah the idiots that don't know you think you
[47:33.520 --> 47:36.760]  like plastic explosives
[47:40.600 --> 47:47.560]  it's on record that he's CIA and was trying to provocateur as many people as
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.720]  he could mean Al Qaeda works for the people that run our country that's why
[47:51.720 --> 47:54.800]  they've been given Libya they've been brought into Syria it's in mainstream
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.960]  news they're being landed and brought in and and then the West is going to call
[47:58.960 --> 48:01.840]  them freedom fighters and bomb the country into the Stone Age and call it
[48:01.840 --> 48:06.760]  freedom and peace and say this is not military now send 3,000 Saudis in there
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.240]  sorties send in the bombers blow the daylights out of it it's peace I mean
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.800]  that just raise the radiation levels it's healthy bombing countries is peace
[48:15.800 --> 48:22.040]  Al Qaeda is good George Washington's bad it just twilight zone crazy I mean
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.400]  you're living in the twilight zone I'm living in it it's crazy it's gonna get
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.920]  crazier tyranny is crazy Nero chewing children's throats out is crazy
[48:31.920 --> 48:35.840]  Caligula marrying his horse and making it the head of the Senate is crazy
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.480]  Kettler running around doing it is crazy but it's what they do now killing 60
[48:41.480 --> 48:46.320]  plus million people because he wanted to that's pretty crazy but they're gonna do
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.720]  it so and and and people won't wake up to him so it's it's all gonna happen
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.840]  they could they could coat cyanide pills in American flags and American
[48:59.840 --> 49:01.800]  women would give them to their children even though they knew it was gonna kill
[49:01.800 --> 49:04.800]  them well it's an American flag die you know my child's dead but it was an
[49:04.800 --> 49:08.440]  American flag you're not against the American flag are you
[49:08.440 --> 49:18.040]  literal mind control literal trance and the minute I was reading the ACLU
[49:18.040 --> 49:20.480]  article who I don't particularly like is they don't defend real liberties but
[49:20.480 --> 49:25.120]  they did get it right on this I notice that article had gone up on their site
[49:25.120 --> 49:30.400]  and we'd posted it and I saw within minutes staged attack pieces saying it
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.120]  wasn't true quoting the false provision within minutes there was no way people
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.520]  had already found that and had that so I said okay and we went and checked some
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.720]  IPs it was the standard government people like okay they don't even try to hide
[49:41.720 --> 49:45.360]  it they don't care they have total disdain we do report on this soon I've
[49:45.360 --> 49:54.280]  just been so busy and again we're being engaged here they don't just admit it
[49:54.280 --> 49:57.200]  up front they deceive their enemy the American people it's all military
[49:57.200 --> 50:01.000]  deception they deceive the troops it's all a culture of lies who's the father
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.240]  of lies that they sell you the unjustifies the means that's their big
[50:05.240 --> 50:13.000]  trick in compartmentalization and so I had Watson write an article and within
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.200]  two minutes of it going live dozens of comments with the section saying I'm a
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.880]  liar saying it's not true but our listeners by themselves went and found
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.680]  the sections that said that it was exempted though that the exemption was
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.720]  exempted and defeated them and that's what feels good they could kill me right
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.320]  now the truth goes on we've taught people the enemy's tricks folks have
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.680]  learned them on their own but Rand Paul has come out and said yes it does
[50:40.680 --> 50:42.960]  affect Americans the head of the Japanese American League
[50:42.960 --> 50:48.080]  Citizens League has come out and the other Congressman has also come out
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.280]  Republican Congressman Justin Amash told the Grand Rapids Press the language
[50:53.280 --> 50:56.360]  of the bill is carefully crafted to mislead the public that it is the
[50:56.360 --> 51:00.240]  greatest tyranny we've ever seen it is lock you up throw away the key or kill

[54:48.600 --> 54:53.840]  got another article here where mainline peaceful anti-war groups are well of
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.000]  course anyone politically involved left right libertarian you are being watched
[55:00.000 --> 55:10.680]  and they get these right wing type guys to spawn the left and left wing guys to
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.400]  spawn the right and in between that they've got everything covered I noticed
[55:15.400 --> 55:19.320]  that Brandon Darby writes for big government and Andrew Brett Bart does
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.040]  some good work I think he knows all about Brandon Darby the fellow who was
[55:24.040 --> 55:30.600]  operating here in Austin the informant with the activist up at the RNC in
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.600]  Minnesota who supposedly we're gonna try to ball off cocktail things and you

[55:40.320 --> 55:44.960]  Aaron just handed me this during the break he's an activist who rose the
[55:44.960 --> 55:48.120]  international recognition for his role in co-founding directing the common
[55:48.120 --> 55:58.880]  ground relief organization is it that nice he currently resides in his home
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.920]  state of Texas and continues with his passion to investigate and expose
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.800]  groups and individuals who intend to harm the United States I guess the big
[56:07.800 --> 56:11.480]  mega corporations that have taken us over though he now does so as a private
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.560]  citizen he's become a staunch ally and advocate for the FBI's use of informants
[56:15.560 --> 56:21.500]  and for the role they play in the front lines keeping citizens rights and safety
[56:21.500 --> 56:29.960]  protected aren't we lucky and he got he has an article here leftist drink
[56:29.960 --> 56:36.280]  Chardonnay in first-class while toying with the lives of young revolutionaries
[56:36.280 --> 56:42.240]  it's really weird maybe he's misguided I don't know very creepy getting back to
[56:42.240 --> 56:46.800]  what I was covering here they've always wanted to use the military against
[56:46.800 --> 56:50.360]  the American people and we've got a Super Congress I have an economist
[56:50.360 --> 56:53.800]  article I covered last night where it's like let's just get rid of governments
[56:53.800 --> 56:58.280]  and have technocrats run things yeah the Constitution's not good you know you've
[56:58.280 --> 57:04.120]  seen Time Magazine Newsweek come out and say that they're really pushing this and
[57:04.120 --> 57:10.320]  they admit in this legislation that you can be killed arrested disappeared no
[57:10.320 --> 57:18.000]  trial thrown in one of these emergency centers this is all admitted now but
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.160]  they're not FEMA camps they're emergency centers it's like this isn't a

[57:39.240 --> 57:44.120]  bill can be applied to US citizens and he went on telling the Grand Rapids Press
[57:44.120 --> 57:48.040]  that the language of the bill is carefully crafted to mislead the public
[57:48.040 --> 57:54.040]  and it allows military law that's martial law that's the suspension of
[57:54.040 --> 58:02.160]  regular law and martial martial means military martial law but they won't call
[58:02.160 --> 58:10.680]  it that it's security keeping you safe from the terrorist who the government's
[58:10.680 --> 58:14.520]  publicly given control of Libya to and is now shipping in the Syria and that's
[58:14.520 --> 58:22.680]  coming up with partly after your calls and we've got ESPN helping cover up

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.640]  alright we're already in hour number two and I've been pontificating I'll get
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:44.440]  more into the NDAA the national head of the Japanese American Citizens League
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.120]  warns that Bill has echoes of World War two style internment without charge Ron
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.600]  Paul comes out and warns it's horrible Rand Paul says he's gonna try to block it
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.720]  your phone calls are needed other congressmen are pointing out that it
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.520]  says Americans are exempt but then takes the exemption out later again just you
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:08.280]  are seen as an absolute enemy by the banksters and they're just trying to
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.360]  convince the police and military or the enemy and that's why we spend so much
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.320]  time reaching out to police and military not in a suck-up way look if you want to
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.240]  destroy your own future and sign on to pure evil and buy into the false script
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:28.240]  and propaganda you know free will universe free will make your decision
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.880]  as for me I'm not signing on this I know these people are and just because
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.880]  you're tuning in going man this guy says some really horrible stuff about people
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.200]  in government I back it up believe me I wish every day people over the years
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.320]  accused me of exaggerating or fear mongering and occasionally I may
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.080]  exaggerate something occasionally I may you know inadvertently be fear
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.880]  mongering it's true because reality is pretty darn crazy but nine times out of
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.320]  ten or more it's worse than what I've said in fact a lot of times I don't
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.360]  even tell you what I really think this guy I think people can't handle it but
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.880]  somebody's got to face these people and I'm not talking about just me I mean do
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.280]  you get in the ditch and wait for the wolves to come or do you get together
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.000]  and do something about it and it starts with a lot of times I'll see police at
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.880]  the mall or I'll see him somewhere and they look completely bored but still
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.960]  kind of in on the power trip of staring everybody I'll walk over go hey how do
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:36.000]  you like what's going on America and I'll start bringing up real issues to
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.360]  him because we've got to reach out to these people but more importantly we've
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.680]  got to reach out to our friends our family everybody and have a discussion
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:49.880]  about where this country has gone what is unfolded in this nation but I've got a
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.800]  couple articles I'll get you later at the calls imagine the magnitude I keep
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.840]  using that word because what it's what we're dealing with here
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:09.920]  imagine the magnitude the proportions of it publicly admitted that the terror
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.200]  manuals the rest of it the surface is al-qaeda oh we got to fight him and then
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.520]  meanwhile our own government is putting al-qaeda and power all over the world
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.000]  and then you get into the real files and it's demonizing every political
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.760]  movement in America the only way the globalist like you is if you're on six
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.880]  or seven prescription drugs watching five six hours of TV a day and believing
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.720]  whatever the media tells you and flying Chinese made American flags made by
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.640]  slaves outside your house and then you're gonna have your pension funds stolen
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.840]  and abused but they know because the government you'll just kind of get in a
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.720]  fetal position and roll over and the government will blow something up you
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.440]  know say al-qaeda did it oh you took my pension fund but al-qaeda just hit go
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.240]  ahead and take more and it's like yeah that that's right al-qaeda just hit mm-hmm
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.120]  got him on the airplane mm-hmm oh publicly we got caught getting him on
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.280]  the airplane but you're not gonna worry about that are you because you're
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.400]  incredibly weak-minded and the public's like yes I'm not gonna worry about that

[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:42.400]  biologically under assault and we have the globalist documents of how and why
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.360]  they're doing it and then you look at all this other news what does it matter
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.160]  I'm gonna go to your calls but a lot of people obviously probably want to hear
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:58.560]  what I have to say about Herman King I have seen because you know who cares
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.080]  about radiation levels going up or who cares about I'm getting ready to loot
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.800]  more pension funds or take private bank accounts now who cares about global
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.000]  depression people want to know about Herman King I've done special reports
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.160]  on it I've shown the lies of Herman Cain he is one of the best liars I've
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.440]  ever seen most people even when Bill Clinton lies I could I could tell he
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.880]  was lying when he said I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky how
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:34.280]  dare you I knew right then it was a lie Herman came when he told Ron Paul and I
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.720]  will can really quote him good by imitating but the point is he's like
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.320]  listen Ron Paul you believe too much on the internet I never said that you need
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.600]  to stop believing all that stuff on the internet and he said it very
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.720]  convincingly Ron Paul looked at him cocked an eyebrow look back to his notes
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.880]  and said we'll look into that Herman we'll look into that he said it in his
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.920]  book he said it in multiple radio shows I have played it here but he looked right
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.080]  at Ron Paul and said that is wrong I'm tired of you misrepresenting me and
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.800]  other people I never said people are stupid they want to audit the Fed I
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.320]  never said that and you need to stop believing everything you see on the
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.800]  internet and a bunch of people laugh because he's a good liar and I knew I'd
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.360]  heard him say that I knew I'd read the quotes he says it all the time I've
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.160]  seen groups interview like we are change he says it so I went and looked it up
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.800]  and sure enough he was a liar and he knows he's a liar and so the minute I
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.920]  heard about this with all the women of course it's political of course it's
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.760]  Obama people of course they're trying to get him it doesn't matter he's still
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.040]  ball-faced lion you think that big high-powered multimillion dollar a year
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.680]  running all those corporations running around I mean come on folks where
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.920]  there's smoke there's fire and now she's got all these hundreds of phone calls
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.760]  and over over 14 years give me a break right there in the town and sure of
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:11.120]  course it's probably political with her as well but he is a liar and once I
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.120]  catch you lying to me over and over again I don't believe a word that comes
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.360]  out of your mouth if something can be an honest mistake I'll give you one
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.720]  chance used to I give people two three four chances now you get one chance in
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.480]  my life and I catch you lying to me again I am never going to talk to you
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:39.760]  again it's a real luxury to be able to just never talk to bad people again it's
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.200]  a real luxury the problem is we can't get these government liars out of our
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.240]  lives they and they know we're waking up to people are always like call Washington
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.680]  let them know and I'm not saying it's bad keep letting them you know you that
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.960]  you're aware of them they have a 9% approval rating they're all they say
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.800]  they're allowed to insider trade and give contracts to themselves and their
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.640]  wives total criminal activity total embezzlement total fraud insider
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.360]  trading been rigging and they just say well we're allowed to of course a group
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.640]  of crooks most of them involved in absolute corruption financials the main
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:22.360]  thing of course of course of course they're trying to get military on the
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.640]  streets of course they're trying to federalize they're a bunch of criminals
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.040]  they want to secure their ill-gotten gains and expand it that's what tyranny
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.560]  is why do criminals want to get control of government because you can take over
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:42.440]  everything and their experts at it and the big think tanks and the robber
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.240]  barons are expert at it and the Congress people are just their little
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.640]  their little prostitutes who are in there selling out everything for chicken
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.840]  feed member Barney Frank he got caught running an underage brothel 14-year-old
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.800]  boys he came out a few years ago and he said it's an invisible empire the film
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.760]  we produced last year the news clips and he said listen the police will stop
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:15.440]  investigating this or I will tell the names in Congress and you know what the
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:26.400]  police dropped it instantly instantly just like they knew 10 years ago at ESPN
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.920]  about the tapes of the wife standing out washing rape little kids and they said
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.400]  well you know we're not going to even give it to the cops
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.480]  yeah it's all in the all in the sick family of pedophiles and sickos and
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.640]  trash and control freaks and back scratchers and all these people that
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.960]  that's that's let me tell you when I first started getting involved politically
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.360]  17 years ago people would come and tell me this stuff and I'm like oh yeah sure
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:59.280]  pedophile rings run at all sure they do mm-hmm have you taken your medication
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.680]  oh there's a place called skull and bones where they do satanic rituals and
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.680]  bohemian growth sure sure now can I get my coffee and get out of this place
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:18.400]  thank you take your medication and then I finally actually looked and only
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.400]  admitting the horror is gonna stop them they're gonna keep on going just like
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.680]  people in Germany couldn't believe what it was doing all right I'm gonna go to
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.240]  your phone calls and coming up Reuters admits Wi-Fi's frying and killing all
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.480]  your sperm all part of the plan and nobody's gonna stop it's fun dying we'll
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.680]  get more into mainline political groups listed as terrorist and of course under
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.320]  the military to be arrested and killed and they have you know just take you out
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.560]  shoot you in the back of the head they got special units for that of course
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.360]  once that starts people won't have a choice anymore but the bankers are gonna
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.720]  sit off shore they don't care of the military and police get chewed up in a
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.360]  fight with Americans they hate you as much as they hate the American people
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:11.760]  continuing here just kind of a prelude to the real kickoff of everything just
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.720]  so you can make your choice we're here just in case you might not want to be
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.040]  a slave but I know a lot of you new listeners haha listen to this crazy
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:31.200]  guy okay great if you don't listen now you'll assuredly remember later you know
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.400]  I saw articles about people collapsing and dying and being run over and being
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.920]  hurt and people for hours going by the dead body at the big mega mart and not
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.760]  caring because they had some place to go so one of the guys you know dying of a
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.960]  heart attack probably would have lived and they just let him sit there for an
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.240]  hour after he was dead because they had some purchases to make oh what's gonna
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.200]  happen when you're dying what's gonna happen when you're in trouble well your
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.920]  neighbors are gonna act just the same you've been taught how to be shallow
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:11.760]  childlike arrested development blobs but there's a lot of us who aren't like
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.440]  that and so just because you want to be slaves doesn't mean I I get to be one
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.680]  just because you want to go along with this and I'll never forget the little
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.600]  Madeline lady choking I've told the story 20 times and they wouldn't help her
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.320]  while she was choking I'd been in the bathroom she'd been choking a while she
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.400]  was now falling on the table purple and I had to shove the nineties out of the
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:38.560]  way they were like no no we called 9-1-1 no no you're not gonna make noises like
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.840]  that government rape me I mean this is the attitude of these people there's
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.960]  armies of them they're dangerous and then after I'd gotten the thing out of
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.320]  the woman's throat my wife's like well they're saying you're a hero let's
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.640]  stand I'm like no get out of here because they were already starting to
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:00.240]  calculate little demons maybe he might have heard a rib or something I mean I
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.760]  understand them so I had to help her and then get out because helping them is
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.600]  what they don't want spiritually they want to be plowed under they hate
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.960]  themselves well not me I like myself okay all right I'm done with you I'm
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.160]  done with you them I'm talking to those out there who serve this this this
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:28.400]  weakness Elaine in Texas you're on the air go ahead hi hey first of all I just
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.080]  want to tell you that God used you to bring me back to him thank you thank
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:40.520]  you last night I rewatched a video that David I did in an interview by the name
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:46.080]  of Arizona wilder and I watched it again for three hours to make sure that my
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.320]  information was not erroneous but at about halfway through you know an hour
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.600]  and a half through that video she starts naming names about people that were at
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.960]  these satanic meetings you know the Royals the bushes and all that and new
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:08.760]  gingrich was one of them so it's well look look all I know is is that it's in
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:13.080]  seeing in today the evidence that sir hands sir and this has been known since
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.760]  it happened with the RFK killing was on drugs was given a hypnotic drug you go
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.920]  to the dentist they give you a halcyon for you know that's an amnesia you're
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.760]  in a highly suggestible zombie state then and that he was a diversion and this
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.880]  and the police did their job and said no he didn't shoot him Kennedy was shot
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.000]  from behind the different caliber sir hands arm was pinned on the table did
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.880]  not hit Kennedy and it turned out even BBC reported three CIA guys were in the
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.600]  crowd the day it happened and the guy that did that really did the shooting
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.880]  one of the bodyguards was CIA and worked at a skunk works operation and they
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.760]  killed him they had a drugged up guy actually on the drugs doing it and so
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.760]  that Arizona Wilder stuff I believe she was involved in some of that but when
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.000]  you really get into all the crazy stuff they see in things that's part of the
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.320]  hallucinogens they give them but newt gingrich is involved in these key
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.040]  future societies that are admittedly Luciferian admit me I read his quotes
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.600]  about global consciousness the one-world order the getting rid of the family the
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:21.720]  power-seeding in him yes newt gingrich is Illuminati there there's no doubt and I
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.440]  wouldn't be surprised if that interview is inaccurate newt gingrich is super
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.760]  super movie bad news I mean he is he is a very demonic creature I can look at
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:38.200]  him he can't even cloak it he's seething with evil I mean he's supported NAFTA
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:47.040]  GATT open borders gun control abortion carbon taxes world government end of the
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.840]  family I mean just an absolute total demon and I've got him in the news today
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.960]  saying he is the real conservative I guess Al Gore is too no newt gingrich is

[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.840]  and here's a quote the definition of indefinite detention sections of the
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:01.000]  NDAA bill will turn the whole United States into a battlefield and hand the
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.040]  executive branch the power to have the military arrest US citizens and hold
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:11.800]  them without trial I mean it doesn't get any more tyrannical than that and I'm
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.440]  gonna warn you again they got all the good old boys to sign on to this cuz
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.040]  they said it's the brown Arabs and they're like we'll kill them all and the
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:24.280]  system's like okay we will meanwhile they actually give al-Qaeda control of
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:29.480]  major countries it's all about imploding the dollar and bankrupting the
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:33.520]  country by design the globalist have always hated America this is their long
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.440]  term plan they don't do it through a frontal assault they do it by posing as
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:45.880]  our loving patriotic leaders that care so much about the troops now we've got a
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.000]  lot of friends in high places there's a lot of good people throughout the system
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.280]  public and private this doesn't have to happen but the system has these psychos
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.920]  in control of it at the top and they're able to carry it out if we don't speak
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:03.760]  out against it boldly or if you're on the inside leak information bare minimum
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:13.880]  soft sabotage just don't implement things that are unconstitutional that's
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.400]  how you do it juries can say no to laws that they believe are unjust that's
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.680]  constitutional so they're trying to get rid of juries there's a lot of ways to
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.320]  stop this and we'd already be in great tyranny we're already in it to a great
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.200]  extent but not as bad as it's gonna get but we've held it up and that's given us
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.080]  time you've held it up to wake a lot of people up Peter in Washington you're on
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:45.640]  the year go ahead oh hello Alex yesterday you talked about Larry McDonald yes
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:52.560]  and I you know I had his picture on my wall for about 20 years and I wonder if
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:57.000]  you could go into some detail about that what you know and where you've got the
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.200]  info and so forth because well I've talked a lot of the John Birch society
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.520]  people and you know what I want to get a McManus on the head of the John Birch
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.760]  society he hadn't been on a long time folks let's get him on next week or this
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.440]  week and you can go research it even on Wikipedia I don't always believe
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.480]  Wikipedia but it's got all the links to the accurate documents very suspicious
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.400]  you know the plane forced down and then reports later where the people being
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.760]  tortured disappearing and that was clearly an authorized event where that
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.080]  happened and he was really upset in the system because he was a good guy and I
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.200]  should do a whole report like that's an idea I've actually got a file where I
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.680]  put ideas I'm gonna tell the crew I want to do a the next few weeks problems I
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.640]  start researching and then never get around actually doing the report I'll
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.760]  do a special nightly news report and try to air it on the radio the next day
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:56.440]  about Congressman Larry McDonald okay thank you anything else sir nope that's
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:06.360]  it thank you that's very sad of course the telltale sign is and there was no
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:13.160]  investigation it's just like oh just land it and keep the people sure very
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:20.040]  sick Steve in Florida Steve you're on the air welcome hey Alex first time
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:26.600]  caller here it's pleasure to talk to you I was just watching last night on NBC the
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:32.240]  CFR anchor Brian Williams was talking about how more and more parents are
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.800]  opting out of the vaccine system you know it's funny one of my crew actually
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.480]  brought me let me grab it a transcript of that nightly news propaganda on
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.520]  vaccines and they said oh my gosh the measles are gonna be horrible if we if it
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.000]  just a few other percentage points of people don't get the shots that's gonna
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.600]  kill old people and and and they're scaring folks saying if you aren't
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.600]  vaccinated you'll make others who are get sick I thought they're protected and
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.080]  I've heard daughter Dean Adele say people should be arrested that don't
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.960]  inoculate what how many shots 100 is 200 300 good whatever these companies come
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:14.240]  out with a lobby and then I have to take it to protect us when the proof is they
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.520]  don't even protect us so it's this idea of make it the law to take the shots and
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.640]  they're even talking about checkpoints to make sure you've taken all the shots
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:28.160]  what was your take on that well it's ridiculous but it just really brings me
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.240]  to the point that we're having the biggest effect on the Illuminati in their
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.680]  biggest profit center which is the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.680]  industry well exactly what they do is they slow kill us while they suck our

[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:45.200]  have a right to not eat corn and other food staples that have had
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.640]  pharmacological attributes added to them or that have had pesticides added to
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.640]  them with a plant actually grows its own pesticide at 1,000 times the natural
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:01.760]  level that the toxic fungus normally grows France overturns a ban on GM
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.760]  crops their highest administrative body ah overturn the courts it's all
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.720]  administrative law and that TSA guy was getting ready to try to go down my pants
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.000]  he said I have administrative rights and a little twinkle in his eye a little
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.640]  twinkie twinkle France's highest administrative body overturned two
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.400]  Ministry of Agriculture rulings on Monday banning the planting of
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.680]  genetically modified corn and of course here they try to block you even having
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.720]  labeling you're not allowed to even know to they don't want you to know you're
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.240]  you're evil two government ministers quickly said they were looking for ways
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.360]  to continue blocking the crop yeah a lot of those elitist over there enjoy
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:48.200]  their farmland and stuff well sorry it's time to get your GMO corn oh your
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:58.400]  honeybees aren't all dying they will be soon don't worry we care about you and
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:04.320]  there's come out a report the famous cop for pepper spraying the peaceful people
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.280]  sitting down and then how they spun it and said well basically your criminals
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.840]  for being sprayed in the face turns out John Pike and no longer ford his
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.040]  mortgage after the housing market crash it doesn't matter though this whole
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.560]  future is going to be destroyed by the globalist he loves them it's fun to get
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:23.920]  to spray peaceful people in the face and our media is like that's freedom that
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.640]  that's freedom oh taking people's private MF global accounts that's freedom too oh
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.680]  the army secretly arresting people and gonna put you in FEMA camps for life no
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.160]  judge or jury or they can even kill you well that sounds like freedom I mean
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.960]  they're fighting al-Qaeda there's nothing scary about having secret arrest a
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.520]  secret in prison I mean that's not dangerous to have the government doing
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:49.040]  that I'm not scared of that I'm scared of the al-Qaeda who the government gets
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:54.120]  on the airplanes and protects and that brings us to our next stack of reports
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:59.360]  Iranian protesters storm UK embassy image shows Iranian missile site

[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.200]  your rights totally ridiculous Iranian protesters okay we're gonna go to
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.280]  Webster Griffin Tarpley and then your phone calls 30 minutes after that the
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.360]  first 30 minutes of the next hour and somebody who's been a bit hawkish and
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.000]  has a lot of insider sources did work for government agencies and things drum
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.200]  course he's gonna be joining us talk about Iran but I wanted to go to Webster
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:57.640]  Griffin Tarpley of Tarpley.net fresh back from the front lines of Damascus
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:02.260]  you name it in Syria and he was there the public says it's Western forces
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:07.000]  shooting and sniping just everybody just to create a cutout kind of like
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.480]  Occupy Wall Street was just a cutout of there's people dying and he's a back and
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.720]  a lot of this is being confirmed in mainstream news but the stuff we saw a
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.560]  month ago where the Al Qaeda forces ran up the Al Qaeda flag and all the major
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.760]  cities and had signs saying Syria here we come but our media is actually saying
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.680]  that we've got to attack Syria because they like Al Qaeda of course Al Qaeda is
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.600]  actually attacking them but does it matter with the American people just
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.320]  just say Al Qaeda you can walk up to the average American and say I'm gonna take
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.600]  your car I'm fighting Al Qaeda they'd say here's my car I'm gonna beat your kids
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.040]  head in with a baseball bat I'm fighting Al Qaeda they'd say baseball bat please
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.600]  let me help you I'm gonna gang rape your wife fighting Al Qaeda we'll grab
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.800]  certainly are there a hundred of you would you like to blow her head off in
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.800]  the process you're fighting Al Qaeda they're like yes we'd like to oh good
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.960]  fight Al Qaeda then we now go to historian doctor of history and also
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.720]  he's an economist and author on Obama who wrote the unauthorized biography on
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.680]  our Lordship Webster Tarpley fresh back from Damascus there in DC or I guess
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:18.800]  you're in Maryland today Tarpley tell us tell us what you've seen well I've
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.240]  been in Damascus as you've mentioned and in unharms and in a place called Banyas
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.400]  in and also in Syria which is on the coast I've actually I've been through
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:35.320]  the port city of Tartus and this is now the place where just after I pass through
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:40.240]  there we have the arrival of this Russian naval task force I don't think
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.680]  they're all in the port the port of Tartus has been expanded and upgraded
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.400]  with some rather important you know additions to the facilities over the
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.320]  last couple of years and the information I have but one one report comes from
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:00.480]  general Michel Aoun the head of the Christians of Lebanon I think a figure
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:07.760]  like de Gaulle the savior of of Lebanon he told me a week ago the Saturday
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.760]  morning that the Russian fleet had actually arrived and I got this confirmed
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  from a Russian journalist a woman working in Damascus and it's a fleet that's
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:22.000]  composed of the Admiral Kuznetsov which is a an aircraft carrier or at least the
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.120]  helicopter carrier maybe a through-deck cruiser might be an eternal yeah it's
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.720]  like a trip carrier helicopter it's kind of like the Coronado Marine Corps ship
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.600]  right and then we've got a heavy cruiser the Moskva the Moskva is a heavy duty
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.480]  heavy cruiser with with the missile missiles on board three or four nuclear
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.600]  submarines and the trick with the submarines is you don't know how many
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.120]  because they're they're underwater if they come through the Bosporus and the
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.240]  Dardanelles if they were coming from Odessa and the Russian black sea fleet
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.240]  then they would have to surface as they go through the the Bosporus and the
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.720]  Dardanelles because that's the the treaty the treaty of Montreux I think says
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.440]  if it's the submarine you got to come up to the surface to go through but
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:07.240]  according to the the Russian journalist I talked to in Damascus she said that
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.080]  these these ships had come from romance so she said there were there were three
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.400]  or four nuclear submarines that were known and maybe more and I think also an
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.800]  anti-submarine warfare ship so this I think highly significant and I think the
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:28.120]  big thing that's that's hanging over all this is the tremendous hysterical Dr.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.520]  Goebbels style Western media blackout that this Russian fleet is there there
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:39.640]  are even other reports that they're unloading these S 300 advanced surface
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:44.160]  to air missiles the kind of thing that that Gaddafi wanted didn't get in time
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.160]  the kind that Iran has asked for and they still haven't gotten them at least
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.680]  in the numbers they wanted as far as we know anyway that these are now being
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:57.400]  delivered to Syria so this means that there's a whole new dimension of Russian
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.960]  support for Syria two weeks ago this past weekend we also had the visit of the
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.720]  Russian Orthodox patriarch Kirill Cyril so he's patriarch Cyril of the Russian
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.760]  Orthodox Church the top religious authority of the Russian Federation
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.720]  at least of the Christians and he came there to Damascus to meet with the
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:23.040]  Grand Mufti of Damascus who was a very interesting figure in his own right I
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.960]  recommend you if you look him up so the idea is that you've got a pattern and
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.520]  you've also got now a foreign minister Lavrov of Russia is saying we want you
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:37.520]  to stop with these ultimatums to Syria stop with this stuff he's responding to
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.600]  a French madman Elijah pay the foreign minister of France as it's time to cut
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:48.840]  humanitarian corridors into Syria and set up humanitarian that's a total repeat
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.520]  of the Libya and the humanitarian love bombs and but but you were there we
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.600]  haven't we were able to get a hold of you after you were first on there in the
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.200]  sniper areas and now it's coming out that indeed that is the Al Qaeda forces
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.600]  even the one in Telegraph admits Al Qaeda is now taking over all of Libya the
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.520]  military leader is a top Al Qaeda operative who openly says murder the
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:15.840]  Americans and all this that's a CIA cover we've also got them at least 600
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.200]  landing there and then secondarily now since you've been there I want to hear
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:24.800]  about what you saw there bravely in areas under sniper attack Webster you
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:28.840]  never like to toot your horn but you've been in the middle of it then I want to
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:34.280]  continue Russia threatens to block NATO routes that they're using since
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.320]  Pakistan's cut off their route into Afghanistan what's happening with that
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.480]  base being bombed by the way Hami Google is on tomorrow folks former head of
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.280]  Pakistani intelligence at the start of the show wanted to just confirm that's
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:52.000]  coming up also Webster we now have these issues explosions all over Iran
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.560]  blowing up a lot of their missile facilities killing their top commanders
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.000]  now the media especially admitting the West is running operations there the
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.080]  Iranians have hit the British Embassy I mean clearly things are escalating right
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.600]  now yes I think you could say the Anglo-American mad dog imperialists are
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.360]  running a muck they are in a manic hysterical war psychosis a flight
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:21.880]  forward it is this is now a new surge I guess we haven't seen anything quite at
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.400]  this level since about two webster the MF global is making 40 to one bets and
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.160]  and and there's now statements in the news where they said that's just the way
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:36.960]  it is insanely 40 to one bets that were guaranteed to fail losing 12 billion
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.160]  dollars in one day and just frothing around I mean the elite has gone totally
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.720]  insane yes and I think this is it's good that you bring this up because this is
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.400]  I think there's a certain causal chain in other words when you take a ruling
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.040]  elite like the Anglo-American fiance or oligarchy these are finance
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.240]  capitalists these are zombie bankers hedge fund hyenas and all the rest they
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.080]  go nuts they go bunkers when they're derivative structures and their debt
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.600]  structures their collateralized debt obligations and structured investment
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.960]  vehicles when those go into negative leverage and to reverse leverage and
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:16.840]  they start pyramiding astronomical unbelievable losses at the top of these
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:21.280]  pyramids that they create they go nuts and they say increase the rate of
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.480]  primitive accumulation of looting of sacking of pillaging of robbing
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.920]  exploiting the world but they then they're told well there are these
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.480]  governments that seem to get in the way there's the Syrian government that
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:39.200]  insists on selling bread for about 25 cents for a 2.2 pounds one kilo of
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.920]  pretty good bread I've had some for about a quarter and they say that's
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.200]  impossible we want that to cost 25 dollars for that kind of bread so we
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.640]  can send the money to Wall Street in the city of London so all of these
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.960]  governments are in the way and this has been this this has been the story of the
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.680]  whole Arab Spring and then in the middle of this look at that band of
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.080]  territory that goes from Lebanon Lebanon is now governed pretty much by an
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:10.560]  alliance of the Hezbollah pro-Iranian forces listen now let's hardly I want to
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.040]  get into all the geopolitical intricacies here but bottom line the
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.880]  elites are panicking they're all gonna go to jail unless they start World War
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.640]  3 and they're announcing they're gonna arrest citizens for no reason and put
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.320]  us in FEMA camps that's in the news and it's just a frothing they're like
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.120]  they're like flopping around at the at the cocktail party insane and but they're
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.880]  the boss so that's just the way it is I mean in the middle of all this you've
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.560]  got to pick the one point when you have when you have opposition forces as we
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.920]  do that are weak and disorganized and confused there's got to be a clear
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.720]  trumpet in other words what do you do under these circumstances what's the one
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.560]  point where activity where you know a political assault a political attack
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.400]  can actually have a name to have some some importance finance capital is the
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.680]  enemy Wall Street is the enemy the financiers the zombie bankers the
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.400]  hedge fund hyenas this is what's behind the whole they're the opposite of free
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.740]  market to they're just absolute crony capitalist insider crooks who then are
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:17.680]  always given more power for the messes they create yeah they what they they
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.920]  talk free market but what they actually carry on is the fascist corporate state
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:27.160]  on the on the Mussolini model and again this this the Syrian the Syrian case is
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.600]  highly interesting so bottom line you were there the sniper attacks all that
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.160]  stuff's coming out it's staged are they gonna have the nerve to start the love
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.000]  bombing the kinetic love and will all the trendies dance around and be happy
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.080]  look it did not depends on Russia I would say just about everything depends on
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:47.440]  Russia right now as as Gideon Wells the secretary of the Navy said in 1863 and
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.280]  1864 God bless the Russians thank God for Putin under these circumstances
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.640]  thanks thank God he's making a comeback because if we had made bedev with full
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.840]  power the bombing of Syria and the civil war in Syria would already be going on
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:06.280]  notice that one of the things that's changing is the US is leaving Iraq that
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.480]  is the large numbers of forces are are departing and what that what that conjures
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:16.920]  up then is a belt of territory that goes from Lebanon to Syria across the the
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.160]  Shiite parts of Iraq and into Iran that's basically going to be one
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:26.360]  continuous belt and they're they're opposed to the US and the British right
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.640]  they don't like the imperialists for whatever whatever reasons and there are
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.760]  many reasons and a lot of them are good reasons so the idea now is if the Iraq
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.320]  is falling away from US control and they you can see it right the Iraqis
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.200]  refused to vote the sanctions against Syria at the Arab League they joined
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.440]  with Lebanon Algeria and Iraq said no we will not take part in the economic
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.920]  warfare against Syria it means that that whole thing is meaningless yeah because
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.800]  they've already enjoyed decades of mass starvation and loving sanctions and love
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.320]  love bombs in everything so the idea now is they wanted the whole idea was to
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:08.760]  attack Syria so you'd isolate his ball out you you destroy the only ally that
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:14.440]  Iran had other than Iraq but now that doesn't it seems not to be working so
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.920]  I would just caution everybody right the Anglo-Americans are as mad as
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:23.440]  headers they're as mad as March here look at them they're all making 40 to 1
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.800]  crazy bets I mean I think they're gonna start World War 3 look how Cheney tried
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.200]  to start World War 3 with Russia on 888 with the Georgia but but Tarpley I'm
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.440]  gonna break and come back what about the Pakistan situation what's up with them
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:43.240]  blowing up military bases now well this is we've had this all year right and we
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.920]  had the US pressure of course the US threat is to seize the Pakistani nuclear
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:55.160]  forces to destroy them or to or to steal them and set the stage for Pakistan
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.280]  being broken up into four or five parts this is the long-standing scenario now
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.080]  Pakistan has been fighting back the first thing they got was that secret
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.880]  ultimatum from China about six months ago what China said to the US back off
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:13.840]  you bums we are going to treat any attack on on Pakistan as an attack on
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.800]  China just now we've had the the conference of the Shanghai Cooperation
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.200]  Organization and their Putin has come forward as the personal sponsor of
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.160]  Pakistan becoming a full member not just an observer but a full member of the
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  Shanghai Cooperation Organization now you'd think a double guarantee for
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.760]  Pakistan would be enough if China and Russia are both on record of supporting
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.960]  Pakistan that ought to be enough to make the Anglo-Americans back off but

[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:51.840]  Webster Webster what I see from this and Hamed Ghul agreed former head of
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.160]  Pakistani intelligence and others is it is a plan to break it the country in
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.240]  three to five parts three four five they have been caught the CIA trying to give
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.720]  radiation type systems to al-Qaeda operatives that work for him to blame
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.400]  it on the government right they're trying to break it all up and so it's
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.600]  clearly deliberate they keep blowing up military bases and then saying al-Qaeda
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:18.080]  trick them give me a break folks as a pretext so what is it cause revolution
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.280]  in the country that is now happening is this just old-fashioned destabilization
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:28.000]  again look at the ethnic breakdown you have to see that the ethnic origin of
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.280]  the troops who were killed and often these are there sometimes push tunes if
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:38.000]  they're part of these frontier militias and the general idea is that if the
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.200]  push tunes get killed on the Pakistani side they blame the Punjabis or the
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.800]  Sindhis for being part of the deal that allows the US to go on doing these
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.600]  things we've always got to remember the US is there because of the post 9-11
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.840]  ultimatum when Colin Powell and our dear friend Richard Armitage told the
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:02.440]  Pakistani government at that time President Musharraf they said if you
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.960]  don't let us run wild over your territory and your airspace and your
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.160]  transport we will bomb you back into the Stone Age that's how the US got there
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.680]  and instead they've been playing the double game of infiltrating taking over
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.280]  doing this and then now they're saying the Pentagon saying they're afraid the
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.080]  Pakistanis are going to launch terror attacks on America then the globalist
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.400]  stage attacks then they have a pretext to attack them it's just pure poking the
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.560]  dog trying to get the reaction right and I think there's also an element of
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:38.720]  desperation because the US is basically leaving Iraq or largely leaving Iraq
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:43.080]  there's always you know there's always a residue that they they keep behind the
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:48.040]  idea may be oh my god we've got to we've got to hit Pakistan hard and past and
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.680]  try to shatter the country because we may not be here you know in a year or
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:57.360]  two the other thing is who's doing this stuff remember the United States is not
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.800]  really run by Obama at this point as far as I can see there's this thing called
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:05.760]  the principles committee that's Hillary Clinton Leon Panetta that's the holder
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:09.360]  the Attorney General we know his his multiple crimes there's this guy
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.280]  Donald on of the National Security Council and our dear friend general
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.760]  Petraeus and when I look at that attack on Pakistan I say that has Petraeus
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:23.000]  written all over it that's his signature style right sneaky you know
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.760]  betrayal stab in the back attack your ally and then put on a hypocritical
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:31.720]  show and so forth and if I stay there I want to talk about where this goes in
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:35.240]  the final five with you and then mention Europe here's the headlines Europe on
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:49.240]  the brink eurozone looks IMF for rescue oh yes you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[01:59:52.080 --> 02:00:00.600]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.560]  Alex Jones
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:30.800]  okay your calls coming up also there's incredible demonizations of the tea party
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:38.880]  going on right now New York Times has linked it to the try to tie to the KKK
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.000]  cities are auditing the it's just incredible a Colin Powell came out and
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.640]  demonized it and so I'm gonna cover tonight and said the media needs to work
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.360]  basically with the government to lying to the American people
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:57.200]  it's incredible finishing up with a Webster Griffin Tarpley historian and
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.600]  also economist briefly because we really want to hear what you have to say
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:07.240]  about Europe where do you see this going because I mean I'm really starting to
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:13.080]  get concerned the elites are are insane they are megalomaniacal they have a plan
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:17.880]  but the it is sheer madness and they're going to run into countries that aren't
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.240]  going to put up with it yeah well that's what we're seeing with the Russian case
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:25.120]  right today president Mededa doing something that he didn't want to do but
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.420]  Putin is making him do it has opened up you know inaugurated this rather
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:36.680]  impressive-looking phased array anti-missile radar at the western edge of
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:42.240]  the Russian Federation and looking into Europe and they've got some short range
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.560]  missiles set up so they're saying you want to put your ABM anti ballistic
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.160]  missile systems in Poland and Czechoslovakia and Romania and these
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:56.000]  places fine we'll put missiles there so we can blow them up in the first you
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.120]  know two or three minutes so this is actually very big stuff but the part in
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:05.360]  Europe of course is you know it astronomically bigger than even things in
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.120]  the Middle East because in Europe you've got nuclear NATO and nuclear Russia and
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.040]  if these clash then that's that's World War three by anybody's definition so
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:19.840]  Russian resistance is stiffening they the Russians of course started late it was
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.080]  a tragic mistake not to veto the Libyan resolution that's that's Putin
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:31.200]  Putin is trying to pick up the pieces after Mededa made this mess but that is
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.840]  happening and on the European side the problem with the Europeans is they
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.600]  needed to strike against these agencies right we're now hearing that France is
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:46.880]  about to be downgraded like Belgium has been downgraded Portugal downgraded all
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.800]  of these agencies right? Yeah as if the agency can downgrade a nation state when
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.680]  it's the banksters that have maneuvered the nation state into this position now
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.360]  they're saying we say you're in debt servitude and the government say okay I
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.080]  mean this is pathetic yeah that's the danger of a weak state if you had a strong state
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.540]  the strong state would say guess what ratings agencies you're invited you're
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.880]  in jail we're shutting you down you're the tentacle of a foreign intelligence
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.640]  service you're in the orbit of the US intelligence community because of course
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.840]  they are and we're going to be investigating you that's what General
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:25.640]  DeGaul would have done like he would have had a tank parked outside the ratings
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.440]  agency very very quickly and that would have been the end of them the other thing
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.840]  of course is if you're under attack through credit default swaps and that's
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.360]  what's happening to Italy for example ban credit default swaps don't let the
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:43.320]  speculators use this engine right the credit default swap is a way to increase
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.840]  the striking power and the destructive power of whatever speculative money you
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.960]  deciding to throw at a country so this is a it's an orchestrated it could it's a
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.360]  conspiracy what other word for no no they're collapsing it finally into the
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:58.680]  IMF and World Bank and their private holders but one one one comment though
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.640]  tartly and I respect your view and your intellect you keep saying America
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:07.840]  Anglo-american establishment we ourselves are kept slaves of the six big
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:12.680]  megabanks so when you keep saying America America America America America is
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:18.600]  just another one of their holdings we're just a giant engine or a coal box they
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:24.000]  used to fund their system but I tried to point out we're talking about finance
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.640]  capital right we're talking about world street and the city of London and we're
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:32.600]  talking about their respective plantations now if you don't want to be on
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:37.160]  their plantation then then you have to struggle right you have to do something
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.920]  to get out of that I'm quite frankly a mass movement right you've got it you've
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.000]  got a bottom line they're losing control so they're probably might start World
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.560]  War three right but the point is we need we need to we got some momentum with
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.040]  this occupied world street I think that had some positive features that's gonna
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:55.360]  now we'll have to have you back up Webster glad you got back saying phone
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:05:00.120]  calls tons of news straight ahead stay with us
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:05.560]  hi this is Alex Jones this holiday season more than half of our nation is

[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:48.160]  day about this instead I'm just well yeah they're trying to have indefinite
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.200]  detention secret arrest secret torture secret execution because this ties in to
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:57.520]  the enemy combatant act and all that the military commission stuff and then I've
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.920]  been to the drills I see it in the news but the military now running real
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:07.160]  checkpoints totally illegal and look the mega banks that have captured America
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.560]  if you take away one thing from this broadcast is this if you study history
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:15.440]  corrupt elites always use the military to take over the country and rob the
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:22.560]  general public that's the nature of it it's a it's a weapon the corrupt always
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.600]  one it's like to use the law of the rings analogy it's the it's the ring of Mordor
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.320]  and there's always somebody that wants to get it and put it on and government
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:37.520]  can provide that that tyranny that appetite of total domination and the
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.240]  giant criminal group that brings the corrupt oligarchy to power they always
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:47.040]  want more more and more and they don't like competition operating it's about
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:59.760]  total avarice filled domination and they have been preparing and pushing forever
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.840]  to bring the military on the streets of America and to get rid of the Bill of
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.760]  Rights and Constitution and now they're almost done and they're going to stage
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:16.120]  terror attacks new Oklahoma cities and blame it on this radio show on Ron Paul
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:21.520]  and on our movement for Liberty they've done it before they're gearing up you
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.440]  seen the memos telling Obama how great it would be with his advisors how only
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:29.320]  a new Oklahoma city to blame his detractors will save him and it won't
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:37.120]  be to save Obama it'll be to save this agenda they don't fight fair and even
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.720]  if there was a real terror attack which it is always staged when it's this type
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:46.320]  of event or provocateur how does taking your rights fix everything why if it's
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:49.900]  statistically one of the least dangerous things out there being killed by
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:53.600]  terrorists why have you been taught to get all upset and freak out and have a
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.680]  fetish of the fear and how did land the free home of the brave become a bunch of
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:04.040]  people in fetal positions literally getting off on the fear one time I was
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:08.040]  flying with somebody used to work here years ago and they would open the window
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:13.720]  with a plane and get all scared go oh and I would say literally I would say
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:19.560]  stop it and close the window and then he turned he said I think I kind of like
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:24.560]  it getting scared and and and that's what it is
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:31.880]  deals to say I didn't fly with that person again but I mean I'm talking
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:37.360]  about digging into the sequel and I'm like you didn't tell me this and then
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:43.040]  everything's okay you're 30,000 feet looking out the window actually making
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:48.080]  that noise and I said I looked in their eyes I said you're getting off on this
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:57.480]  I guess I am oh my gosh

[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:42.520]  find the call system Steve in Florida you wanted to or was it Steve or who was
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:47.200]  you wanted to make a point about medical journey go ahead yeah yeah and you I'm
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:51.760]  by any of your listeners that just type in Rockefeller Foundation medical
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:56.200]  schools and you'll see right about the time Federal Reserve started all the
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:02.000]  mega million dollars in grants that they paid they gave to them ailing medical
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.840]  schools but I was only under one condition is that they would have to
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:11.360]  follow what they say and I was really a transfer of their petrochemical business
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.880]  to Rockefeller family into the pharmaceutical one and the whole motto
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:21.280]  was disease maintenance and disease expansion and when you look at it I
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:26.960]  think it's demonically brilliant because they've made everybody sick well they

[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.640]  to Ryan and others go ahead Aaron welcome hey what's up Alex hey brother hey
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:39.760]  what's going on we're just talking about our little goblin leaders yeah I know
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.760]  I was gonna say I love your description well unfortunately that's about what it
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:49.560]  is a lot about a six inch goblin who can hardly walk that we all bow down to
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:53.880]  and we're about 10,000 feet tall and can move mountains but we don't we just
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:25:00.880]  grovel and bow down to the goblin as he's got us under a spell yeah um but I
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:05.480]  guess I'll just talk to listeners out there I actually want to share a dream
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:11.240]  I think that people could actually make greenhouses on flat trailers just to
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.520]  have wheels on them you could you just put a little greenhouse and it could
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:18.320]  really keep us kind of mobile and have them in our backyards and stuff and what
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:23.920]  would you grow in that greenhouse oh well if anyone was elected there's way
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:27.040]  more profitable things to do that you sound like you're in a really good mood
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:36.320]  today did you just have a big bong yet I think that's a point that I think that
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.760]  we should be growing our own vegetables everyone should be let's say if you're
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:45.640]  gonna go and have a burger with ketchup and mustard get the organic ketchup get
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:50.200]  the good beef and do the best you can and by the way that's an example of how
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.680]  we can demand things go in the right direction voting with our dollars
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:26:00.600]  hunt's ketchup now says organic and and non high fructose corn syrup sugar just
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.880]  demanding it and I guarantee you Heinz will be next and it's little things like
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.440]  that very interesting anything else Erin because I want to let you get back to
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:15.760]  that bong thank you just stay healthy that's what I the best advice because we
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:20.320]  know so much and I think I was thinking this while I was on hold that every
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:23.760]  Patriot the first year is gonna be hundred people the second year is gonna
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.600]  be thousand people and ten thousand that's what Alex Jones has like ten
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:30.960]  million people listening to him right now well I've got probably got three
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:34.560]  million overall the whole show every day but it's around 15 million a week total
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:39.240]  every different platform and a large portion of those are one-timers that
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:42.720]  come through only once or twice and hear the information so we're reaching a
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:45.880]  lot of new people that's super important as well God bless you I appreciate the
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:52.280]  call Aaron watch out for the ganja okay let's go ahead now and talk to Ryan in
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.680]  Canada you're on the air go ahead hi Alex yeah I've been trying to get a hold
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.120]  of you for a while I just wanted to address this whole Occupy movement and
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:07.440]  how it's associated with the United Nations and more specifically how it's
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:10.960]  using a guide from the Tavistock Institute filtered through the
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:16.480]  consensus building Institute and basically it says in this guide that they
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:22.360]  have the authors or the Commission for group dynamics and assemblies but I can't
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:27.000]  find out who these people are yeah and they persecute them to make people feel
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.040]  sorry for them at one level the dialectic while setting the precedent to
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:34.480]  attack people again they announced for people to come out against corrupt
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.840]  elements of Wall Street good people show up then they come in and say there is no
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.800]  leader to make sure no patriots get in there then they slowly take them over to
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.200]  where now they're calling for open borders world government gun control
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:51.120]  communism socialism George Soros is our supreme ruler all of this garbage to
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:57.320]  control the opposition and yes it's all Delphi UN brainwashing technique and I'm
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:02.280]  not saying the Occupy itself is bad but that's the layer over it trying to
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.760]  control us and then people are like you're criticizing Occupy it's not one
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:11.760]  monolith it's like the Tea Party Ron Paul starts it Republicans try to take it
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.520]  over so you're talking about two tea parties the Patriot Tea Party and the
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:19.960]  Rhino-Newt-Generic type tea party you see it's the same thing with this the
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:27.400]  establishment is trying to control opposition well that sounds exactly what
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:32.200]  I've uncovered with my research I mean it doesn't matter what aspect that you go
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:36.480]  digging into in this the deeper that you dig the more you keep on finding out
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.080]  that there's you and involvement and that these people basically want to get
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:46.000]  down on their knees and invite this New World Order system in that's what it's
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.160]  all about no they're the children of spoiled yuppies of the spoiled baby
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:55.200]  boomers and they literally think the New World Order is going to roll over like a
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.960]  fat sow and and offer a milky up to them they're going to come over and just
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.280]  suckle like fat little piglets all day long with the New World Order says they
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:08.120]  openly want to cyanide their butt so there here's the be you know they drop
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:12.000]  down the big milk device the mammary glam and the little little trendies run
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:19.720]  up and then fall over dead basically well I just find it a little convenient
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.280]  that they have these 10 cities all set up and it's you know right about the
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:27.440]  same time when the EU is about like basically on the verge of collapse and
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:31.640]  we could see them collapse within a couple of weeks and so they have their
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.840]  10 cities all set up ready to serve forced and it you know it seems like
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:39.520]  you know they're creating a home for these people that's gonna end up being
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:44.320]  rife with disease and then they've got to move them to the female center for
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:48.440]  their health exactly we told you this years ago how they would play it out

[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:01.640]  Doc and the Washington Post came out today and actually said oh looks like
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:05.280]  somebody in the West is blowing up these missile bases and killing their top
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:11.200]  missile general and I've known I don't know what is it for five six years Bush
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:14.280]  admitted they've got grips in their sabotaging things I'm no fan of the
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.920]  moolas and the general thing and Iran my issue is it is a major provocation I
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:22.720]  mean imagine if Iran was here blowing stuff up and it's kind of like well
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.200]  Iran you're still evil because we're blowing stuff up Israel the US and
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:32.480]  England reportedly are all over there and you're still bad we blew you up and
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:36.320]  you're standing down and taking it that's Al Qaeda and the media calls them
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:40.680]  Al Qaeda when we all know they're Shiite and all of this is only going to dig the
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:45.720]  moolas in more all the sociologists and political scientists have said and and
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:50.840]  so clearly Dr. Corsi they're moving forward with this show I mean what's
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.200]  your view on this and I know you have a lot of sources I have some of the same
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.920]  sources off record but a lot of this is very transparent that the other things
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:02.400]  aren't just blowing up on their own their Easter bunnies aren't laying
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:09.040]  explosive bombs what's happening here and and how big of an issue is this well
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.720]  I think Alex it's an extremely big issue we're right on the verge of a major
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.880]  war in the Middle East with most likely Israel and Iran and I've seen the
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:23.680]  satellite pictures of this military base that was blown up just a few days ago
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:29.720]  outside of Tehran and it was leveled I mean this was clearly some kind of a
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:35.760]  major strike that took out that base killed 17 Revolutionary Guard atop
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.960]  Iranian missiles scientists nuclear scientists of the the provocations
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:47.480]  within Iran for you know blowing up and also major explosions yesterday and is
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:53.080]  istfan which is one of the refinement processes for uranium one of the sites
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:58.720]  where Iran refines uranium clearly the the initial main suspect is going to be
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:04.840]  Mossad and the Israeli agents it's not unlikely that Israel is going to do
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:08.680]  everything they can to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and the time
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:15.160]  is winding down very quickly Iran is positioned right now to fill the vacuum
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:20.040]  that the United States is leaving especially in Iraq Iran is going to be
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:24.000]  the major dominant power within the Middle East in a very short time and
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  that also frightens the Saudis who were Sunnis so you've got a powder keg here
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.680]  that's already beginning to ignite and internal provocations blowing up
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.480]  facilities within Iran is certainly going to heighten the tension as we see
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:45.960]  again today with the takeover of by so-called students which are really
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:51.720]  various militias and activists in Iran taking over the British Embassy much as
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:58.600]  like in 79 the US Embassy was taken over it's beginning this is the beginning
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:04.240]  of what's going to be a major regional war and I don't think it's reversible
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:08.040]  this point I've been writing about this is 2005 warning people it was going to
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:14.200]  happen we're in the very first stages this is like Alex 1914 and seeing the
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:19.480]  initial provocations and incidents that led to a world war we're headed down that
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.360]  same path now Dr. Corsi obviously you've got a lot of sources a lot of this is
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:31.000]  open intelligence clearly the media has been gearing up I don't buy that story
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  about the car salesman who's going to kill the Saudi ambassador and all that
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.880]  clearly a provocation a lot of experts across the political spectrum including
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:46.480]  George W. Bush's top expert on the Persians came out and said it was phony
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:51.040]  but but but clearly they're trying to go in that direction what intel do you have
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:55.000]  on the time frame and what type of chain reaction that this is going to
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:01.800]  basically lead to and of course I'm getting at Iran really stupidly I mean
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.800]  I know it they can only take so much depending on which you view you take
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:10.120]  regardless they have taken quite a bit of course they deserve it because it's
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:17.080]  peace bombs and everything but but Iran has come out being sarcastic Iran has
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:21.080]  come out and said their intelligence said that they'll take the war to the
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:27.000]  American and Israeli streets and that's exactly what the West wants they'll
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.400]  they're gonna love using the TSA on the streets and the army on the streets and
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:34.720]  they've got this bill to arrest citizens and throw you in the slammer for life
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.360]  with no trial I mean clearly Iran is playing right into the banksters hands
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.040]  right as the banks implode right as the Bank of the World is announced I mean I
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:49.000]  can really see this coming together one and the major provocation right now in
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:55.080]  Iran is not necessarily blowing things up it's actually the pressures that are
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:01.000]  being put on the Iranian central bank again by Great Britain and the Obama
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.080]  administration finally engaging with Iran but these pressures are going to be
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:11.160]  very difficult for Iran to survive economically and when you threaten Iran
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.080]  economically you're gonna get a backlash I think from Israel's point of view
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:20.600]  Israel's gonna wait till the last possible minute before they strike but
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:24.920]  that could happen anytime and the Netanyahu government's been much more
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:30.360]  active I mean my sources in Israel are saying that there's a major push for a
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:36.080]  strike on Iran any day we can wake up any day and the strike could occur when it
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:41.120]  occurs it can also be a provocation that occurs somewhere else an incident in
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.120]  the Gaza an incident with Lebanon any kind of disturbance including within
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:52.960]  Syria where Israel finally feels that the balance is so swung against Israel
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:58.440]  that the pressure from Iran to develop a nuclear weapon is so intense that Israel
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:03.720]  has no choice but to strike now Israel does not want to do it but I think of the
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.840]  final analysis it's coming I've said for years but trying to prevent this war
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.920]  from happening but again the steps that could have been taken all along have
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:17.680]  been missed we engage in negotiations with Iran going back to Condoleezza
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.080]  Rice in 2005 in the Bush administration that was a waste of time
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:28.480]  what about this announcement that al-Qaeda is firing Qutusha rockets into
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:33.520]  the country that's again I mean you've got provocations from al-Qaeda you've
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:38.720]  got provocations from Hamas firing rockets at any day into Israel this
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:42.800]  entire situation Alex is a tinderbox you've got what you know the Arab
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:47.920]  Spring which was touted as this great democracy movement it's really a major
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:53.120]  movement on the bridge on the Muslim mob mob facing Muslim mafia the Muslim
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.840]  Brotherhood which has been anti-Israel been you know directly opposed to the
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:03.040]  interests of Israel and determined to radicalize imposed sharia law in the
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:07.880]  countries across North Africa but doc it's more than than the Muslim
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.440]  Brotherhood Syria law I mean I've got the London telegraph you name it today
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:15.400]  admitting that al-Qaeda has taken over most the cities they're flying the flags
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:21.840]  the military leader in Tripoli is a top real al-Qaeda guy was fighting US forces
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:26.640]  and coalition forces in Iraq we now have reports that 600 al-Qaeda have been
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.840]  sent in to fight Syria it's not just like the government didn't know and
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:35.280]  messed up oopsie here comes al-Qaeda al-Qaeda was used against the Serbs the
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:40.280]  Russians it's like the Swiss army knife that they use so so how can we all give
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.160]  up our rights because al-Qaeda is gonna get us all the underwear bombers gotten
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.440]  on the plane by the government al-Qaeda is being put in power everywhere I mean
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:51.800]  come on doc I mean what's really going on with this al-Qaeda you've got the
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.840]  situation that's what I'm saying Alex is you've got al-Qaeda operating almost as
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:00.960]  the military arm of the Muslim Brotherhood that's what's going on and in
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:03.840]  these countries that's going to be radicalized it's not going to be
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:07.600]  democracy in Egypt it's going to be a government whichever government takes
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:11.680]  over there's going to be much more favorable to letting al-Qaeda operate
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:15.960]  al-Qaeda is going to ramp up the violence the violence is going to be directed to
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:20.080]  Israel if you're stuck out if you're sitting in Tehran there's never been a
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:25.240]  more favorable moment to try a war with Israel the United States has tripled
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:30.000]  economically the EU is going down the tubes fast why would NATO and our
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.320]  government then put al-Qaeda in this position well it's all been the whole
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:40.320]  structure of this and you said it in the previous segment the prelude for more
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.800]  globalism this is again in the EU crisis you're seeing it the solution the EU is
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:52.560]  offering is to have fiscal unity fiscal EU taking over the economies of each of
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:56.920]  the individual nations the globalists are seeing this is the the final great
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:02.480]  push for globalism it's going to come in the collapse of the EU the collapse of
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:06.960]  the United States economically they this there's no way the euro is going to be
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:13.920]  saved unless globalism ramps up and the EU becomes a fiscal union and the
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:18.560]  bankers essentially take over both in the United States and in Europe look at
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:23.000]  how many of these European leaders these technocrats have ties back to
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.160]  Goldman Sachs and all the other major investment brokers at the same time
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:31.720]  Obama's wage in kind of a populist war against Wall Street which he doesn't
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:35.640]  believe for a minute that's of course it's controlled opposition and it
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:41.240]  demonizes general Wall Street not the zombie banks as the problem but but
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:45.080]  but doc looking at this that's also the script he's been given to go out and
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:49.640]  try to divert attention I mean Obama's as much of a globalist as any of us and
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:54.320]  Obama's advancing the globalism goal alright so I concur with you so
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.160]  basically they're putting al-Qaeda in charge in all these countries and using
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:02.440]  them as a secret army because it shows destabilization and that's what they
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:06.880]  want it's very simple order out of chaos exactly this we're going to have a
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.360]  major breakup in the Middle East a major war I think it's going to be I don't see
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.920]  any way at stock and devolved into a war at the same time you've got a major
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:21.520]  breakup in the EU where the the euro is virtually on the brink and the United
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:26.600]  States is bankrupt and these are not happening by accident this is the final
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:33.400]  push for the globalist out of this chaos to tell people the only way you're
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:38.320]  going to be safe is if you give us the power us bankers the power to run the
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:42.520]  world at the same time you got Congress over here with John McCain with new
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:46.480]  measures to say Americans can be picked up off the streets and charged with
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:52.000]  terrorists and put away without any trial you've got the New York Times or the
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.080]  Washington Post who are running a political agenda and refusing to report
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:00.440]  any of this you know the Arab Spring is touted as this great democracy movement
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.480]  has nothing to do with democracy has with a radicalization of the Middle East
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.840]  in advance of a major war the globalists intend to use the chaos in order to gain
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:14.520]  more power exactly very very well said and that is exactly what's going on here
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:20.720]  now I understand that you're pro-Israel I look at this completely neutral and
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:26.160]  cold right I understand that okay okay but but at the same time the West did
[02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:31.600]  overthrow Mosaddek who was pro-West he just wanted to build up Iran and kind of
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:36.920]  the British model didn't didn't want to industrialize its vassal states okay and
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:42.240]  then and then you have all the Shaw and the Savak and the torture I mean this
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:46.080]  country the people running this country and and running England before Israel
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:51.160]  even existed or when it was barely you know crawling have done wrong to the
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:55.640]  Iranian people then you've got all the weird CIA stuff helping get the Mullahs
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.520]  in and Iran Contra I mean you talk about a mess of spaghetti I can study
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.600]  cloak and dagger and I have trouble understanding it from from your
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:08.200]  understanding what's really going on in Iran and won't this just dig in the
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.280]  hardliners and isn't this just about Netanyahu who says this will make him
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:16.520]  like Churchill isn't this will be good for the Mullahs to be attacked it'll be
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.960]  good for Netanyahu to attack making look strong it'll be a nice diversion for
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:26.120]  Obama I mean I just I just see this is evil I mean I mean how come Pakistan
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:29.760]  could have nukes but I I mean I'm not saying Iran is even going to have them
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:35.720]  this is crazy I think you hit on a key point though Alex the the other secret
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:40.160]  history of the intelligence history of the Middle East if not the world since
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:45.200]  the end of World War two is probably the most important real history going on I
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:50.880]  mean you've not only had intelligence involvement back to Mosadak in 1953 you
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.240]  had intelligence involvement all through the history of the Middle East going
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:48:00.600]  back really to the creation of the agencies to the OSS back in you know
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:04.800]  the United States in 19 during the war during World War two this is all a
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:09.800]  structure of intelligence that is also working hand-in-hand with the bankers
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:16.360]  on a global world order if you think the KGB and the CIA are two separate
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.040]  organizations you're wrong these are two organizations that have worked hand-in-hand
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:26.960]  for decades we've got a president whose life history reads like a intelligence
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:33.360]  disinformation campaign to hide who he really is a missing year where no one
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:37.960]  can figure out where Barack Obama was in Columbia that he's not there when he
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:42.040]  was supposed to be there a trip to Pakistan that no one's ever explained a
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:47.320]  fake legend history about him all of it so so so how is it going for the
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:52.160]  globalist and their plan to destroy the free market and and transfer us back to
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:55.800]  feudalism well I think Alex we're right good we're about to find out I mean if
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:00.000]  we if you in the next six months I think are going to be written in the
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:04.680]  streets around the world you're gonna have protests going on in Greece and
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:08.560]  protests going on in Italy and protests in the United States the Occupy
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:14.360]  movement is just the beginning of the you know the anarchist chaos it's the
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:18.200]  it's an attempt to co-op legitimate movements against the zombie banks and
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:22.480]  make it a general anti-capitalist movement let me ask you this question you
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:26.160]  rightly say because that is the plan to implode Europe then implode the US then
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:29.680]  call for this global receivership arm and then the countries waive their
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:34.800]  sovereignty this is all admitted now they're gonna have trouble executing
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.920]  this because we've been here for decades warning people well and in fact what's
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:44.760]  going on to Alex is a greater attempt to marginalize on senior a staff reporter
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:49.360]  for WorldNet daily we're continuing to to write about this all the time but
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:54.000]  again the marginalization you take a look at the extent to which you know the
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:58.920]  New York Times the Washington Post even the major networks including Fox moving
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:03.560]  more to the left there's an attempt to block out anybody who's going to
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:07.960]  criticize globalism anybody's gonna say the bankers are behind this and again
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:11.840]  that point I don't miss the banking connection the riots in the streets today
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:16.520]  in Tehran over the over the embassy being taken over Great Britain is about
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:20.440]  banking it's about the fact that the central banks are trying to put
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:25.880]  discipline on Iran central bank and Iran realizes that's gonna cause depression
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:28.720]  in Iran we're going to break her in a minute but I mean look at it today
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:35.600]  New York Times Lichens Tea Party to KKK City Audits Tea Party I mean they're
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:39.200]  coming out to the Tea Party because even though it's got rhinos trying to
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:44.800]  control it it is what the globalist fear and and and so meanwhile they've got
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:49.120]  Occupy Wall Street that's their attempt to try to control and steer the debate
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.800]  towards robbing the state robbing middle class instead of getting us out of
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:57.240]  globalism that is this bondage not of course he's our guest he writes for

[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:13.800]  get to you finishing up with Dr. Corsi regardless of which side you're on I
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:18.520]  realize this is a lot bigger than Israel I ran the United States England it is
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:23.880]  these mega banks who openly finance the fake green movement the carbon taxes
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:29.240]  the world government Newt Gennrich all of it they don't like a true free
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.600]  society and there are enemies and all of these governments love wars because it
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:39.440]  becomes a political distraction and I agree with Dr. Corsi you're about to I
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:44.160]  mean the world is reaching the quickening point economically all of it
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:47.760]  they can't deny the depression any of it doc we'll have to have you back up for
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:52.040]  full hour in the near future if you can do it to really flesh all this out but
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:55.680]  you've got the bombing of the bases in Pakistan you've got all this other
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:55:02.480]  weirdness going on how do you see this playing out you got cut off by the
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:07.960]  break he were bringing up a lot of issues I mean the fact that they admit
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:11.560]  that this bill allows the secret arrest of citizens but they say oh well
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:15.920]  citizens are exempt but we can then take that away if we want and held for life
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:21.680]  in prison without trial I mean it's like waking up in a dystopic movie or
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:26.760]  something well I think Alex the point I want to get across is that the next six
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:32.040]  months you're gonna see the EU you're gonna see the United States be violence
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:36.280]  in the streets this is gonna go back to the streets and they and the intent is
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:40.920]  to push it into the streets chaos because when chaos occurs while I'm while
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.640]  a war I think also breaks out in the Middle East simultaneously so you got
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:50.200]  financial collapse got people who are threatened not gonna get their pension
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:53.880]  checks not gonna get their Medicare checks not gonna get whatever from the
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:58.600]  government you've got chaos breaking out in the United States the EU will collapse
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:03.960]  and out of this chaos is exactly the formula I think the globalists intend to
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:09.720]  gain more power because it will produce fear well people feel fear when they're
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:13.980]  watching on the television state said every night riots uncontrolled violence
[02:56:13.980 --> 02:56:18.600]  people are gonna be willing to give up more rights to government control we now
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:23.280]  move the bankers into the position take a look at who the new heads of state are
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:28.360]  in Europe these technocrats they're moving the bankers into positions of
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:34.520]  politicians running these countries in preparation of a banker takeover of the
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:39.320]  European Union that's the that's what's gonna emerge from the chaos because the
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:44.120]  the globalists have not given up their dream of a one-world government it'll
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:48.520]  take chaos to create what they want in terms of a one-world government and
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:52.840]  we're going through that chaos first stages right now you are 100% right
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:56.880]  that is the plan we're now here the real birth of world government where they
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:00.240]  just go yeah it's authoritarian yeah the bankers took over Europe through fraud
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:05.680]  so what the economist says they know best incredible stuff happening here how
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:10.040]  do we stop them I mean I think we've already done it for decades we've known
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:14.360]  what's going on we've exposed the program and I think that they're gonna
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.840]  have trouble they may try to get it in place but there's no way even an
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:25.120]  authoritarian secret arrest system is going to be able to enforce this it's
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:29.400]  I think we're gonna get to a point where the United States has is closer to
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:33.240]  breaking up than it's ever been you know that I think we're at a point of
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:37.960]  going back to the 10th Amendment there's some states some places in the
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:42.120]  country they're just gonna say no don't want to participate in this anymore the
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:46.160]  only way to deal with it is going to be to opt out of it to say we're finished
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:50.160]  with it you know United States of America go your own way we're ex we're
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:55.440]  Texas we're whatever state we're going our way because it's gonna have to be a
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:00.720]  situation of fighting against the globalist by not allowing power to
[02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:06.000]  aggregate exactly governments and in banks but getting back to individual
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:10.200]  control of our lives well said I mean it's like this the Russian people aren't
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:15.240]  bad the German people aren't bad they got evil governments and America has been
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:20.960]  hijacked by these finance oligarchs and who don't read the Constitution and
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:26.200]  don't care about the Constitution yeah and and and who hate it and folks you're
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:30.320]  gonna have to recognize this of America has any hope dr. Jerome Corsi of

[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:39.920]  today hi Alex thanks for taking the time to have me on I was listening to you
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:43.760]  and Dr. Corsi and a gentleman that called yesterday who was speaking about
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:49.080]  how his children were taken through the family courts and CPS because his wife
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:53.200]  had brain cancer I believe or a brain tumor I think it was one of the older
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:58.080]  daughters I got confused but yes but what you were just saying with Mr.
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:03.640]  Corsi about how you would think that the government and the people wouldn't take
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:08.240]  the steps that are happening right now because you're aware of it it seems to
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:13.520]  me my experiences these people don't they really don't even care anymore I've
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.520]  been I've been inside the family court system for close to 12 years now you
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:23.360]  know people have asked me to sit in their cases and I see where they just
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:29.040]  lately they couldn't care less what the law is oh they lie they'll take kids and
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:32.480]  they'll use I've seen it in cases because I used to have the will to go to
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:36.560]  these things it's very painful I had to stop because it's very painful to watch
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:41.240]  them feeding on the pain of the families they'll take a three-year-old case of
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:45.440]  another family and with all the fake charges and just sign a new cover sheet
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.360]  with a new name on it and give that to a judge and take your kids and the judge
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:52.480]  sits there and laughs and doesn't care because they're usually a big fat
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:56.360]  child rapist I mean literally our government's just full of just just the
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:02.480]  most murderous villainous child raping filth literal just I don't have words
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:07.560]  to describe the level of evil look at ESPN they knew about this stuff for a
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:11.880]  decade did nothing you know the the the the wife of the coaches recorded
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:16.560]  clandestinely they confirm it about raping children and and they don't
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:22.920]  even care I mean it's just a nation of demons you know this thing is you know
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:27.680]  like when I tried to point out and when I tried to make other people aware what
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:32.400]  was happening not only in my situation but with other people everyone thinks
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:36.720]  that it doesn't apply to them they say well this has no bearing on me you know
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.880]  their selfish scum that's the beginning of true evil is not having empathy and
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:46.280]  so they think oh that guy's dead in the Walmart I got some stuff I want to buy
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:51.000]  I'm not gonna tell anybody he's dead or having a heart attack I'm so trendy they
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.560]  think it's a virtue to be into themselves only and and and so they
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:57.720]  exactly they don't know what's gonna happen to them and then they squeal and
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:04.480]  beg when it happens to them and nobody helps them and Alex the thing is it is
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:08.560]  happening to everyone right now in America they don't even realize it
