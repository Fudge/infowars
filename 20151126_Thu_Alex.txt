[00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.491]  Yeah.
[00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:06.383]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:08.164]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:09.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.505]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.025]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:17.227]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:26.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.011]  Look, I know that we're going into a planned worldwide tyranny in a new dark age.
[00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:40.501]  ...destroying true libertarian liberal ideas, packaged under the modern pseudo-liberalism.
[00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:58.549]  But when I sit here and read headlines like this out of Rasmussen.com, Rasmussen Reports, one of the biggest polling agencies in the world, and it's not us warning of this a decade ago, it's not the academics and governments calling for it in newspapers, it's serious polls.
[00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:08.953]  With a large percentage of people wanting to arrest anyone that disagrees with man-made climate change.
[00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:11.975]  First it was freezing, then it was warming, now it's changed.
[00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.395]  And this is just today's stack.
[00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:18.597]  I have a huge stack here of what they call political correctness.
[00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:22.018]  It's not political correctness, it is totalitarianism.
[00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:24.339]  It is Mao Zedong.
[00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:26.140]  It's Adolf Hitler.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.960]  It's happening.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.220]  Again.
[00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:41.539]  It's only 20-something percent that, in this poll, want to arrest everybody.
[00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.280]  But that's still a whacked-out group of scum, with their bizarre moral authority.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.242]  And you see it going on in these universities, where somebody drove by in a truck two months ago, and I think I heard something racist.
[00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:56.022]  And there was a Thomas Jefferson statue!
[00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:57.403]  Get rid of everybody in the school!
[00:01:57.403 --> 00:01:58.283]  Lock everything down!
[00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:01.848]  And now it's happening all over the country.
[00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:07.332]  They're routing particularly black conservative professors.
[00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:17.098]  And it is just a mindless power grab by the feminist commanding the young throngs of tip-on-the-shoulder youth.
[00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:18.319]  We've done an analysis of it.
[00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.460]  All Ford Foundation Soros manipulated.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.843]  And it's just pathetic to see.
[00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.711]  These people will not get jobs anywhere.
[00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:31.553]  I don't care if it's a young white woman, a young white guy, black woman, whatever.
[00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:33.334]  I'm looking at these people.
[00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:34.714]  They're not getting educations.
[00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:38.256]  They're not learning how to make connections and get jobs.
[00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.797]  Just so much of business is just interpersonal skill.
[00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:46.760]  Even Bloomberg had an article on that a month ago, or three and a half weeks ago.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.761]  These people are completely whacked out.
[00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.266]  They are psychologically destroyed.
[00:02:51.266 --> 00:03:03.391]  They've had their normal social skills basically degraded or removed to seeing phantoms.
[00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.752]  In fact, I saw a political cartoon.
[00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.733]  It may still be on Infowars.com.
[00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:11.515]  We'll put the political cartoons down on the lower left-hand side.
[00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:16.017]  And it shows a psychiatrist holding up the inkblot test.
[00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:20.878]  And saying, what do you see?
[00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:24.220]  And I see racism, I see homophobia, I see this, I see that.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.703]  No matter what the blobs on the page look like, that's what they see.
[00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:34.224]  And that's what it is.
[00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:36.245]  And that's the plan.
[00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:40.007]  This is how you put a virus in a computer to fry people's brains.
[00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:47.616]  Little support for pushing, little support for punishing global warming foes.
[00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:53.278]  Global warming advocates are calling for the prosecution of groups who disagree with them.
[00:03:53.278 --> 00:04:00.141]  And the New York State has taken it a step further by investigating people.
[00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:07.544]  Now I'm going to come back and cover all this, but I can't even believe it's gone this far.
[00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:10.505]  And what's even sicker is it's ExxonMobil.
[00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:29.042]  And British Petroleum and Dutch Royal Shell, those three, are the biggest funders of the whole man-made climate change garbage to shut down coal, their main competitor.
[00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:34.046]  And they're so sophisticated, the left doesn't even know they work for them.
[00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.929]  And then they have New York State investigating ExxonMobil.
[00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.233]  Claiming they paid for fake science.
[00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:42.394]  It wasn't fake science.
[00:04:42.394 --> 00:04:43.715]  That was 15 years ago.
[00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:51.921]  They were ordered by the board head, David Rockefeller, to convert and support it, and they have since then.
[00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.282]  Incredible.
[00:04:53.282 --> 00:04:53.863]  Incredible.
[00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:56.225]  This is just incredible.
[00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.946]  The oil companies run the fraud.
[00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:08.423]  Global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change, despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern U.S.
[00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:16.007]  The Climate Words for All Coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City.
[00:05:16.007 --> 00:05:27.252]  These are New York City's largest buildings, over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consist of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings, and multifamily housing developments, the report stated.
[00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:32.275]  The report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms.
[00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:43.843]  Global warming advocates, however, will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change, even though a few years ago, they were predicting that the Earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now.
[00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:49.287]  But they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood and tax the area.
[00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:57.896]  I'm good.
[00:05:58.903 --> 00:06:08.625]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.

[00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.459]  Yeah.
[00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:11.121]  My fellow patriots, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:12.342]  I'm for prosperity.
[00:07:12.342 --> 00:07:21.728]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[00:07:21.728 --> 00:07:29.012]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[00:08:01.989 --> 00:08:04.771]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:08.274]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.274 --> 00:08:21.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting across the globe from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:25.587]  Professor Daryl Hamamoto is our guest for the balance of the hour.
[00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:37.215]  We also have some fun video that we have time we're going to play of Anthony Guiciardi trying to barefoot water ski.
[00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.395]  Hey, I'm not knocking him.
[00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:41.176]  I can't do it either, but there's a reason I'm going to play it.
[00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:46.537]  I know this is a radio show, but free video feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:50.240]  I want to play a few clips before we go to the professor.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.982]  He's been on four or five times, I think, over the years.
[00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:58.926]  He's been persecuted because he headed up part of the school for saying, look, we can't ban Halloween.
[00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:01.048]  We can't ban dressing in costumes.
[00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:10.255]  We can't run around demanding everybody take on weird, bizarre, you know, race cults where the Hispanics are in a weird race cult that resembles basically the Klan.
[00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:13.237]  And then you've got the blacks in a group and the whites in the group and the Asians in a group.
[00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.569]  The Chinese, Asians in one group, the Japanese in another group.
[00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:19.310]  I mean, this is true Balkanization the opposite of Martin Luther King.
[00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.991]  It's scary, but it's social control.
[00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:26.392]  Total hijacking of great classical liberal ideas.
[00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:28.492]  He's been talking about this for years.
[00:09:28.492 --> 00:09:33.353]  He is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, so he's worked inside the belly of the beast.
[00:09:33.353 --> 00:09:41.215]  Before we do that, I wanted to play a couple clips we haven't gotten to that are context for this.
[00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:42.695]  The Buckley program at Yale
[00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:53.925]  Had this particular professor on who wrote The Coddling of the American Mind.
[00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:58.748]  Again, even the liberal Atlantic is admitting this stuff's going on.
[00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:09.055]  And then the protests begin protesting while First Amendment lawyer and the FIRE president CEO, Greg, and I'm pronouncing this right, Lukanoff, how do you say that?
[00:10:09.055 --> 00:10:09.536]  Lukanoff?
[00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:18.278]  Author of The Coddling of American Minds speaks during the State of the Free Expression, Intellectual Diversity, and Higher Education 5th Annual Conference.
[00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:18.979]  And this is the thing.
[00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:24.542]  I have a really good friend who was a big Hollywood editor.
[00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:25.743]  I went to college same time as him.
[00:10:25.743 --> 00:10:27.184]  I was in a student film.
[00:10:27.184 --> 00:10:29.326]  And he edited some of the big Hollywood films.
[00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:34.129]  He just didn't like Hollywood, didn't want to go back to school and get a psychology degree.
[00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:41.452]  I guess he's going for his PhD or whatever right now, and it's literally a cult.
[00:10:41.452 --> 00:10:52.835]  Where he's got to identify and say that he's bad because he's white, and just bizarre weirdness where if he makes one mistake his whole paper's given a zero, everybody else can make all the mistakes, they're given A+.
[00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.036]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:10:55.036 --> 00:10:55.816]  It's crazy.
[00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.385]  But it's also just men in general.
[00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:04.669]  And it's men leading women saying men are bad and men have to denounce they're basically bad.
[00:11:04.669 --> 00:11:06.071]  I mean, it's just gangs.
[00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:08.452]  It's gang mentality.
[00:11:08.452 --> 00:11:11.915]  It's raw exercise of like brown shirt stuff in Germany.
[00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:13.497]  That's all this is devolved into.
[00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:14.597]  Any group can degenerate.
[00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:16.159]  Right wing, left wing, you name it.
[00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:23.685]  And this is people basically going and getting these university degrees that are more and more close to useless in some cases for the economy.
[00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:30.327]  And they're just looking for identity, and it's devolving into king rat behavior.
[00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:35.189]  It's devolving into prison behavior, where everybody's in their own little group, and then the warden manages all that.
[00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:38.891]  This has been done by social engineers on record, and our guest was put through these programs.
[00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:40.232]  That's why he's an insider exposing it.
[00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.832]  You have to understand, again, as I've said a thousand times, this is not rhetoric when I say these things.
[00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:54.816]  This is CIA, Defense Department, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation on record doing this.
[00:11:54.816 --> 00:12:01.499]  Where people's identities aren't, I'm being discriminated against by the NSA spying on me, or Samsung TV's watching me, admit it.
[00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:04.720]  Or being signed onto trillions in derivatives that aren't my debt.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.361]  Or GMO not being able to be labeled.
[00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:20.702]  Or being told I've got to let the globalists bring in cheap labor and pay for it all as a, you know, free welfare, free baby stuff, as a corporate welfare payoff to give them the labor.
[00:12:20.702 --> 00:12:21.662]  On and on and on.
[00:12:21.662 --> 00:12:25.944]  All the real issues, all the real things happening.
[00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:26.605]  It is a tyranny.
[00:12:26.605 --> 00:12:28.646]  So we're gonna go to our guest after I play this clip.
[00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:30.767]  You know, Seinfeld's come out and said his daughter
[00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:34.596]  13 years old.
[00:12:34.596 --> 00:12:35.497]  I think she's 13 to 14.
[00:12:35.497 --> 00:12:38.518]  She says, Dad?
[00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:40.338]  Dad?
[00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:41.418]  You know?
[00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:42.739]  Why are we moving back to New York?
[00:12:42.739 --> 00:12:46.320]  Well, because we want you to have more friends and meet more boys.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.221]  She says, Dad, boys and girls together is sexist just to say boys and girls.
[00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:53.682]  And see, Seinfeld thought that she just didn't understand.
[00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:54.282]  No, no, no.
[00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:54.902]  She understood.
[00:12:54.902 --> 00:12:56.443]  This is what's taught.
[00:12:58.086 --> 00:13:02.250]  I mean, it's beyond 1984, it's beyond WE and other dystopic novels.
[00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.993]  This is the destruction of language and communication.
[00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.374]  By design.
[00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:21.646]  So let's go to this clip of where it's a First Amendment summit, and it's being shut down at Yale, and now Yale is apologizing that they did have professors say we shouldn't ban Halloween parties.
[00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:22.246]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:22.487]  Here it is.
[00:13:23.462 --> 00:13:30.087]  Another time was when I covered the University of Delaware case, and I went to actually University of Delaware to explain why their program was so nuts.
[00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:37.932]  I can't explain the University of Delaware program in any fewer than 50,000 words, so please read my book on learning liberty, but it was insane.
[00:13:37.932 --> 00:13:41.874]  And this is all, you know, so this is all 2007 and before.
[00:13:41.874 --> 00:13:46.798]  I have never seen such an emotional display from students.
[00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:52.101]  And again, this was over an email about, hey, can we chill out a little bit about Halloween?
[00:13:53.562 --> 00:14:00.988]  I'm sorry?
[00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:01.688]  And they take over.
[00:14:01.688 --> 00:14:06.112]  It's all about taking over and blocking speech.
[00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.333]  How dare you say we should be able to have costume parties?
[00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:12.637]  I mean, this is total beyond Jim Jones clothes.
[00:14:12.637 --> 00:14:14.438]  Totally posticide.
[00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:19.202]  Okay, so... We stand with our sisters of color.
[00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:20.987]  So I watched this.
[00:14:20.987 --> 00:14:22.208]  This is some white kid.
[00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:26.452]  This is like his fight to show he's battling his coming of age.
[00:14:26.452 --> 00:14:28.633]  He's trying to stop free speech.
[00:14:28.633 --> 00:14:32.156]  I'm telling you, look how upset and weird that guy looks.
[00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:33.678]  I've been around these people.
[00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:35.159]  That guy looks like a cult member.
[00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:36.620]  He looks like a zombie.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.321]  This is amazing.
[00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:41.504]  And I'm sorry I don't just go off looks, but these people all have to seem like where they can't walk, they stumble around.
[00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:43.906]  For making a mild criticism.
[00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:45.508]  By the way, I don't even charge that guy.
[00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:47.950]  If you did that to cops anywhere else, he'd be charged with resisting arrest.
[00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:56.995]  This is amazing!
[00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:58.637]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:14:58.637 --> 00:15:02.179]  I would have just kept him in there and let him keep doing it.
[00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:03.080]  He goes on, it gets worse.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.861]  I don't have time to play.
[00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:04.741]  I want to go to the professor.
[00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:07.123]  I'm going to skip this one break to give him more time.
[00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:09.145]  I'll play the Seinfeld clip, but you've got to understand, folks.
[00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:12.378]  The people running this.
[00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.699]  You notice at every university now, it's basically the same.
[00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:16.859]  This didn't just magically happen.
[00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:18.660]  The Atlantic says, how did it get this way?
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.220]  Why do they have panic attacks?
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.381]  If you have a brown paper bag, you know, why do they see racism in the clouds?
[00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:26.602]  It was scientifically done.
[00:15:26.602 --> 00:15:27.522]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:29.662]  And he's got a lot of points he wants to go over.
[00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:32.343]  He's got an initiative he's going to call for today.
[00:15:32.343 --> 00:15:36.064]  You know, Janet Napolitano heads up a bunch of universities.
[00:15:36.064 --> 00:15:38.244]  How about she resides?
[00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:40.345]  So we're talking about using their own weapons against them.
[00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.587]  We have the White House praising the protest.
[00:15:44.587 --> 00:15:54.193]  Again, this is about global social engineers taking everything over with one standardized culture that is a plastic corporate culture that can be rewritten within a week.
[00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:56.674]  And then you're given the new received proper terms.
[00:15:56.674 --> 00:16:01.257]  People ask why they're always changing, why it's always getting more extreme, because it's scientific.
[00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:03.839]  We're being culturally conquered.
[00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:06.961]  Not that the old mix of culture was perfect, but at least it was cultures.
[00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:08.782]  This is scientific.
[00:16:08.782 --> 00:16:11.344]  I'm going to shut up now and go to the professor.
[00:16:11.344 --> 00:16:12.324]  Trynday.com.
[00:16:12.324 --> 00:16:14.146]  You can find his book and work there.
[00:16:17.148 --> 00:16:21.410]  He's taught at the University of California, Davis, for most of his academic career.
[00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:27.813]  He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in political science, popular culture studies, and comparative culture.
[00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:31.555]  Hamamoto is the senior ranking professor of the Department of Asian American Studies.
[00:16:31.555 --> 00:16:32.836]  He's a recognized authority on U.S.
[00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:37.018]  media, popular culture, and sexuality, having published extensively in these areas.
[00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:43.501]  Hamamoto is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship at UCLA and is a Fulbright scholar.
[00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:45.862]  His current project is a volume that outlines the
[00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:46.983]  Good to have you back, my friend.
[00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:48.544]  I just played some of those clips.
[00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:11.297]  Is it cresting or is it just starting?
[00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:18.678]  Is this the beginning of the Maoist-style Red Terror or the Soviet or jack-booted brown-shirt Nazi bizarreness?
[00:17:18.678 --> 00:17:20.818]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:17:20.818 --> 00:17:22.719]  It's good to be back, Alex.
[00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.319]  Good to be back with you and your audience.
[00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:31.160]  You know, my perceptions and yours square up almost identically.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.201]  And I refer to this process as weaponizing the student body.
[00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:38.302]  There's a two-fold meaning in that.
[00:17:38.302 --> 00:17:48.768]  One is that the students are being used as a tool or a weapon against discussion, against dissent, against dissenters, against unpopular.
[00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:50.629]  Actually, I'm a very popular professor.
[00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:53.171]  But they're used as a weapon against
[00:17:54.887 --> 00:18:00.269]  Professors such as myself who don't go along with the politically correct orthodoxy.
[00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:11.772]  And the second meaning of weaponization is that these creatures that we're seeing on these YouTube postings, their bodies have been weaponized.
[00:18:11.772 --> 00:18:14.393]  You've talked many times about the sodium fluoride.
[00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:15.353]  That's only part of it.
[00:18:16.814 --> 00:18:30.542]  According to an environmental scientist by the name of Lauren Moray, these undergraduates are being hit with heavy concerted program doses of EMF.
[00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:35.606]  They're being heavily controlled by social media in general.
[00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:39.949]  That's right, screen time on record, reprograms and brain damages.
[00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:41.348]  It does.
[00:18:41.348 --> 00:18:54.858]  In addition to that, we have been subjected to, involuntarily, we've been subjected to experiments such as this famous social contagion experiment that was launched by Facebook.
[00:18:54.858 --> 00:19:05.186]  And their team of behavioral and social scientists wrote a paper on it, a social science paper, an academic paper, and they were completely unapologetic about it.
[00:19:05.586 --> 00:19:09.127]  So this is a total, like you're saying, it is a program.
[00:19:09.127 --> 00:19:18.771]  The students are in an electropharmaceutical gulag, and it's no accident that whatever campus you go to, it's the same program, it's the same scenario.
[00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:29.616]  You have these subsets of what you could call the crisis actor that we saw rolled out in Sandy Hook, and now they've been deployed in several different populations.
[00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:34.318]  You've got the Soros-connected railroad head who's got his son out there,
[00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.983]  Triggering and running the whole op, exactly.
[00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:44.641]  So they got just a few of their operatives, they're then given media attention, they're then the victim, and then they then lead the sheep to slaughter.
[00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:46.491]  That's right.
[00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:47.772]  These are Judas Goats.
[00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:49.033]  They're the Alpha Goats.
[00:19:49.033 --> 00:20:01.759]  And as you pointed out earlier, there's a certain subset within that, and they're typically aligned with some sort of GLBTQIA agenda, or they come out of gender and sexuality studies.
[00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:09.122]  By the way, they don't even call it women's studies anymore, because part of this agenda is to take us into a post-gender world, a transhumanist post-human world.
[00:20:09.122 --> 00:20:09.482]  That's right.
[00:20:09.482 --> 00:20:10.663]  They're not freeing us sexually.
[00:20:10.663 --> 00:20:11.523]  You're an expert on this.
[00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:12.884]  They are ending our sexual
[00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:22.206]  That's right, they're going to take us to the next level, as it's said, and that's the level where there is no gender differentiation.
[00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:27.847]  So you see this woman, Melissa Click, who thankfully resigned.
[00:20:27.847 --> 00:20:29.087]  She's a crisis actor.
[00:20:29.087 --> 00:20:38.449]  It's going to be interesting to see if one of your listeners want to track her to see where she shows up, but I'm sure she has a job waiting for her someplace in the university system.
[00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:45.216]  Uh, but it's typically a female quote-unquote white assistant professor.
[00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:46.758]  This is what you said here two years ago.
[00:20:46.758 --> 00:20:47.799]  I mean, you've laid this out.
[00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:48.460]  It's a program.
[00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:59.972]  Oh yes, I've had a ringside seat in this neo-Maoist, Pol Pot style Red Guards program that's being run out of Academic Affairs.
[00:20:59.972 --> 00:21:00.932]  And I want to point that out.
[00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:02.992]  And by the way folks, I just got chills.
[00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:04.093]  He's not just saying that.
[00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:05.413]  He went through the Rockefeller program.
[00:21:05.413 --> 00:21:09.474]  This is what they did with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
[00:21:09.474 --> 00:21:11.414]  And it's what they did in China.
[00:21:11.414 --> 00:21:15.035]  I mean, it's crazy to see that our government would do this.
[00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:16.795]  Because we know what the next phases are.
[00:21:17.475 --> 00:21:17.956]  And U.S.
[00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:22.360]  intelligence was behind the auto genocide in Cambodia.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:28.687]  And by the way, I teach the children and grandchildren of refugees from these totalitarian regimes.
[00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:38.136]  And that's why they're somewhat resistant to the political correctness that they are being indoctrinated to at the University of California, University of Missouri.
[00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:40.399]  I guess it kind of wakes you up to have your family killed.
[00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:41.882]  It does.
[00:21:41.882 --> 00:21:44.924]  So they're at the tipping point, so to speak.
[00:21:44.924 --> 00:21:56.492]  They're trying to recruit them aggressively through these mind control regimens, again through the Office of Student Affairs and so-called student community centers, where they go to these little enclaves.
[00:21:57.913 --> 00:22:15.589]  Reopen their hurts, their little problems with Mommy and Daddy, and they take them to these isolated retreats, and then they find people there who can take the program a little bit further, and then if you're really, really sleazy, you get to stay behind to attend the after party.
[00:22:15.589 --> 00:22:20.233]  And then perhaps after that, maybe you get to party with Janet LaPalazana at one of these mansion parties.
[00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:20.653]  Who knows?
[00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.457]  It's a cult.
[00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:24.237]  It's a cult.
[00:22:24.237 --> 00:22:27.019]  It's a mind control cult.
[00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:33.183]  It comes right out of the pages of Jonestown, which again apparently was a U.S.
[00:22:33.183 --> 00:22:34.583]  intelligence operation.
[00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:37.285]  When it got exposed, they shut it down and everybody killed themselves.
[00:22:37.925 --> 00:22:49.738]  Absolutely, and several people, including Congressman Leo Ryan, sacrificed their lives in order to expose this dark aspect of our national security university state.
[00:22:49.738 --> 00:22:55.624]  Well, when we put this interview out and write articles about it tomorrow, and again, it's not rhetoric, I say that neurotically because it's true.
[00:22:56.605 --> 00:23:02.492]  A university professor exposes government mind control programs on universities, and that's what it is.
[00:23:02.492 --> 00:23:16.066]  It's so bold that they would, and please keep getting into the facts and the techniques of how they do it, but it's really as bold they try this here, and I guess it's working like a charm, except you're fighting back and many others are now fighting back.
[00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.448]  It may backfire on them.
[00:23:17.448 --> 00:23:18.429]  Please keep elaborating.
[00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:25.609]  Well, any number of professors, my colleagues, even at UC Davis, are beginning to man up on this issue.
[00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:28.271]  Sorry for using the sexist language.
[00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:31.374]  I got in trouble for talking to a provost and using that.
[00:23:31.374 --> 00:23:32.855]  No, no, I understand.
[00:23:32.855 --> 00:23:36.298]  We need to do that, not because we're trying to just show how everything's programmed.
[00:23:36.298 --> 00:23:36.998]  Please continue.
[00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:42.202]  I'm doing it as a deliberate provocative gesture just to antagonize these rats who are spying on me right now.
[00:23:44.544 --> 00:24:08.824]  Yeah, these, well first of all, let me establish, I've done some research on Chancellor Linda Katehi, who by the way is deducting 25% of my salary for the next five months, and I call here and now for her immediate resignation as Chancellor of the University of California, Davis, because she is engaged in actions that go counter to the Constitution, the U.S.
[00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:12.587]  Constitution, to the very principles of academic freedom.
[00:24:13.087 --> 00:24:28.376]  So, Linda Katehi, stand down, and while you're at it, please take the President of the UC System, Janet Napolitano, with you, and Dean Susan Kaiser, who has stationed an emeritus professor in my classes, both of them.
[00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:34.239]  He's attending every single one of my lectures and taking copious notes so that he can pass it to the commissars.
[00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:37.162]  So why don't you three resign?
[00:24:37.162 --> 00:24:38.463]  Leave us alone.
[00:24:38.463 --> 00:24:42.007]  We're going to rebuild the University of California without you.
[00:24:42.007 --> 00:24:47.553]  The people of the state of California, the American people, will prevail on this issue.
[00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:51.337]  And by the way, I've read about you in student writings and other things.
[00:24:51.337 --> 00:24:53.419]  You've got some of the most attended classes.
[00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:54.260]  You head up the department.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.121]  They tried to get rid of you.
[00:24:55.922 --> 00:25:00.223]  You're promoting true classical liberalism, and the young men and women love it.
[00:25:00.223 --> 00:25:19.469]  And I'm not putting words in your mouth, but explain to people how successful you've been, because you're Toto pulling back the curtain, showing the man behind the curtain, or the women behind the curtain, that are literally engaged in cultural mind control, because they know these young people aren't going to be able to get jobs now in this economy.
[00:25:19.469 --> 00:25:24.330]  They've got to screw them up mentally, so they're adult and in a cult, and don't know why they have no future.
[00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.833]  So, I mean, this is really a sabotage of the American mind and a balkanization.
[00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:32.016]  But specifically, talk about how popular you are.
[00:25:32.016 --> 00:25:32.937]  That's why they're trying to get rid of you.
[00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:42.774]  Well, in all modesty, I was teaching introductory classes of 200 students, and my classes were routinely oversubscribed.
[00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:58.725]  And the university is so sleazy, they put one of these controllers into the departmental chair of my department, and he hired somebody specifically, and then she hired four student snitches, assistants, to empty out my classes.
[00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:02.248]  And she went on social media, Twitter, Facebook, in order to do so.
[00:26:02.748 --> 00:26:11.997]  Now, eventually she got thrown under the bus, and that's a warning to all you snitches out there who think you're going to get over by screwing with people, whether it's me or someone else.
[00:26:11.997 --> 00:26:25.949]  But eventually they're going to roll over on you, so keep that in mind before you attend one of these bogus encampments, these so-called safe spaces, or before you turn your soul over to so-called the Student Community Center.
[00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:33.919]  But she got rolled over and as a result, this new academic year, I'm Mr. Popular again.
[00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:40.488]  My classes are already for the next quarter already are oversubscribed unless they pull some dirty tricks on me.
[00:26:41.744 --> 00:26:45.586]  So, yes, I am the senior ranking professor.
[00:26:45.586 --> 00:26:49.648]  Well, they're definitely scared of you, and that's the point.
[00:26:49.648 --> 00:26:57.592]  You've been through several years of persecution for teaching a class, really giving young people true value on how the education system has been taken over.
[00:26:57.592 --> 00:26:58.533]  This is invaluable.
[00:26:59.178 --> 00:26:59.718]  That's right.
[00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.559]  And they understand it, Alex.
[00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:06.520]  These are really super bright, highly motivated young men and women.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:12.082]  And that is why I am so thoroughly invested in their future, because their future is our future.
[00:27:12.082 --> 00:27:17.884]  And I am not submitting to this notion that America, the American economy is dead or dying.
[00:27:17.884 --> 00:27:18.244]  In fact,
[00:27:19.185 --> 00:27:25.971]  My new area of emphasis is building up the new Silk Road economy, as it's called.
[00:27:25.971 --> 00:27:26.752]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:27:26.752 --> 00:27:28.434]  We could turn the economy back on at any time.
[00:27:28.434 --> 00:27:33.439]  They're trying to go into this post-industrial shutdown mode, trying to get them ready for it.
[00:27:33.439 --> 00:27:37.243]  That's why doing what you're doing will help create a new renaissance, and more and more professors are doing it.
[00:27:37.523 --> 00:27:41.106]  Let's get more into the technicals, though, because you've been to the Rockefeller program.
[00:27:41.106 --> 00:27:43.387]  I mean, this is a real operation.
[00:27:43.387 --> 00:27:57.138]  How do they take these young people and get them where they're just hysterical in fear, like Freddy Krueger's coming to get them, when they hear there might be, you know, you're not banning the people from wearing costumes?
[00:27:57.138 --> 00:28:01.781]  And then they shriek and scream and, I mean, act like someone just murdered their baby.
[00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:03.302]  This is true mind control.
[00:28:03.302 --> 00:28:05.624]  When you look at these people, they're wild-eyed.
[00:28:05.624 --> 00:28:06.465]  They're scared.
[00:28:07.265 --> 00:28:09.030]  I mean, what have they done to these people?
[00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:23.819]  Well, first of all, they have to hire an ethnically correct leader, a vice chancellor to head the student affairs unit, and that covers everything from athletics to food service to the so-called student community center.
[00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:32.286]  And she, and I say she because it's typically a woman these days, has to be a minority Latina or Asian American or African American.
[00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:38.491]  So she's there, she's in place, and then she staffs the entire operation with people who are sympathetic
[00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:43.075]  To the agenda, the agenda, by the way, comes from the Pentagon comes to the Department of Defense.
[00:28:43.075 --> 00:28:45.397]  It doesn't come from the University of California.
[00:28:45.397 --> 00:28:47.378]  Definitely doesn't come from the professors.
[00:28:47.378 --> 00:28:52.603]  And we have a principle of shared governance, which has completely been discarded.
[00:28:52.603 --> 00:28:53.984]  So they have that.
[00:28:53.984 --> 00:28:59.389]  And at the ground level, they have at the student community center, we have a brand new building.
[00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:00.569]  Apparently.
[00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:19.101]  Apparatchik, correct.
[00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:33.766]  And they have a master's degree, just a graduate degree, to administer the 18- and 19-year-olds who are looking for, legitimately, a social cause.
[00:29:33.766 --> 00:29:34.947]  They want a better society.
[00:29:35.527 --> 00:29:36.527]  So they role model him.
[00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:37.188]  They put him in.
[00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:43.249]  You know, just like if you want to corrupt an 18-year-old woman to make her a prostitute, you put her in with a, you know, 20-year-old who guides her into it.
[00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:45.510]  They just get them ready to pimp them directly and stay there.
[00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.391]  This is inside intel, folks.
[00:29:47.391 --> 00:29:48.411]  Key info.
[00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:49.811]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.332]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:55.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.144 --> 00:29:59.784]  The D.C.
[00:29:59.784 --> 00:30:04.786]  Police Chief urges citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:08.127]  Speaking with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Washington, D.C.
[00:30:08.127 --> 00:30:18.411]  Police Chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting, whether it means run, hide, or fight.
[00:30:18.411 --> 00:30:20.932]  If you're in a position to try to take the gunman out,
[00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:25.394]  It's the best option for saving lives before police can get there, Lanier said.
[00:30:25.394 --> 00:30:37.618]  While acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised, Lanier claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris, which left over 120 people dead.
[00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:41.560]  We always tell people, don't take action.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.660]  Call 9-1-1.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.121]  Don't intervene in the robbery, Lanier said.
[00:30:45.121 --> 00:30:47.281]  We've never told people, take action.
[00:30:47.281 --> 00:30:49.522]  But, it's a different scenario.
[00:30:49.522 --> 00:30:57.864]  Keep up with our latest news and information on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.

[00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:32.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:32.299 --> 00:31:37.303]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:37.303 --> 00:31:40.585]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:44.068]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:45.809]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:46.970]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.150]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.152]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:31:50.152 --> 00:31:56.756]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:34.494]  Everybody knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.
[00:32:34.534 --> 00:32:37.075]  That's why I coined the term 360Win.
[00:32:37.075 --> 00:32:39.996]  You're funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.

[00:32:49.861 --> 00:32:53.802]  Store wide free shipping on everything.
[00:32:53.802 --> 00:32:54.723]  Check it out today.
[00:33:09.512 --> 00:33:14.496]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:14.496 --> 00:33:16.478]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.478 --> 00:33:36.253]  By the way, the University of Missouri Fox News is now reporting has appointed a new black interim president.
[00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:42.302]  And I could care less if you got a black football coach or black president, as long as they do a good job.
[00:33:42.302 --> 00:33:49.828]  But this is clearly, you must resign and admit you're racist, and we're giving you a job because you're white.
[00:33:49.828 --> 00:33:51.969]  I mean, it's terrorism.
[00:33:51.969 --> 00:33:55.152]  And it just shows what they can do.
[00:33:55.152 --> 00:34:01.117]  And this is, again, federally globalist directed, where they can make the universities all capitulate and do whatever they want.
[00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:09.998]  Because after they remove 20 or 30 university presidents and chancellors, they're going to say now, you will adopt 100% our program.
[00:34:09.998 --> 00:34:12.060]  You will now carry it out.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.720]  Report!
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.401]  U of Missouri names black interim president yesterday.
[00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:24.126]  The governing board of the University of Missouri has selected a black law professor and deputy chancellor emeritus to serve as interim president of the university system.
[00:34:24.126 --> 00:34:26.427]  Multiple media outlets were reporting Thursday.
[00:34:26.427 --> 00:34:27.988]  It'll only get worse now.
[00:34:27.988 --> 00:34:28.869]  It just never stops.
[00:34:30.103 --> 00:34:35.669]  Michael Middleton retired in August after 30 years at the school.
[00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:43.376]  His selection comes three days after Tim Wolfe resigned amid controversy over his handling of a series of racially charged events.
[00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:49.663]  And they're now calling it Yale, a racially charged event, because people freaked out and said ban costume parties.
[00:34:49.663 --> 00:34:51.284]  Get rid of it, I dare you!
[00:34:51.284 --> 00:34:51.965]  Shut up!
[00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:52.906]  Shut up, get rid of it!
[00:34:55.072 --> 00:34:56.353]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:34:56.353 --> 00:34:58.796]  But it's not when you realize it's weaponized, it's by design.
[00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:02.179]  Professor Darryl Hamamoto is our guest.
[00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:07.625]  And he heads up the, he's the senior ranking professor in the Department of Asian American Studies.
[00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:11.949]  He's began to see this years ago and has now been writing about it and exposing it extensively.
[00:35:11.949 --> 00:35:15.693]  Before we go back to him, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:20.261]  We cannot fund this operation without your support.
[00:35:20.261 --> 00:35:30.009]  And you've been doing that, so you've seen us expand, hire more reporters, send our reporters around the country and the world, break more news, have a bigger effect.
[00:35:30.009 --> 00:35:31.971]  But I believe in the free market.
[00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:35.894]  I know you're such great listeners that you'd buy products even though they weren't the very best.
[00:35:35.894 --> 00:35:39.857]  But I want you to be a repeat customer, plus I want the good, you know, karma, whatever you want to call it.
[00:35:41.317 --> 00:35:44.459]  We bring you really true game changers.
[00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:56.645]  I could have a hundred products out right now, go to a major manufacturer, they'd still be pretty decent, private label an entire line for one of these big manufacturers, and have a hundred products out in just a few months.
[00:35:57.921 --> 00:35:59.282]  And make more money.
[00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:00.303]  But I refuse to do that.
[00:36:00.303 --> 00:36:04.567]  We go out and absolutely every product is what I call a game changer.
[00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:09.831]  Every product is like top scientists, doctors, researchers saying, this is the missing link.
[00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:11.612]  This is what people aren't getting.
[00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:17.097]  Sometimes it's real simple, like truly pure, clean, deep earth source iodine.
[00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:19.979]  Survival Shield, nascent iodine, true nascent iodine, X2.
[00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:23.722]  Because we've tested some of the stuff out there, it's not really nascent iodine.
[00:36:23.722 --> 00:36:24.083]  Ours is.
[00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:42.887]  Whether it's the oxy powder that flushes out your intestines with higher level oxygen that time releases, whether it is the liver shield, whether it's our new product, Living Defense Harmful Organism Parasite Cleanse Dietary Supplement at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:42.887 --> 00:36:45.768]  These nutraceuticals are powerful.
[00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:48.908]  Lung cleanse, a silver bullet is just 30 parts per million.
[00:36:48.908 --> 00:36:50.949]  More than that can be toxic, according to our experts.
[00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:53.670]  Still consult your doctors.
[00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.990]  Topical, internal, whatever.
[00:36:56.277 --> 00:37:05.360]  You take Silver Bullet, it is the best quality we could come out with and is lower than leading competitors.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.801]  Those are the exact same stuff from the same manufacturer.
[00:37:08.801 --> 00:37:10.541]  Some of our stuff is private-labeled.
[00:37:10.541 --> 00:37:12.942]  A lot of it's originally produced, but with big manufacturers.
[00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:15.205]  So that's what it comes down to.
[00:37:15.205 --> 00:37:16.687]  We've got a whole bunch of products.
[00:37:16.687 --> 00:37:20.271]  We've got up to like 15 products in the last three years.
[00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.533]  We've got a few more coming online in the next few months.
[00:37:22.533 --> 00:37:26.057]  But I plan to kind of round stuff out with about 30 products.
[00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:30.162]  Because I'm not going to try to come out with like 500 great products, which takes 15, 20 years to do.
[00:37:31.603 --> 00:37:32.724]  That's what Longevity's done.
[00:37:32.724 --> 00:37:33.484]  I support them.
[00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.065]  They've got a great line of products.
[00:37:35.065 --> 00:37:35.946]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:42.210]  If you want to find Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 and Polymburst and other great products as well.
[00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:42.890]  Just amazing.
[00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.071]  That supports the broadcast too.
[00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:46.053]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:37:46.053 --> 00:37:47.153]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:37:47.153 --> 00:37:51.216]  If you want big discounts and free shipping and want to be able to sign up for AutoShip.
[00:37:53.368 --> 00:38:00.357]  Infowarsteam.com, Infowarshealth.com, again, is the hundreds and hundreds of products from the great folks at Yongevity.
[00:38:00.357 --> 00:38:03.001]  Be sure and get it there because you get big discounts and it supports the broadcast.
[00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:07.507]  But Infowarslife.com are our proprietary game-changing products as well.
[00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:10.972]  So I wanna encourage everybody to take advantage of that.
[00:38:10.972 --> 00:38:22.776]  We still have big specials on some of the other nutraceuticals, upwards of 25% off on things like Winter Sun, high-quality organic vitamin D, and Brain Force, and others.
[00:38:22.776 --> 00:38:29.058]  Still have free shipping on the water filtration systems like Alexa Pure Pro, and the 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:38:29.058 --> 00:38:33.739]  That's InfoWarsStore.com, and a sub-area is InfoWarsLife.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:35.220]  And one way you can still vote
[00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:41.252]  Is with your dollars and with your support.
[00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:49.073]  That's why it's important to support professors like Professor Daryl Hamamoto, who's been threatened to be fired, had his pay cut, being harassed, to tell the truth.
[00:38:49.073 --> 00:38:53.614]  But I can tell he's more alive than ever, because that's really the sustenance of life is telling the truth.
[00:38:53.614 --> 00:39:00.656]  But when you do spread the word about free speech, when you support true classical liberals, libertarianism, whatever you want to call it,
[00:39:01.792 --> 00:39:15.495]  When we take back the real mantle of renaissance and enlightenment and culture away from these tyrant control freaks and their minions, we begin to turn the tide against this new dark age the system wants to bring in.
[00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:16.455]  Now, I'm done ranting.
[00:39:16.455 --> 00:39:17.055]  I apologize.
[00:39:17.055 --> 00:39:17.536]  I've been ranting.
[00:39:17.536 --> 00:39:20.756]  I'm going to go back to Professor Hamamoto here at trineday.com.
[00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:21.837]  You want to find his publications.
[00:39:24.987 --> 00:39:33.797]  You got cut off getting into how they technician things, how they break it down, how they stable the young people, how they run them through, how they peer pressure them.
[00:39:33.797 --> 00:39:37.441]  And just young people, I mean, it's like even my kids.
[00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:38.001]  They're in school 13, 11, and 7.
[00:39:42.307 --> 00:39:46.190]  Other kids learn how to be mean, and then my kids sometimes want to be mean back.
[00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:52.974]  I try to teach them it doesn't matter, you'll transcend this, you know, live your own life, find the few people you like, get along with them.
[00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:55.936]  It's the same peer pressure cult.
[00:39:55.936 --> 00:39:59.098]  They kind of keep that going into college, into the workforce, everywhere else.
[00:39:59.098 --> 00:40:04.122]  But I've learned if you tell children, but also young adults about this, like you're doing, this is how you're being programmed.
[00:40:04.122 --> 00:40:07.664]  This is how you're being socially meant to feel bad if you don't submit to this.
[00:40:07.664 --> 00:40:09.345]  And then you feel accepted.
[00:40:09.345 --> 00:40:12.007]  Tribalism, what you naturally need, cultural,
[00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:15.329]  By submitting to this, this is a fake culture.
[00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:23.916]  You need to find true culture with real people and free association that does transcend race, religion, region, you know, ethnicity, all this stuff.
[00:40:23.916 --> 00:40:24.296]  True.
[00:40:25.495 --> 00:40:26.536]  Free market of ideas.
[00:40:26.536 --> 00:40:27.416]  So I'm done ranting.
[00:40:27.416 --> 00:40:28.817]  Get into how the technicians operate.
[00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:30.637]  You've got the floor pretty much for the rest of the hour.
[00:40:30.637 --> 00:40:31.978]  I want you to break it down.
[00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:34.479]  Major whistleblower from UC Davis.
[00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:36.620]  Head of the Asian American Studies.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.222]  Persecuted for years, telling the truth.
[00:40:39.222 --> 00:40:45.024]  I want you to get back into how they do it, but also I'd like to ask you somewhere in there, how did you begin to wake up?
[00:40:45.024 --> 00:40:47.365]  Was it when they put you through the Rockefeller program?
[00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:50.667]  Or were you always somewhat awake?
[00:40:50.667 --> 00:40:52.128]  And then where do you see this going?
[00:40:52.128 --> 00:40:52.368]  Go ahead.
[00:40:53.752 --> 00:41:02.977]  Well, to answer your last question first, I was, even as a young person, and by the way, they start tracking you in elementary school.
[00:41:02.977 --> 00:41:11.121]  There's a reason why a certain group of kids are always taking these little standardized tests, reading, mathematics, very early on.
[00:41:11.121 --> 00:41:21.166]  And today, the so-called STEM program identifies students in elementary school, and that's one of the reasons why Jerry Seinfeld's daughter came back with that candid response.
[00:41:22.586 --> 00:41:34.714]  About moving back to New York because it's a program and a lot of these students who are trained at UC Davis and other places at the so-called Student Community Center do what's called outreach.
[00:41:34.714 --> 00:41:36.716]  That's a red flag word right there.
[00:41:36.716 --> 00:41:41.399]  Outreach to the elementary schools and to the junior high schools and high schools.
[00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:48.504]  So by the time they come to the university, they've already been primed and they've been pre-selected so far as the leadership track is concerned.
[00:41:49.204 --> 00:41:56.266]  Now, within that, there's a pincer movement between two student constituencies that are being used.
[00:41:56.266 --> 00:42:01.388]  And you can tell by the amount of resources that are being allocated to these areas.
[00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:07.670]  And you can also tell by the identification, for example, Linda Katehi, the chancellor at UC Davis.
[00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.691]  She's an engineer by training.
[00:42:09.691 --> 00:42:12.732]  And by the way, she holds 19 patents for antennas.
[00:42:12.732 --> 00:42:18.334]  And antennas are key to this whole EMF regime that's part of the mind control system.
[00:42:19.114 --> 00:42:28.388]  But she has declared herself as part of the Gender and Sexuality Studies, even though she has no academic expertise in the area.
[00:42:28.388 --> 00:42:29.970]  So that's a big area.
[00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:35.238]  It's the GLBTQIA department and programs.
[00:42:35.838 --> 00:42:52.412]  That the so-called student activists are being recruited from and those are the people that come into my class most recently and in a sexuality class that sit in the back and you showed a video earlier and they start questioning you aggressively they try to sweat you
[00:42:53.432 --> 00:43:05.119]  They'll wear little fright wigs, little purple wigs, and just all of a sudden, spontaneously, as if they were mind-controlled, which they are, and they'll start spontaneously asking you these questions.
[00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:11.103]  All you have to do is break them down individually, and they begin to crumble.
[00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:16.746]  Another technique I've known is said, yeah, come up to the to the stage, the front of the stage.
[00:43:16.746 --> 00:43:17.987]  Here's an open microphone.
[00:43:17.987 --> 00:43:21.149]  Tell me what what you want to see in this class.
[00:43:21.149 --> 00:43:22.270]  And they have nothing.
[00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.271]  They have nothing.
[00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:28.836]  By the way, this is a technique that a lot of comedians, stand-up people like Seinfeld will use.
[00:43:28.836 --> 00:43:30.598]  They'll just turn the light on the heckler.
[00:43:31.238 --> 00:43:32.719]  And they don't have anything.
[00:43:32.719 --> 00:43:33.980]  They're just, they're there.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.401]  They have a program.
[00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:43.346]  So getting back on point, we have the GLBTQ Mafia that's out there and the other mafia is the Children of Illegal Immigrants.
[00:43:44.624 --> 00:43:47.627]  And supposedly underrepresented minorities on campus.
[00:43:47.627 --> 00:43:54.392]  At UC Davis, there is an office in the so-called Student Community Center called AB 540.
[00:43:54.392 --> 00:44:01.116]  That stands for California Assembly Bill 540, the so-called The DREAM Act, which hasn't even passed yet.
[00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:06.941]  It's not close to passing, but the University of California has taken it upon itself
[00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:22.246]  Probably from orders from the Pentagon, the DoD, or the Wall Street, the City of London bankers, on orders from them to establish a center to normalize their presence, not just in the university, but in society.
[00:44:22.246 --> 00:44:28.428]  It's not that they care about the children of illegal immigrants, and I have nothing against them personally.
[00:44:28.428 --> 00:44:31.969]  They're wonderful individuals, the students, I know many of them.
[00:44:33.009 --> 00:44:37.550]  But they're going to be used as tools in the future out of gratitude.
[00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:52.053]  They're going to be the people who are in CPS, the social workers, the psychotherapists, the teachers, the people who are helping to bring in this larger globalist... Sure, the Soviet Union always uses... I mean, interrupt me since it's so true what you're saying.
[00:44:52.053 --> 00:44:53.153]  I just got to back you up.
[00:44:53.153 --> 00:45:00.495]  The Soviet Union, the Nazis, all totalitarians use quote orphans within a 10-year training program are then the shock troops.
[00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.851]  They are the Jungend, absolutely.
[00:45:04.851 --> 00:45:12.935]  And you were mentioning that there's an ethnically correct interim president appointed to the University of Missouri.
[00:45:12.935 --> 00:45:26.501]  I call that process whereby administrators and certain faculty, including assistant professors who need to show that they're quote-unquote down with the students in order to get tenure, I call that flat mail.
[00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:29.562]  As in flat catchers.
[00:45:29.562 --> 00:45:31.422]  And this comes from Tom Wolfe.
[00:45:31.422 --> 00:45:33.463]  This is the common strategy.
[00:45:33.463 --> 00:45:50.387]  If you read a classic essay by Tom Wolfe called Mao Maoing the Flat Catchers, 1970, he talks about how the so-called liberals with a small L got behind the original Black Panthers and got into this, what he calls, radical chic.
[00:45:50.387 --> 00:45:53.368]  And that's one of the reasons why you're not hearing a lot of professionals
[00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:56.030]  Come forward at this point.
[00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.933]  I think they're starting to, but not in large numbers.
[00:45:59.933 --> 00:46:05.818]  Because they're still operating on the basis of what was going on through the 60s and 70s.
[00:46:05.818 --> 00:46:17.888]  They don't realize that this is a really serious Maoist, Pol Pot type takeover using the Jungend as a means, as a tool for the totalitarian takeover.
[00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:25.073]  And the Pol Pot time, I have their children, as I mentioned, of the refugees in my classes.
[00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:35.076]  It's difficult selling them, but if they can get them into the so-called Student Community Center, take them to these retreats, so-called.
[00:46:35.076 --> 00:46:39.097]  And by the way, the other red flag word is leadership.
[00:46:39.097 --> 00:46:40.897]  Leadership retreats.
[00:46:40.897 --> 00:46:42.858]  They take them into a remote location.
[00:46:43.758 --> 00:46:47.161]  To University of California owned or leased property.
[00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:48.462]  They isolate them.
[00:46:48.462 --> 00:46:50.864]  They play these little trust games.
[00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:57.448]  The trainers with the master's degrees and PhD level psychotherapists are there to oversee it.
[00:46:57.448 --> 00:47:00.611]  They are all trained in neurolinguistic programming.
[00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:18.104]  The Delphi Technique, all these different mind control protocols that come out of the Stanford Research Institute, the RAND Corporation, completely weaponized behavioral science directed against 18, 19-year-old first-year students who are away from home.
[00:47:18.744 --> 00:47:25.690]  They're ripe for cult membership and indoctrination and induction, along with the various cults that line up by the coffee house.
[00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:34.256]  And let's remember under the 60s earlier template that sounded reasonable, don't tell your kids what to do, let them be their own, don't be their parents.
[00:47:34.256 --> 00:47:41.021]  They're now looking for parents, like young gang members, you know, looking for a father figure and joining the Crips or whatever.
[00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:44.304]  They're now looking for mommy and daddy and they're giving it.
[00:47:44.304 --> 00:47:45.485]  This is so systematic.
[00:47:46.704 --> 00:47:48.185]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:47:48.185 --> 00:47:53.748]  And the court that I'm talking about, their parents typically have their heads screwed on straight.
[00:47:53.748 --> 00:47:54.428]  They're immigrants.
[00:47:54.428 --> 00:48:00.912]  They came to the United States to make a living, to live in freedom and liberty.
[00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:02.512]  So it's really, really difficult.
[00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.613]  And also they're family oriented.
[00:48:04.613 --> 00:48:10.877]  The Latinos, Latinas, they come from a society and culture that's wonderful, the parent culture.
[00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:15.638]  So when they come to the University of California, they have to unlearn all that.
[00:48:15.638 --> 00:48:19.879]  So they are indoctrinated by this weaponized behavioral science.
[00:48:19.879 --> 00:48:20.219]  I agree.
[00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:26.620]  From what I've seen, it works better on 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th generation whites, I found, are the absolute worst.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.141]  And then blacks feel like they've been wrong, which they were, but that chip is reinstated and then projected onto everybody.
[00:48:33.141 --> 00:48:38.642]  I mean, am I accurate in saying, from your perspective, that whites and blacks are the easiest to get into the brainwashing, or is that wrong?
[00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:46.085]  That is correct, and I would add to that fourth and fifth generation Asian Americans and fourth and fifth generation Latinos and Latinas.
[00:48:46.085 --> 00:48:50.507]  It's a generational drift away from the vitality of the parent culture.
[00:48:50.507 --> 00:48:59.412]  And so that's why it's so important to start reteaching instead of doing this quote-unquote theory in the English Department of History.
[00:48:59.412 --> 00:49:06.336]  Let's read the Nordic tales, the medieval literature, the great works of art, literature, music.
[00:49:07.616 --> 00:49:11.358]  So that we can get this new renaissance into gear here.
[00:49:11.358 --> 00:49:12.518]  And that's where we're heading.
[00:49:12.518 --> 00:49:13.819]  This is where we're heading.
[00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:15.479]  Despite the little petty tyranny.
[00:49:15.479 --> 00:49:15.779]  That's right.
[00:49:15.779 --> 00:49:17.140]  Let's talk about your main mission.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.741]  I mean, because that's really this.
[00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:20.361]  I mean, you have a solution.
[00:49:20.361 --> 00:49:21.161]  I've read it.
[00:49:21.161 --> 00:49:22.622]  Your essays, your work.
[00:49:22.622 --> 00:49:25.003]  I mean, you know, because you're an insider, how to beat them.
[00:49:25.003 --> 00:49:26.523]  And the new renaissance is here.
[00:49:26.523 --> 00:49:29.845]  We give them the opportunity that there's a real renaissance and it's about them.
[00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:30.425]  It's game over.
[00:49:31.857 --> 00:49:32.779]  That's right.
[00:49:32.779 --> 00:49:36.007]  First of all, I'm getting my students to start reading.
[00:49:36.007 --> 00:49:41.240]  They don't have to read Dubliners or Ulysses by James Joyce.
[00:49:42.142 --> 00:49:53.306]  Which was purposely made difficult to understand so that you'd create jobs for professors of literature, but even popular literature like Michael Crichton.
[00:49:53.306 --> 00:49:56.467]  I mean, before he was, well, let's say he died.
[00:49:56.467 --> 00:50:04.610]  Okay, before he expired, he was really, really getting into the heart of this bioweaponization system with his novel Next.
[00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:13.131]  And a state of fear where he took apart the whole fake environmental scare and even had a bibliography in the back of his book and an author statement.
[00:50:13.131 --> 00:50:19.513]  Now this is a man who has a medical degree from Harvard Medical School and he's a hugely popular writer.
[00:50:19.513 --> 00:50:26.934]  So I get to say, please, we're coming up to Thanksgiving and the winter holidays, you know, read a novel.
[00:50:26.934 --> 00:50:28.534]  And even if it has to be J.K.
[00:50:28.534 --> 00:50:31.214]  Rowling, the Satanist, read it with a certain eye.
[00:50:31.214 --> 00:50:32.875]  If you want to read Tolkien, that's fine.
[00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:33.555]  If you're a ringer,
[00:50:34.735 --> 00:50:44.642]  Fine, but understand the occultic and the social and cultural engineering and the Tavistock connections to these forms of mass mind control.
[00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:58.951]  By the way, one thing I found common to a lot of the current generation of students, and this is true not just with Americans, but I also taught a course this summer for Fulbrighters, and so these are the best and brightest of young people from all over the world.
[00:50:58.951 --> 00:51:03.935]  There's one common literary source that they all share, and this is something that
[00:51:04.735 --> 00:51:09.816]  That needs to be looked into by people in the English department or comparative literature.
[00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:12.997]  They've all read Harry Potter.
[00:51:12.997 --> 00:51:14.337]  All the volumes.
[00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:19.758]  These were the kids that stood in line until midnight waiting for the next volume to drop.
[00:51:19.758 --> 00:51:21.899]  They've all read it systematically.
[00:51:21.899 --> 00:51:22.879]  So there's something there.
[00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:27.120]  This could be like the catcher in the rye of the current millennial generation.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.801]  It might be one of those Mark David Chapman sugar type deals.
[00:51:31.961 --> 00:51:35.082]  And by the way, everything you say is so backed up.
[00:51:35.082 --> 00:51:39.264]  In fact, I just want to talk about Dr. Nick Baggage, whose, of course, brother was a U.S.
[00:51:39.264 --> 00:51:42.065]  Senator, is his father a Congressman.
[00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:48.207]  He's detailed thousands of patents, but hundreds of them on DARPA and antennas.
[00:51:48.207 --> 00:51:58.571]  And I even read articles in the Baltimore Sun on air where DARPA said, you know, at the local universities we're testing systems with wavelengths to soothe the students.
[00:51:59.111 --> 00:52:02.033]  So when you bring that up, I don't know how much you can go into.
[00:52:02.033 --> 00:52:04.994]  It sounds crazy, but we're in 2015.
[00:52:04.994 --> 00:52:07.816]  He says, don't worry about the fluoride in the water, that's bad enough.
[00:52:07.816 --> 00:52:17.461]  That yes, they are in selective areas testing, and we know it's patented for decades, literal wavelengths with frequency pollution.
[00:52:17.461 --> 00:52:24.464]  And then I look at the students that come out and protest us, the Maoists, they have tattoos of Mao on them, black, white, you name it.
[00:52:24.464 --> 00:52:25.345]  When I look at
[00:52:26.933 --> 00:52:40.682]  The student that was attacking the professor, you know, there at Yale at the Free Speech Summit, they can't walk, they're kind of falling down, they look crazy, their eyes don't point the right directions, and I don't go off a book's cover.
[00:52:40.682 --> 00:52:47.067]  But when I went out to this pro-life demonstration, and literal people showed up, black, white, you name it, they all looked the same.
[00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:49.322]  Spiritually wise.
[00:52:49.322 --> 00:52:52.025]  They were like, the white people almost had like green skin.
[00:52:52.025 --> 00:52:53.066]  They were all wearing black.
[00:52:53.066 --> 00:52:59.632]  They would stumble into me and like, but they all pulled up like in, you know, brand new black Jaguars and stuff.
[00:52:59.632 --> 00:53:01.513]  Talk about the activist chic.
[00:53:01.513 --> 00:53:02.754]  And then we went and tracked them.
[00:53:02.754 --> 00:53:03.695]  We got a tip.
[00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:11.863]  They're like at the police review boards with the UT professors literally setting up like a communist takeover and admitting it.
[00:53:11.863 --> 00:53:13.144]  I mean, it's just like,
[00:53:13.664 --> 00:53:20.769]  That's who the elite are going to put in charge is like weirdos stumbling around saying they love Satan that can hardly walk?
[00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:22.490]  I mean, there's something going on.
[00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:23.771]  Like, is it spiritual?
[00:53:23.771 --> 00:53:24.892]  Is it chemicals?
[00:53:24.892 --> 00:53:26.313]  What are they doing to these?
[00:53:26.313 --> 00:53:34.058]  I mean, we know about MKUltra and the Unabomber, you know, at Harvard or whatever it was with the CIA MKUltra program.
[00:53:34.058 --> 00:53:35.359]  I mean, he was in that, folks.
[00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:37.300]  That's LA Times.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.481]  I'm kind of ranting here.
[00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:42.503]  It's just I'm noticing something that they're like zombies.
[00:53:42.503 --> 00:53:43.204]  Have you seen that?
[00:53:44.084 --> 00:53:44.725]  Absolutely.
[00:53:44.725 --> 00:53:46.485]  They're EMF zombies.
[00:53:46.485 --> 00:53:54.409]  As I told you before, Chancellor Linda Katehi has 19 unique patents on antenna technology to her name.
[00:53:54.409 --> 00:54:03.433]  It's not an accident that she was put in this position because the University of California Davis also has a close connection, an intimate connection, with
[00:54:04.814 --> 00:54:08.056]  The Los Alamos Nuclear Labs and the Lawrence Livermore.
[00:54:08.056 --> 00:54:12.639]  Edward Teller thought UC Davis was one of his favorite campuses.
[00:54:12.639 --> 00:54:21.485]  So, UC Davis is, and it also has a national primate laboratory where they workshop all these different EMG and different types of EMFs.
[00:54:21.485 --> 00:54:24.287]  Sure, I was led into the UT facility while I wanted to get arrested.
[00:54:24.287 --> 00:54:25.188]  I wasn't led into it.
[00:54:25.188 --> 00:54:28.670]  I was allowed to see a camera into it from the psychology department.
[00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:29.711]  Hell on earth!
[00:54:29.711 --> 00:54:31.892]  But you notice that none of the liberals want to stop that.
[00:54:31.892 --> 00:54:34.034]  I mean, there's no discussion about that.
[00:54:34.674 --> 00:54:36.135]  No.
[00:54:36.135 --> 00:54:37.716]  Yeah, welcome to the monkey house.
[00:54:37.716 --> 00:54:40.697]  And it's interesting that you brought up Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:54:40.697 --> 00:54:50.263]  I was going to speak to some of the really early on discoveries or insights that Dr. Begich had, and that was his work on HAARP.
[00:54:50.263 --> 00:54:59.268]  What we're seeing here with students on campus is that crazed look, that Maoist commie look that you have seen in people both on tape and in person.
[00:54:59.268 --> 00:55:00.268]  That comes from EMF.
[00:55:00.268 --> 00:55:01.329]  This is HAARP.
[00:55:01.329 --> 00:55:02.730]  This is HAARP in action.
[00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:15.478]  So, ladies and gentlemen, if you think this is the heart project that is just for our enemies, foreign, it's really for the people, the American people, and they're hitting our young people the most.
[00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:16.959]  We know about the psychotropics.
[00:55:16.959 --> 00:55:20.601]  I was going to mention Dr. Peter Bragan's great work on psychotropic drugs.
[00:55:20.601 --> 00:55:29.507]  We know that a large percentage, if not most of the young men and women, are on some form of very powerful hallucinogenic drugs.
[00:55:30.067 --> 00:55:36.351]  They should be taking nutraceuticals, vitamin supplements, and they also should be taking mandatory gym classes.
[00:55:36.351 --> 00:55:38.512]  That's one of my suggestions.
[00:55:38.512 --> 00:55:40.493]  We need to bring back P.E.
[00:55:40.493 --> 00:55:47.697]  of K-12 through middle and high school, and also through the college and university, so people can start getting... Plus, they have no social skills, too!
[00:55:47.697 --> 00:55:48.618]  I mean, are you seeing that?
[00:55:48.618 --> 00:55:49.639]  That's right.
[00:55:49.639 --> 00:55:56.462]  They need to learn how to be true team players, not Maoist, Pol Pot-type zombie players.
[00:55:56.462 --> 00:55:56.583]  Wow.
[00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:00.403]  It's definitely HAARP.
[00:56:00.403 --> 00:56:04.564]  I think that's something that needs to be looked at much more closely.
[00:56:04.564 --> 00:56:14.686]  Last academic year, a portable, very, very powerful antenna, portable antenna, showed up and people were talking about then it kind of went away.
[00:56:14.686 --> 00:56:16.026]  But they're experimenting with it.
[00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:21.207]  They're putting in new lighting systems, supposedly smart lighting systems, you name it.
[00:56:21.207 --> 00:56:27.969]  By the way, that's even in USA Today that it can be used to transmit data back and forth, but also to calm
[00:56:28.869 --> 00:56:36.614]  The police officers in Minnesota, where they put it in first, and they just put out like, you know, like, it's like Rasmussen Poll.
[00:56:36.614 --> 00:56:40.297]  National Poll, should we arrest global warming skeptics?
[00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:44.119]  It's just kind of like, oh, the lights calm the police officers.
[00:56:44.119 --> 00:56:45.640]  I mean, we're not making this up.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.662]  It sounds fantastical, but it's all really going on.
[00:56:48.662 --> 00:56:53.445]  I mean, I remember five years ago, six years ago, exposing stingray systems, and they wouldn't admit they were there.
[00:56:53.445 --> 00:56:56.687]  Now everybody's like, oh, of course there's secret cell towers grabbing everything.
[00:56:56.687 --> 00:56:57.288]  I mean, it's just...
[00:56:58.473 --> 00:57:00.876]  I'm telling you, it is a fantastical time to be alive.
[00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:06.462]  As scary as it is, Professor, isn't it exciting that we are conscious and trying to figure this out?
[00:57:06.462 --> 00:57:07.484]  I mean, it's an adventure.
[00:57:08.385 --> 00:57:09.486]  It is an adventure.
[00:57:09.486 --> 00:57:22.172]  I am so glad, happy, honored to be here in 2015, joining in this battle with you and the people, liberally loving people in America and around the world to take back our civilization.
[00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:29.396]  And we are going to win because all I have to do is talk to the gang stalkers individually and they melt.
[00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:30.477]  They break down.
[00:57:30.477 --> 00:57:32.738]  The programming just disappears.
[00:57:32.738 --> 00:57:34.138]  It's not that strong.
[00:57:34.138 --> 00:57:35.219]  Because you've got humanity.
[00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:36.260]  And it's electrical.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.161]  Exactly.
[00:57:37.161 --> 00:57:38.081]  They know I'm real.
[00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:39.502]  They know I'm sincere.
[00:57:39.502 --> 00:57:43.466]  They know I don't have an axe to grind or a hidden agenda.
[00:57:43.466 --> 00:57:47.589]  If I did, I would be on Wall Street or something.
[00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:53.093]  Look, when you tell the truth the eloquent way you do it, expose it and give the sources, they've been looking for the truth.
[00:57:53.093 --> 00:57:56.556]  They're already subconsciously smart that you're not teaching them anything.
[00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:59.799]  You're just telling them what they already knew but was blinded.
[00:57:59.799 --> 00:58:02.761]  You're just opening the curtains and the lights coming in.
[00:58:02.761 --> 00:58:04.563]  And that's why we are going to win is because
[00:58:05.143 --> 00:58:07.846]  Humanity wants to succeed together to the stars.
[00:58:07.846 --> 00:58:08.727]  It's going to happen.
[00:58:08.727 --> 00:58:17.677]  We've just got to really work hard to try to make this transition period not as destructive as these wicked elites would rather it be.
[00:58:17.677 --> 00:58:18.438]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:58:18.438 --> 00:58:19.299]  Keep it over five minutes.
[00:58:19.299 --> 00:58:20.920]  You probably got to go to finish up.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.885]  Talk about some of your papers, how we keep you at the university, how we get what you're teaching.

[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:06.623]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.623 --> 01:00:08.383]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.383 --> 01:00:10.144]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:11.745]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:13.305]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.467 --> 01:00:21.729]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:24.650]  Peter Schiff's coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:26.651]  Been really accurate on his predictions.
[01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:31.133]  A record 94,610,000 Americans not in the labor force.
[01:00:31.133 --> 01:00:32.833]  Dissipation rate lowest in 77.
[01:00:34.654 --> 01:00:39.036]  Record 56 million women not working.
[01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:42.097]  How's that being married to the state working out for you?
[01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:44.418]  Jobs up only for immigrants.
[01:00:44.418 --> 01:00:47.859]  Down 262,000 for native-borns.
[01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:50.681]  Payrolls is a disaster going down.
[01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.002]  Fed never going to raise rates.
[01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:53.562]  It's ugly.
[01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.563]  We have a flashback.
[01:00:55.563 --> 01:00:56.523]  They were saying how great it would be.
[01:00:56.523 --> 01:00:58.704]  That's some of the stories up at DrugsReport.com.
[01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.972]  Not a happy face under the New World Order.
[01:01:03.972 --> 01:01:06.234]  Meanwhile, I saw the headline on InfoWars.
[01:01:06.234 --> 01:01:07.735]  I got the story right here.
[01:01:07.735 --> 01:01:13.099]  Colorado College bans the words, Lord, God, and Jesus.
[01:01:13.099 --> 01:01:14.380]  Just don't say them.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.301]  Don't write them.
[01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:16.882]  It's hurtful to other people.
[01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:18.683]  Just like the word father or mother is hurtful.
[01:01:18.683 --> 01:01:21.285]  If you don't have a father or mother, it's hurtful that you have one.
[01:01:21.285 --> 01:01:24.187]  See, the ultimate collectivism.
[01:01:24.187 --> 01:01:26.469]  It's like, you have two legs, we have to chop them off.
[01:01:26.469 --> 01:01:27.530]  Somebody else is upset.
[01:01:30.885 --> 01:01:34.467]  Tell ya, that takes some Cajones as they say to do that.
[01:01:34.467 --> 01:01:45.471]  But, they've got, we laugh at this, they have a servile population that waits every day as like religious cult fervor.
[01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:50.954]  MKUltra, like Pavlovian, Skinnerian service to the establishment.
[01:01:50.954 --> 01:01:57.857]  And just whatever the latest cutting edge vomit is that comes out of the establishment's mouth, they just lick it all up.
[01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:02.685]  Oh, it's so poisonous.
[01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.566]  Oh, it's meant to destroy me.
[01:02:04.566 --> 01:02:05.747]  Thank you.
[01:02:05.747 --> 01:02:07.688]  Oh, you hate me.
[01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:11.971]  Oh, thank you for screwing me over and wanting to destroy my free will.
[01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:13.252]  Oh, you're so anti-liberal.
[01:02:13.252 --> 01:02:14.112]  I love you.
[01:02:14.112 --> 01:02:17.114]  Oh, that's why we call you liberal because everything's a deception with you people.
[01:02:17.114 --> 01:02:18.635]  Oh, thank you for your tyranny.
[01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:20.256]  Oh, it's so loving.
[01:02:20.256 --> 01:02:24.378]  Those who hammer their guns into plowshares will plow for those who do not.
[01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:27.240]  Founder of the Democratic Party, Thomas Jefferson.
[01:02:29.005 --> 01:02:30.366]  But what do you people even know?
[01:02:30.366 --> 01:02:31.427]  You don't know anything.
[01:02:31.427 --> 01:02:36.912]  You don't know who your daddy or your mommy was, or your greedy greedy granny that goes beep beep beep down Sesame Street.
[01:02:36.912 --> 01:02:40.174]  You don't know your head from a hole in the ground.
[01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:50.123]  All you know how to do is to be cowardly, pathetic failures who love it, and who want to make us join you in your servile weakness.
[01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:51.224]  Well, no thanks.
[01:02:52.898 --> 01:02:54.239]  You're like heavyweight.
[01:02:54.239 --> 01:02:57.381]  I've got a squat, or I've got a bench, or I've got a deadlift, or I've got a cling.
[01:02:57.381 --> 01:02:59.722]  You're like a mountain I've got to climb.
[01:02:59.722 --> 01:03:01.463]  You're there as an obstacle.
[01:03:01.463 --> 01:03:12.350]  Your weakness, your giant piles of fraud, your lies, your deception, your disdain for humanity, your hatred, your greediness, your insolence, is nothing but an obstacle to make me strong.
[01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.651]  You understand that?
[01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:16.433]  You're an inanimate, dead object.
[01:03:16.433 --> 01:03:18.974]  Like a boulder that I'm going to climb.
[01:03:18.974 --> 01:03:20.655]  And I'm going to climb you.
[01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:21.776]  And I'm going to make it past you.
[01:03:23.544 --> 01:03:29.330]  And you're not going to stop us in our long march to humanity's ultimate destiny.
[01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:31.652]  Oh, you never thought about an ultimate destiny?
[01:03:31.652 --> 01:03:33.314]  You don't like things like that.
[01:03:33.314 --> 01:03:35.436]  People want destinies.
[01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:37.358]  People want to do big things.
[01:03:37.358 --> 01:03:39.600]  I hate myself, so I hate you.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.386]  And I'm going to project it on you, and I'm going to screw up your life.
[01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:46.728]  Yeah, go ahead and try then.
[01:03:50.313 --> 01:03:53.694]  You were forged by your God to be weak.
[01:03:53.694 --> 01:03:56.695]  I wasn't made that way.
[01:03:56.695 --> 01:04:03.458]  And as weak as I am, because believe me, I'm only flesh and blood, I am transcendent compared to you people.
[01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:04.798]  I've already won.
[01:04:04.798 --> 01:04:12.761]  Thank Jesus Christ for that one.
[01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:18.704]  One of the devil's biggest tricks is selling the idea that Satanism gives you free will and empowerment.
[01:04:18.704 --> 01:04:19.224]  No, it doesn't.
[01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:22.148]  Christ gives you power.
[01:04:22.148 --> 01:04:23.608]  Christ gives you will.
[01:04:23.608 --> 01:04:25.048]  Christ gives you strength.
[01:04:25.048 --> 01:04:42.034]  And the churches, on purpose, sell this image of an incredibly weak Christ figure so that you don't understand the power that it took to lay down to all that weakness and that patheticness to a bunch of bugs.
[01:04:42.034 --> 01:04:43.674]  That was strength.
[01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:45.015]  That was honor.
[01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:45.595]  That was will.
[01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.966]  And to take on, at the same time, all of our weakness.
[01:04:50.966 --> 01:04:52.929]  And then to transcend it.
[01:04:52.929 --> 01:04:55.974]  That's the great animating contest.
[01:04:55.974 --> 01:04:57.877]  And we're only a shadow, an expression of that.
[01:04:59.213 --> 01:05:02.134]  All you pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news!
[01:05:02.134 --> 01:05:07.635]  Anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under Australian no-jab-no-pay law.
[01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:15.877]  The new changes that will take effect on January 1st, 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over $500 million over four years.
[01:05:15.877 --> 01:05:18.618]  And how many children are not receiving their vaccines?
[01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:21.498]  According to the Australian Childhood Immunization Register, it's 1.77%.
[01:05:24.039 --> 01:05:27.441]  I thought all you needed was 90% to have herd immunity.
[01:05:27.441 --> 01:05:33.666]  The government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption, it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health.
[01:05:33.666 --> 01:05:38.109]  But what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want.
[01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:40.390]  And they want to make sure you bend over and take it.
[01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:45.054]  A footnote in the article is that by 2020, childless couples will overtake those with children.
[01:05:45.054 --> 01:05:48.296]  Now I know where the next Muslim migrant invasion is going to take place.

[01:08:02.264 --> 01:08:08.886]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:11.867]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:28.134]  You know, I have mixed feelings about the next hour.
[01:08:28.134 --> 01:08:39.483]  Because I've studied DARPA, the government's advanced research laboratories, the Defense Department's advanced research programs.
[01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:47.189]  Eisenhower in 1961, when he gave his farewell address, we've played the full 21 minute address here many times.
[01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.892]  We've played the clip, in fact we ought to cue it up, where he talks about
[01:08:50.845 --> 01:09:16.899]  A technological elite in control of the military industrial complex creating a breakaway civilization and using these super advanced technologies to basically build back doors into all of the culture and society to create a brain trust that did not deploy that knowledge to the general public but kept it to itself as a way to gain total hegemonic power.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.101]  I haven't read this book yet.
[01:09:21.101 --> 01:09:27.885]  I just got it a few days ago, scanned over it this morning, looked at some of the pictures, read the synopsis, read the reviews.
[01:09:27.885 --> 01:09:29.246]  I've read some of the articles about it.
[01:09:29.246 --> 01:09:46.497]  And let me tell you, this weekend, when I go to the local pool with my kids, I'm going to be trying to sneak in an hour or so while they're swimming and fighting with each other or whatever, over floats, fighting friendly, trying to read this, because
[01:09:48.228 --> 01:09:49.349]  It's important.
[01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:52.971]  And you know, this show, we get into all this, we research it, we think we know it all.
[01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:58.174]  You read it all together, because I've already started reading it, it's just, you learn a lot from it.
[01:09:58.174 --> 01:10:00.536]  Because this is the real world.
[01:10:00.536 --> 01:10:08.281]  I mean, you think secret government programs ended with the Manhattan Project and the A-bomb, I will assure you that was just the beginning of the shadow government.
[01:10:08.281 --> 01:10:10.182]  And the National Security Act and the rest of it.
[01:10:10.182 --> 01:10:13.264]  I'll never forget, it was in the Baltimore Sun, I've talked about this many times,
[01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:24.900]  Eighteen years ago, and they talked about DARPA practicing, just testing in major cities through cell towers, putting out calming waves for the public.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.141]  Now, usually it's schizophrenics that have had heavy metal toxification.
[01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:35.704]  They're not actually under cell phone tower control, but I'd always heard that from people, and then they're always reading it in the paper, and I'm like, what is this?
[01:10:35.704 --> 01:10:38.585]  Is this something to condition me, to get me ready for this?
[01:10:38.585 --> 01:10:41.166]  So how deep does the rabbit hole really go?
[01:10:42.128 --> 01:10:46.929]  We're not selling this book, but it is a great pitch I'm giving it.
[01:10:46.929 --> 01:10:52.990]  The Pentagon's Brain and Uncensored History of DARPA, America's top secret military research agency.
[01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:59.531]  Annie Jacobson, author of the New York Times bestseller, Area 51 and Operation Paperclip.
[01:10:59.531 --> 01:11:11.093]  You know, I knew about Operation Paperclip, and I'm going to go to our guest, when I was about six or seven and my grandfather would be sitting there around his round kitchen table
[01:11:12.096 --> 01:11:19.859]  Talking about reentry devices and MIRV technology and space bases and Werner Von Braun and all the rest of it.
[01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:24.260]  And he would talk about damn Nazis because he was in World War II a pilot.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:29.882]  And how he would in Texas go to these military bases when he was doing work for
[01:11:31.718 --> 01:11:34.198]  DARPA, I've never been told all of it.
[01:11:34.198 --> 01:11:36.639]  It was basically crowd control robots and stuff.
[01:11:36.639 --> 01:11:38.679]  It was secret.
[01:11:38.679 --> 01:11:45.381]  And he would just talk about how much he hated Nazis because he got out of whatever it was because it was Nazis that he would run into.
[01:11:45.381 --> 01:11:48.581]  And I remember sitting around and my mom would be like, he's a little eccentric.
[01:11:48.581 --> 01:11:50.082]  My dad would be like, no, he's not eccentric.
[01:11:50.082 --> 01:11:51.382]  Your grandfather's really smart.
[01:11:51.382 --> 01:11:53.762]  But imagine you're six, seven years old hearing about Nazis at U.S.
[01:11:53.762 --> 01:11:54.822]  military bases.
[01:11:54.822 --> 01:11:57.143]  Believe me, it'll get your attention.
[01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:05.664]  But, that said, let's now move on to our guest, the Pentagon's brain, Annie Jacobson.
[01:12:05.664 --> 01:12:07.145]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:12:07.145 --> 01:12:08.766]  Congratulations on your new book.
[01:12:08.766 --> 01:12:10.407]  Oh wow, where does this start?
[01:12:10.407 --> 01:12:12.809]  I mean, where should we go talking about something as big as DARPA?
[01:12:14.395 --> 01:12:17.418]  Well, thank you so much for having me, and I loved that intro.
[01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:18.639]  Fascinating about the Nazis.
[01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:19.900]  So how about we start right there?
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.263]  How about I tell you a fascinating story about Nazis and DARPA?
[01:12:23.263 --> 01:12:25.404]  Let's do it!
[01:12:25.404 --> 01:12:31.750]  Okay, so the way I got interested in this book in the first place, I was finishing up my Operation Paperclip Nazi Scientist book.
[01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.371]  And I learned that there was a new agent.
[01:12:35.371 --> 01:12:42.193]  I was wondering what von Braun was doing in the 50s after he had kind of settled in and was building rockets for the government.
[01:12:42.193 --> 01:12:51.436]  And I learned that he was the first choice in 1958 for this brand new agency at the Pentagon called, it was then called ARPA.
[01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:52.436]  Now we know it as DARPA.
[01:12:53.129 --> 01:12:53.229]  Wow.
[01:13:21.334 --> 01:13:26.437]  And then they spun off and sent him over to NASA, I guess, and then he brought in Goddard and everybody else.
[01:13:26.437 --> 01:13:27.078]  Yes, yes.
[01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:33.902]  But here's another little Nazi link you might enjoy, which is that, you know, you spoke of the military-industrial complex.
[01:13:33.902 --> 01:13:36.203]  You've run Eisenhower's speech.
[01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:48.111]  So, specifically, Herb York, that chief scientist of DARPA, first chief scientist, wanted to know, he was troubled, he said in his memoirs, to whom Eisenhower was referring specifically.
[01:13:48.672 --> 01:14:00.518]  So when Eisenhower retired, Herb York went to go see him at Eisenhower's home here in the California desert and got him to say who specifically it was he was afraid of.
[01:14:00.518 --> 01:14:07.002]  And the two people he named were Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb, and Wernher von Braun.
[01:14:09.639 --> 01:14:13.501]  Wow, so much of our world has been shaped by these people.
[01:14:13.501 --> 01:14:14.961]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:14:14.961 --> 01:14:16.242]  That's why I can't wait to read your book.
[01:14:16.242 --> 01:14:20.764]  I'm greedily looking at it like it's a big cake I want to carve into.
[01:14:20.764 --> 01:14:25.186]  Accelerating into what got a lot of news, you were talking about DARPA and brain chips and troops.
[01:14:25.186 --> 01:14:26.947]  Tell us about that.
[01:14:26.947 --> 01:14:28.767]  Yes.
[01:14:28.767 --> 01:14:32.749]  So much of this book I wrote is really about man and machine.
[01:14:32.749 --> 01:14:34.870]  Man's relationship with machines.
[01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.932]  As we came out of World War II, technology just takes off.
[01:14:39.784 --> 01:14:56.352]  And when you get to the end of the book, you learn about this new future idea, which is actually very much part of the present, but is accelerating us into the future, which is the Pentagon, specifically DARPA's plan to couple man and machine.
[01:14:56.352 --> 01:15:01.834]  So that science fiction idea of cyborgs is now becoming a reality at the Pentagon.
[01:15:01.834 --> 01:15:04.335]  And by the way, this is all dogma.
[01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:07.417]  These are, you know, I pull quotes out of Pentagon
[01:15:08.363 --> 01:15:15.286]  Unclassified reports that talk about, we must accelerate our artificial intelligence weapon system.
[01:15:15.286 --> 01:15:19.789]  We must take advantage of this new brain technology.
[01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:25.512]  The Pentagon calls it neuroprosthetics, but, you know, you or I might call it brain chips.
[01:15:25.512 --> 01:15:34.456]  And those are the plans to begin these, and they are beginning these clinical trials where soldiers who have come back from Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.741]  With cognitive impairment.
[01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.862]  They're called brain-wounded warriors by the Pentagon.
[01:15:39.862 --> 01:15:53.870]  There's 300,000 of them who came home from those wars and in the clinical trials where they are now, they're putting these brain chips into the soft tissue of the brain to restore cognitive functioning.
[01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:55.090]  That's the plan.
[01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:58.472]  But what I also found in interviewing, for example, the Jason scientist, that
[01:16:01.441 --> 01:16:10.383]  The Pentagon is being advised this is not a good idea, and this is a direct quote, because it could lead to high-quality brain control.
[01:16:10.383 --> 01:16:12.404]  Wow.
[01:16:12.404 --> 01:16:13.064]  Direct quote.
[01:16:13.064 --> 01:16:17.465]  That is not Annie Jacobson's idea about what might happen.
[01:16:17.465 --> 01:16:21.666]  That's the Jason scientists who, by the way, have been advising DARPA
[01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:23.831]  Since 1960.
[01:16:23.831 --> 01:16:25.951]  I interviewed Murph Goldberger for the book.
[01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:29.893]  He was the co-founder of the Jason Scientist, and he just died.
[01:16:29.893 --> 01:16:39.836]  But he shared with me a lot of fascinating information about, you know, advising DARPA about what weapon systems to design over the decades.
[01:16:39.836 --> 01:16:42.617]  And then there were other futures depending on like Marshall and others.
[01:16:42.617 --> 01:16:44.298]  I want to try to walk through some of those, but...
[01:16:45.484 --> 01:16:50.947]  My issue with it is it's like Volkswagen putting cheating software on their emissions testing.
[01:16:50.947 --> 01:16:53.209]  The problem is my uncle was in a motorcycle accident.
[01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.530]  He has epilepsy from it.
[01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:58.052]  They gave him a brain chip and a stimulator.
[01:16:58.052 --> 01:17:00.073]  It's really helped his quality of life.
[01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:00.773]  I'm all for it.
[01:17:00.773 --> 01:17:01.774]  I'm not against technology.
[01:17:01.774 --> 01:17:14.822]  The problem is these companies and corporations always want to piggyback something into it and it's so complex that how do you stop Trojan horses or how do you stop hacks once we start taking brain chips?
[01:17:16.238 --> 01:17:18.379]  Well, absolutely, and this is the heart of the matter.
[01:17:18.379 --> 01:17:24.022]  It's the double-edged sword of these military systems that DARPA creates.
[01:17:24.022 --> 01:17:29.545]  Yes, there are these amazing benefits that make their way into the population.
[01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:31.406]  Watch the internet!
[01:17:31.406 --> 01:17:33.147]  Yes, and also like your uncle's brain chip.
[01:17:33.147 --> 01:17:37.189]  I mean, every side has two sides, in essence.
[01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:41.511]  But here's the thing, is that that which keeps you safe can also harm you.
[01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:45.233]  And so, for me, just as a journalist, I mean, my job is to inform the public.
[01:17:45.845 --> 01:17:57.248]  And so, it's like, and I love that you play Eisenhower's speech, because he says in that second part of his military-industrial complex speech, you know, these two ideas can live together.
[01:17:57.248 --> 01:17:59.508]  You can have a very strong military.
[01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.689]  You can have a necessary national defense.
[01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:08.870]  But it must be in balance with what he calls an alert and knowledgeable citizenry.
[01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:09.851]  And there's the rub.
[01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:15.472]  That's why people, it behooves them to know about these programs.
[01:18:15.768 --> 01:18:19.972]  These are not, you know, things of science fiction novels.
[01:18:19.972 --> 01:18:28.440]  Look, the DARPA director said just the other day at the Aspen Conference, everything is science fiction until it becomes real.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:28.821]  It is!
[01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:32.264]  Everything is magic until it becomes real.
[01:18:32.264 --> 01:18:37.269]  Yes, and the thing is that DARPA, because their job is to create revolution,
[01:18:38.064 --> 01:18:39.225]  In military affairs.
[01:18:39.225 --> 01:18:40.265]  Think about that word.
[01:18:40.265 --> 01:18:45.609]  I mean, a revolution is not a revolution if there's not an element of surprise.
[01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:50.252]  And so DARPA is working on weapon systems 20, 25 years out.
[01:18:50.252 --> 01:18:51.172]  They invented stealth.
[01:18:51.172 --> 01:18:54.875]  I mean, they didn't invent it, but their scientists created stealth.
[01:18:54.875 --> 01:19:03.020]  And then when stealth was unveiled during the Gulf War, you know, it took the enemy by surprise.
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:04.541]  So what's the, what is DARPA doing?
[01:19:05.169 --> 01:19:05.930]  Now.
[01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:16.737]  And when I show you in the book what DARPA is doing that's unclassified, that I was able to report on from interviewing scientists, you get to decide for yourself, okay, so what is really going on?
[01:19:18.766 --> 01:19:20.147]  Well, I can't wait to read the book.
[01:19:20.147 --> 01:19:21.828]  I'm going to come back from break.
[01:19:21.828 --> 01:19:24.450]  I want to just talk about what you think are some of the most important parts of the book.
[01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:28.713]  It is a big book, a lot of photos, a lot of diagrams, a lot of information.
[01:19:28.713 --> 01:19:30.895]  And, you know, for me, this is the real world.
[01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:33.256]  People talk about sports icons, Hollywood.
[01:19:33.256 --> 01:19:44.985]  It's all really boring when you realize that what we see with DARPA is only the tip of the iceberg of a giant, submerged, shadow technological system.
[01:19:44.985 --> 01:19:46.706]  And as you said, the stealth technology was 25, 30 years old.
[01:19:48.966 --> 01:19:53.328]  Uh, when they rolled it out in, you know, 1987, 1988.
[01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:55.890]  It's just amazing.
[01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:56.490]  We'll be back.
[01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:59.492]  Stay with us inside the Pentagon's brain.
[01:19:59.492 --> 01:20:01.653]  So listen up here, guys.
[01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:07.096]  My buddy Mark, he overhears the management team at Guns80.com.
[01:20:07.096 --> 01:20:16.041]  And what they're saying is that between now and Black Friday, they're gonna put a special on the website at Guns80.com every day.
[01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:24.607]  What that means is that you have to go to guns80.com every day to check out the specials between now and Black Friday.
[01:20:24.607 --> 01:20:29.010]  Go to guns80.com, but don't tell them you heard it from me.
[01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.012]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[01:20:31.012 --> 01:20:34.754]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.

[01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:15.426]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[01:22:15.426 --> 01:22:18.608]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[01:22:18.608 --> 01:22:21.849]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:27.012]  After consuming One World Weight today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[01:22:27.808 --> 01:22:34.430]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:37.251]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[01:22:37.251 --> 01:22:40.772]  The only thing I know I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.

[01:23:27.952 --> 01:23:30.993]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:23:30.993 --> 01:23:33.635]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:23:33.635 --> 01:23:34.375]  Croix River.
[01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:36.616]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:23:36.616 --> 01:23:39.577]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:23:39.577 --> 01:23:40.457]  His excuse?
[01:23:40.457 --> 01:23:41.778]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:23:41.778 --> 01:23:43.399]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[01:24:05.888 --> 01:24:07.029]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:24:07.029 --> 01:24:13.351]  Alex Jones here, broadcasting live on this Friday, the second day of October, 2015 broadcast.
[01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:16.693]  I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:24:16.693 --> 01:24:21.995]  Central, with the abbreviated two-hour live original broadcast as well.
[01:24:21.995 --> 01:24:29.298]  The Pentagon's brain, an uncensored history of DARPA, America's top secret military research agency, Annie Jacobson is our guest.
[01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:46.695]  And Gerald Posner, author of God's Bankers, said Annie Jacobson's considerable talents as an investigative journalist prove indispensable in uncovering the remarkable history of one of America's most powerful and clandestine military research agencies.
[01:24:46.695 --> 01:24:55.059]  And she is a great storyteller, making the tantalizing tale of the Pentagon's brain from the depths of the Cold War to the present day come alive on every page.
[01:24:55.059 --> 01:24:58.160]  You know, you've been nice, and kind of let me lead the interview at first, but
[01:24:59.031 --> 01:25:04.193]  You're the expert on this, and obviously the expert on your book.
[01:25:04.193 --> 01:25:05.553]  You heard my point going into break.
[01:25:05.553 --> 01:25:07.874]  I mean, this is a shadow government.
[01:25:07.874 --> 01:25:13.076]  It did basically become what Eisenhower warned about to a certain extent.
[01:25:13.076 --> 01:25:19.118]  And I think that adds the arrogance of Washington, because imagine what they've got they're not telling us about.
[01:25:19.118 --> 01:25:25.540]  But at a certain point, still it's just humans that are running this whole thing.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.080]  Yes.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.401]  Shall I tell you about one of the spooky programs?
[01:25:28.772 --> 01:25:30.233]  Yes, please.
[01:25:30.233 --> 01:25:41.077]  Okay, so we were talking about coupling man and machine, that's the goal for the future, but DARPA is already able to create what they call bio-hybrids.
[01:25:41.077 --> 01:25:46.819]  That is their actual term for it, and it's actually, it's like part animal, part machine.
[01:25:46.819 --> 01:25:52.342]  And this is now 12, 13 years old, this program, the success of it.
[01:25:52.342 --> 01:25:57.284]  So back in 2002, they had their first public success.
[01:25:57.284 --> 01:25:58.344]  DARPA scientists
[01:25:58.832 --> 01:26:00.393]  We're good to go.
[01:26:22.904 --> 01:26:31.228]  This process has been ongoing of coupling more animals with machines and just last year, DARPA scientists did the same thing with a moth.
[01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:39.132]  So they inserted the electrodes, these neuroprosthetics, into the moth when it was in its pupa stage.
[01:26:39.132 --> 01:26:40.173]  So think that through.
[01:26:40.173 --> 01:26:44.215]  It's like this incredible analogy of metamorphosis.
[01:26:44.215 --> 01:26:51.078]  So they put the electrodes in the pupa stage, the worm stage, and then the moth, you know, the wings blossom in essence.
[01:26:51.078 --> 01:26:52.279]  And now the
[01:26:53.055 --> 01:26:54.916]  Absolutely, it's the end of free will.
[01:27:19.517 --> 01:27:21.138]  You know, if you sign up for it.
[01:27:21.138 --> 01:27:22.839]  I mean, and I think that's the rub.
[01:27:22.839 --> 01:27:33.386]  I think that there's a lot to be said about being aware of how these military applications, you know, are or not are not appropriate.
[01:27:33.386 --> 01:27:36.989]  The government calls it a super soldier program.
[01:27:36.989 --> 01:27:37.889]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:44.074]  Giving war fighters enhanced cognition, enhanced physiology.
[01:27:44.989 --> 01:27:47.970]  Sure, we all know there's governors lifting weights or marching.
[01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:52.512]  They can just flip a switch and you can march a hundred miles.
[01:27:52.512 --> 01:28:00.496]  Or you can wear the super suit, which by the way, DARPA has teamed up with special forces now to create this Palo super suit.
[01:28:00.496 --> 01:28:02.357]  I mean, it has, it, you know, it does everything.
[01:28:02.357 --> 01:28:06.459]  It even has like blood hemorrhage control mechanisms inside of it.
[01:28:06.459 --> 01:28:06.959]  Good God.
[01:28:09.175 --> 01:28:15.418]  But you have to ask yourself, where it's really going toward is a concept called transhumanism.
[01:28:15.418 --> 01:28:33.728]  This idea, and people who are pro-transhumanism believe that it's actually a good idea, that why not, why shouldn't man, with all his intelligence, all his technology, all his science, be able to kind of control his own evolution by merging himself with machines?
[01:28:33.728 --> 01:28:36.190]  But of course many other people think this is a really bad idea.
[01:28:36.803 --> 01:28:47.647]  Well, I'm not against it in general, but the elite we have basically sheep-dipped eugenics, as you know, at the end of World War II, because Hitler gave it a bad name, and turned it into transhumanism.
[01:28:47.647 --> 01:28:52.589]  I'm not saying transhumanists are all eugenicists, but that's what it came from.
[01:28:52.589 --> 01:28:57.831]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, at the UN wrote papers admitting all this.
[01:28:57.831 --> 01:29:03.533]  So, my problem is, a lot of the elite want to use this for population control, not to empower people.
[01:29:04.193 --> 01:29:13.039]  And so I don't see us being given a choice, as Ray Kurzweil says, well, you may not be augmented, but you'll be like a bug, basically.
[01:29:13.039 --> 01:29:16.642]  I mean, look, this is definitely something worth discussing.
[01:29:16.642 --> 01:29:22.246]  I think that's the whole point is that, you know, just to kind of like ignore it all is a bit like putting
[01:29:22.799 --> 01:29:27.021]  Your head in the sand like an ostrich and leaving your neck exposed.
[01:29:27.021 --> 01:29:32.403]  I mean, you want, you, people, want to be aware of what is going on.
[01:29:32.403 --> 01:29:34.004]  Annie Jacobson, stay there.
[01:29:34.004 --> 01:29:34.744]  Stay there.
[01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:35.724]  We've got to go to break.
[01:29:35.724 --> 01:29:36.145]  Absolutely.
[01:29:36.145 --> 01:29:40.867]  Let's come back and discuss that and walk through it because we're talking about the whole future of the world here.
[01:29:40.867 --> 01:29:43.528]  AnnieJacobson.com is her website.
[01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:45.749]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:29:45.749 --> 01:29:46.669]  We're talking about reality.
[01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:52.313]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.313 --> 01:29:59.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.616 --> 01:30:06.239]  While ISIS threatens to attack the U.S., a record number of illegal immigrants are flooding into the country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities.
[01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:10.341]  Barely a week after the November 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, France, the U.S.
[01:30:10.341 --> 01:30:15.784]  Border Patrol revealed that nearly 3,000 unaccompanied children were caught crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks.
[01:30:16.204 --> 01:30:20.085]  But just think of how many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting caught.
[01:30:20.085 --> 01:30:21.926]  It's probably at least 10 times more.
[01:30:21.926 --> 01:30:29.708]  Speaking on the subject, House Representative Duncan Hunter said, quote, The greatest existential threat to this nation right now is this administration's open border policy.
[01:30:29.708 --> 01:30:31.008]  Hunter is speaking the truth.
[01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:36.850]  ISIS is likely already exploiting President Obama's open border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country.
[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:38.932]  But here's something else you may not realize.
[01:30:38.932 --> 01:30:46.199]  Human traffickers are also taking advantage of Obama's open borders to enslave women around the world and import them as sex slaves into the U.S.
[01:30:46.199 --> 01:30:50.422]  In other words, Obama's lax enforcement of immigration laws is fueling a war on women.

[01:33:00.829 --> 01:33:10.734]  I've thought about this probably more deeply than any other subject because it is the subject.
[01:33:27.808 --> 01:33:35.455]  Shadow government, shadow technology, super technology, super science that was science fiction is now reality.
[01:33:35.455 --> 01:33:52.530]  And just from my own family experiences with my grandfather and then some other members of the family, I know there are huge secret government programs going on that are way more 20, 30, 40, 50 years in advance, depending on the science of what we even know about.
[01:33:54.739 --> 01:34:00.902]  And we understand that from television and so many of these other technologies, it's dumbing us down.
[01:34:00.902 --> 01:34:03.122]  Our physical IQ is dropping.
[01:34:03.122 --> 01:34:11.046]  So that's not just the nurture, it's the nature as well.
[01:34:11.046 --> 01:34:15.988]  Humanity is falling apart in many respects.
[01:34:15.988 --> 01:34:19.109]  And so the answers to our future could be in the technology.
[01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:24.151]  The problem is elites are very predatory on average historically, and they're using it to control.
[01:34:27.873 --> 01:34:35.759]  And everything they're doing is about ending free will and making us take what the government wants into our bodies, i.e.
[01:34:35.759 --> 01:34:36.759]  vaccines.
[01:34:36.759 --> 01:34:40.562]  They act like we're against vaccine technology because we're just ignorant hillbillies.
[01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:48.627]  No, we know about all the recalls, the problems, the additives, the immunity of the vaccine makers, the fact they want to make a hundred and something vaccines mandatory.
[01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:54.767]  We know it's linked to major problems, and then they just sell this thing of, it's science, take it.
[01:34:54.767 --> 01:34:56.568]  And GMO, it's science, eat it.
[01:34:56.568 --> 01:34:57.829]  Oh really, I got all these studies.
[01:34:57.829 --> 01:34:58.809]  Shut up and take it.
[01:34:58.809 --> 01:35:01.731]  You know, glyphosate, never hurt anybody, you can drink it.
[01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:02.831]  Okay, lobbyists, drink it.
[01:35:02.831 --> 01:35:07.654]  I'm not going to drink that.
[01:35:07.654 --> 01:35:12.056]  So that's my problem, is so many of these corporate leaders are delusional.
[01:35:13.018 --> 01:35:14.558]  They're on power trips.
[01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:16.119]  They're narcissistic.
[01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:20.879]  And who wouldn't be with billions of dollars in helicopters and all the power you want?
[01:35:20.879 --> 01:35:23.520]  And hey, I get a Manhattan Project to live forever.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.640]  That's really what this is.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.161]  The Manhattan Project for eternal life.
[01:35:27.161 --> 01:35:37.423]  They're just using the Pentagon and all of these operations as the focused, compartmentalized template to siphon off the goodies.
[01:35:37.423 --> 01:35:39.223]  And what happens when they do
[01:35:40.422 --> 01:35:40.822]  I think so.
[01:35:56.087 --> 01:35:59.410]  The ones that'll talk to me, they say, yeah, you're right.
[01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:03.755]  When I go to these big meetings and I go to these big events, I've talked to folks that have been to Bilderberg.
[01:36:03.755 --> 01:36:08.680]  They go, we discuss, why haven't we just released a bioweapon and wiped everybody out?
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.024]  Because, you know, the profane public doesn't deserve all this.
[01:36:12.024 --> 01:36:14.706]  Only us, these ascended gods deserve it.
[01:36:15.407 --> 01:36:17.350]  So, that's being discussed.
[01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:18.292]  You need to understand that.
[01:36:18.292 --> 01:36:20.835]  Now, that's a pretty heavy talk.
[01:36:20.835 --> 01:36:22.498]  Annie Jacobson is our guest.
[01:36:22.498 --> 01:36:24.000]  AnnieJacobson.com.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.524]  The new book, The Pentagon's Brain.
[01:36:26.524 --> 01:36:30.830]  So, I've set the table now, and I'm going to try to give you the floor to really walk through all this.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.262]  I've laid out my fears, my concerns, where this is going.
[01:36:35.262 --> 01:36:39.924]  The elite already kind of act like they've had some major breakthroughs and we don't exist anymore.
[01:36:39.924 --> 01:36:40.765]  They don't even really care.
[01:36:40.765 --> 01:36:42.866]  Their propaganda doesn't work anymore.
[01:36:42.866 --> 01:36:51.811]  And I'm seeing a lot of digging in, a lot of bunkers being built, a lot of elites running off that find out about this, to armored redoubts in New Zealand.
[01:36:51.811 --> 01:36:53.592]  I talked about this a decade ago.
[01:36:53.592 --> 01:36:54.353]  It's now in the news.
[01:36:55.453 --> 01:37:04.698]  Whatever the billionaires, whatever the top technicians that are given entry into this are being told makes them cry.
[01:37:04.698 --> 01:37:10.301]  So, kind of a heavy interview, Annie, but where do you want to go with that?
[01:37:10.301 --> 01:37:17.424]  Well, let's talk about fear for a moment and narrative because, you know, you and I are in the same business in essence.
[01:37:17.424 --> 01:37:19.566]  I mean, I inform the public and so do you.
[01:37:19.566 --> 01:37:21.847]  That's the job of the journalist, okay?
[01:37:21.847 --> 01:37:24.128]  So, what I found really
[01:37:25.365 --> 01:37:28.468]  Just at the edge of sinister.
[01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:31.571]  Trying to maintain objectivity, I find that word, okay?
[01:37:31.571 --> 01:37:37.756]  So, because DARPA now has a program that has to do with trust.
[01:37:37.756 --> 01:37:52.189]  And it seems to have been born out of this idea that at the Pentagon, as the Pentagon is moving toward autonomous robots, toward hunter-killer robots, as we've been talking about, merging man and machine, merging animal and machine,
[01:37:52.682 --> 01:37:57.864]  Yeah, we need to build a world for humans and not just give ourselves over to it until we know it works properly.
[01:38:18.358 --> 01:38:26.022]  Yes, and these are actually individuals inside the military establishment saying, you know, the probability and consequences of failure are too great.
[01:38:26.022 --> 01:38:26.842]  We don't want to go there.
[01:38:26.842 --> 01:38:40.049]  And so what does the Defense Science Board, so you talk about the elite, I'll tell you, the Defense Science Board is a group of elite advisors in the Pentagon that very few people have heard of, DSB.
[01:38:40.049 --> 01:38:43.911]  And they advise both the President and they advise the Pentagon.
[01:38:43.911 --> 01:38:45.812]  And the DSB looks at this idea
[01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:52.476]  Uh, about mistrusting robots, and they say, this attitude must change.
[01:38:52.476 --> 01:39:00.123]  We must have, they call unambiguously for the rapid acceleration and the development of these AI weapon systems.
[01:39:00.123 --> 01:39:01.364]  Okay, hold that thought.
[01:39:01.364 --> 01:39:10.532]  Separate from that, right around the same time, DARPA teams up with IARPA, which is the CIA's DARPA, so it stands for Intelligence
[01:39:11.135 --> 01:39:13.116]  Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[01:39:13.116 --> 01:39:18.339]  And they begin a program, and this is where I talk to you about fear and about narrative.
[01:39:18.339 --> 01:39:21.440]  It's called Narrative Networks, N2.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:31.745]  And they're looking at how to develop techniques, this is language from them, to look at the effects of narrative on human cognition.
[01:39:31.745 --> 01:39:34.646]  To look at the effects of how people can be influenced.
[01:39:34.646 --> 01:39:37.508]  But specifically, they're looking at it through chemical means.
[01:39:37.508 --> 01:39:39.789]  And this is what I found sinister.
[01:39:40.865 --> 01:39:47.851]  There's a chemical in the brain called oxytocin, and it's often called the moral molecule.
[01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:53.096]  It's released, I'll give you an example, when a mother is breastfeeding, oxytocin is released.
[01:39:53.096 --> 01:39:57.981]  That's that ultimate bond of trust between mother and breastfeeding child, okay?
[01:39:57.981 --> 01:39:59.282]  Oxytocin.
[01:39:59.282 --> 01:40:07.189]  Well, DARPA has a program to look at oxytocin and see how it can be used in terms of trust.
[01:40:07.734 --> 01:40:21.486]  Separate from that, a researcher in Germany told Scientific American recently that she did a study injecting oxytocin in the nose of 64 men to see if she could erase fear.
[01:40:21.486 --> 01:40:23.547]  And she said that's exactly what happened.
[01:40:23.547 --> 01:40:28.812]  So you have to ask yourself, what is going on with this idea of getting rid of fear?
[01:40:31.035 --> 01:40:32.516]  Well, I've got the answer to DARPA.
[01:40:32.516 --> 01:40:41.643]  If you just get your life together and get a purpose-driven life to stand up for honor and good people, I can dose myself immediately and I have no fear knowing I'm doing it for children.
[01:40:41.643 --> 01:40:43.524]  I mean, that's why they always say it's for the children.
[01:40:43.524 --> 01:40:44.365]  It's for the children.
[01:40:44.365 --> 01:40:49.849]  They know with psych warfare terms how to get us to release that, at least people that are moral and manipulate us.
[01:40:49.849 --> 01:40:52.531]  So, this is so advanced.
[01:40:52.531 --> 01:40:53.872]  There's obviously chemical warfare.
[01:40:54.372 --> 01:40:56.595]  Going on through so many of the additives.
[01:40:56.595 --> 01:40:57.736]  I know you're an investigative journalist.
[01:40:57.736 --> 01:41:00.619]  You don't go off into that, but I can pull articles up and show you right now.
[01:41:00.619 --> 01:41:01.620]  You're highly informed.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.923]  Undoubtedly, everything we're being told about is...
[01:41:05.249 --> 01:41:08.130]  Super ancient in modern terms.
[01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:09.790]  You know, 10 years ago it was ancient.
[01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:20.933]  I remember seeing science papers when I was a kid, you know, laying around the house of like roaches that had silicon microchips they could control.
[01:41:20.933 --> 01:41:21.433]  Yes.
[01:41:21.433 --> 01:41:24.133]  So DARPA talks about RoboRat being 12 years old.
[01:41:24.133 --> 01:41:26.074]  That's their rollout of RoboRat.
[01:41:26.074 --> 01:41:27.214]  Yes.
[01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:28.314]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:41:28.314 --> 01:41:29.434]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:29.434 --> 01:41:31.255]  I mean, you're talking, what is going on 10, 25,
[01:41:32.802 --> 01:41:33.402]  We're good.
[01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:54.155]  And yet, you know, in 1968, there were these two drone systems called Night Panther and Night Gazelle, okay?
[01:41:54.155 --> 01:42:01.821]  And yet, most people think drones made an appearance on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2002.
[01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:13.329]  I know, my grandfather sold it, and then it was classified, but he sold a crowd control robot that he developed at Fort Hood to the Pentagon in like the 70s.
[01:42:15.271 --> 01:42:18.394]  Mmm, that was part of the non-lethal weapons program.
[01:42:18.394 --> 01:42:19.976]  That was crowd control.
[01:42:19.976 --> 01:42:25.502]  That was born out of, you know, what are we going to do about these Vietnam protesters?
[01:42:25.502 --> 01:42:29.747]  Absolutely, and then Vietnam ended so they didn't buy them.
[01:42:29.747 --> 01:42:31.729]  But those non-lethal weapons have continued.
[01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:33.711]  Those really have a lot to do with crowd control.
[01:42:35.512 --> 01:42:58.153]  They were, you know, where they were developed, many of the laboratories were actually in Saigon during the war, in Thailand during the war, because it was much easier to keep them far away from the public and disguise them as if they were being used, you know, against, you know, the Viet Cong in Vietnam, when in fact, as I report in the book, they were actually being designed for use back home.
[01:42:59.133 --> 01:43:18.874]  I covered a story about 16, 17 years ago, the Sunshine Project out of UT, a professor, and this was one of the only times we actually got visited and then they agreed to reclassify and they shut down the Sunshine Project, but this was drones to be used to deploy chemicals for crowd control across the United States.
[01:43:18.874 --> 01:43:20.016]  Did you ever run into anything like that?
[01:43:22.088 --> 01:43:23.149]  Well, I didn't run in.
[01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.929]  That's interesting.
[01:43:23.929 --> 01:43:25.550]  Drones dropping chemicals.
[01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:34.316]  I mean, I learned about them, the DARPA program, that had to do with kind of like shooting them out of cannons or conventional weapons.
[01:43:34.316 --> 01:43:42.662]  But obviously, helicopter pilots might say no to spray a hallucinogen on Austin, Texas or an opiate knockout gas.
[01:43:42.662 --> 01:43:44.063]  The problem is it causes a lot of fatalities.
[01:43:44.063 --> 01:43:46.284]  There's a car wrecks and fires and stuff like that.
[01:43:46.284 --> 01:43:47.745]  That's why they call it unethical.
[01:43:47.745 --> 01:43:48.646]  They keep it classified.
[01:43:48.646 --> 01:43:51.628]  But they declassified this and then they reclassified it.
[01:43:52.828 --> 01:43:53.009]  Wow.
[01:43:53.009 --> 01:43:53.629]  Wow.
[01:44:11.676 --> 01:44:12.056]  Wow.
[01:44:12.056 --> 01:44:13.458]  Yeah, it's that Wayback Machine.
[01:44:13.458 --> 01:44:14.499]  I found some stuff that way.
[01:44:14.499 --> 01:44:15.240]  That is interesting.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.584]  I mean, and how ironic that the internet used to be called the ARPANET.
[01:44:19.584 --> 01:44:19.864]  Yes.
[01:44:19.864 --> 01:44:22.066]  Because it is a DARPA invention.
[01:44:22.066 --> 01:44:23.207]  Yeah.
[01:44:23.207 --> 01:44:28.833]  Well, I just don't get why they'd have UT shut it down, and the Sunshine Project shut it down, and have us shut it down, and then they just left it on Google.
[01:44:30.151 --> 01:44:31.753]  Well, they might not be able to get rid of it.
[01:44:31.753 --> 01:44:33.857]  I mean, that is what is interesting, you know.
[01:44:33.857 --> 01:44:39.144]  There are little stories about that all the time, about researchers finding documents in, say, the National Archives.
[01:44:39.144 --> 01:44:43.431]  I write about one of them, this giant program for the apocalypse.
[01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:45.193]  It was called the Doomsday Project.
[01:44:46.007 --> 01:45:03.123]  You know, a researcher uncovers it, makes it public, then the Department of Defense steps in, reclassifies it, but it's still out there, as it should be, and so there's really nothing that the government can do about it at that point once it's on the internet as a PDF file or as part of the Wayback Machine.
[01:45:06.095 --> 01:45:12.803]  What about, I haven't read your book yet, I'm reading it this weekend, as I said, if folks just tuned in, we're talking to the Pentagon's brain author Annie Jacobson.
[01:45:12.803 --> 01:45:17.008]  What about other governments and their DARPAs or their ARPAs?
[01:45:17.008 --> 01:45:19.632]  What's your expert take on that?
[01:45:19.632 --> 01:45:25.539]  Well, again, there's where you have to really acknowledge that DARPA is a major force.
[01:45:26.415 --> 01:45:30.397]  And it's a major significant force for Americans for national security.
[01:45:30.397 --> 01:45:32.678]  I mean, you must give credit where credit is due.
[01:45:32.678 --> 01:45:38.161]  The agency was created when the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik.
[01:45:38.161 --> 01:45:42.283]  And in all these decades since, DARPA has done its job.
[01:45:42.283 --> 01:45:45.045]  We've never been taken by technological surprise.
[01:45:45.045 --> 01:45:55.110]  And you can be sure that there is a goal by other enemy nations, be it Russia or China, or even a dark horse like Saudi Arabia, I've been told.
[01:45:55.549 --> 01:46:07.536]  To try to break one of these major barriers, artificial intelligence, cloning, to embarrass the United States and, you know, kind of score that propaganda coup.
[01:46:07.536 --> 01:46:17.901]  Russia has its own DARPA, and in a couple statements, its defense minister has actually said, you know, something along the lines of, our DARPA is better than your DARPA.
[01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:25.005]  There's this sinister menace idea that, you know, one day they're going to come out with their revolution in technology.
[01:46:27.401 --> 01:46:30.142]  Well, I tell you, America has been exceptional in many ways.
[01:46:30.142 --> 01:46:31.523]  Putin says you're not exceptional.
[01:46:31.523 --> 01:46:35.025]  We've been exceptionally decadent, exceptionally had other problems.
[01:46:35.025 --> 01:46:37.946]  We've also done a lot of exceptional things in a good way.
[01:46:37.946 --> 01:46:48.151]  And there's no way to doubt that America's free market system, coupled with corporate and government coordination, has led the new renaissance.
[01:46:48.931 --> 01:46:54.538]  But there's just such an attitude of statist in people to not deploy that renaissance to the people.
[01:46:54.538 --> 01:46:56.601]  And I think that's DARPA's biggest failure.
[01:46:56.601 --> 01:46:57.922]  They did deploy the internet.
[01:46:57.922 --> 01:47:01.627]  Now they wish, according to Jay Rockefeller and others, they never would have.
[01:47:01.627 --> 01:47:06.333]  So I guess maybe that's why they're scared, is that they don't want to give Promethean fire to the public.
[01:47:07.623 --> 01:47:08.463]  Mm-hmm.
[01:47:08.463 --> 01:47:10.444]  Well, you know, that's an interesting point you're making.
[01:47:10.444 --> 01:47:12.385]  Look at GPS technology, okay?
[01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:21.128]  Researching this book, I was really surprised to learn that GPS technology goes back to DARPA's first year in 1958 when they put satellites up.
[01:47:21.128 --> 01:47:23.289]  So it was originally targeting technology.
[01:47:23.289 --> 01:47:24.029]  I mean, think about it.
[01:47:24.029 --> 01:47:24.949]  Of course it was.
[01:47:24.949 --> 01:47:25.370]  Artillery.
[01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:26.730]  Right?
[01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:31.492]  Yes, it was like once laser-guided bombs made an appearance in the end of the Vietnam War,
[01:47:32.108 --> 01:47:37.191]  Now you could have this GPS coordinates, but you say, how did it get into the public?
[01:47:37.191 --> 01:47:41.213]  So the story goes like this, you know, it's secret.
[01:47:41.213 --> 01:47:44.955]  It was actually very easy to hack into, believe it or not.
[01:47:44.955 --> 01:47:52.820]  And so the military created a feature called Selective Availability, and it was essentially an offset by several hundred feet.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:59.524]  So if somebody hacked into the military's GPS system to drop a bomb, in essence, or target something, they would be off by a couple hundred feet.
[01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:14.161]  Well, during the Clinton administration, word came in that Europe was going to develop, you know, sort of copy American military GPS and make the system public, and obviously have a huge industry around it.
[01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:21.484]  And so Clinton declassified DARPA's GPS program, got rid of the FA feature, that offset feature,
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:22.900]  And made it public.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:29.443]  And now the benefits of that are in, you know, the American system, the monetary system.
[01:48:29.443 --> 01:48:29.903]  Look at Google.
[01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:33.325]  But they only do it when somebody else is going to innovate.
[01:48:33.325 --> 01:48:33.885]  They have to.
[01:48:33.885 --> 01:48:37.566]  That's why we need to keep national sovereignty and not have a global government.
[01:48:37.566 --> 01:48:43.609]  I believe a global government will be the beginning of a new dark age because there'll be no incentive to innovate.
[01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:47.230]  And of course, that goes right along with my idea, which is just educate the people.
[01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:48.711]  I mean, just know what is going on.
[01:48:48.711 --> 01:48:49.291]  Be alert.
[01:48:49.719 --> 01:48:50.939]  And knowledgeable.
[01:48:50.939 --> 01:48:54.621]  People often think that they, you know, well what does that do?
[01:48:54.621 --> 01:49:09.846]  I mean, you and I both know from being in the business of information that, you know, what you look at, what you read, your eyeballs, all of that gets paid attention to and it all matters and it all has an effect.
[01:49:09.846 --> 01:49:12.647]  And I believe absolutely to my core
[01:49:13.143 --> 01:49:13.724]  That's it.
[01:49:13.724 --> 01:49:13.884]  Exactly.
[01:49:13.884 --> 01:49:15.305]  We become what we ingest, what we look at.
[01:49:25.622 --> 01:49:29.927]  I know it keeps the public busy to have them watch football all day, but man, these people are stupid.
[01:49:29.927 --> 01:49:31.289]  I mean, I get folks that like football.
[01:49:31.289 --> 01:49:35.493]  I played football, but that's not... Men I talk to, that's all they talk about.
[01:49:35.493 --> 01:49:37.375]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:38.957]  I didn't grow up around that.
[01:49:38.957 --> 01:49:43.381]  And, you know, hell, my grandfather played, you know, football with, you know, folks like...
[01:49:43.982 --> 01:49:45.042]  Tom Landry at UT.
[01:49:45.042 --> 01:49:46.563]  I'm not against football.
[01:49:46.563 --> 01:49:47.243]  I played football.
[01:49:47.243 --> 01:49:48.684]  My dad played football.
[01:49:48.684 --> 01:49:57.087]  It's just it's so weird where that's our culture when American culture really was about inventions, trailblazing, exploration.
[01:49:57.087 --> 01:50:03.930]  And so I have a love-hate relationship with DARPA because it seems so Americana, so good, so innovative, so wonderful.
[01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:06.631]  But then it's got a dark side.
[01:50:06.631 --> 01:50:09.051]  Well, you know, don't get me wrong.
[01:50:09.051 --> 01:50:10.052]  I interviewed 75
[01:50:11.058 --> 01:50:38.125]  Scientists and engineers uniquely affiliated with DARPA programs going back to the agency's beginning and almost the 100% majority raves about DARPA for this very American ideal of excellence that they say all these scientists say look DARPA gave me money let me give you an example there's a limb regeneration lab yes I said that correctly a limb regeneration lab here at UC and
[01:50:38.670 --> 01:50:47.496]  Uh, Irvine, where scientists are working because they believe 25, 30 years out, humans will be able to regrow their limbs if they can do the research.
[01:50:47.496 --> 01:50:48.556]  Annie Jacobsen, stay there.
[01:50:48.556 --> 01:50:49.657]  Final segment, riveting.
[01:50:49.657 --> 01:50:55.040]  I want to come back with some of the incredible things they're looking at, what they could be deploying.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:55.761]  Just amazing.
[01:50:55.761 --> 01:50:56.982]  What's the next big revolution?
[01:50:56.982 --> 01:50:57.362]  Stay with us.

[01:54:03.243 --> 01:54:14.168]  Final segment with our guests, we have Peter Schiff joining us on the really bad jobs and unemployment and economic numbers.
[01:54:14.168 --> 01:54:16.108]  And the bottom line is, this is nothing new to our audience.
[01:54:16.108 --> 01:54:21.371]  This is what quantitative easing brought to us by the technocrats the Federal Reserve is going to do.
[01:54:21.371 --> 01:54:22.211]  It's a rigged economy.
[01:54:23.490 --> 01:54:30.258]  Brings some final comments from my guest, who I hope will come back as an expert on Operation Paperclip and Area 51 and do an interview about some of her previous books.
[01:54:30.258 --> 01:54:32.160]  Can't wait to read the book, The Pentagon's Brain.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:36.686]  We'll talk with Annie Jacobson here in just a moment, AnnieJacobson.com.
[01:54:36.686 --> 01:54:38.528]  Briefly, it's been sold out for months.
[01:54:39.309 --> 01:54:41.850]  It is now back in stock, but not for long.
[01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:42.991]  That's not a sales tactic.
[01:54:42.991 --> 01:54:46.052]  People love our products, love our nutraceuticals.
[01:54:46.052 --> 01:54:47.052]  They're game changers.
[01:54:47.052 --> 01:54:48.053]  They're super high quality.
[01:54:48.053 --> 01:54:50.534]  They have 4.8 reviews out of 5.
[01:54:50.534 --> 01:55:02.679]  That's basically the highest reviews you're going to find on Power Reviews and other big third-party respected sites, because it's concentrated, hardcore herbs, in the case of liver shield, that are known to have detoxifying effects.
[01:55:03.459 --> 01:55:13.334]  You do it with the oxy powder and the apple cider vinegar and the olive oil on the sixth day with the epsom salts and well you've heard what callers have said.
[01:55:13.334 --> 01:55:15.136]  We have informational videos about it.
[01:55:15.136 --> 01:55:16.519]  I'm not going to go into details here.
[01:55:16.519 --> 01:55:18.041]  Infowarslife.com
[01:55:19.775 --> 01:55:22.976]  For me, at least, it was explosive.
[01:55:22.976 --> 01:55:26.478]  And certainly made me feel a lot better, have a lot more energy.
[01:55:26.478 --> 01:55:27.258]  It's amazing.
[01:55:27.258 --> 01:55:29.699]  Some people, you know, they feel pretty bad, too.
[01:55:29.699 --> 01:55:31.199]  I mean, it's not a joke.
[01:55:31.199 --> 01:55:32.220]  It's real.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:37.362]  Consult a health care provider, medical person, you know, before you do it.
[01:55:37.362 --> 01:55:40.183]  But it's generally recognized as safe.
[01:55:40.183 --> 01:55:44.665]  It's all FDA grass certified, you know, stuff that they say is safe herbs.
[01:55:44.665 --> 01:55:47.106]  The point is, together, in conjunction, it's not a game.
[01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:47.746]  It's not a joke.
[01:55:48.126 --> 01:55:50.369]  We don't sell stuff that's a placebo or a joke.
[01:55:50.369 --> 01:55:52.010]  We sell stuff that's the real deal.
[01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:54.513]  So again, InfoWars is a good free market idea.
[01:55:54.513 --> 01:55:56.535]  People keep buying it.
[01:55:56.535 --> 01:55:56.836]  Wow!
[01:55:56.836 --> 01:55:57.917]  Old-fashioned ideas.
[01:55:57.917 --> 01:55:58.878]  Wow!
[01:55:58.878 --> 01:56:01.240]  So InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:04.964 --> 01:56:17.155]  And we've got a lot of great pro-liberty t-shirts, a lot of other great films, books, just over 600 items now on InfoWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:56:17.155 --> 01:56:24.621]  And also, again, I just want to add to folks, we will be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with the Sunday transmission.
[01:56:24.621 --> 01:56:26.022]  But a whole other hour is coming up.
[01:56:26.022 --> 01:56:26.943]  I meant to go to calls.
[01:56:26.943 --> 01:56:27.844]  I meant to give the number out.
[01:56:27.844 --> 01:56:30.947]  I just hogged the time with our guests and didn't, so I apologize.
[01:56:30.947 --> 01:56:32.188]  We'll open phones up with Schiff.
[01:56:32.728 --> 01:56:35.950]  In the next hour with your economic comments or questions at 800-259-9231.
[01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:42.315]  Well, Annie, I'm impressed with your book that I've read so far, just 30 pages or so.
[01:56:42.315 --> 01:56:43.076]  I'm impressed with you.
[01:56:43.076 --> 01:56:44.497]  I want to read your other books.
[01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.638]  We've got about three minutes left.
[01:56:45.638 --> 01:56:49.240]  In closing, what are some of the other big advances that are coming out of DARPA?
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.742]  I mean, people talk about NASA and all these inventions.
[01:56:51.742 --> 01:56:52.783]  Isn't most of it DARPA?
[01:56:54.815 --> 01:56:55.916]  Most of it is DARPA.
[01:56:55.916 --> 01:56:59.681]  I mean, DARPA, for example, has a robot that will go to Mars.
[01:56:59.681 --> 01:57:04.687]  It's called Valkyrie, and NASA designed it for DARPA Challenge.
[01:57:04.687 --> 01:57:09.693]  But it's going to go to Mars and act like an avatar, so it'll be controlled back here on Earth.
[01:57:11.024 --> 01:57:18.146]  Valkyrie robot will be on Mars, ideally, building a habitat which then the humans will go into.
[01:57:18.146 --> 01:57:22.308]  So there's no doubt that DARPA is so future-thinking.
[01:57:22.308 --> 01:57:25.649]  DARPA likes to say DARPA makes the future happen.
[01:57:25.649 --> 01:57:36.813]  But, again, people just will really benefit from having a handle on what that future may or may not look like because the one
[01:57:37.737 --> 01:57:48.606]  Really spooky element of all of this that I came to was learning at the end of my book how, you know, defense contractors have become advisors to DARPA.
[01:57:48.606 --> 01:57:55.612]  And that's a real problem because it, you know, it's what Eisenhower warned against with the military-industrial complex.
[01:57:55.612 --> 01:58:03.779]  When you have a closed loop, when the guys who are actually making money building these robotic systems, building these drones,
[01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:11.342]  Are the ones who are advising the Pentagon to create more drones, create a system of robotic warfare.
[01:58:11.342 --> 01:58:12.843]  So they are controlling the future.
[01:58:12.843 --> 01:58:13.984]  They're not just getting the money.
[01:58:13.984 --> 01:58:14.885]  Absolutely.
[01:58:14.885 --> 01:58:18.488]  They are now controlling the evolution of human development.
[01:58:18.488 --> 01:58:19.248]  Well, absolutely.
[01:58:19.248 --> 01:58:23.552]  And this is literally science fact, not science fiction.
[01:58:23.552 --> 01:58:29.236]  And it's why it's worth being an alert and knowledgeable citizen.
[01:58:29.236 --> 01:58:29.756]  Amazing.
[01:58:29.756 --> 01:58:31.178]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:31.178 --> 01:58:32.318]  I'm going to read your book.
[01:58:32.318 --> 01:58:33.339]  Hopefully you'll join us again.
[01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:34.060]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:35.231 --> 01:58:35.471]  Anytime.
[01:58:35.471 --> 01:58:36.573]  Thanks for having me.
[01:58:36.573 --> 01:58:36.793]  Wow.
[01:58:36.793 --> 01:58:37.494]  Amazing interview.
[01:58:37.494 --> 01:58:37.874]  Stay with us.
[01:58:37.874 --> 01:58:38.735]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:38.735 --> 01:58:39.055]  Wow.
[01:58:39.055 --> 01:58:40.677]  Can't wait to read this.
[01:58:40.677 --> 01:58:41.478]  Nico wants it too.
[01:58:41.478 --> 01:58:44.241]  I only have one copy, but he doesn't get it till I read it.
[01:58:44.241 --> 01:58:46.324]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.016 --> 01:58:52.258]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:58:52.258 --> 01:59:02.224]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:59:38.797 --> 01:59:40.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:06.762]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.762 --> 02:00:08.523]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.523 --> 02:00:10.284]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.284 --> 02:00:11.865]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.865 --> 02:00:13.406]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:17.588]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.588 --> 02:00:23.071]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.071 --> 02:00:29.135]  Joe Biggs was just responding to footage we played of your radio listener of Marines training to confiscate firearms, round people up.
[02:00:30.265 --> 02:00:37.287]  Back in 1999, like 17 years ago, we played new footage shot last month the Marines released of it ramping up.
[02:00:37.287 --> 02:00:42.129]  We're not saying a massive takeover is imminent, it's an incremental frog in the pot.
[02:00:42.129 --> 02:00:47.131]  And Joe was telling me during the break about all the subtle threats he's getting, past colonels he had calling up.
[02:00:47.131 --> 02:00:50.592]  Describe the heat you're getting on Jade Helm reportage.
[02:00:50.592 --> 02:00:54.153]  I'm getting a lot of, I would say not as much negative.
[02:00:54.153 --> 02:00:56.414]  I'm getting a lot of previous colonels are coming at me like,
[02:00:56.954 --> 02:00:58.175]  Why are you talking about this?
[02:00:58.175 --> 02:00:58.875]  Leave it alone!
[02:00:58.875 --> 02:00:59.256]  Stop!
[02:00:59.256 --> 02:00:59.616]  Stop!
[02:00:59.616 --> 02:01:00.456]  You know?
[02:01:00.456 --> 02:01:01.757]  You know, we never did that.
[02:01:01.757 --> 02:01:02.938]  You used to be a good soldier.
[02:01:02.938 --> 02:01:04.039]  Why are you talking about this?
[02:01:04.039 --> 02:01:04.259]  You know?
[02:01:04.259 --> 02:01:08.302]  And I'm like, I think I'm still being a good soldier by questioning what's going on.
[02:01:08.302 --> 02:01:13.765]  You know, maybe I wasn't able to question as much then, which is why I wasn't as highly liked.
[02:01:13.765 --> 02:01:16.407]  Because I never, I wasn't a robot.
[02:01:16.407 --> 02:01:20.089]  But, I was born to question stuff and I will continue to do that.
[02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:22.271]  Well, the country's being dismantled in front of us!
[02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:35.195]  I mean, this is the thing though, we've talked about so many military exercises in the year that I've been here, but not once do you get any kind of feedback, hostile feedback from soldiers.
[02:01:35.195 --> 02:01:40.298]  You know, now you're getting all these people, they're just jumping up and it seems like they just say the same thing all the time.
[02:01:40.298 --> 02:01:42.579]  Leave it alone, why are you talking about it?
[02:01:42.579 --> 02:01:45.201]  No, just be a good soldier, just leave it alone.
[02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:45.441]  Why?
[02:01:46.325 --> 02:01:51.791]  Why don't you say that when I talk about the dirty bomb exercise in California.
[02:01:51.791 --> 02:01:56.156]  It was supposed to be a dirty bomb exercise, but in fact what it was was, you know, rounding up a...
[02:01:57.475 --> 02:01:59.936]  Constitutionalists, the sovereign citizens.
[02:01:59.936 --> 02:02:00.676]  Well, that's the truth.
[02:02:00.676 --> 02:02:02.916]  They've been given a traitorous mission.
[02:02:02.916 --> 02:02:03.877]  They're scared.
[02:02:03.877 --> 02:02:05.697]  They don't want to discuss it.
[02:02:05.697 --> 02:02:08.678]  Now, the troops themselves, we've talked to, are upset and agree with us.
[02:02:08.678 --> 02:02:09.578]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:09.578 --> 02:02:13.259]  But it's the officers that want to just go play golf.
[02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:14.619]  They want to just get paid.
[02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:18.480]  They want to get their little under-the-counter bonuses that everybody knows they get.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:21.381]  And listen, guys, we're going to lose the whole country.
[02:02:22.381 --> 02:02:23.662]  This hit him 20 years ago.
[02:02:23.662 --> 02:02:26.184]  This is all coming to a head.
[02:02:26.184 --> 02:02:29.046]  You better choose the right side.
[02:02:29.046 --> 02:02:31.308]  Don't sign up with Hitler.
[02:02:31.308 --> 02:02:33.650]  It's not going to go well.
[02:02:33.650 --> 02:02:34.451]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:34.451 --> 02:02:38.194]  A lot of the special forces guys that have reached out to me were, I think, more confused.
[02:02:38.194 --> 02:02:42.317]  I think that we at Infowars hate special operations guys.
[02:02:42.317 --> 02:02:43.018]  And I had to talk to them.
[02:02:43.018 --> 02:02:46.320]  They're like, no, it's not the operator that we have a problem with.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.561]  That's a total psi op.
[02:02:47.561 --> 02:02:50.123]  They don't even... Yeah, but I mean, it's the people at the top.
[02:02:50.123 --> 02:02:51.485]  It's the ones who are making those
[02:02:52.679 --> 02:02:53.119]  Plans.
[02:02:53.119 --> 02:02:54.239]  It's the people of the Pentagon.
[02:02:54.239 --> 02:02:57.100]  We don't really, we don't have a problem with the everyday soldier.
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:05.002]  I've had General Stubblebine, who was the head of Special Forces on 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago, saying this is all coming.
[02:03:05.002 --> 02:03:05.622]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.622 --> 02:03:09.503]  I mean, they were trying to get him involved in stuff like this 20 years ago.
[02:03:09.503 --> 02:03:11.583]  They've been, the globalists have been wanting to take over forever.
[02:03:11.583 --> 02:03:12.864]  They're always trying.
[02:03:12.864 --> 02:03:14.924]  We're here pointing out this mission takes us there.
[02:03:14.924 --> 02:03:17.465]  And this is happening right when they're trying to go to driverless cars too.
[02:03:17.465 --> 02:03:18.545]  They want to control our movement.
[02:03:19.465 --> 02:03:22.411]  And they're doing these to put people into camps, it looks like.
[02:03:22.411 --> 02:03:23.333]  They're doing all these exercises.
[02:03:23.333 --> 02:03:25.198]  They're testing all the control grids.
[02:03:25.198 --> 02:03:26.440]  But let's be clear.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.422]  The public's awake.
[02:03:27.422 --> 02:03:28.084]  Folks are upset.
[02:03:28.084 --> 02:03:29.868]  The majority of the troops we talked to agree with us.
[02:03:30.951 --> 02:03:36.255]  But there is a minority of regular trips, and then you've got the officers that are really engaging in a shy-op.
[02:03:36.255 --> 02:03:55.270]  Yeah, and then you've got people like Eric Bolling, again, has this huge audience on Fox, and he's mocking us, saying, you know, why are we talking about this, this is all a conspiracy, you know, or not everything's a conspiracy, leave it alone, you guys are, what, a bunch of gullible nutbags, or something like that, he said.
[02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:57.873]  So I got on Twitter this morning, and I said, hey,
[02:03:58.593 --> 02:03:59.954]  I challenge you to come out here.
[02:03:59.954 --> 02:04:01.174]  You're starting to get really lippy.
[02:04:01.174 --> 02:04:02.375]  You're starting to get jumpy.
[02:04:02.375 --> 02:04:04.816]  Why don't you have Alex on your show?
[02:04:04.816 --> 02:04:08.697]  Are you afraid that you're going to get a Piers Morgan whooping?
[02:04:08.697 --> 02:04:10.938]  I don't know if he's got the tweet up or whatever.
[02:04:10.938 --> 02:04:13.699]  And then he responded with, I'll meet Alex in the parking lot.
[02:04:13.699 --> 02:04:17.841]  Yeah, he's like, meet me at the corner of Lex and something after recess or whatever.
[02:04:20.435 --> 02:04:22.635]  But uh, these guys are scared.
[02:04:22.635 --> 02:04:24.356]  I mean, they want to pre-tape it.
[02:04:24.356 --> 02:04:29.117]  They want to be able to go in and... Yeah, they're just telling me to meet me at the corner of Park and Lex after school.
[02:04:29.117 --> 02:04:29.877]  Yeah.
[02:04:29.877 --> 02:04:31.637]  So he's making a joke like we're little kids.
[02:04:31.637 --> 02:04:33.778]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.778 --> 02:04:34.898]  Now we're schooling him.
[02:04:34.898 --> 02:04:36.218]  Yeah, he's scared.
[02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:39.359]  He will not do it live because he knows he will get manhandled.
[02:04:39.359 --> 02:04:40.859]  He didn't respond and say he'd do it taped, did he?
[02:04:40.859 --> 02:04:42.800]  Oh no, he didn't say anything about that.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.200]  Look, at this point, I'll even do it taped.
[02:04:45.267 --> 02:04:48.032]  Because I'm going to tape it, and then I'm going to show what they turned it into.
[02:04:48.032 --> 02:04:50.375]  Yeah, we take our own camera crew in there and show them what really happened.
[02:04:50.375 --> 02:04:51.417]  Yeah.
[02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:53.821]  Alright, Joe Biggs, we'll have more on this Denali News Night 7.
[02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:57.787]  We're going to get into some victories we're having right now on GMO that they said was good.
[02:04:59.278 --> 02:05:02.219]  All you pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news.
[02:05:02.219 --> 02:05:07.700]  Anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under Australian no-jab-no-pay law.
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:15.963]  The new changes that will take effect on January 1st, 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over $500 million over four years.
[02:05:15.963 --> 02:05:18.684]  And how many children are not receiving their vaccines?
[02:05:18.684 --> 02:05:21.584]  According to the Australian Childhood Immunization Register, it's 1.77%.
[02:05:24.105 --> 02:05:27.527]  I thought all you needed was 90% to have herd immunity.
[02:05:27.527 --> 02:05:33.731]  The government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption, it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health.
[02:05:33.731 --> 02:05:38.194]  But what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want.
[02:05:38.194 --> 02:05:40.456]  And they want to make sure you bend over and take it.
[02:05:40.456 --> 02:05:45.119]  A footnote in the article is that by 2020, childless couples will overtake those with children.
[02:05:45.119 --> 02:05:48.381]  Now I know where the next Muslim migrant invasion is going to take place.
[02:05:48.581 --> 02:05:52.148]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.

[02:07:34.361 --> 02:07:34.701]  That's why I
[02:07:34.721 --> 02:07:35.121]  We're good.
[02:08:01.525 --> 02:08:04.306]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.306 --> 02:08:13.070]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.070 --> 02:08:25.795]  Coming up in the next hour, Percy Schmeiser, the first farmer to prominently go up against Monsanto and be victorious, was first on with us when he started his fight.
[02:08:27.048 --> 02:08:29.108]  Fifteen plus years ago.
[02:08:29.108 --> 02:08:31.209]  He hasn't been on since.
[02:08:31.209 --> 02:08:35.830]  No, he was on the Nightly News once.
[02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:42.652]  Now Monsanto has been derated from a good investment by major investment firms to a risky bad investment.
[02:08:42.652 --> 02:08:43.852]  Their profits are in trouble.
[02:08:43.852 --> 02:08:46.092]  McDonald's is in trouble.
[02:08:46.092 --> 02:08:49.833]  They're both an allied operation.
[02:08:49.833 --> 02:08:52.134]  This is frankenfood.
[02:08:52.134 --> 02:08:53.494]  And they get up there and they lie.
[02:08:55.447 --> 02:09:00.410]  And they say, oh, it's just like George Washington Carver crossing two tomatoes.
[02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:01.491]  No.
[02:09:01.491 --> 02:09:06.193]  Because those tomatoes are closely enough related that they're able to breed together.
[02:09:06.193 --> 02:09:16.419]  But just like if you get a donkey and a horse, very similar, to have sex, they can procreate, but they have a sterile offspring.
[02:09:16.419 --> 02:09:18.420]  It's called a mule.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:21.062]  I'm not a geneticist, but I know these basic things.
[02:09:21.062 --> 02:09:22.022]  It's like a liger.
[02:09:22.022 --> 02:09:23.643]  A tiger and a lion?
[02:09:23.643 --> 02:09:24.184]  You can breed them.
[02:09:24.943 --> 02:09:27.665]  The offspring, a liger, is sterile.
[02:09:27.665 --> 02:09:40.875]  What happens when you breed two tomatoes together that are far enough apart that they're able to get together and share their different traits, but they don't produce seeds, or the seeds don't produce more fruit?
[02:09:40.875 --> 02:09:44.357]  Tomatoes are fruit for those that didn't know.
[02:09:44.357 --> 02:09:49.541]  They've gone beyond that and created GMO where you'll have 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 traits in it.
[02:09:52.028 --> 02:09:54.029]  Where it lasts longer, it doesn't die.
[02:09:54.029 --> 02:09:55.009]  Bugs can't eat it.
[02:09:55.009 --> 02:09:59.311]  If they do eat it, they die, because there's a natural pesticide produced.
[02:09:59.311 --> 02:10:05.794]  And they argue, well, it's a natural pesticide, yeah, but you boost it a thousand times or more.
[02:10:05.794 --> 02:10:12.477]  Yeah, the plant produces a pesticide or invites a fungus to grow on it that's poisonous, but it's not at that level.
[02:10:12.477 --> 02:10:14.378]  It's not inside the plant.
[02:10:14.378 --> 02:10:16.339]  You wash it off.
[02:10:16.339 --> 02:10:17.840]  Didn't used to kill the honeybees.
[02:10:19.301 --> 02:10:23.464]  And that's all 20, 30-year-old technology that's wreaking havoc right now.
[02:10:23.464 --> 02:10:26.847]  But as all this comes out, the system is panicking.
[02:10:26.847 --> 02:10:37.095]  At the bottom of the hour, our guest will be with us for the hour, I will do a five-minute news blitz on incredible economic news, incredible world news, just over-the-top intel.
[02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:42.219]  And we've got economists coming out, mainline ones with headlines like this.
[02:10:42.219 --> 02:10:47.543]  Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a worldwide scale when the debt bubble bursts.
[02:10:50.965 --> 02:10:57.027]  Video student confronts Jeb Bush, your brother created ISIS.
[02:10:57.027 --> 02:11:04.489]  Iowa man arrested for Facebook post calling for murder of white cops.
[02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:08.871]  Roomba maker to develop smart robots to surveil your own.
[02:11:08.871 --> 02:11:14.893]  Manslaughter charge against black officer in gray case derails race agenda in Baltimore.
[02:11:16.035 --> 02:11:19.660]  Video of Marines' practice of doing citizens inside internment camps.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.042]  That's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:11:21.042 --> 02:11:22.805]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:11:22.805 --> 02:11:27.392]  Rand Paul visits Secret Room to read Obama Trade, the SPP.
[02:11:28.772 --> 02:11:32.073]  Or the TPP, calls for public release of deal.
[02:11:32.073 --> 02:11:34.374]  Yeah, it's thousands of pages long.
[02:11:34.374 --> 02:11:36.095]  There's a photo in the article.
[02:11:36.095 --> 02:11:38.016]  It's a locked door.
[02:11:38.016 --> 02:11:40.317]  They search you, can't have anything on you.
[02:11:40.317 --> 02:11:44.138]  And then you go in, and that's since lawmakers demanded to see it a few months ago.
[02:11:44.138 --> 02:11:53.782]  For the last two years while they've been writing this, the corporate lawyers globally, for this Asia partnership, Congress can't see it.
[02:11:55.404 --> 02:11:56.886]  I mean, just think about that.
[02:11:56.886 --> 02:11:57.607]  And it's the same thing.
[02:11:57.607 --> 02:12:00.211]  Who sits on these boards, Monsanto?
[02:12:00.211 --> 02:12:03.436]  Who sits on the IMF advisory boards?
[02:12:03.436 --> 02:12:07.582]  Who sits on the World Trade Organization board?
[02:12:07.582 --> 02:12:09.264]  You guess it, Monsanto representatives.
[02:12:09.264 --> 02:12:11.567]  Who sits over the FDA and EPA, Monsanto?
[02:12:12.668 --> 02:12:21.194]  And back when I would get Jeffrey Smith and Percy Schmeiser and others on, Monsanto was suing people that criticized them then.
[02:12:21.194 --> 02:12:22.575]  With slap suits.
[02:12:22.575 --> 02:12:23.256]  And they still do.
[02:12:23.256 --> 02:12:27.078]  But that intimidation didn't work.
[02:12:27.078 --> 02:12:32.682]  Folks that brought you Agent Orange, Dioxin, dumped in black communities.
[02:12:32.682 --> 02:12:34.624]  I mean, the people that brought you Aspartame.
[02:12:34.624 --> 02:12:35.464]  They bought Searle.
[02:12:35.464 --> 02:12:36.585]  They couldn't get it approved.
[02:12:36.585 --> 02:12:37.866]  In the 70s, they got it approved in 1981.
[02:12:39.775 --> 02:12:43.778]  Now admit it to absolutely give you cancer, you name it.
[02:12:43.778 --> 02:12:45.699]  Kill monkeys in lab tests.
[02:12:45.699 --> 02:12:46.860]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.223]  Monsanto is the most devilish company I could think of.
[02:12:51.223 --> 02:12:54.466]  I mean, they really are wicked.
[02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:57.128]  And now the world is waking up.
[02:12:57.128 --> 02:12:58.929]  Every couple days a new country is banning.
[02:13:00.097 --> 02:13:02.800]  The importation.
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:05.263]  New studies have come out linking it to cancer in humans.
[02:13:05.263 --> 02:13:07.746]  The UN has come out.
[02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.648]  I mean, humanity is awakening.
[02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:13.673]  And by the way, it didn't come from the top, it was the UN scientist.
[02:13:13.673 --> 02:13:14.954]  So, more and more...
[02:13:15.936 --> 02:13:29.060]  Just like FDA scientists in 2000 and again a few years ago, almost unanimously, it was like 99% of them sent letters to their bosses saying, hydrofluorosilicic acid is causing bone cancer, brain damage, IQ reduction.
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:29.920]  Here's our studies.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:32.000]  Here's our Harvard studies.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.341]  It needs to be pulled out of the water.
[02:13:33.341 --> 02:13:34.721]  It doesn't help the teeth.
[02:13:34.721 --> 02:13:36.201]  You need a little bit of calcium fluoride.
[02:13:36.201 --> 02:13:39.142]  This is hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:13:39.142 --> 02:13:41.623]  If you're going to put it in there, you need to put a little bit of calcium fluoride.
[02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:45.430]  This is deadly poison.
[02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:49.811]  They just reduced it by half in the water and have now banned it in all pesticides.
[02:13:49.811 --> 02:13:51.351]  Already banned worldwide.
[02:13:51.351 --> 02:13:54.572]  We're having some devastating victories right now.
[02:13:54.572 --> 02:13:55.513]  This is very exciting.
[02:13:55.513 --> 02:14:12.578]  And the man spearheading so much of this, we sell his books and his films, Jeffrey Smith is international best-selling author, award-winning filmmaker, executive director of the Institute for Responsible Technology, and a leading spokesman on the health dangers of GMOs, the most recognized consumer advocate promoting healthier non-GMO choices.
[02:14:13.889 --> 02:14:17.492]  And he's the author of the documentary and the book, Genetic Roulette.
[02:14:17.492 --> 02:14:26.158]  He's the Executive Director of the Institute for Responsible Technology, non-gmoshoppingguide.com, responsibletechnology.com, seedswithdeception.com.
[02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:31.362]  Invite all his books and films at infowarsstore.com and support both of our operations.
[02:14:31.362 --> 02:14:31.742]  Jeffrey!
[02:14:32.723 --> 02:14:33.904]  Am I overstating?
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.262]  Lobbing Hail Marys and catching every one?
[02:14:52.262 --> 02:14:57.287]  I mean, it doesn't mean we won, but are we not racing back to a global awakening?
[02:14:57.287 --> 02:15:00.410]  I mean, are we on the cusp of a new renaissance?
[02:15:00.410 --> 02:15:03.753]  Because it was dark having you on 14, 15, 16 years ago.
[02:15:03.753 --> 02:15:08.197]  Having Percy Schmeiser on 16 years ago when he first launched his operation.
[02:15:08.197 --> 02:15:13.121]  Now it seems like, you know, courts are coming out admitting Monsanto planted their stuff on their crops.
[02:15:13.121 --> 02:15:14.743]  Monsanto's having things reversed.
[02:15:16.257 --> 02:15:31.929]  I want to talk about how they're striking back, part two of this interview, but am I accurate with you at the center of this who testifies to, you know, major political bodies worldwide, where are we right now in the global fight to not have poisoned food?
[02:15:32.984 --> 02:15:38.569]  Well, we're definitely winning, Alex, and the chief victory is among consumers.
[02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:45.475]  As you know, in 1999, consumer concern on GMOs caused a tipping point of consumer rejection.
[02:15:45.475 --> 02:15:51.300]  It was this very specific moment in time when the food companies realized that using GMOs was going to cost them money.
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:58.004]  That moment in time was April 27th, when Unilever said no more GMOs in its European brands.
[02:15:58.004 --> 02:16:02.366]  The next day, Nestle said no more GMOs in its European brands.
[02:16:02.366 --> 02:16:05.748]  The next week or two, everyone else followed.
[02:16:05.748 --> 02:16:19.376]  That tipping point of consumer rejection occurred in the natural products industry in the United States in 2013, when Whole Foods announced that when a product becomes third-party verified as non-GMO, it increases sales by 15 to 30 percent.
[02:16:20.777 --> 02:16:24.541]  Immediately, thousands of products were enrolled in verification.
[02:16:24.541 --> 02:16:31.328]  There's over 30,000 non-GMO verified products in the United States that tipped the natural products industry.
[02:16:31.328 --> 02:16:40.317]  Now we see products like Cheerios and Grape Nuts and Ben & Jerry's and Target Home Brands and soon Hershey's all declaring non-GMO on their package.
[02:16:40.817 --> 02:16:53.187]  As soon as they start increasing in market share in the United States, the rest of the food industry will realize, I can't wait till my chief competitor goes non-GMO before me, or I'll start losing customers.
[02:16:53.187 --> 02:17:07.798]  So we're looking for a tipping point of consumer rejection in the United States this year or at the very latest next year, and we think there'll be a clean-out of GMOs and direct ingredients over the next three years, and for animal products over the next five.
[02:17:07.978 --> 02:17:13.563]  Dan Monsanto is caving in all over the world and pulling its push in Europe for GMOs.
[02:17:13.563 --> 02:17:21.570]  I mean, I liken this to Hitler's collapse on the Eastern Front, launching a counter-offensive on the Western Front at the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:23.252]  I think that's the point we're at.
[02:17:23.252 --> 02:17:31.319]  If we beat them at the Battle of the Bulge in the next couple of years, I believe we're seeing a collapse-level event of these operators.
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:43.524]  Not only that, but we just got incredible ammunition from the World Health Organization last month that declared Monsanto's Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate as a probable carcinogen.
[02:17:43.524 --> 02:17:49.746]  Since then, 30,000 Argentine medical doctors have petitioned their government to ban it.
[02:17:50.206 --> 02:17:54.769]  The federal prosecutor in Brazil has said that their government should ban it.
[02:17:54.769 --> 02:18:01.194]  The president of Colombia said they're no longer going to use it to spray on the cocoa fields to eradicate that trade.
[02:18:01.194 --> 02:18:06.958]  It was banned in Richmond in California and it continues to be a subject... Bermuda?
[02:18:06.958 --> 02:18:07.178]  Pardon?
[02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:07.819]  Bermuda just banned it?
[02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:08.871]  Bermuda.
[02:18:23.490 --> 02:18:26.791]  Similarly, there was evidence showing birth defects back in the 1980s.
[02:18:26.791 --> 02:18:48.741]  They've been covered up by Monsanto and regulators, and it turns out in Argentina, the peasants that are sprayed with this Roundup or glyphosate have much higher levels of birth defects, 400% increase region-wide, 70 times in one hospital, and an increase in cancer of 300% in one area and higher in other regions.
[02:18:49.241 --> 02:19:02.010]  We also saw in China when they started introducing genetically engineered roundup ready soybeans for their soybean oil, it was reported that cancer and heart disease and other problems skyrocketed.
[02:19:02.010 --> 02:19:05.692]  I was there giving a presentation in Beijing last year.
[02:19:05.692 --> 02:19:18.921]  A general who was in the audience had earlier reported that he warned the government and warned the people that this new genetically modified roundup ready soybean oil was linked to all of these increase in diseases and the army
[02:19:19.581 --> 02:19:25.788]  In fact, that came out in the news that the Chinese elite are obsessed with non-GMO and were found to have secret government-funded gardens.
[02:19:36.624 --> 02:19:44.012]  It turns out that Bush, the past Bush administration, absolutely insisted that their kitchen be organic.
[02:19:44.012 --> 02:19:46.775]  And evidently, Obama has followed through.
[02:19:46.775 --> 02:19:51.560]  So, it turns out that those that know the situation don't want to risk themselves.
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:56.525]  In fact, a former Monsanto scientist told me that three of his colleagues were doing the safety check.
[02:19:56.525 --> 02:19:57.326]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:19:57.326 --> 02:19:57.947]  This is amazing.
[02:19:57.947 --> 02:19:58.768]  I want to hear it when we come back.
[02:19:59.108 --> 02:20:07.214]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.

[02:24:03.513 --> 02:24:05.875]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:24:05.875 --> 02:24:12.922]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:12.922 --> 02:24:22.931]  Ladies and gentlemen, I get so excited about voting with our dollars, voting with our euros, voting with our yens, our yuan, our rubles, our shekels.
[02:24:22.931 --> 02:24:24.812]  That's why they want to get rid of cash.
[02:24:24.812 --> 02:24:27.475]  It's why they want to force you into big box stores.
[02:24:27.475 --> 02:24:29.516]  It's why they want to make you only shop
[02:24:30.253 --> 02:24:34.454]  With the big megacorporations because they have a plan for a global monopoly.
[02:24:34.454 --> 02:24:42.595]  Monsanto and other big GMO companies have admitted they want to make everything GMO from trees to grass and patent it.
[02:24:42.595 --> 02:24:50.296]  Now they're coming out and saying, you know, that words are going to be copyright where you supposedly can't use them in language.
[02:24:50.296 --> 02:24:53.497]  They're now saying you can't work on your own car.
[02:24:53.497 --> 02:24:59.578]  In fact, this morning I was talking to a lady and she was telling me about her Keurig coffee maker.
[02:25:01.374 --> 02:25:01.734]  I don't know.
[02:25:21.069 --> 02:25:33.432]  And so you have to go in and basically put tape over it or cut the chip off so that her other, in this case she said organic coffee, we were having an organic discussion at the gym, would go in there.
[02:25:33.432 --> 02:25:37.072]  So see, that's the type of monopoly they're trying to create.
[02:25:37.072 --> 02:25:40.613]  And I'm kind of diverting off into another subject, but it all connects.
[02:25:40.613 --> 02:25:43.014]  We were talking about Volkswagen.
[02:25:43.014 --> 02:25:45.834]  You buy a Volkswagen, two years later your battery doesn't work?
[02:25:45.834 --> 02:25:47.915]  You go get a third party battery, same battery, works great.
[02:25:48.939 --> 02:25:51.583]  They remotely, from the factory, turn it off.
[02:25:51.583 --> 02:25:56.311]  You have to go in and pay a $150 service charge to have them certify it as theirs.
[02:25:56.311 --> 02:25:59.135]  Now, that's where all this is going!
[02:25:59.978 --> 02:26:02.600]  And with this genetically engineered food, that's where it's going.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:04.242]  This is a short segment, Mr. Smith.
[02:26:04.242 --> 02:26:05.202]  Long segment coming up.
[02:26:05.202 --> 02:26:07.284]  We're going into victories right now.
[02:26:07.284 --> 02:26:11.688]  I'm glad to hear from you, the expert, that I'm not overestimating how exciting this is.
[02:26:11.688 --> 02:26:15.791]  Let me shift gears and we'll go back into good news and where the rest of the fight is in the next segment.
[02:26:15.791 --> 02:26:28.482]  In this short segment, as we talk to Jeffrey Smith, ResponsibleTechnology.com, probably the leading spokesperson fighting this stuff, on the GMO, there's Mercola and others, but they cover the whole spectrum.
[02:26:29.534 --> 02:26:30.935]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:26:30.935 --> 02:26:33.556]  How is the empire going to strike back?
[02:26:33.556 --> 02:26:37.558]  What's going to be their battle the bulge counter offensive?
[02:26:37.558 --> 02:26:39.159]  What are they doing?
[02:26:39.159 --> 02:26:53.346]  Well, they're spending millions of dollars now promoting the quote benefits of GMOs through media and also trying to discredit those of us like me and Vandana Shiva and others claiming that we are anti-science and uncredible.
[02:26:53.346 --> 02:26:57.948]  So they're actually cornered against the wall and in discussions with my colleagues around the world
[02:26:58.388 --> 02:27:01.252]  It's clear that they're doing a full court press.
[02:27:01.252 --> 02:27:08.541]  I'm here in Ecuador, where the country actually has a constitutional amendment saying that no GMOs are allowed.
[02:27:08.541 --> 02:27:15.531]  If you look at WikiLeaks, the United States government had a plan to undermine the Constitution here and get them to overturn it.
[02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:30.138]  So they actually paid for bringing reporters from Ecuador to the United States so that Monsanto can train them how to report on GMOs, and sure enough, they started giving Monsanto's false talking points in the press here in Ecuador.
[02:27:30.138 --> 02:27:43.084]  Then they surrounded the president, who does have the ability to overturn the constitutional prohibition, and he came out saying that GMOs could increase yields by 400%, and he's now against the constitutional provision.
[02:27:43.504 --> 02:27:43.925]  I don't know.
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:13.185]  The general public and farmers, and trying to use as much evidence as they can, which is false, to try and convince them that this is absolutely necessary to feed the world, to save economies, to prevent the use of agricultural chemicals, all of which has been demonstrated as false.
[02:28:13.185 --> 02:28:21.888]  Sure, but the effects of it are so deadly, we're 30 years into this nightmare, that no amount of BS is ever going to paper over the prima facie reality.
[02:28:22.688 --> 02:28:28.635]  Well, I'll talk about it in the next segment, about the specific diseases that we now know are probably linked to GMOs.
[02:28:28.635 --> 02:28:38.107]  I'll say probably, but I'm very confident, as thousands of physicians in the United States who are prescribing non-GMO diets, they are very confident that these particular diseases are linked.
[02:28:38.487 --> 02:28:58.303]  And why it's so important now not to just buy non-GMO, but to buy organic, because Monsanto's Glyphosate or Roundup is sprayed on wheat, barley, lentils, sweet potatoes, potatoes, sugar cane, over a hundred different crops are now authorized to have high levels of Glyphosate residue, and it's sprayed just before harvest as a ripening agent.
[02:28:58.303 --> 02:29:04.648]  Briefly describe in one minute why Glyphosate, I mean they admit it grows breast cancer, why is it so deadly?
[02:29:05.407 --> 02:29:08.389]  Well, I can do it in one minute, but we should spend a little more time.
[02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:12.613]  It's definitely a probable carcinogen according to the World Health Organization.
[02:29:12.613 --> 02:29:14.034]  It's linked to birth defects.
[02:29:14.034 --> 02:29:16.956]  It's an antibiotic that kills the beneficial gut bacteria.
[02:29:16.956 --> 02:29:19.678]  It causes an overgrowth of negative gut bacteria.
[02:29:19.678 --> 02:29:30.747]  It blocks the gut bacteria's ability to produce tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin, so it can affect mood, behavior, sleep, blood sugar chemistry, as well as obesity.
[02:29:31.087 --> 02:29:33.609]  It also is linked to an endocrine disruptor.
[02:29:33.609 --> 02:29:36.492]  It also blocks the liver's ability to detoxify.
[02:29:36.492 --> 02:29:36.932]  Oh, stay there.
[02:29:36.932 --> 02:29:38.733]  I want you to recap all that when we come back.
[02:29:38.733 --> 02:29:44.818]  And I'm sure it's all an accident that these eugenicists that gave us all this other bad stuff at Monsanto came up with this.
[02:29:44.818 --> 02:29:46.720]  I'm sure it's all an accident.
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:48.341]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.341 --> 02:29:49.742]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.742 --> 02:29:52.265]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.265 --> 02:29:54.947]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.042 --> 02:29:59.703]  The D.C.
[02:29:59.703 --> 02:30:04.707]  Police Chief urges citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[02:30:04.707 --> 02:30:08.050]  Speaking with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Washington, D.C.
[02:30:08.050 --> 02:30:18.339]  Police Chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting, whether it means run, hide, or fight.
[02:30:18.339 --> 02:30:20.861]  If you're in a position to try to take the gunman out,
[02:30:21.061 --> 02:30:25.303]  It's the best option for saving lives before police can get there, Lanier said.
[02:30:25.303 --> 02:30:37.530]  While acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised, Lanier claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris, which left over 120 people dead.
[02:30:40.171 --> 02:30:41.472]  Don't take action.
[02:30:41.472 --> 02:30:42.573]  Call 9-1-1.
[02:30:42.573 --> 02:30:45.036]  Don't intervene in the robbery, Lanier said.
[02:30:45.036 --> 02:30:49.440]  We've never told people take action, but it's a different scenario.
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:57.788]  Keep up with our latest news and information on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:30:58.757 --> 02:31:02.260]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:10.506]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.506 --> 02:31:15.930]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:31:36.931 --> 02:31:40.233]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:40.233 --> 02:31:43.715]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:43.715 --> 02:31:45.696]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[02:32:07.611 --> 02:32:16.000]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:21.646]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:32:22.106 --> 02:32:31.194]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:32:31.194 --> 02:32:37.439]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:32:37.439 --> 02:32:43.725]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:32:44.165 --> 02:32:49.554]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:32:49.554 --> 02:32:52.018]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:33:01.215 --> 02:33:03.616]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:03.616 --> 02:33:04.496]  A lie!
[02:33:04.496 --> 02:33:06.497]  No man is obsolete!
[02:33:06.497 --> 02:33:08.378]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:08.378 --> 02:33:11.619]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:33:11.619 --> 02:33:17.082]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:33:17.082 --> 02:33:18.763]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:18.763 --> 02:33:20.263]  A crawling insect!
[02:33:20.263 --> 02:33:24.305]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:33:24.925 --> 02:33:26.426]  I am a human being.
[02:33:26.426 --> 02:33:34.172]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind.
[02:33:34.172 --> 02:33:35.313]  I don't care.
[02:33:35.313 --> 02:33:36.353]  I tell you, I don't care.
[02:33:36.353 --> 02:33:37.915]  I'm a human being.
[02:33:37.915 --> 02:33:38.595]  I exist.
[02:33:38.595 --> 02:33:41.117]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[02:33:41.849 --> 02:33:45.611]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:33:45.611 --> 02:33:48.772]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:48.772 --> 02:33:56.456]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[02:33:56.456 --> 02:34:03.520]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:07.602]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:07.602 --> 02:34:09.343]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:17.195]  And what is the state we're facing?
[02:34:17.195 --> 02:34:23.882]  Well, 550 years ago, the state was corrupt religious institutions and corrupt royalty.
[02:34:24.815 --> 02:34:30.021]  And we had a renaissance, and then it itself got taken over by the robber barons the last 120 years.
[02:34:30.021 --> 02:34:35.608]  We now face corporate global governance that masquerades as liberal, masquerades as conservative.
[02:34:35.608 --> 02:34:43.918]  It's really just oligarchical totalitarianism carried out by corporate institutions that are anti-free market, crony capitalists.
[02:34:45.287 --> 02:34:52.273]  And they use socialism to control the general masses below them with a small sliver of GDP.
[02:34:52.273 --> 02:34:57.477]  So it's a bifurcated upper and lower house system.
[02:34:57.477 --> 02:34:59.639]  And that is not my opinion.
[02:34:59.639 --> 02:35:03.563]  That is the real political system of the globalists.
[02:35:03.563 --> 02:35:10.549]  I first read about it in None Dare Call a Conspiracy, published in 1972, two years before I was born.
[02:35:10.549 --> 02:35:11.609]  And then I read None Dare...
[02:35:12.470 --> 02:35:37.401]  After I read None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, whose son runs and founded Politico today, the late, great Gary Allen, I went and I read the books they recommended that they were quoting from, Tragedy and Hope, The Anglo-American Establishment, both by Carol Quigley, other books like the Technotronic Era by Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others.
[02:35:37.401 --> 02:35:41.003]  And you read those and they explain everything from their perspective.
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:45.125]  So you need to understand, this is about fighting a global monopoly.
[02:35:45.125 --> 02:35:46.346]  We're going back to our guest.
[02:35:46.346 --> 02:35:53.116]  I'm going to give the floor right through this long segment so you can really break down what we know the United States is doing.
[02:35:53.116 --> 02:35:56.080]  He's a major target, so he puts provisos in there.
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.304]  That's a whole other story here.
[02:36:00.256 --> 02:36:05.498]  Because Monsanto went after farmers, researchers, scientists, persecuted people.
[02:36:05.498 --> 02:36:20.664]  I've had top genetic engineers on the show that are making millions a year, who even own percentages, I've had a bunch of them on, in new potatoes that were coming out, in new corn, and they would say, hey, this is sterilizing the rats, this is killing the guinea pigs, and they'd say, shut up or you're fired.
[02:36:23.646 --> 02:36:32.372]  There's been a war, a long history of persecution that I hope our guest can talk about maybe in the next segment before he leaves us and before Percy Schmeiser, a true hero, joins us.
[02:36:32.372 --> 02:36:37.076]  Because they've gone through hell to bring us to where we're now here.
[02:36:37.076 --> 02:36:43.120]  Kind of like they, I think, manipulated the vote in California and other states to not let GMO labeling happen.
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:45.942]  But the fight educated everybody, so it even blew up bigger.
[02:36:45.942 --> 02:36:51.887]  See, George Washington lost almost all the first battles for the first five years of the war.
[02:36:53.134 --> 02:36:56.296]  Then began to win the battles the last year and a half.
[02:36:56.296 --> 02:37:06.203]  But every time they lost a battle, they still escape with enough of a force to reconstitute to wear out the juggernaut.
[02:37:06.203 --> 02:37:09.885]  So it's perseverance, ladies and gentlemen, that wins.
[02:37:09.885 --> 02:37:16.530]  That's why if I get destroyed, I get set up, I get, you know, brought down, believe me, I get plenty of threats, we're in the zeitgeist.
[02:37:16.530 --> 02:37:17.871]  We're not touching it, we're in it.
[02:37:19.909 --> 02:37:22.985]  Doesn't matter because I know the war will be won!
[02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:29.393]  And it's not some heroic reason I'm doing that, it's self-preservation for the species.
[02:37:29.393 --> 02:37:35.517]  I really do, I'm an individual, but when you become a real individual, you then understand the collective.
[02:37:35.517 --> 02:37:38.558]  They try to bring a collective that you submit to and give up your individualism.
[02:37:38.558 --> 02:37:38.979]  No.
[02:37:38.979 --> 02:37:51.726]  We as individuals gravitate to what's the core of the human spirit, the human drive, and then we collectively radiate those ideas and actions and then build a harmonistic collective.
[02:37:51.726 --> 02:37:54.048]  But the collective comes out of the individual.
[02:37:55.535 --> 02:37:57.136]  Not out of the collective.
[02:37:57.136 --> 02:38:00.398]  And that's my own philosophy and my own ideas, but I know it's true.
[02:38:00.398 --> 02:38:01.938]  And so I am the planet.
[02:38:01.938 --> 02:38:02.779]  I am the people.
[02:38:02.779 --> 02:38:04.240]  You are the people.
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:06.861]  We are this species.
[02:38:06.861 --> 02:38:10.463]  And we have to decide that we care about everybody.
[02:38:10.463 --> 02:38:13.765]  But that doesn't mean then being told, oh, do this to show your moral.
[02:38:13.765 --> 02:38:18.767]  You've got to go do research to really follow the right path to really help people.
[02:38:18.767 --> 02:38:23.270]  You can't just give away your free will to the false corporate collective that it tells you is moral.
[02:38:24.986 --> 02:38:25.946]  I'm ranting now.
[02:38:25.946 --> 02:38:28.327]  Briefly, we're running two specials right now.
[02:38:28.327 --> 02:38:30.767]  Powerful Concentrated Herbs.
[02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:32.768]  We have Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:32.768 --> 02:38:34.088]  We're going to launch this through next week.
[02:38:34.088 --> 02:38:35.648]  20% off Super Mel Vitality.
[02:38:35.648 --> 02:38:39.129]  20% off Super Female Vitality.
[02:38:39.129 --> 02:38:42.830]  These are just a whole bunch of concentrated herbs of the highest quality.
[02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:44.070]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:46.831]  Known to just really supercharge the body.
[02:38:46.831 --> 02:38:49.352]  The libido, the energy, you name it.
[02:38:49.352 --> 02:38:50.372]  It's what I've been taking.
[02:38:51.274 --> 02:39:01.561]  Prostagard is 10 different saw palmetto organic and other things known to really help the prostate and other functions that are connected to that.
[02:39:01.561 --> 02:39:02.341]  Everybody knows this.
[02:39:02.341 --> 02:39:04.443]  I even showed you in a Mayo Clinic article yesterday.
[02:39:04.443 --> 02:39:09.546]  This is one of the most documented things and it's got concentrated strong organic saw palmetto.
[02:39:09.546 --> 02:39:18.152]  It's got a bunch of other things that are absolutely known, absolutely known to turbo charge that same activity.
[02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:29.701]  Vitamin D, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, and a bunch of other ingredients, saw palmetto, lycopene, the healthy plant sterols.
[02:39:29.701 --> 02:39:37.048]  This is the super formula, over 40 bucks from a medical doctor I was getting something similar from in his practice.
[02:39:37.048 --> 02:39:39.530]  He said, you're 40, get on this, about two years ago.
[02:39:40.191 --> 02:39:42.452]  So I said, why not develop our own supercharged version?
[02:39:42.452 --> 02:39:43.192]  It's out.
[02:39:43.192 --> 02:39:49.215]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:39:49.215 --> 02:39:52.257]  And thank you for your prayers and support.
[02:39:52.257 --> 02:39:54.518]  And I was saying it wrong earlier.
[02:39:54.518 --> 02:40:05.063]  It's responsibletechnology.org, not com, responsibletechnology.org, non-gmoshoppingguide.com, and seedsofdeception.com.
[02:40:05.063 --> 02:40:07.044]  Jeffrey Smith at the tip of the spear.
[02:40:07.044 --> 02:40:09.045]  So get into what it's doing to us.
[02:40:09.645 --> 02:40:11.886]  Where are the rest of the fights going?
[02:40:11.886 --> 02:40:20.090]  And then people need to realize those that have gone through hell to stand up and tell the truth.
[02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:27.093]  And thank God it's not in vain because we can save millions of lives if we go ahead and finally discredit this deadly chemical.
[02:40:27.093 --> 02:40:28.233]  Go ahead, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:40:28.233 --> 02:40:28.773]  Great.
[02:40:28.773 --> 02:40:29.494]  Thank you.
[02:40:29.494 --> 02:40:30.554]  I'll talk about Roundup.
[02:40:30.554 --> 02:40:37.257]  I also want to talk about the new apple and potato before we break with a new technology that may be far worse than anything we've seen.
[02:40:37.977 --> 02:40:47.280]  Now, Roundup, or glyphosate, its active ingredient, was originally patented as a descaler to clean industrial boilers and pipes.
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:58.583]  That's because it chelates or grabs minerals, all sorts of minerals, all the metallic minerals, zinc, chromium, magnesium, manganese, calcium, all of those.
[02:40:58.583 --> 02:41:04.485]  Now, when they discarded the glyphosate on the ground, it killed the plants.
[02:41:04.485 --> 02:41:07.086]  And so Monsanto patented it as an herbicide.
[02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:17.615]  Now it turns out that it can deplete the minerals in the crops and the animals in the United States eat mostly roundup ready crops.
[02:41:17.615 --> 02:41:24.279]  So the animals in the United States, the livestock, have a universal deficiency of certain minerals like manganese.
[02:41:24.739 --> 02:41:28.903]  According to the veterinarians that send in organs for evaluation.
[02:41:28.903 --> 02:41:39.453]  So we're eating weak and sick mineral deficient plants, weak and sick mineral deficient animals, and residues of Roundup that further chelate or bind with our minerals, making them unavailable.
[02:41:39.453 --> 02:41:42.516]  Mineral depletion is linked to a whole host of diseases.
[02:41:42.516 --> 02:41:46.480]  Now because it blocks certain minerals, it's also an antibiotic.
[02:41:47.332 --> 02:41:48.593]  But it's selective.
[02:41:48.593 --> 02:42:01.298]  It kills the beneficial gut bacteria, the lactobacillus, the bifidus, the stuff we pay for, but not the negative stuff, like botulism and salmonella and E. coli, which can cause an overgrowth of the negative gut bacteria.
[02:42:01.298 --> 02:42:09.942]  This alone can create holes in the intestinal walls called permeable gut or leaky gut, and that's linked to cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autism,
[02:42:10.642 --> 02:42:14.544]  Food allergies, inflammation, and autoimmune disease, to name a few.
[02:42:14.544 --> 02:42:25.229]  Now, some of our gut bacteria is used to produce what's called aromatic amino acids, including tryptophan, which is necessary for the production of serotonin.
[02:42:25.229 --> 02:42:27.230]  Serotonin is a good thing.
[02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:31.992]  If we don't have enough serotonin, we may not be happy, we may be depressed, sad, etc.
[02:42:31.992 --> 02:42:34.033]  It also regulates our blood sugar.
[02:42:34.033 --> 02:42:37.035]  It also regulates our ability to say, I'm full, I can stop eating.
[02:42:37.555 --> 02:42:47.478]  So if we have a deficiency of serotonin because Roundup is blocking the production of tryptophan, that could cause a whole effect in terms of mood behavior and health.
[02:42:47.478 --> 02:42:51.219]  It also affects the melatonin, which relates to sleep.
[02:42:51.219 --> 02:42:55.981]  In addition, it blocks another pathway in our liver that helps detox.
[02:42:55.981 --> 02:43:03.343]  So that means all of the other poisons that we're exposed to may become amplified because the ability to detox to the liver is hampered.
[02:43:03.903 --> 02:43:14.006]  It also is an endocrine disruption at very, very tiny levels, at parts per trillion, at parts of the amount of glyphosate that's currently in our water supply.
[02:43:14.006 --> 02:43:17.947]  Now, it can change the balance of estrogen and testosterone.
[02:43:17.947 --> 02:43:25.010]  Rats that were fed round up in the water supply, which was less than the amount allowed in the United States.
[02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:28.851]  The females had more testosterone and lower estrogen.
[02:43:28.851 --> 02:43:31.852]  The males had more estrogen and lower testosterone.
[02:43:32.412 --> 02:43:34.334]  And it can also affect the aromatase.
[02:43:34.334 --> 02:43:35.435]  And what do we see here?
[02:43:35.435 --> 02:43:46.386]  We see, and it's just a fact, they admit this, more butch women, bigger women, and I'm not attacking what's been done to them with the chemicals, it's just a fact, and more effeminate men.
[02:43:46.386 --> 02:43:50.650]  Lower sperm counts, lower testosterone, metrosexual activity.
[02:43:51.450 --> 02:43:55.211]  And again, the media always spins this like I'm bashing people for their sexual preference.
[02:43:55.211 --> 02:43:56.472]  We don't even get into that, folks.
[02:43:56.472 --> 02:44:02.373]  It's a fact that in mammals, but also in the runoff from fish, you name it, that this stuff's happening.
[02:44:02.373 --> 02:44:10.676]  You look at Prozac runoff, and it's causing the fish to commit suicide, literally swimming up to birds, not afraid.
[02:44:10.676 --> 02:44:12.476]  It's causing risky behavior.
[02:44:12.476 --> 02:44:14.717]  I mean, we are just bathed in this garbage.
[02:44:14.717 --> 02:44:18.338]  I know I'm digressing off into other chemicals, but we know this is happening.
[02:44:19.557 --> 02:44:31.628]  In addition to causing endocrine disruption, it also could affect the ability of the sperm to move because manganese, which is chelated by glyphosate, is needed for sperm mobility.
[02:44:31.628 --> 02:44:41.638]  In fact, when they fed genetically modified soy to female rats starting two weeks before they got pregnant, more than half of their babies died within three weeks compared to 10% of controls.
[02:44:42.819 --> 02:44:53.103]  For hamsters that were fed Roundup Ready soy, which is sprayed with Roundup, by the third generation, most were sterile, some had hair growing in their mouths, and they died at four or five times the rate.
[02:44:53.103 --> 02:45:02.826]  Now, birth defects are also linked to glyphosate big time, both in animals and in the human population in places like Argentina, where they spray a lot of that.
[02:45:03.306 --> 02:45:10.988]  Roundup also damages the mitochondria, which means that we may get tired, and there's a lot of diseases that can link to that.
[02:45:10.988 --> 02:45:18.590]  It also is, as we say, a promoter of tumors, and you saw on the screen just now some very, very large tumors of rats.
[02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:26.792]  This was a study done by Seralini and others in Europe, where they fed Roundup-ready corn to rats for two years.
[02:45:27.372 --> 02:45:37.734]  Now, the rats ended up dying at higher rates than earlier, they had damage to their liver, kidneys, and pituitary, and they also had multiple massive tumors.
[02:45:37.734 --> 02:45:42.415]  Now, they didn't know whether it was the Roundup or the GMO that caused the problem.
[02:45:42.415 --> 02:45:51.597]  So, as part of the study, they fed Roundup ready corn that had not been sprayed with Roundup, and that group had multiple massive tumors, early death, and organ damage.
[02:45:51.977 --> 02:46:00.104]  And to another group, they fed the Roundup without the corn, and that group also had multiple massive tumors, early death, and organ damage.
[02:46:00.104 --> 02:46:02.266]  So the Roundup was worse than the GMO?
[02:46:02.266 --> 02:46:03.127]  Well, actually, no.
[02:46:03.127 --> 02:46:04.068]  Both.
[02:46:04.068 --> 02:46:06.590]  They both contained the same outcome.
[02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:08.832]  Early death, organ damage, and multiple massive tumors.
[02:46:08.832 --> 02:46:09.253]  So what's worse?
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:20.762]  It's hard to know, but we've tracked in the epidemiological trends what is related to the increase of GMOs or what's related to the increase of Roundup.
[02:46:20.762 --> 02:46:23.142]  The list of diseases is astonishing.
[02:46:23.142 --> 02:46:29.823]  Deaths from stroke, deaths from senile dementia, deaths from obesity, deaths from high blood pressure, deaths from intestinal infections.
[02:46:29.823 --> 02:46:31.244]  And by the way, we see all that going up.
[02:46:31.244 --> 02:46:37.585]  I mean, every week I hear about some 25-year-old woman or 30-year-old guy who just dies of a stroke.
[02:46:37.585 --> 02:46:38.325]  It's just crazy.
[02:46:39.167 --> 02:46:45.809]  And I've talked to thousands of people who say when they get off of GMOs, they get better from a lot of these same diseases and disorders.
[02:46:45.809 --> 02:46:50.450]  In fact, thousands of doctors are prescribing to people to stop eating GMOs.
[02:46:50.450 --> 02:47:08.296]  I speak at those medical conferences and they tell me people are getting better from these same diseases and disorders, the same ones that afflict the lab animals that are fed GMOs, and the same ones that the farmers and veterinarians tell us their livestock gets better from when they start feeding them non-GMO corn and soy.
[02:47:09.176 --> 02:47:21.324]  And so, it turns out there's a correlation between what's afflicting the lab animals, what people are reporting getting better from, the livestock getting better from, pets are getting better from, and those things that are on the rise in the U.S.
[02:47:21.324 --> 02:47:22.545]  population.
[02:47:22.545 --> 02:47:32.191]  Now, there was a mysterious kidney disease killing up to 25% of the labor force in Central America among farmers working in sugarcane plantations.
[02:47:32.191 --> 02:47:36.374]  They spray the sugarcane with glyphosate just before ripening.
[02:47:39.196 --> 02:47:43.459]  And half of them are dying and then you go to the next village and the same deal.
[02:47:43.459 --> 02:47:44.920]  It's just incredible.
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:51.085]  Now there was a study that showed that Roundup, we talked about how it chelates, it binds with certain minerals.
[02:47:51.085 --> 02:47:57.490]  It binds with arsenic and can smuggle that arsenic into the body where it gets into the kidneys.
[02:47:57.490 --> 02:48:01.233]  Then the situation in the kidneys allows it to un-chelate.
[02:48:01.233 --> 02:48:03.254]  So now you have two toxins in the kidneys.
[02:48:03.254 --> 02:48:05.056]  You have glyphosate and you have arsenic.
[02:48:05.376 --> 02:48:12.942]  And this is the theory of this mysterious kidney disease that's afflicting farm workers both in Central America and in Sri Lanka.
[02:48:12.942 --> 02:48:16.504]  They believe it's a combination of glyphosate and arsenic.
[02:48:16.504 --> 02:48:20.047]  Sure, what about the massive sicknesses in India associated with it?
[02:48:20.447 --> 02:48:28.729]  Oh yeah, so there's all these people who touch the cotton plants either while they're harvesting or while they're cleaning it and get rashes all over their bodies.
[02:48:28.729 --> 02:48:33.409]  They allow animals to graze on the cotton plants after harvest and thousands have died.
[02:48:33.409 --> 02:48:41.211]  I visited one village where there are buffalo, 13 of them, all of them died after eating the corn, the cotton plants after a single day.
[02:48:41.211 --> 02:48:46.092]  These same buffalo had survived eight years eating natural cotton plants after harvest.
[02:48:46.092 --> 02:48:47.432]  So that's a bioaccumulation?
[02:48:48.223 --> 02:48:54.704]  Yeah, well bioaccumulation is interesting because Monsanto said that glyphosate is water-soluble and can just go out of the body.
[02:48:54.704 --> 02:49:06.966]  But it turns out the glyphosate amount in the breast milk in humans is so high, it demonstrates that it does bioaccumulate, which means it's probably in higher levels of our milk and probably higher levels of our meat.
[02:49:06.966 --> 02:49:12.127]  So it's also found in rain samples and air samples in 60 to 100 percent.
[02:49:12.127 --> 02:49:16.608]  In the Midwest, where it's sprayed a lot, it's found in our water samples and it's found in our urine.
[02:49:17.128 --> 02:49:22.691]  In fact, the amount has increased so much because the herbicide is now being resisted by weeds.
[02:49:22.691 --> 02:49:26.333]  There was an increase in herbicides because of GMOs the first 16 years by 523 million pounds.
[02:49:26.333 --> 02:49:27.394]  Sure, it's a nightmare.
[02:49:27.394 --> 02:49:30.015]  And as you said, it kills the soil and won't even work after a while.
[02:49:30.015 --> 02:49:32.156]  That's why the farmers then commit suicide in India.
[02:49:32.156 --> 02:49:32.837]  We're going to break.
[02:49:32.837 --> 02:49:35.979]  I want to come back and let you hit other key areas for this segment and one other.
[02:49:35.979 --> 02:49:38.140]  And then Percy Smizer joins us at 5 after.
[02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:40.041]  But let me ask you this in the next minute and a half.
[02:49:41.536 --> 02:49:47.262]  If they knew about this in the 80s, and I know about those studies and their own internal concerns, why would they approve this and roll it out?
[02:49:47.262 --> 02:49:53.109]  I mean, are these people directly like Hellraiser, like some type of demons?
[02:49:53.109 --> 02:49:54.551]  I mean, what's their problem?
[02:49:55.407 --> 02:50:03.074]  Well, we know from the FDA memos made public from a lawsuit that GMOs in general were described by FDA scientists as dangerous.
[02:50:03.074 --> 02:50:08.899]  They said allergens, toxins, new diseases and nutritional problems may be created and we need to test them carefully.
[02:50:08.899 --> 02:50:13.663]  But the White House had told the FDA to promote biotechnology because it was going to increase U.S.
[02:50:13.663 --> 02:50:16.386]  exports and domination of world food trade.
[02:50:16.386 --> 02:50:19.769]  So the FDA brought in Michael Taylor, Monsanto's former attorney,
[02:50:20.129 --> 02:50:23.354]  And now the world is rejecting our food and it's doing the opposite thing.
[02:50:36.753 --> 02:50:37.213]  Exactly.
[02:50:37.213 --> 02:50:41.235]  So it's a political influence over the scientific process almost every time.
[02:50:41.235 --> 02:50:44.516]  And there's a new example of like this I'd like to bring up after the break.
[02:50:44.516 --> 02:50:44.956]  We'll do that.
[02:50:44.956 --> 02:50:47.957]  And then I want to hear about some of the victims of Monsanto.
[02:50:47.957 --> 02:50:52.199]  Folks, you need to remember the true veterans of this war.
[02:50:52.199 --> 02:50:54.920]  By the way, folks, this is so sick.
[02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:56.080]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:50:57.661]  It's just, thank God people are waking up.
[02:50:59.687 --> 02:51:00.487]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:00.487 --> 02:51:02.288]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:02.288 --> 02:51:03.949]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:03.949 --> 02:51:06.770]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:06.770 --> 02:51:09.051]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:09.051 --> 02:51:13.573]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:54:00.754 --> 02:54:04.136]  There's another line from Bob Dylan.
[02:54:29.281 --> 02:54:30.821]  Sun down on the Union.
[02:54:30.821 --> 02:54:35.223]  They're gonna grow corn on the moon and eat it raw.
[02:54:35.223 --> 02:54:37.263]  Look at these headlines.
[02:54:37.263 --> 02:54:40.364]  EU passes controversial GMO food law.
[02:54:40.364 --> 02:54:44.445]  EU agrees to opt-out deal for GMO imports.
[02:54:44.445 --> 02:54:49.307]  Monsanto secretly gave money to farmer caught contaminating organic farms with GMOs.
[02:54:50.669 --> 02:54:51.330]  Record U.S.
[02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:54.793]  farmers switching to non-GMO crops in 2015.
[02:54:54.793 --> 02:54:58.476]  Hundreds of farmers block roads in protest of Monsanto GMO crops.
[02:54:58.476 --> 02:55:02.860]  Thousands of Polish farmers and GMOs land rights protests.
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:03.860]  Booming organics.
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:04.161]  U.S.
[02:55:04.161 --> 02:55:07.924]  farmers forced to import organic crops to meet non-GMO demand.
[02:55:07.924 --> 02:55:13.529]  That's what's in this TPP coming up, is more forced deals to accept all this.
[02:55:13.529 --> 02:55:16.932]  But then they won't let us label and just make our own choice.
[02:55:16.932 --> 02:55:18.153]  They're totalitarian.
[02:55:20.919 --> 02:55:27.903]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to go back to our guest, Jeffrey Smith, ResponsibleTechnology.org.
[02:55:27.903 --> 02:55:29.804]  You can find his books, his films there.
[02:55:29.804 --> 02:55:30.745]  Also, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:30.745 --> 02:55:32.866]  He's going to be with us for another five minutes.
[02:55:32.866 --> 02:55:34.968]  The next hour, Percy Smizer joins us.
[02:55:34.968 --> 02:55:36.589]  We're really focusing in on this today.
[02:55:36.589 --> 02:55:38.790]  I've got some other geopolitical news I'm going to get to.
[02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:39.390]  I haven't yet.
[02:55:39.390 --> 02:55:39.911]  I said I would.
[02:55:39.911 --> 02:55:41.231]  There's just so much of it.
[02:55:41.231 --> 02:55:43.453]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonButter.com.
[02:55:44.013 --> 02:55:59.397]  You wanted to get into one other issue before you got into the persecution that these groups, which is not just Monsanto, it's a whole combine of these organizations, but I'd say they're the biggest head on the Hydra, or I guess kind of the main head of Medusa, but there's a lot of snakes up in her hair.
[02:55:59.397 --> 02:56:01.898]  Maybe that's the best analogy.
[02:56:01.898 --> 02:56:02.518]  Please continue.
[02:56:03.536 --> 02:56:03.896]  Sure.
[02:56:03.896 --> 02:56:12.283]  By the way, I'm in Ecuador today because one of your listeners heard our interview earlier on, started studying my work, and invited me to come and speak in Ecuador.
[02:56:12.283 --> 02:56:13.123]  So thank you for that.
[02:56:13.123 --> 02:56:13.824]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:56:14.764 --> 02:56:23.332]  I was on the Daily Show recently and they did a terrible job in their coverage of the new genetically engineered non-browning potato and apple.
[02:56:23.332 --> 02:56:34.322]  I wrote a very long article on my website, ResponsibleTechnology.org, as to why this new technology may be far more dangerous than any of the other type of GMOs produced.
[02:56:35.063 --> 02:56:38.447]  It uses something called double-stranded RNA.
[02:56:38.447 --> 02:56:47.617]  Now the code on the RNA, little piece of RNA, matches up with the code of the DNA and silences the gene.
[02:56:47.617 --> 02:56:52.562]  So it silences the gene that produces the browning for the apple and the potato.
[02:56:53.263 --> 02:57:06.086]  But it turns out that if we eat the apple and potato, this double-stranded RNA code may match up with our gene code and silence or change our gene expression.
[02:57:06.086 --> 02:57:13.248]  Now, as an example, they fed some double-stranded RNA to honeybees, and it was supposed to have no effect.
[02:57:13.248 --> 02:57:14.969]  It was supposed to be the control group.
[02:57:15.629 --> 02:57:21.573]  It turns out it changed 1,461 genes levels of expression.
[02:57:21.573 --> 02:57:29.518]  That means 10% of the entire genome of the honeybees were affected when they were fed one single meal.
[02:57:29.518 --> 02:57:32.120]  This is pure madness.
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:33.781]  RNA is what viruses are made of.
[02:57:34.922 --> 02:57:41.313]  And when you then bring RNA into a plant or a human that's designed like this, it's beyond a virus.
[02:57:41.313 --> 02:57:44.118]  It's a turn-off or turn-on switch.
[02:57:44.118 --> 02:57:46.422]  It just sounds like something that would give you cancer to me.
[02:57:47.452 --> 02:57:52.394]  Well, it certainly could make changes that could possibly cause cancer, but we don't know.
[02:57:52.394 --> 02:58:02.218]  Now, the USDA's own scientists said, we don't have an assessment available to protect the public and environment from this double-stranded RNA.
[02:58:02.218 --> 02:58:05.659]  We need to completely revamp our risk assessment.
[02:58:05.659 --> 02:58:13.863]  Two years later, without revamping the risk assessment, the USDA went ahead and approved double-stranded RNA in food.
[02:58:14.543 --> 02:58:21.985]  Now, their excuse, their excuse as well as the excuse from regulators around the world is based on science that's 10 years old.
[02:58:21.985 --> 02:58:23.425]  Well, think how insane this is, though.
[02:58:23.425 --> 02:58:26.266]  It turns brown to let you know it's not as fresh.
[02:58:26.266 --> 02:58:27.166]  This is normal.
[02:58:27.166 --> 02:58:29.067]  It's like a vampire injection.
[02:58:29.067 --> 02:58:31.507]  So you don't need to have any oxygen, but you still are alive.
[02:58:31.507 --> 02:58:33.728]  I mean, this is just, this is insane.
[02:58:33.728 --> 02:58:34.208]  I mean, there's still...
[02:58:35.368 --> 02:58:38.673]  These apples can last 18 days without turning brown.
[02:58:38.673 --> 02:58:40.576]  The potatoes won't turn brown at all.
[02:58:40.576 --> 02:58:42.619]  They'll just dry up and disappear.
[02:58:42.619 --> 02:58:44.922]  And we don't know we're eating... Stay there, stay there, sir.
[02:58:44.922 --> 02:58:45.663]  I gotta get up.
[02:58:45.663 --> 02:58:46.484]  This is insane.
[02:58:46.484 --> 02:58:47.886]  It just gets worse by the...

[03:00:08.741 --> 03:00:20.644]  Coming up, you've seen mainstream news stories, TV stories from California to upstate New York about weird jihad camps and being funded by the government and even Washington Post articles about
[03:00:21.681 --> 03:00:23.527]  Hundreds of millions of dollars being given to these groups.
[03:00:25.014 --> 03:00:33.440]  Well, we've got an interview with Mark Hall coming up, documentary filmmaker on his film, Killing Ed, exposing the largest networks of charter schools in the U.S.
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:40.964]  run by fundamentalist Turkish imam, expelled from Turkey 16 years ago for pushing an Islamic state.
[03:00:40.964 --> 03:00:41.845]  This is where it comes from.
[03:00:41.845 --> 03:00:44.867]  A transnational caliphate.
[03:00:44.867 --> 03:00:49.630]  His network receives hundreds, this is one group, of millions a year in U.S.
[03:00:49.630 --> 03:00:50.631]  taxpayer funding.
[03:00:50.631 --> 03:00:52.032]  He's got some of these in Texas.
[03:00:52.032 --> 03:00:53.473]  And next, I'm letting folks know,
[03:00:54.895 --> 03:01:00.137]  Law enforcement and others who watch and listen just so we don't get overlap on this.
[03:01:00.137 --> 03:01:04.358]  When we're there, we're sending our crews out in the next few weeks.
[03:01:04.358 --> 03:01:07.279]  So this is the real deal.
[03:01:07.279 --> 03:01:11.320]  And it's coming up and more in the fourth hour with David Knight.
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:19.263]  Please tell your friends and family to tune in to Local Affiliates or InfoWars.com forward slash show where the free audio and video feeds are.
[03:01:19.263 --> 03:01:20.143]  And you have the power.
[03:01:21.243 --> 03:01:24.205]  You're the reason we're reaching more people and why we're being attacked.
[03:01:24.205 --> 03:01:25.366]  You're spreading the word.
[03:01:25.366 --> 03:01:27.328]  We're growing.
[03:01:27.328 --> 03:01:28.909]  Well, let's grow faster.
[03:01:28.909 --> 03:01:30.911]  Let's not get in a fight here and lose this thing.
[03:01:30.911 --> 03:01:33.313]  I mean, we've got to throw more coal on the fire.
[03:01:33.313 --> 03:01:35.635]  We've got to accelerate to attack speed.
[03:01:35.635 --> 03:01:38.897]  We've got to commit and go 110%.
[03:01:38.897 --> 03:01:40.278]  Feels good is all I can tell you.
[03:01:40.278 --> 03:01:40.899]  To be committed.
[03:01:40.899 --> 03:01:42.400]  To be fighting tyranny.
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:43.441]  Know I'm on the side of right.
[03:01:43.441 --> 03:01:44.321]  You are too.
[03:01:44.321 --> 03:01:45.442]  Let's take action, folks.
[03:01:45.442 --> 03:01:45.903]  Let's do it.
[03:01:47.369 --> 03:01:48.150]  Spread the word.
[03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.931]  Email everybody.
[03:01:48.931 --> 03:01:50.232]  Call everybody.
[03:01:50.232 --> 03:01:51.013]  Facebook, Twitter.
[03:01:51.013 --> 03:01:55.058]  Tell them to tune in right now to learn about real jihad training in America, U.S.
[03:01:55.058 --> 03:01:55.959]  government funded.
[03:01:55.959 --> 03:01:58.461]  This is sensational.
[03:01:58.461 --> 03:01:59.523]  But it's hiding in plain view.
[03:02:01.266 --> 03:02:03.747]  All right, let's go ahead now in the last three minutes we have.
[03:02:03.747 --> 03:02:06.628]  Dr. Grip, I want to shift yours out of the latest product.
[03:02:06.628 --> 03:02:07.489]  Years in development.
[03:02:07.489 --> 03:02:10.270]  You had your own product clinic developing this for your patients.
[03:02:10.270 --> 03:02:12.051]  Obviously now it's available to the general public.
[03:02:12.051 --> 03:02:19.834]  Theinfowarslife.com, Living Defense, Harmful Organism Cleansing Dietary Supplement, 120 big capsules.
[03:02:19.834 --> 03:02:22.715]  So what is the best way to take this?
[03:02:22.715 --> 03:02:23.636]  How should you take this?
[03:02:24.176 --> 03:02:31.821]  But the best way is three capsules, two times daily, two to three capsules, two times daily for six weeks.
[03:02:31.821 --> 03:02:37.125]  That seems to be the best getting for us to get the best results with that.
[03:02:37.125 --> 03:02:38.165]  I will say that.
[03:02:40.395 --> 03:02:43.278]  Some people may experience a healing crisis.
[03:02:43.278 --> 03:02:57.309]  Whenever you start eliminating some of these harmful organisms or they start breaking open, you can have these dead organisms inside your body and they can start to decay or be in there for a little while until your immune system can flush them out.
[03:02:57.309 --> 03:03:03.354]  So it's really good to drink a lot of extra water, exercise, get your blood moving and push all those out.
[03:03:03.354 --> 03:03:06.277]  I also recommend that people do intestinal cleansing.
[03:03:06.977 --> 03:03:08.118]  I'm almost scared to do it.
[03:03:21.875 --> 03:03:23.416]  But it's not that bad, trust me.
[03:03:23.416 --> 03:03:26.637]  I mean, the liver cleanse is probably the hardest out of all the cleanses.
[03:03:26.637 --> 03:03:30.019]  And it's easy for me, it was easy for me.
[03:03:30.019 --> 03:03:46.846]  99% of the people, when they do a harmful organism cleanse, maybe for the first few days they might be a little lethargic, but after that they're able to slowly eliminate and their body starts, their immune system starts to be built back up and they naturally get rid of these things.
[03:03:46.846 --> 03:03:50.168]  Why are you racist against pinworms, hookworms, tapeworms?
[03:03:51.108 --> 03:03:52.709]  Amoebas and other things.
[03:03:52.709 --> 03:03:54.671]  Why were you raised a bigot?
[03:03:54.671 --> 03:03:56.872]  You should accept it.
[03:03:56.872 --> 03:04:01.115]  Well, the thing is, there are good organisms, too, that live in our bodies.
[03:04:01.115 --> 03:04:05.158]  And that's, you know, it's always the fight against good and bad, right?
[03:04:05.158 --> 03:04:08.721]  So you want to have as many good organisms in your body.
[03:04:08.721 --> 03:04:09.682]  What are some of the good things?
[03:04:10.717 --> 03:04:17.959]  All your probiotics, your biodome inside your intestinal lining, those are going to be all... That's your first exposure point, like we've talked about.
[03:04:17.959 --> 03:04:20.020]  Now that's the extremists that have to be dealt with, right?
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:21.540]  That's the terrorists, you mean?
[03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:29.323]  Yeah, what we want to do is we want to have the good organisms in our body fighting against the bad organisms in our body.
[03:04:29.323 --> 03:04:30.123]  It's like, it's weird.
[03:04:30.623 --> 03:04:34.546]  We have the same scenario in our lives, but we also have the environment.
[03:04:34.546 --> 03:04:35.266]  Look at a forest.
[03:04:35.266 --> 03:04:35.947]  Look at a desert.
[03:04:35.947 --> 03:04:39.349]  It's all got that balance of stuff going on in it.
[03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:41.590]  Dr. Group, Global Healing Center dot com.
[03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:43.592]  Thank you so much for all your great work.
[03:04:43.592 --> 03:04:44.732]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[03:04:44.732 --> 03:04:45.413]  Appreciate it.
[03:04:45.413 --> 03:04:45.893]  You bet.
[03:04:45.893 --> 03:04:47.774]  Folks, this David Knight thing is big.
[03:04:47.774 --> 03:04:50.356]  When I looked into this a month ago, he was first working on it.
[03:04:50.356 --> 03:04:52.898]  And then a few weeks ago, I was just like, get out there, get out there, get out there.
[03:04:52.898 --> 03:04:57.661]  I mean, when I think about how sensational this is, if we expose this, it could really damage the globalist.
[03:04:58.837 --> 03:05:08.323]  Global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change, despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern U.S.
[03:05:08.323 --> 03:05:15.908]  The Climate Words for All coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City.
[03:05:15.908 --> 03:05:17.949]  These are New York City's largest buildings.
[03:05:18.169 --> 03:05:27.236]  Over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consists of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings, and multi-family housing developments, the report stated.
[03:05:27.236 --> 03:05:32.180]  The report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms.
[03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:43.409]  Global warming advocates, however, will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change, even though a few years ago, they were predicting that the Earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now.
[03:05:43.729 --> 03:05:49.416]  But they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood and tax the area.

[03:07:00.964 --> 03:07:01.824]  Mine!
[03:07:28.522 --> 03:07:28.922]  I think so.
[03:08:02.549 --> 03:08:09.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:12.164]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:15.683 --> 03:08:17.105]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:17.105 --> 03:08:22.031]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour, and we have a big fourth hour coming up.
[03:08:22.031 --> 03:08:26.256]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by documentary filmmaker Mark Hall.
[03:08:26.256 --> 03:08:28.919]  He's done a film called Killing Ed.
[03:08:28.919 --> 03:08:30.021]  I don't think it's been released yet.
[03:08:30.021 --> 03:08:33.585]  We'll talk to him about the details of when and where it's going to be released.
[03:08:34.286 --> 03:08:37.587]  But the key thing about this is this is a documentary about our schools.
[03:08:37.587 --> 03:08:38.647]  What's going on in the schools.
[03:08:38.647 --> 03:08:41.788]  A lot of people don't like what's happening with charter schools.
[03:08:41.788 --> 03:08:48.269]  I want to see educational choice, but I'm concerned when I see crony capitalism.
[03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:55.971]  The problem I see with charter schools is that the power, the money, is still being removed from the local community at a very high level.
[03:08:55.971 --> 03:09:01.272]  That invites corruption, but it also invites something else in this case, which you really need to pay attention to.
[03:09:02.256 --> 03:09:05.357]  This is a story that really shows the worst case.
[03:09:05.357 --> 03:09:09.059]  This film shows the worst case of what can happen with charter schools.
[03:09:09.059 --> 03:09:17.603]  And I think the Fatala Gulen schools, essentially controlled and run by an exiled Islamic imam from Turkey.
[03:09:18.423 --> 03:09:22.649]  He proposed a transnational caliphate.
[03:09:22.649 --> 03:09:25.613]  He called it an Islamic State, having run out of Turkey.
[03:09:25.613 --> 03:09:32.281]  He was thrown out of Turkey back in 1999, so that's how long the Islamic State, IS, has been around, okay?
[03:09:32.281 --> 03:09:33.162]  But of course, he's not...
[03:09:34.278 --> 03:09:38.943]  Creating moderate rebels inside these countries that are already at war.
[03:09:38.943 --> 03:09:44.168]  No, the real thing we need to be concerned about is the education of our children.
[03:09:44.168 --> 03:09:50.695]  And in other countries, these schools that are run by the Gulen movement are explicitly Islamic.
[03:09:51.687 --> 03:09:55.469]  They're religious schools and there's a lot of questionable things about these schools.
[03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:58.831]  We're going to talk about that when he joins us in the next break.
[03:09:58.831 --> 03:10:03.274]  I want to tell you about what we're going to do tonight with the live debate coverage.
[03:10:03.274 --> 03:10:09.298]  Our Political Science 3000 debate coverage is going to resume tonight with our Celebrity Big Brother debate being held.
[03:10:09.298 --> 03:10:10.739]  I think this one is in Wisconsin.
[03:10:10.739 --> 03:10:14.781]  The key thing is it's going to be Fox News business that's going to be doing this.
[03:10:14.781 --> 03:10:18.864]  It's going to be Neil Cavuto and another moderator asking them questions.
[03:10:19.224 --> 03:10:19.984]  This is going to be different.
[03:10:19.984 --> 03:10:22.285]  This one is really going to be about issues.
[03:10:22.285 --> 03:10:27.486]  But, of course, it's going to be about jobs, taxes, the economy, foreign policy, the same stuff they always talk about.
[03:10:27.486 --> 03:10:30.746]  You know, will they talk about the militarized police state?
[03:10:30.746 --> 03:10:32.907]  Will they talk about the surveillance state?
[03:10:32.907 --> 03:10:36.728]  Will they talk about the war on our people that they call prohibition?
[03:10:36.728 --> 03:10:37.928]  Actually, they do call it a war.
[03:10:37.928 --> 03:10:39.348]  They call it the war on drugs.
[03:10:39.348 --> 03:10:43.249]  Actually, it's the war of drugs against the American people.
[03:10:43.709 --> 03:10:46.391]  We're going to talk about the candidates' responses to that.
[03:10:46.391 --> 03:10:50.075]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to let you know that we have a new product.
[03:10:50.075 --> 03:10:53.357]  You just heard Alex Jones talking to Dr. Group about this.
[03:10:53.357 --> 03:10:55.279]  Living Defense by InfoWars.
[03:10:55.279 --> 03:10:56.280]  Statistics are clear.
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:59.202]  Nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms.
[03:10:59.202 --> 03:11:05.047]  These toxic organisms can be transmitted by people, by pets, by food, the environment, so many other sources.
[03:11:05.047 --> 03:11:09.151]  Once they've made it into your body, they steal your nutrients, they release toxic waste.
[03:11:09.151 --> 03:11:10.212]  So this is one way
[03:11:10.793 --> 03:11:12.818]  To get rid of toxic parasites.
[03:11:12.818 --> 03:11:13.920]  It's a new product.
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:14.421]  Living Defense.
[03:11:15.373 --> 03:11:18.256]  You can find it at Infowarslife.com today.
[03:11:18.256 --> 03:11:27.263]  They're going to do one thing that I would like to see them talk about, and I don't know if they will talk about this or not, of course, that is the candidates' positions on drugs.
[03:11:27.263 --> 03:11:29.966]  I guess we could call this the candidates on drugs.
[03:11:29.966 --> 03:11:32.428]  You could say, what have they been smoking?
[03:11:32.428 --> 03:11:41.476]  I don't know, but they're basically, they found a way to make themselves approachable, to make themselves look like every man.
[03:11:42.338 --> 03:11:47.841]  And of course we had Carly Fiorina was the first one to do this back in the first debate in September.
[03:11:47.841 --> 03:11:49.142]  She talked about her daughter.
[03:11:49.142 --> 03:11:55.085]  She says, I very much hope that I'm the only person on this stage who can say this, but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing.
[03:11:55.085 --> 03:11:59.448]  My husband Frank and I buried a child to drug addiction.
[03:11:59.448 --> 03:12:06.452]  Now, she didn't tell you what kind of drug addiction that was because she didn't want to talk about the fact that she lost her daughter to prescription drugs and alcohol abuse.
[03:12:07.566 --> 03:12:10.689]  No, it's her stepdaughter who was an adult at the time.
[03:12:10.689 --> 03:12:14.091]  Similar thing is going on now with Chris Christie and Jeb Bush.
[03:12:14.091 --> 03:12:22.719]  Jeb Bush, if you remember, when he was governor, his daughter ran into some problems and he castigated the press for talking about that.
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:25.902]  Chris Christie, but now he's talking about it.
[03:12:25.902 --> 03:12:27.244]  Now it's cool.
[03:12:27.244 --> 03:12:31.590]  This is the new Jeb can fix it Bush.
[03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:35.315]  This is the new Jeb Bush that doesn't wear a tie, doesn't wear a jacket either.
[03:12:35.315 --> 03:12:36.997]  He just goes out and talks.
[03:12:36.997 --> 03:12:38.018]  He's the everyman.
[03:12:39.076 --> 03:12:39.937]  That's the new approach.
[03:12:39.937 --> 03:12:46.062]  And so now that new Jeb Bush is going to capitalize on his daughter's problems with drug addiction.
[03:12:46.062 --> 03:12:46.562]  And you know what?
[03:12:46.562 --> 03:12:47.603]  It is a problem.
[03:12:47.603 --> 03:12:51.687]  Here's an article that we had just last week.
[03:12:51.687 --> 03:12:52.888]  46,471 drug overdoses.
[03:12:52.888 --> 03:12:56.791]  More Americans die from drug overdoses than from car crashes or guns.
[03:12:56.791 --> 03:12:57.432]  But guess what?
[03:12:58.291 --> 03:13:01.933]  The worst drug overdoses are from prescription drugs.
[03:13:01.933 --> 03:13:08.276]  You know, the same things that cause problems for Carly Fiorina's daughter, for Jeb Bush's daughter.
[03:13:08.276 --> 03:13:09.397]  Prescription drugs.
[03:13:09.397 --> 03:13:12.278]  Are they going to make those illegal?
[03:13:12.278 --> 03:13:13.519]  I don't know.
[03:13:13.519 --> 03:13:19.642]  Also, we had a report this weekend, DEA report says heroin and meth seizures are up 300% in Arizona.
[03:13:21.829 --> 03:13:24.630]  Is that a sign that the war on drugs is working?
[03:13:24.630 --> 03:13:25.951]  I don't think so.
[03:13:25.951 --> 03:13:29.652]  I think this is a sign that we have the tip of the iceberg.
[03:13:29.652 --> 03:13:32.973]  Very similar to what we saw happening in the Antarctic.
[03:13:32.973 --> 03:13:33.633]  Remember?
[03:13:33.633 --> 03:13:39.756]  We had reports of Antarctic ice flows melting off and breaking off, increasing dramatically.
[03:13:39.756 --> 03:13:41.296]  And everybody said, look at that!
[03:13:41.296 --> 03:13:42.357]  The polar caps are melting.
[03:13:43.277 --> 03:13:51.786]  And NASA, NASA came out and said, no, based on our satellite information, yes, there is an increase in ice that is breaking up.
[03:13:51.786 --> 03:13:56.191]  But if you look at other parts of Antarctica, there are record amounts of ice.
[03:13:56.191 --> 03:13:58.914]  There's a net increase of ice.
[03:13:58.914 --> 03:14:01.837]  That's why you're seeing an increase and it melting in the
[03:14:02.998 --> 03:14:06.580]  In one area, is because it is going up by record amounts.
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:13.604]  It's a similar situation where you see the heroin, the meth showing up in record amounts, 300%.
[03:14:13.604 --> 03:14:19.087]  I think that's an indication that the trafficking has gone up.
[03:14:19.087 --> 03:14:23.230]  We know that's what happened in Afghanistan, when America went into Afghanistan.
[03:14:24.190 --> 03:14:33.478]  The Taliban had reduced the growing of heroin and when we went in there, it went from about 10% of the world's supply up into the upper 90s now.
[03:14:33.478 --> 03:14:37.382]  Every year they have a record crop since the American government has gone into Afghanistan.
[03:14:37.382 --> 03:14:42.806]  We've got a record crop of poppies that they use to make heroin and other opiates.
[03:14:43.467 --> 03:14:49.913]  But the 2016ers, as they say in CNN, are now opening up about drug addiction fights because it is now cool.
[03:14:49.913 --> 03:14:52.115]  It is now a way to connect with the people.
[03:14:52.115 --> 03:14:56.779]  They point out Jeb Bush on the campaign trail in New Hampshire spoke in emotional terms.
[03:14:56.779 --> 03:15:00.523]  He says, uh, I visited my daughter in jail.
[03:15:00.523 --> 03:15:03.105]  I never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail.
[03:15:03.906 --> 03:15:09.799]  And then he did what I imagine he should have said right after that is, so I got her out.
[03:15:09.799 --> 03:15:13.948]  You know, there's not going to be any mandatory minimums for the Bush clan, are there?
[03:15:14.980 --> 03:15:16.802]  That's the insanity of the drug war.
[03:15:16.802 --> 03:15:21.066]  Of course, that started with the revered Ronald Reagan, these mandatory minimums.
[03:15:21.066 --> 03:15:27.412]  But in her case, she was arrested in 2002 at the age of 24 for trying to fill a false prescription.
[03:15:27.412 --> 03:15:29.414]  She was sentenced to 10 days in jail.
[03:15:29.414 --> 03:15:30.055]  10 days.
[03:15:30.055 --> 03:15:30.656]  10 days.
[03:15:30.656 --> 03:15:34.179]  Not 10 years, like your daughter would be sentenced.
[03:15:34.179 --> 03:15:37.602]  No, the Bush daughter gets 10 days in jail.
[03:15:37.602 --> 03:15:38.904]  And it's because of contempt.
[03:15:39.718 --> 03:15:44.313]  Because after they put her in a drug rehab program, they found her with crack cocaine.
[03:15:44.313 --> 03:15:45.436]  Now, let me tell you something.
[03:15:47.265 --> 03:15:59.350]  If you were not a Bush drug-pushing member of that family, you were found with prescription drug abuse, you were found with crack cocaine, you would get a lot more than 10 days.
[03:15:59.350 --> 03:16:02.452]  But now, he wants to connect with everybody.
[03:16:02.452 --> 03:16:07.174]  He wants to tell everybody that he understands that he feels our pain.
[03:16:07.174 --> 03:16:08.915]  I don't really know what his prescription is.
[03:16:08.915 --> 03:16:13.056]  I know that Chris Christie had a viral video this Saturday when I looked at it.
[03:16:13.056 --> 03:16:15.377]  It had over 4 million views.
[03:16:15.377 --> 03:16:16.278]  He was saying, OK, fine.
[03:16:17.093 --> 03:16:21.497]  They bumped me off of the debate, but I'm gonna get to people with videos like this.
[03:16:21.497 --> 03:16:24.280]  And they had a very slickly produced video.
[03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:26.782]  Ultra, ultra close-up on his face.
[03:16:28.021 --> 03:16:30.723]  And, you know, so you could see the emotion.
[03:16:30.723 --> 03:16:32.845]  Very dramatic effect.
[03:16:32.845 --> 03:16:39.310]  And he goes through a long story about a friend that he had from law school, and he makes a case about how this guy had everything.
[03:16:39.310 --> 03:16:43.233]  Very successful in law school, very successful as a lawyer.
[03:16:43.233 --> 03:16:46.916]  He had a beautiful family, a lot of money, and all this.
[03:16:46.916 --> 03:16:51.259]  He lost everything because of prescription drug abuse.
[03:16:51.259 --> 03:16:52.080]  He hurt his back.
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:53.681]  He went to an M.D.
[03:16:53.681 --> 03:16:54.301]  and the M.D.
[03:16:54.301 --> 03:16:56.003]  put him on painkillers, Percocet.
[03:16:56.980 --> 03:17:02.405]  And because of the Percocet prescription, he got addicted to that.
[03:17:02.405 --> 03:17:03.546]  He lost his job.
[03:17:03.546 --> 03:17:04.587]  He lost his money.
[03:17:04.587 --> 03:17:05.707]  He lost his family.
[03:17:05.707 --> 03:17:07.469]  And eventually, he committed suicide.
[03:17:07.469 --> 03:17:08.750]  And you can see that if you're watching this.
[03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:11.773]  You can see how tight and close that is.
[03:17:11.773 --> 03:17:13.414]  Extreme close-up on Chris Christie.
[03:17:13.414 --> 03:17:17.658]  Because this is about making a visceral connection with the public.
[03:17:17.658 --> 03:17:19.259]  That's what this is really about.
[03:17:19.259 --> 03:17:21.161]  So, Chris Christie tells again, like,
[03:17:21.761 --> 03:17:26.285]  Carly Fiorina telling about her daughter who is addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol.
[03:17:26.285 --> 03:17:32.551]  Chris Christie tells about a friend that he had who died from prescription drug abuse.
[03:17:32.551 --> 03:17:35.133]  And then they pivot to marijuana.
[03:17:35.133 --> 03:17:35.793]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:17:36.519 --> 03:17:37.300]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:17:37.300 --> 03:17:38.281]  Doesn't that tell you something?
[03:17:38.281 --> 03:17:39.822]  It certainly tells me something.
[03:17:39.822 --> 03:17:53.253]  But of course, it's interesting that Chris Christie says that he's going to shut down the Tenth Amendment for Colorado and Oregon and Washington, these states who have legalized marijuana because they realize that the war on drugs is a failure.
[03:17:53.253 --> 03:17:57.057]  Chris Christie will say that it's a failure, but then he wants to continue it.
[03:17:57.870 --> 03:18:05.175]  His only concession is that he wants to imprison the drug sellers and not the drug buyers.
[03:18:05.175 --> 03:18:07.876]  Well, here's a news flash for Chris Christie.
[03:18:07.876 --> 03:18:08.757]  We've been there.
[03:18:08.757 --> 03:18:09.778]  We've done that.
[03:18:09.778 --> 03:18:11.579]  We did that with alcohol prohibition.
[03:18:11.579 --> 03:18:14.521]  We only went after the Al Capones.
[03:18:14.521 --> 03:18:18.984]  See, what changed was under Ronald Reagan, we went after the end user.
[03:18:19.764 --> 03:18:22.485]  That's how abhorrent this thing has become.
[03:18:22.485 --> 03:18:24.706]  The 44 years of failed policy.
[03:18:24.706 --> 03:18:26.366]  We went after the end user.
[03:18:26.366 --> 03:18:30.827]  Yeah, they only went after the drug dealers under alcohol prohibition, and it was a failure.
[03:18:30.827 --> 03:18:37.129]  And as Chris Christie, a lawyer, should understand, we needed a constitutional amendment for alcohol prohibition.
[03:18:37.129 --> 03:18:45.532]  Where is your constitutional amendment, Chris Christie, to prohibit marijuana or any of the other things that you say you have the authority to throw us in jail for life about?
[03:18:46.152 --> 03:18:58.635]  Okay, what you have done, and what you need to understand, is that these people who have foisted this war of prohibition on us, it's not about using drugs, because people are going to use drugs anyway, aren't they?
[03:18:58.635 --> 03:19:00.875]  Aren't they still using drugs after 44 years?
[03:19:00.875 --> 03:19:08.677]  That has been a total failure, and he's right, it has been a total failure in terms of trying to stop people from using drugs, but it has been an immense success.
[03:19:09.497 --> 03:19:13.919]  At creating very powerful monopolistic black markets for drug cartels.
[03:19:13.919 --> 03:19:16.700]  It's been a success at completely destroying the rule of law.
[03:19:16.700 --> 03:19:19.741]  It's been a success at creating a militarized police state.
[03:19:19.741 --> 03:19:21.581]  And he wants to continue with that.
[03:19:21.581 --> 03:19:22.862]  He wants to continue with that.
[03:19:22.862 --> 03:19:28.284]  Now, Bernie Sanders says he wants to, just for marijuana, he has introduced a bill.
[03:19:28.284 --> 03:19:29.664]  And fine, better late than never.
[03:19:29.664 --> 03:19:31.245]  Where has he been for the last 44 years?
[03:19:31.245 --> 03:19:35.006]  He wants to introduce a bill to basically take marijuana off the list.
[03:19:35.626 --> 03:19:37.927]  Hillary Clinton says, well, let's remove it from the FDA list.
[03:19:37.927 --> 03:19:39.067]  It's not the FDA list.
[03:19:39.067 --> 03:19:44.789]  That Schedule 1 through 4 list, that was created by the UN 10 years before Nixon's war on drugs.
[03:19:44.789 --> 03:19:45.749]  That's what this is really about.
[03:19:45.749 --> 03:19:49.330]  The only person who got it right was Donald Trump 25 years ago.
[03:19:49.330 --> 03:19:51.171]  Will he have the guts to say it again?
[03:19:51.171 --> 03:19:54.312]  That the only way to stop this, this whole thing is a joke.
[03:19:54.312 --> 03:19:56.432]  We have to legalize drugs to win the war.
[03:19:56.432 --> 03:19:58.613]  We have to take away the profit from the drug czars.
[03:20:01.755 --> 03:20:06.396]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:06.396 --> 03:20:10.677]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:10.677 --> 03:20:12.058]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:12.058 --> 03:20:17.299]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water, but have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:17.299 --> 03:20:19.500]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:19.500 --> 03:20:21.781]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:21.781 --> 03:20:23.441]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:23.441 --> 03:20:25.922]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:25.922 --> 03:20:29.963]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:30.803 --> 03:20:31.924]  Another concern?
[03:20:31.924 --> 03:20:35.906]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:35.906 --> 03:20:38.488]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:38.488 --> 03:20:42.471]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:42.471 --> 03:20:45.253]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:45.253 --> 03:20:49.916]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[03:20:53.558 --> 03:20:54.919]  You'll never be cold again.

[03:24:11.676 --> 03:24:16.602]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, November 10th, 2015.
[03:24:16.602 --> 03:24:26.754]  Joining me now is Mark Hall, producer and director of a new documentary film called Killing Ed, subtitled Charter Schools, Corruption, and the Glenn Movement in America.
[03:24:27.595 --> 03:24:29.898]  This is something that is very important.
[03:24:29.898 --> 03:24:32.981]  As Alex was pointing out, you need to understand what is going on.
[03:24:32.981 --> 03:24:35.844]  I support freedom of choice in education.
[03:24:35.844 --> 03:24:38.426]  I support parental involvement in education.
[03:24:38.426 --> 03:24:41.750]  But we need to very carefully look at the structures that we're going to use with this.
[03:24:42.549 --> 03:24:48.572]  Certainly, I think charter schools have a possibility of, and we've seen this happen, of crony capitalism.
[03:24:48.572 --> 03:24:50.594]  There's a lot of money in this pot.
[03:24:50.594 --> 03:24:51.374]  There's a lot of money.
[03:24:51.374 --> 03:25:01.520]  We're going to talk about how much money the largest organization, the largest network of charter schools gets is actually run by an Islamic imam
[03:25:02.140 --> 03:25:15.546]  Exiled from Turkey and brought into the United States, and he has the largest network of schools So Mark when you did this you weren't went for I guess really the worst case example of what can go wrong with a charter school Yeah, absolutely David.
[03:25:15.546 --> 03:25:15.906]  Thanks.
[03:25:15.906 --> 03:25:16.927]  Thanks for having me here today
[03:25:18.027 --> 03:25:26.974]  Yeah, Killing Ed is really showing us the worst case scenario in this lightly regulated charter school system that we've set up in our country.
[03:25:26.974 --> 03:25:35.481]  I started shooting this film a number of years ago after seeing the Gulen movement and its schools grow in number here in Texas.
[03:25:35.481 --> 03:25:40.225]  They had the largest number of schools here in Texas, roughly about 46 I believe now.
[03:25:40.225 --> 03:25:42.467]  We just added one today.
[03:25:42.947 --> 03:25:45.571]  You were kind enough to bring us a press release.
[03:25:45.571 --> 03:25:54.183]  And get this, this is coming from the Austin Police Department talking about a new Fatala Gulen school that's being opened up here in Austin.
[03:25:54.183 --> 03:25:59.110]  That's one of the things that really came out in this documentary was how the Gulen movement
[03:25:59.591 --> 03:26:08.856]  Has connected itself with law enforcement, with congressmen, with local and state government, with contractors, all these different, but they really are totally connected.
[03:26:08.856 --> 03:26:12.678]  Of course, there were pictures in your documentary of Art Acevedo.
[03:26:15.439 --> 03:26:20.922]  Congressman McCaul, who is head of Homeland Security, you would think he would know a little bit better.
[03:26:20.922 --> 03:26:22.603]  You would think that he would vet this.
[03:26:22.603 --> 03:26:28.425]  Maybe he does, because we've seen what's going on with ISIS in Syria and the Middle East.
[03:26:28.425 --> 03:26:35.489]  We've seen that when our government creates a terrorist, arms a terrorist, trains a terrorist, gives them money, they're moderate terrorists.
[03:26:35.489 --> 03:26:38.610]  We've got that picture up on our website today, as a matter of fact.
[03:26:38.610 --> 03:26:40.051]  They have a terrorist and has a
[03:26:40.131 --> 03:26:49.999]  A guy in a balaclava holding an AK-47 and then next to him the exact same picture but it says moderate terrorist because in his left hand he's holding a small American flag.
[03:26:49.999 --> 03:27:06.473]  And so we have talked about how our government has been involved with the creation of ISIS, with the creation of these jihadis using them as surrogates in wars, but this is something that we all should be very much aware of, very concerned about, that this Islamic cleric who
[03:27:06.493 --> 03:27:16.619]  Who floated the idea of the Islamic State, of a transnational caliphate, way back in the 90s, and was thrown out of Turkey because of that, is brought into the United States by the CIA.
[03:27:16.619 --> 03:27:18.780]  They give him letters of recommendation.
[03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:23.943]  Rand Corporation, former bigwig there, gave him letters of recommendation.
[03:27:23.943 --> 03:27:29.746]  So he was brought into the United States, ushered in by the CIA, even though many people opposed him.
[03:27:29.906 --> 03:27:36.709]  Who knew what he was about, and now he's running the biggest network of charter schools in the United States, getting federal taxpayer money.
[03:27:36.709 --> 03:27:37.429]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:41.811]  I mean, we know that Fethullah Gulen came to the United States in 1999.
[03:27:41.811 --> 03:27:49.075]  He had been indicted by the Turkish government at that time for trying to overthrow the Turkish secular government.
[03:27:49.075 --> 03:27:58.519]  He was trying to install a theocratic government, and he came to the United States ostensibly on a medical reason for diabetes, I understand.
[03:27:59.059 --> 03:28:11.615]  And he set himself up in the Poconos of Northeastern Pennsylvania, where he lives with several hundred of his followers, and he's operating this global Islamic movement from that location.
[03:28:11.615 --> 03:28:13.037]  Now, it's very gutsy.
[03:28:13.037 --> 03:28:16.701]  In the documentary, you actually go to the gates of his compound.
[03:28:16.701 --> 03:28:17.102]  Exactly.
[03:28:17.102 --> 03:28:17.963]  It's a very gutsy move.
[03:28:18.163 --> 03:28:18.463]  Right.
[03:28:18.463 --> 03:28:22.607]  We've been there a couple of times and they're not happy to see us.
[03:28:22.607 --> 03:28:24.288]  They don't really want to live out in the open.
[03:28:24.288 --> 03:28:27.110]  It's a very secretive group.
[03:28:27.110 --> 03:28:36.138]  We know that their schools here in the United States are bringing in followers that follow him from Turkey, you know, that believe in the Gulen movement's agenda.
[03:28:36.778 --> 03:28:41.041]  And they're teaching at these schools, not only here in Texas, but all over the United States.
[03:28:41.041 --> 03:28:43.723]  There's a lot of instructors who come in from Turkey.
[03:28:43.723 --> 03:28:44.423]  Absolutely.
[03:28:44.423 --> 03:28:48.206]  And they always do this under the beard, just like they're doing this, the school that opens today.
[03:28:48.206 --> 03:28:56.692]  And as I remarked to you when we were way, you know, during the commercial break, so this is a strange time of the year to open up a new school, you know, in the middle of November.
[03:28:56.852 --> 03:28:58.073]  But they're opening up a new school.
[03:28:58.073 --> 03:29:03.379]  The Austin Police Department is going to be there, cutting the ribbon with them for this opening ceremony.
[03:29:03.379 --> 03:29:08.405]  And they call them the Harmony Public Schools STEM-based curriculum.
[03:29:08.405 --> 03:29:10.908]  And that's science, technology, engineering, and math.
[03:29:10.908 --> 03:29:14.192]  But they always talk about the Harmony Schools of Science and Math.
[03:29:14.192 --> 03:29:14.652]  Yes.
[03:29:14.652 --> 03:29:15.213]  That's the beard.
[03:29:15.433 --> 03:29:27.761]  Well, that is one of the things that they're using, I think, to get our support, to get our politicians' support, is that we're somehow needing more STEM, you know, teachers, and we need more STEM-educated students.
[03:29:27.761 --> 03:29:28.922]  It's really just a ruse.
[03:29:28.922 --> 03:29:29.382]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:29:29.382 --> 03:29:43.532]  People are very much interested in having a science and technology education for their children, rightfully so, but the question we're going to address when we come back is, are they getting that, or are they getting a propaganda education towards Turkey, towards Islam?
[03:29:43.532 --> 03:29:43.892]  Stay with us.
[03:29:43.892 --> 03:29:45.053]  We'll be right back with Mark Hall.
[03:29:48.298 --> 03:29:49.701]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.701 --> 03:29:52.225]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.225 --> 03:29:54.929]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.025 --> 03:30:04.749]  Hamtramck, Michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority Muslim city in the U.S.
[03:30:04.749 --> 03:30:11.694]  For example, business owners routinely advertise their products in Arabic and they can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque.
[03:30:11.694 --> 03:30:16.977]  But besides this cultural shift, Hamtramck also serves as a microcosm of America's economy.
[03:30:16.977 --> 03:30:22.261]  Hamtramck was the home of a Chrysler automobile plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s.
[03:30:22.981 --> 03:30:26.982]  Everything from Plymouth Barracudas to Dodge Chargers were built at the Hamtramck plant.
[03:30:26.982 --> 03:30:30.264]  But now the plant is closed down just like America's manufacturing base.
[03:30:30.264 --> 03:30:30.744]  When the U.S.
[03:30:30.744 --> 03:30:34.745]  dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange decades ago, the U.S.
[03:30:34.745 --> 03:30:36.606]  still had a strong manufacturing base.
[03:30:36.606 --> 03:30:42.248]  But now it doesn't, and the only reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar.
[03:30:42.248 --> 03:30:47.610]  But eventually other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture anything anymore.
[03:30:47.850 --> 03:30:49.031]  When that happens, the U.S.
[03:30:49.031 --> 03:30:52.996]  economy will close down just like the Hamtramck automobile plant did so many years ago.
[03:30:52.996 --> 03:30:57.621]  This is Kit Daniels and visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.

[03:32:57.842 --> 03:33:06.707]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.707 --> 03:33:08.988]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:13.075 --> 03:33:14.416]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.416 --> 03:33:15.117]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:15.117 --> 03:33:20.380]  Your host joining me now is Mark Hall, and he's done a film called Killing Ed.
[03:33:20.380 --> 03:33:21.641]  He's a documentary filmmaker.
[03:33:21.641 --> 03:33:27.125]  He's producer and director of this film, and I was able to see an advanced copy of this.
[03:33:27.125 --> 03:33:28.086]  Thank you for inviting me, Mark.
[03:33:28.086 --> 03:33:29.267]  Absolutely.
[03:33:29.267 --> 03:33:34.711]  You invited me because I talked about Fatala Ghulain, and this is something people need to be aware of.
[03:33:34.711 --> 03:33:37.373]  There were many things that I learned from the film about the Ghulain
[03:33:40.055 --> 03:33:43.717]  It is the largest charter school movement in the United States.
[03:33:43.717 --> 03:33:44.658]  Actually, the largest in the world.
[03:33:44.658 --> 03:33:46.780]  They've got 180 countries that they're in.
[03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:49.381]  Many people estimate it at over 1,000 schools worldwide.
[03:33:49.381 --> 03:33:52.203]  We just had another one open up here in Austin.
[03:33:52.203 --> 03:34:03.171]  And the Austin Police Department sent out a press release that Mark sent me today talking about how they have a new school opening here in Austin with 540 students.
[03:34:03.171 --> 03:34:05.213]  This is the way they expand.
[03:34:05.213 --> 03:34:06.093]  And, of course,
[03:34:07.254 --> 03:34:08.535]  We're seeing this all over the place.
[03:34:08.535 --> 03:34:16.221]  A couple years ago, The Atlantic was talking about, just in Texas, they were getting $100 million a year.
[03:34:16.221 --> 03:34:16.401]  Right.
[03:34:16.401 --> 03:34:20.224]  So this has to be a huge amount of money that is being channeled to them.
[03:34:20.224 --> 03:34:33.214]  Your documentary talks about what's going on in the educational establishment, the impact of charter schools, the possibility for corruption, for crony capitalism with the charter school mechanism, because there is a huge pot of money
[03:34:33.874 --> 03:34:39.741]  That is, and the federal coffers is being handed out to anybody that can meet these qualifications to start a charter school.
[03:34:39.741 --> 03:34:44.886]  So that is a problem right there, okay, that we need to look at.
[03:34:44.886 --> 03:34:48.210]  But you look at the very worst case, the Glenn movement.
[03:34:49.672 --> 03:34:50.352]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:34:50.352 --> 03:34:55.497]  I was just going to say, I mean, you know, the new school that's open today is one of six here in Austin.
[03:34:55.497 --> 03:35:00.982]  You know, they're educating roughly a little over 60,000 students across the United States now.
[03:35:00.982 --> 03:35:01.342]  Wow.
[03:35:01.342 --> 03:35:09.269]  And they're bringing in, you know, many thousands of teachers who are followers of Imam Gulen on H-1B visas to teach at the schools.
[03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:11.031]  We talked a little bit about STEM education.
[03:35:11.611 --> 03:35:19.116]  A lot of the politicians that you see in the film are saying, you know, we need to have more teachers that are qualified to teach these STEM subjects.
[03:35:19.116 --> 03:35:22.578]  Science, engineering, these technology subjects.
[03:35:22.578 --> 03:35:24.159]  But really, it's a ruse.
[03:35:24.159 --> 03:35:32.405]  It's really a falsehood to bring in these followers from Turkey who are, you know, they have sworn their allegiance to Imam Fethullah Gulen.
[03:35:32.685 --> 03:35:33.887]  It is a religious movement.
[03:35:33.887 --> 03:35:36.751]  It is a transnational caliphate that he's trying to set up.
[03:35:36.751 --> 03:35:43.740]  He talked about an Islamic state and got thrown out of Turkey in the 1990s, brought into the United States then by the CIA to set this up.
[03:35:43.740 --> 03:35:48.606]  That's everybody's concern, is that what he is setting up here is not a bunch of schools of science and math.
[03:35:49.127 --> 03:35:56.054]  But what he's setting up here is Islamic madrasas, like he has set up and has explicitly done in Islamic countries.
[03:35:56.054 --> 03:36:05.003]  Some of his detractors have called his educational institutions educational jihad, because what you see in the schools here in the United States and elsewhere
[03:36:05.663 --> 03:36:09.586]  Is intense national turkification of their children.
[03:36:09.586 --> 03:36:20.556]  So instead of teaching Spanish as a language in many of the schools here on the border of Mexico, you're seeing these schools primarily teach Turkish to these young children.
[03:36:20.796 --> 03:36:21.496]  Yes.
[03:36:21.496 --> 03:36:23.097]  And these are not Turkish kids.
[03:36:23.097 --> 03:36:26.098]  These are kids that come from a variety of backgrounds.
[03:36:26.098 --> 03:36:30.680]  Hispanics, Caucasians, African Americans.
[03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:36.462]  And the question is, why are they being so intensively taught a love of Turkey when they should be...
[03:36:37.022 --> 03:36:37.563]  We're good to go.
[03:36:52.839 --> 03:37:00.881]  They come in and they're giving them a lot of Turkish culture, teaching them the Turkish language, sending them on trips to Turkey.
[03:37:00.881 --> 03:37:01.542]  Exactly.
[03:37:01.542 --> 03:37:06.363]  Every year, thousands of these children are going to Turkey for the summer.
[03:37:06.363 --> 03:37:09.024]  I've talked to parents that have gone on these trips.
[03:37:09.024 --> 03:37:20.507]  We don't cover it very much in the film, but you do see, you know, students from even public schools that somehow have been invited to go on these trips to Turkey as a result of the Gulen movement.
[03:37:20.507 --> 03:37:22.408]  And they get a Disneyland experience when they go.
[03:37:22.568 --> 03:37:30.291]  Well they get an experience that's not really the real Turkey and I think this is what irks the secular Turks that we should be supporting in Turkey.
[03:37:30.291 --> 03:37:39.835]  We should not be supporting a global Islamic movement here in our country because they're getting in excess of 500 million dollars a year in taxpayer funds.
[03:37:39.835 --> 03:37:40.375]  That's amazing.
[03:37:40.495 --> 03:37:47.317]  These are funds that you and I are giving to our government, and they're going directly to this organization.
[03:37:47.317 --> 03:37:53.518]  Now, a lot of that money is going to the schools, to operate the schools, to pay salaries.
[03:37:53.518 --> 03:38:03.741]  However, you'll find that young teachers that are coming to work at these schools, that are not affiliated with the Gulen movement, are being paid a lot less than the Turkish teachers that are coming over.
[03:38:04.241 --> 03:38:21.725]  Now, a part of that money evidently and apparently is being skimmed every year to go to the non-educational purposes that Fethullah Gulen has for his followers, including what I consider a very soft civil war that's occurring right now in Turkey.
[03:38:22.065 --> 03:38:23.565]  Yeah, we see that happening all the time.
[03:38:23.565 --> 03:38:29.407]  There's news of Gulen followers being arrested by the Erdogan government.
[03:38:29.407 --> 03:38:37.469]  And so there are people that are high in the Turkish government that are trying to arrest and then release people who are Gulen followers.
[03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:39.630]  And then, you know, so there's a back and forth.
[03:38:40.010 --> 03:38:45.275]  They're arrested, released, arrested, released, and you point out it's an ongoing, I said, looks like they're on the cusp of a civil war.
[03:38:45.275 --> 03:38:47.417]  You said it's kind of a soft civil war right now.
[03:38:47.417 --> 03:38:48.158]  Absolutely.
[03:38:48.158 --> 03:38:56.005]  The Gulen movement has taken over the judiciary in Turkey, elements of the police, including secret police.
[03:38:56.005 --> 03:38:59.969]  They tried to take over the Turkish version of the CIA.
[03:38:59.969 --> 03:39:01.610]  They were unsuccessful.
[03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:03.112]  Erdogan and Gulen were friends.
[03:39:03.112 --> 03:39:04.153]  They were both Islamists.
[03:39:04.773 --> 03:39:06.914]  Erdogan runs the AKP party.
[03:39:06.914 --> 03:39:10.094]  He's just been re-elected on November 1st with a majority.
[03:39:10.094 --> 03:39:12.815]  He'd love to change the constitution of Turkey.
[03:39:12.815 --> 03:39:18.797]  But the Gulen movement has been countering those efforts for many years now.
[03:39:18.797 --> 03:39:21.677]  So we're supporting the wrong people with our tax dollars.
[03:39:21.677 --> 03:39:28.359]  Ultimately our money, our money, tax dollars, is going to this very anti-democratic group
[03:39:29.279 --> 03:39:35.620]  In Turkey, it's going to a group of people here in the United States that are teaching over 60,000 students now.
[03:39:35.620 --> 03:39:42.081]  And we don't seem to have the political will or the will in our law enforcement to do something about it.
[03:39:42.081 --> 03:39:44.042]  This is something we've seen for decades.
[03:39:44.042 --> 03:39:53.143]  All my life we've seen the malinvestment in terms of foreign policy, propping up dictatorships and so forth abroad and seeing how that is making those countries worse.
[03:39:53.143 --> 03:39:55.464]  And yet now, with the charter school movement,
[03:39:56.244 --> 03:39:57.386]  We're doing the same thing to our country.
[03:40:12.928 --> 03:40:13.629]  That have gone.
[03:40:13.629 --> 03:40:15.791]  We think there's more than that.
[03:40:15.791 --> 03:40:18.653]  But you'll see in the film, dozens and dozens of people.
[03:40:18.653 --> 03:40:20.555]  You mentioned Mike McCaul.
[03:40:20.555 --> 03:40:23.658]  Sheila Jackson Lee.
[03:40:23.658 --> 03:40:24.859]  Senators.
[03:40:24.859 --> 03:40:30.303]  The Washington Post is currently, you know, there's been an investigation, a congressional investigation in the ethics of this.
[03:40:31.264 --> 03:40:33.487]  Um, and so there's a real problem here.
[03:40:33.487 --> 03:40:46.861]  The film discusses that, and of course the Gulen movement has made hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars off of us, um, to advance their goals, which are not, you know, they're not democratic goals.
[03:40:47.782 --> 03:40:48.483]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:40:48.483 --> 03:40:53.428]  And I want to, before we run out of time, I want to play a trailer for your movie, Killing Ed.
[03:40:53.428 --> 03:40:54.769]  I should have done that a little bit earlier.
[03:40:54.769 --> 03:40:56.631]  Give people a taste of what this is about.
[03:40:56.631 --> 03:41:03.318]  We're going to play this trailer, and when we get to the points where you have Turkish speakers on there that are subtitled for the trailer, I'll narrate that.
[03:41:03.318 --> 03:41:04.680]  Let's run that trailer right now.
[03:41:07.068 --> 03:41:09.309]  A charter school is a public school.
[03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:12.389]  There are some state regulations that don't apply to charters.
[03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:16.251]  So we can change much more rapidly than in traditional school districts.
[03:41:16.251 --> 03:41:21.272]  They're privately managed schools that are funded with taxpayer dollars.
[03:41:21.272 --> 03:41:24.713]  It's a perfect storm that's destroying American public education.
[03:41:26.365 --> 03:41:30.306]  This is about money, this is about politics, and it's harmful to our democracy.
[03:41:30.306 --> 03:41:33.207]  I would say about 300 kids are supposed to use this playground.
[03:41:33.207 --> 03:41:42.150]  There seem to be some treatment differently of minority students, minority teachers, and females.
[03:41:42.150 --> 03:41:45.792]  It's not a good environment for anybody.
[03:41:45.792 --> 03:41:49.253]  I've never known a school to be rated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[03:41:49.253 --> 03:41:50.513]  This is a first.
[03:41:50.513 --> 03:41:54.875]  There's a lot of perception that KIPP is the largest charter school operator in the United States.
[03:41:54.875 --> 03:41:55.255]  It's not.
[03:41:57.970 --> 03:42:10.980]  Most Americans are not aware that the largest charter chain in America is run by a group of Turkish men associated with an imam who happens to be very politically powerful in Turkey.
[03:42:10.980 --> 03:42:15.163]  We started writing about how the Fethullah Gulen movement organized in Turkey.
[03:42:15.163 --> 03:42:20.687]  They accused us journalists of being part of a terrorist organization.
[03:42:20.687 --> 03:42:26.852]  We were detained and arrested because the Fethullah Gulen in Turkey is less democratic.
[03:42:28.464 --> 03:42:38.389]  Isn't it amazing that a group that is this powerful in Turkey is also running the largest network of charter schools and Americans don't know about it?
[03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:40.010]  America isn't aware of this.
[03:42:40.010 --> 03:42:42.531]  The Gulen movement is so sly.
[03:42:42.531 --> 03:42:45.973]  By the time you realize this, it will be too late.
[03:42:45.973 --> 03:42:51.616]  Let's not lose sight of the fact that what this whole process needs to be about is the student.
[03:42:58.496 --> 03:43:05.538]  Well, Mark, with the help of your documentary, hopefully people realize what is going on before it is too late.
[03:43:05.538 --> 03:43:08.019]  There's an excellent website.
[03:43:08.019 --> 03:43:10.980]  You said you're familiar with this, of course, because you've done a lot of research on this.
[03:43:10.980 --> 03:43:15.482]  A Guide to the Gulen Movement's Activities in the U.S.
[03:43:15.482 --> 03:43:20.984]  Look this up because this is for Gulen charter school parents and teachers and for concerned community members.
[03:43:20.984 --> 03:43:22.604]  This is a great website.
[03:43:22.604 --> 03:43:24.465]  Do you know the address of this website?
[03:43:25.545 --> 03:43:36.676]  You know, it's C-A-S-I-L-I-P-S is the organization, Casi Lips, and I believe it is gulencharterschools.weebly.com.
[03:43:36.676 --> 03:43:40.780]  I may be incorrect, but this is an excellent resource.
[03:43:40.780 --> 03:43:44.483]  Or just Google a guide to the Gulen Movement's activities in the U.S.
[03:43:44.483 --> 03:43:46.325]  You'll probably find it from that title right there.
[03:43:46.325 --> 03:43:47.186]  I'll read you it real quick.
[03:43:47.606 --> 03:43:55.108]  Quote here, the Gulen movement is secretive, its activities and methods are complicated, internationally obscure, in a constant state of flux, difficult to grasp.
[03:43:55.108 --> 03:44:03.330]  However, the essence of the movement can be summed up in a single sentence written by a researcher, his last name is Azipek, in his 2009 thesis.
[03:44:03.330 --> 03:44:11.693]  He attended Gulen schools in Turkey, has extensive direct contact with the movement, and he says the primary objective of the Gulen movement is to increase its share of power.
[03:44:11.693 --> 03:44:16.194]  Of course, that power is organized around an Islamic state.
[03:44:16.194 --> 03:44:16.694]  Absolutely.
[03:44:17.154 --> 03:44:22.196]  It's very troubling that our law enforcement, as you see in the film, FBI raids in four states.
[03:44:22.196 --> 03:44:23.516]  It's gone on for six years.
[03:44:23.516 --> 03:44:24.877]  There have been no deportations.
[03:44:24.877 --> 03:44:26.618]  There's been no arrests.
[03:44:26.618 --> 03:44:32.820]  We cover the bribery of a state official or attempted bribery of a state official in Louisiana and keep one of their schools open.
[03:44:32.820 --> 03:44:35.121]  But fortunately, Louisiana did the right thing.
[03:44:35.121 --> 03:44:36.501]  They investigated it.
[03:44:36.501 --> 03:44:40.142]  We go through that report with people that were involved.
[03:44:40.142 --> 03:44:41.103]  Yes, that was very powerful.
[03:44:41.883 --> 03:44:43.564]  There's just so much going on.
[03:44:43.564 --> 03:44:46.145]  It's a complex story here.
[03:44:46.145 --> 03:44:51.086]  You're talking about the FBI is investigating this and yet we see that the CIA brought him in.
[03:44:51.086 --> 03:44:54.307]  We have the same kind of thing going on here in America that's going on in Turkey.
[03:44:54.307 --> 03:44:56.328]  You've got a divided government.
[03:44:56.328 --> 03:44:58.209]  Some factions will enable him.
[03:44:58.209 --> 03:44:59.509]  Some factions will oppose him.
[03:44:59.509 --> 03:45:01.650]  The same thing is happening here in America.
[03:45:01.650 --> 03:45:05.972]  We have members of the American government that enable Glenn, that brought him in.
[03:45:05.972 --> 03:45:06.632]  Talk about that.
[03:45:06.632 --> 03:45:07.392]  Talk about the CIA.
[03:45:07.392 --> 03:45:10.013]  We alluded to that earlier, how they got him into the country.
[03:45:10.273 --> 03:45:16.158]  We don't spend much time about this connection in the film because it's very difficult to prove.
[03:45:16.158 --> 03:45:18.800]  Anything with the CIA is very dark and mysterious.
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:24.984]  However, I will say that the connections with the Gulen movement seem to be well established by those that live in Turkey.
[03:45:24.984 --> 03:45:38.435]  They understand that Gulen schools in Central Asia, some of the thousand plus schools that they operate around the world, were places that many CIA agents were working right after the fall of the USSR.
[03:45:38.835 --> 03:45:45.901]  So there's been a connection with high-level government members in our own government, with CIA.
[03:45:45.901 --> 03:45:56.249]  When I was doing research for this film, I talked to prosecutors that opposed the extension of Ftula Gulen's visa status here in the United States some years ago.
[03:45:56.249 --> 03:45:57.510]  It led to a lawsuit in 2008.
[03:45:58.911 --> 03:46:10.056]  Who were the people that swore out affidavits that said that Gulen was a man of impeccable background and a true educational leader from around the world?
[03:46:10.056 --> 03:46:11.417]  It was members of the CIA.
[03:46:11.417 --> 03:46:14.218]  It was a member of the Turkish, a former U.S.
[03:46:14.218 --> 03:46:15.779]  ambassador to Turkey.
[03:46:15.779 --> 03:46:19.241]  One of those members was Graham Fuller, who you may know of.
[03:46:19.241 --> 03:46:23.743]  He's been very active in promoting political Islam around the world.
[03:46:24.463 --> 03:46:28.427]  So there's a lot of connections here that need to be looked at further.
[03:46:28.427 --> 03:46:29.127]  Yes, yes.
[03:46:29.127 --> 03:46:30.549]  Very, very troubling.
[03:46:30.549 --> 03:46:40.498]  You know, we were talking about how they use science and technology for beard, and you have a very good expose of that in your film, showing how they use science fairs.
[03:46:40.498 --> 03:46:41.218]  Talk about that.
[03:46:41.218 --> 03:46:42.039]  Explain that to the audience.
[03:46:42.059 --> 03:46:49.161]  Well, one of the things that the Gulen movement has done in the United States and other countries around the world is set up science fairs.
[03:46:49.161 --> 03:46:51.681]  Now, the science fairs are very interesting.
[03:46:51.681 --> 03:46:57.743]  They're a way to stair-step their profile here in the United States.
[03:46:57.743 --> 03:47:05.305]  About three-quarters of the students that go there are from Gulen charter schools and from schools from around the world, so we actually went to one of those
[03:47:06.585 --> 03:47:31.270]  Gulen science fair is called Ice Weep in Houston and talked to some of the children who I don't think we're really well well aware of what they were presenting to the people at the fair and it's come out in documents especially in the Louisiana investigation that teachers Turkish teachers the administrators that are trying to make a lot of money through these charter schools we're actually creating those projects for the kids just to stand in front of and
[03:47:31.650 --> 03:47:37.934]  Again, using science as a beard for what the real objective is, so the teachers create the science project, have the kids stand there in front of it.
[03:47:52.802 --> 03:48:19.646]  And not just that, not just students within that particular school district, or even within that state, as you pointed out, they're bringing in students from all over the world, as you showed in your documentary film, to make it look very large, to show impressive projects that were done by adults for them, to bring in students from all over the world for these science fairs, and then they bring in local and state officials to see this, and they just kind of walk by these different projects, and it's like, oh, that's great, there's a kid, and look at what he did.
[03:48:20.166 --> 03:48:21.047]  Exactly.
[03:48:21.047 --> 03:48:27.733]  I mean this is, I want to be very clear that I do not believe that the Gulen movement or members of the movement are violent.
[03:48:27.733 --> 03:48:30.455]  They're not what we see on televisions from Syria.
[03:48:30.455 --> 03:48:39.644]  They're much more sophisticated in how they're trying to achieve what is a similar goal, which in my opinion is the reestablishment of an Ottoman Empire.
[03:48:40.004 --> 03:48:43.027]  Let's say an Ottoman Empire in Turkey.
[03:48:43.027 --> 03:48:44.949]  Gulen is very much a neo-Ottomanist.
[03:48:44.949 --> 03:48:47.351]  I think his followers are that way too.
[03:48:47.351 --> 03:48:50.994]  They're followers of Sayyid Nursi, who believed in science.
[03:48:50.994 --> 03:48:52.996]  So they do have the science in their background.
[03:48:52.996 --> 03:48:57.140]  They're not against science at all.
[03:48:57.140 --> 03:48:59.042]  So this is one thing that you do see in their schools.
[03:48:59.042 --> 03:49:02.865]  And I think it's also very attractive to parents.
[03:49:02.865 --> 03:49:05.167]  Well, you show in your documentary
[03:49:05.928 --> 03:49:11.791]  Some of the Turkish instructors that they bring in, and they don't have any educational background per se.
[03:49:11.791 --> 03:49:19.174]  They mix them in with domestic teachers who come in, and many of them have turned into whistleblowers.
[03:49:19.174 --> 03:49:20.615]  But that's the amazing thing about it.
[03:49:20.615 --> 03:49:24.017]  They bring them in because of their loyalty to the Gulen movement.
[03:49:24.577 --> 03:49:29.921]  And then pay them an inflated salary, but then demand that they tithe back 20% of it.
[03:49:29.921 --> 03:49:30.461]  Exactly.
[03:49:30.461 --> 03:49:33.904]  The tithing is between 10 and 30%.
[03:49:33.904 --> 03:49:36.746]  It's also dependent on the regions of the country.
[03:49:36.746 --> 03:49:43.511]  As you see in the film, the Gulen movement some years ago, about five or seven years ago, divided the United States into five regions.
[03:49:44.051 --> 03:49:51.375]  And they send the teachers into these five regions, and of course, they're making more money, let's say, in New York City than they would here in Austin, Texas.
[03:49:51.375 --> 03:50:10.047]  But yes, there is a bag man that comes along for every pay period, and he's taking a percentage of their paychecks, these H-1B teachers from Turkey that are followers of Gulen, that money is being brought back to Pennsylvania, and it's being used for their purposes, non-educational purposes.
[03:50:10.799 --> 03:50:16.262]  You know, it is very troubling to look at this, and like I said, I support parental involvement.
[03:50:16.262 --> 03:50:18.082]  I support parental choice.
[03:50:18.082 --> 03:50:25.746]  I know Charlotte Isserby has been very negative for quite a while about charter schools, and I really had not looked into what she had to say about charter schools.
[03:50:25.746 --> 03:50:27.547]  Certainly, if you've got a pot of money
[03:50:28.087 --> 03:50:33.651]  That somebody can put together some kind of a business structure, present a plan to someone without a lot of supervision.
[03:50:33.651 --> 03:50:36.672]  That just invites corruption and crony capitalism.
[03:50:36.672 --> 03:50:39.414]  So we're going to talk about that when we come back briefly.
[03:50:39.414 --> 03:50:41.856]  This whole structure and the issues with charter schools.
[03:50:41.856 --> 03:50:47.319]  When we come back, I'm talking to Mark Hall, the producer and director of Killing Ed.
[03:50:47.319 --> 03:50:50.221]  Charter schools, corruption, and the Gulen movement in America.
[03:50:50.221 --> 03:50:50.821]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:59.898 --> 03:51:01.859]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:01.859 --> 03:51:06.843]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:06.843 --> 03:51:10.845]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:10.845 --> 03:51:12.406]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:12.406 --> 03:51:16.489]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:16.489 --> 03:51:21.072]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:21.072 --> 03:51:21.913]  He waited too long.
[03:51:22.333 --> 03:51:25.694]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:25.694 --> 03:51:26.594]  What did I do?
[03:51:26.594 --> 03:51:34.057]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:34.057 --> 03:51:42.480]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:42.480 --> 03:51:44.120]  To get your ExtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:44.340]  That's 1-877-8822.

[03:53:14.449 --> 03:53:15.570]  Jason from Minnesota.

[03:53:33.566 --> 03:53:34.206]  Jason!

[03:53:35.487 --> 03:53:37.409]  Going once, twice.
[03:53:37.409 --> 03:53:39.471]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:53:39.471 --> 03:53:40.332]  You blew it.
[03:53:40.332 --> 03:53:40.652]  Huh?

[03:54:02.655 --> 03:54:09.282]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:54:09.282 --> 03:54:12.245]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:16.434 --> 03:54:17.615]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:17.615 --> 03:54:25.978]  I'm David Knight, in studio with Mark Hall, producer and director of Killing Ed, a documentary that focuses on charter schools and what can go wrong.
[03:54:25.978 --> 03:54:34.422]  A worst-case example of it is the Glenn Movement, getting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money to set up Islamic-focused schools.
[03:54:34.422 --> 03:54:36.783]  We're going to go back and talk to Mark about that real quickly.
[03:54:36.783 --> 03:54:42.345]  We're going to find out when this is going to be available, where you can get information on it, because this is a very important film to see.
[03:54:42.345 --> 03:54:43.066]  I saw the
[03:54:44.006 --> 03:54:48.971]  An advanced screening of it and that's one of the reasons that we've got Mark here.
[03:54:48.971 --> 03:54:58.158]  Before we get back to that I just want to let you know real quickly that today we have introduced a new product Living Defense at Infowarslife.com and I'm not going to cover that right now.
[03:54:58.158 --> 03:55:07.166]  We've covered that earlier and Dr. Group talked to Alex earlier in the program but basically it's a way to clear out infestation of harmful organisms.
[03:55:07.166 --> 03:55:10.229]  A way to get rid of toxic organism in your system.
[03:55:10.609 --> 03:55:12.630]  You can find that at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:16.192]  Now quickly, because we've got a short segment here, I want to come back.
[03:55:16.192 --> 03:55:18.073]  We saw some of the things in the trailer that we saw.
[03:55:18.073 --> 03:55:18.574]  Bill Gates.
[03:55:18.574 --> 03:55:26.818]  Tell us what Bill Gates' involvement is with this Islamic imam who wants to set up a multinational caliphate.
[03:55:26.818 --> 03:55:35.063]  Well, the Gates Foundation, the Gates Family Foundation, has given hundreds of millions of dollars to advance the charter school movement in the United States.
[03:55:35.603 --> 03:55:41.611]  We know that some of that movement has gone to the schools operated by the Gulen movement here in the United States.
[03:55:41.611 --> 03:55:43.473]  There's other family foundations as well.
[03:55:43.473 --> 03:55:49.201]  Eli Broad, the Dell Family Foundation here in Austin, numerous.
[03:55:49.201 --> 03:55:52.726]  The Walmart Family Foundation too has given quite a bit of money.
[03:55:53.126 --> 03:55:59.750]  And these people are not interested really in what's best for the public or our children.
[03:55:59.750 --> 03:56:03.572]  They're interested in advancing something beyond us.
[03:56:03.572 --> 03:56:04.692]  They're unaccountable.
[03:56:04.692 --> 03:56:10.956]  We tried to talk to the person that's in charge of the charter school grants there at the Gates Foundation.
[03:56:11.736 --> 03:56:12.596]  In Seattle.
[03:56:12.596 --> 03:56:14.217]  They don't want to talk to anyone.
[03:56:14.217 --> 03:56:15.898]  They're totally beyond that.
[03:56:15.898 --> 03:56:17.999]  I want to also mention something, too.
[03:56:17.999 --> 03:56:24.962]  I don't want it to be thought that these schools are overtly teaching Islam.
[03:56:24.962 --> 03:56:28.164]  There's no indication to me that I can find that they're teaching Islam.
[03:56:28.164 --> 03:56:29.384]  However... In the United States.
[03:56:29.384 --> 03:56:30.305]  In the United States.
[03:56:30.305 --> 03:56:35.267]  They are operating schools that teach religion in Germany that are publicly funded.
[03:56:35.267 --> 03:56:38.209]  We think there's schools that are doing similar things in Australia.
[03:56:39.569 --> 03:56:47.338]  And of course if they do that, and there's allegations that they are doing that, they would have to do that covertly or they would lose the hundreds of millions of dollars that they get in public funding.
[03:56:47.338 --> 03:56:48.218]  Absolutely.
[03:56:48.218 --> 03:56:59.550]  And one of the things too I think is worth mentioning is through the cultural education that children are getting about Turkey and going to Turkey and visiting Turkish schools there that are religious in purpose.
[03:57:01.232 --> 03:57:05.837]  You know, they are being acclimated to understand Islam from a very particular view.
[03:57:05.837 --> 03:57:15.048]  We have Muslims in the film who have been arrested, who have been put in jail, who have been tortured by the Gulen movement outside of the United States.
[03:57:15.048 --> 03:57:16.830]  And this is not the Islam that they know.
[03:57:16.830 --> 03:57:20.795]  So it's important to try to understand, you know, the complexities of this.
[03:57:21.175 --> 03:57:23.497]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of different flavors of Islam.
[03:57:23.497 --> 03:57:34.246]  If you want to go back and look at Christian denominations, especially around the time of the Reformation, the competition back and forth between Catholic and Protestant and other denominations, we see that happening with the war in Syria.
[03:57:34.246 --> 03:57:37.489]  I mean, you've got the Sunnis, the Shias, the Wahhabis.
[03:57:37.489 --> 03:57:40.852]  I mean, they're at each other's throats very much so.
[03:57:40.852 --> 03:57:42.113]  So we see that happening.
[03:57:42.113 --> 03:57:46.357]  But, you know, I guess as we're talking, Mark, one of the things that concerns me about all of this
[03:57:47.137 --> 03:57:51.782]  ...is the fact that parents are just not involved enough in their children's education.
[03:57:51.782 --> 03:57:52.843]  You have to be involved.
[03:57:52.843 --> 03:57:59.889]  You have to understand that there are people out there who want to socially engineer society, who want to control your children and use them as pawns.
[03:57:59.889 --> 03:58:02.251]  That goes all the way back to Plato's Republic.
[03:58:02.251 --> 03:58:04.173]  And that's the same thing that we're seeing now.
[03:58:04.173 --> 03:58:05.575]  We have to guard against.
[03:58:05.575 --> 03:58:07.837]  The only way to guard against that is to educate yourself.
[03:58:08.237 --> 03:58:09.458]  We're out of time.
[03:58:09.458 --> 03:58:10.239]  Join us tonight.
[03:58:10.239 --> 03:58:11.560]  Thank you for joining us, Mark Hall.
[03:58:11.560 --> 03:58:12.001]  Thank you.

[03:58:18.527 --> 03:58:23.032]  We're going to have live commentary of the GOP debate in our Political Science 3000 format.
[03:58:23.032 --> 03:58:23.392]  Join us then.
[03:58:41.624 --> 03:58:45.624]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
