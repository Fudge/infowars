[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.040 --> 00:30.360]  look I know that we're going into a planned world-wide tyranny and new
[00:30.360 --> 00:37.800]  dark age destroying truth libertarian liberal ideas packaged under the modern
[00:37.800 --> 00:44.360]  pseudo liberalism but when I sit here and read headlines like this out of
[00:44.360 --> 00:49.920]  rasmussen.com rasmussen reports one of the biggest polling agencies in the
[00:49.920 --> 00:55.160]  world and it's not us warning of this a decade ago it's not the academics and
[00:55.160 --> 01:00.280]  government's calling for it newspapers it's it's serious polls with a large
[01:00.280 --> 01:07.320]  percentage of people wanting to arrest anyone that disagrees with man-made
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.200]  climate change first it was freezing then it was warming now exchange and this
[01:12.200 --> 01:17.800]  is just today's stack I have a huge stack here of what they call political
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.240]  correctness it's not political correctness it is the talitarianism it is
[01:22.240 --> 01:32.640]  Mao Zedong it's Adolf Hitler it's happening again now it's only 20
[01:32.640 --> 01:42.400]  something percent that in this poll want to arrest everybody but that's still a
[01:42.400 --> 01:47.800]  whacked-out group of scum with their bizarre moral authority and you see it
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.240]  going on these universities where somebody drove by in a truck two months
[01:51.240 --> 01:56.160]  ago I think I heard something racist there's a Thomas Jefferson statue get
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.000]  rid of everybody in the school lock everything down and now it's happening
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.200]  all over the country they're routing particularly black conservative
[02:04.200 --> 02:13.120]  professors and it is just a mindless power grab by the feminist commanding the
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.400]  young throngs of chip on the shoulder youth we've done an analysis of it all
[02:18.400 --> 02:25.880]  Ford Foundation Soros manipulated and it's just pathetic to see these people
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.120]  will not get jobs anywhere I don't care if it's a young white woman a young white
[02:30.120 --> 02:33.960]  guy black woman whatever I'm looking at these people they're not getting
[02:33.960 --> 02:38.520]  education so they're not learning how to make connections and get jobs just so
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.000]  much a business is just interpersonal skill even Bloomberg had an article on
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.440]  that a month ago three and a half weeks ago these people are completely whacked
[02:48.440 --> 02:56.800]  out they are psychologically destroyed they've had their normal social skills
[02:56.800 --> 03:04.360]  basically degraded or removed to seeing phantoms in fact I saw a political
[03:04.360 --> 03:09.000]  cartoon it may still be on info wars.com or put the political cartoons down on
[03:09.000 --> 03:17.920]  the lower left-hand side and it shows a psychiatrist holding up the ink blot test
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.440]  and saying what do you see and I see racism I see homophobia I see this I
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.400]  see that no matter what the blobs on the page said look like that's what they see
[03:31.800 --> 03:38.240]  and that's what it is and that's the plan this is how you put a virus in a
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.080]  computer to fry people's brains little support for pushing little support for
[03:45.080 --> 03:49.800]  punishing global warming foes global warming advocates are calling for the
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.880]  prosecution of groups who disagree with them and the New York state has taken it
[03:54.880 --> 04:01.680]  a step further by investigating people I'm gonna come back and cover all this
[04:01.680 --> 04:08.960]  but I can't even believe it's gone this far and what's even sicker is it's
[04:08.960 --> 04:19.360]  Exxon mobile and British Petroleum and Dutch Royal Shell those three are the
[04:19.360 --> 04:26.120]  biggest funders of the whole man-made climate change garbage to shut down
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.360]  coal their main competitor and they're so sophisticated the left doesn't even
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.400]  know they work for them and then they have New York state investigating Exxon
[04:36.400 --> 04:42.640]  mobile blaming they paid for fake science it wasn't fake science that was
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.280]  15 years ago they were ordered by the board head David Rockefeller to convert
[04:48.280 --> 04:54.320]  and support it and they have since then incredible incredible this is just
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.580]  incredible the oil companies run the fraud global warming advocates are now
[05:00.580 --> 05:04.720]  blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change despite the
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.880]  record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern US the climate
[05:08.880 --> 05:12.520]  words for all coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.120]  buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City these
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.600]  are New York City's largest buildings over 50,000 square feet in size which
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.520]  primarily consists of a mixture of luxury apartments commercial buildings and
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.520]  multifamily housing developments the report stated the report was released
[05:28.520 --> 05:33.000]  just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms global warming
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.720]  advocates however will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made
[05:36.720 --> 05:40.800]  climate change even though a few years ago they were predicting that the earth's
[05:40.800 --> 05:45.160]  ice caps would have dramatically melted by now but they really want you to live

[07:58.680 --> 08:15.960]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:15.960 --> 08:19.800]  ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting across the globe from
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.520]  deep in the heart of Texas Austin professor Darrell on the motto is our
[08:23.520 --> 08:30.000]  guest the balance of the hour we also have some fun video that have we have
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.480]  time we're going to play of answering you she already trying to
[08:35.480 --> 08:40.120]  barefoot water ski hey I'm not knocking I can't do it either but there's a
[08:40.120 --> 08:43.680]  reason I'm gonna play it I know this is a radio show but free video feeds and
[08:43.680 --> 08:49.640]  info wars.com forward slash show now I want to play a few clips before we go
[08:49.640 --> 08:53.120]  to the professor he's been on four or five times I think over the years he's
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.440]  been persecuted because he headed up you know part of the school for saying
[08:57.440 --> 09:01.520]  look we can't ban Halloween we can't ban pressing and costumes we can't run
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.160]  around demanding everybody take on weird bizarre you know race cults where the
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.400]  Hispanics are in a weird race cult that resembles basically the Klan and then
[09:10.400 --> 09:13.040]  you've got the blacks in a group and the whites in the group and the Asians in a
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.600]  group and the Chinese Asians in one group and the Japanese another group I
[09:16.600 --> 09:19.440]  mean this is true Balkanization the opposite of Martin Luther King it's
[09:19.440 --> 09:24.880]  scary but it's social control total hijacking of great classical liberal
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.520]  ideas he's been talking about this for years and he is a recipient of the
[09:29.520 --> 09:32.040]  Rockefeller Foundation research fellowship so he's worked inside the
[09:32.040 --> 09:36.800]  belly of the beast before we do that I wanted to play a couple clips we haven't
[09:36.800 --> 09:46.200]  gotten to that that are context for this the Buckley program in Yale had this
[09:46.200 --> 09:54.120]  particular professor on who wrote the coddling of the American mind and again
[09:54.120 --> 09:59.000]  even the liberal Atlantic is admitting the stuff's going on and then the
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.040]  protests begin protesting while First Amendment lawyer and the fire president
[10:03.040 --> 10:09.560]  CEO Greg I'm pronouncing this right Lucanoff how do you say that Lucanoff
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.280]  author of the coddling of American mind speaks during the state of the free
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.200]  expression intellectual diversity in higher education fifth annual conference
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.000]  and this is the thing I have a really good friend who was a big Hollywood
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.320]  editor I went to college same time as him I was in a student film and they
[10:27.320 --> 10:29.840]  mean he edited some of the big Hollywood films and he just didn't like
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.880]  Hollywood didn't like it want to go back to school and get a psychology
[10:33.880 --> 10:39.880]  degree I guess he's going for his PhD or whatever right now and it's literally
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.000]  a cult where he's got to identify and say that he's bad because he's white and
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.800]  just bizarre weirdness where if he makes one mistake his whole paper is given a
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.080]  zero everybody else can make all the mistakes they're giving a pluses I mean
[10:53.080 --> 11:00.400]  it's crazy it's crazy but it's also just men in general and it's men leading
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.080]  women saying men are bad and men have to not denounce they're basically bad I
[11:04.080 --> 11:10.520]  mean it's just games it's gang mentality it's raw exercise of like brown shirt
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.520]  stuff in Germany that's all this is devolved into any group can degenerate
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.200]  right-wing left-wing you name it and this is people basically going getting
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.040]  these university degrees that are more and more closely useless in some cases
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.400]  with the economy and they're just looking for identity and it's devolving
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.480]  into king rat behavior it's devolving into prison behavior everybody's in their
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.840]  own little group and then the ward manages all that this has been done by
[11:35.840 --> 11:38.920]  social engineers on record and our guest who was put through these programs
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.880]  that's why he's an insider exposing it you understand again as I said a thousand
[11:43.880 --> 11:48.560]  times this is not rhetoric when I say these things that this is CIA Defense
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.920]  Department Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation on record doing this where
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.360]  people's identities aren't I'm being discriminated against by the NSA spying on
[11:58.360 --> 12:03.120]  me or Samsung TVs watching me admitted or being signed on to trillions of
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.720]  derivatives that aren't my debt or GMO not being able to be labeled or being
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.240]  told I've got to let the globalist bring in cheap labor and pay for it all as a
[12:11.240 --> 12:17.680]  you know free welfare free baby stuff as a corporate welfare pay off to give them
[12:17.680 --> 12:25.960]  the labor on and on and on all the real issues all the real things happening it
[12:25.960 --> 12:28.840]  is a tyranny so we're gonna go to our guest after I play this clip you know
[12:28.840 --> 12:35.640]  Seinfeld's come out and says his daughter 13 years old I think she's 13 to 14
[12:35.640 --> 12:43.840]  says dad dad you know why we move back to New York well because when you have
[12:43.840 --> 12:48.360]  more friends and meet more boys she says dad boys and girls together as sexes
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.080]  just to say boys and girls and see Seinfeld thought that she just didn't
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.920]  understand no no no she understood this is what's taught I mean it's beyond
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.080]  1984 it's beyond we and other dystopic novels this is the destruction of
[13:04.080 --> 13:08.680]  language and communication by design so let's go to this clip of where it's a
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.120]  first amendment summit and it's being shut down at Yale and now Yale is
[13:13.120 --> 13:20.840]  apologizing that they did have professors say we shouldn't ban Halloween parties
[13:20.840 --> 13:25.280]  let's go to the club here it is another time was when I when I covered the
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.360]  University of Delaware case and I went to actually University of Delaware to
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.960]  explain why their program was so nuts I can't explain the University of
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.960]  Delaware program in any fewer than 50,000 words so please read my book on
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.080]  learning liberty but it was insane and this is all you know so this is all
[13:40.080 --> 13:46.680]  2007 and before I have never seen such an emotional display from from students
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.000]  and again this was over an email about hey can we chill out a little about a
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.040]  little bit about Halloween
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.800]  and they take over it's all about taking over and blocking speech oh yeah
[14:05.800 --> 14:08.760]  how dare you say we should be able to have costume parties I mean this is
[14:08.760 --> 14:17.440]  total beyond Jim Jones coach totally purpose totally post aside okay so we
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.560]  stand with our sisters of color so I watched this white kid this is like
[14:22.560 --> 14:27.240]  his fight to show he's battling his coming of age just try to stop free
[14:27.240 --> 14:33.160]  speech I'm telling you look how upset and weird that guy looks I've been around
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.640]  these people that guy looks like a cult member he looks like a zombie I'm sorry
[14:37.640 --> 14:39.800]  I don't just go off looks but these people all have the same like where they
[14:39.800 --> 14:44.440]  can't walk they stumble around for making a mild criticism by the way I don't
[14:44.440 --> 14:47.280]  even charge that guy if you did that to cops anywhere else he'd be charged with
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.520]  resisting arrest this is amazing
[14:56.160 --> 15:02.400]  this is absolutely amazing got it just kept him in there let him do no it goes
[15:02.400 --> 15:04.840]  on it gets worse I don't have time to play I want to go to the professor I'm
[15:04.840 --> 15:08.280]  gonna skip this one break to give him more time I'll play the Seinfeld clip but
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.040]  you got to understand folks the people running this you notice at every
[15:13.040 --> 15:16.920]  university now it's basically the same this didn't just magically happen the
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.360]  Atlantic says how did it get this way why do they have panic attacks if you
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.600]  have a brown paper bag you know why do they see racism in the clouds it was
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.960]  scientifically done I'm gonna shut up and he's got a lot of points he wants to
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.960]  go over he's got an initiative he's gonna call for today you know Jan
[15:33.960 --> 15:38.400]  Napolitano heads up a bunch of universities how about she resides we're
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.760]  talking about using their own weapons against them we have the White House
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.400]  praising the protest again this is about global social engineers taking
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.720]  everything over with one standardized culture that is a plastic corporate
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.000]  culture that can be rewritten within a week and then you're given the new
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.600]  received proper terms people that's why they're always changing why it's always
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.640]  getting more extreme because it's scientific we're being culturally
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.440]  conquered not that the old mix of culture was perfect but at least it was
[16:06.440 --> 16:10.680]  cultures this is scientific I'm gonna shut up now and go to the professor

[17:04.880 --> 17:07.640]  from the inside good to have you back my friend I just played some of those
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.480]  clips is it cresting or is it just starting is this the beginning of the
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.080]  malice style red terror or the Soviet or Jack booted brown shirt Nazi
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.240]  bizarreness I mean this is crazy it's good to be back Alex good to be back
[17:23.240 --> 17:29.360]  with you in your audience you know my perceptions and yours square up almost
[17:29.360 --> 17:36.880]  identically and I refer to this process as weaponizing the student body there's
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.200]  a two-fold meaning in that one is that the students are being used as a tool or
[17:41.200 --> 17:47.120]  a weapon against discussion against dissent against dissenters against
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.080]  unpopular art actually I'm a very popular professor but they're used as a
[17:52.080 --> 17:57.480]  weapon against professors such as myself who don't go along with the
[17:57.480 --> 18:02.640]  politically correct orthodoxy and the second meaning of weaponization is that
[18:02.640 --> 18:09.840]  these creatures that we're seeing on these YouTube show postings their bodies
[18:09.840 --> 18:14.520]  have been weaponized you've talked many times about the sodium fluoride that's
[18:14.520 --> 18:19.440]  only part of it according to an environmental scientist scientist by
[18:19.440 --> 18:24.480]  the name of Lauren Moray these undergraduates are being hit with heavy
[18:24.480 --> 18:34.520]  concerted programmed doses of EMF they're being heavily controlled by social
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.520]  media in general you're right screen time on record reprograms and brain
[18:39.520 --> 18:46.920]  damages it does in addition to that we have been subjected to involuntarily
[18:46.920 --> 18:51.760]  we've been subjected to experiments such as this famous social contagion
[18:51.760 --> 18:56.360]  experiment that was launched by Facebook and their team of behavioral and
[18:56.360 --> 19:01.320]  social scientists wrote a paper on it a social science paper an academic paper
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.680]  and they were completely unapologetic about it so this is a total like you're
[19:06.680 --> 19:12.560]  saying it is a program it's the students are on a electro pharmaceutical gulag and
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.120]  it's it's no accident that whatever campus you go to it's the same program it's
[19:17.120 --> 19:22.160]  the same scenario you have these subsets of what you could call the crisis
[19:22.160 --> 19:29.720]  actor that we saw ruled out in Sandy Hook and now they've been deployed you've
[19:29.720 --> 19:35.400]  got the Soros connected railroad head who's got his son out there triggering
[19:35.400 --> 19:38.640]  and running the whole op exactly that the so they got just a few of their
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.800]  operatives they're then given media attention they're then the the victim and
[19:42.800 --> 19:47.360]  then they then lead the sheep to slaughter that's right these are Judas
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.880]  goats are the alpha goats and as you pointed out earlier there's a certain
[19:51.880 --> 19:57.720]  subset within that and they're typically aligned with some sort of GLB TQ IA
[19:57.720 --> 20:02.280]  agenda or they come out of gender and sexuality studies by the way they don't
[20:02.280 --> 20:05.680]  even call it women's studies anymore because part of this agenda is to take
[20:05.680 --> 20:09.560]  us into a post-gender world a transhumanist post-human world they're not
[20:09.560 --> 20:13.720]  freeing a sexual you're an expert on this they are ending our sexual power
[20:13.720 --> 20:17.640]  that's right they're gonna take us to the next level as it said and that's the
[20:17.640 --> 20:22.760]  level where there are there is no gender differentiation so you see this
[20:22.760 --> 20:29.320]  woman Melissa click who thankfully resigned she's a crisis actor it's gonna
[20:29.320 --> 20:32.120]  be interesting to see if some one of your listeners want to track her to see
[20:32.120 --> 20:36.680]  where she shows up but I'm sure she has a job waiting for her someplace in the
[20:36.680 --> 20:44.560]  university system but it's typically a female quote-unquote white assistant
[20:44.560 --> 20:47.720]  professor this is what you said here two years ago I mean you've laid this out
[20:47.720 --> 20:53.320]  it's a program oh yes I've had a ringside seat in this Neil Maoist
[20:53.320 --> 20:59.480]  pull pot style red guards program that's being run out of the academic affairs and
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.840]  I want to point that by the way folks I just got chills yeah he's not just saying
[21:03.840 --> 21:07.120]  that he went through the Rockefeller program this is what they did with the
[21:07.120 --> 21:13.160]  Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and it's what they did in China I mean we're crazy to
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.760]  see that our government would do this because we know what the next phases are
[21:16.760 --> 21:22.880]  and US intelligence was behind the auto genocide in Cambodia and by the way I
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.960]  teach the children and grandchildren of refugees from these totalitarian regimes
[21:27.960 --> 21:32.720]  and that's why they're somewhat resistant to the political correctness that
[21:32.720 --> 21:37.560]  they are being indoctrinated to it and at the University of California University
[21:37.560 --> 21:42.000]  of Missouri I guess it kind of wakes you up to have your family killed it does so
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.560]  they're there at the tipping point so to speak they're they're trying to recruit
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.080]  them aggressively through these mind control regiments again through the
[21:50.080 --> 21:54.800]  Office of Student Affairs and so-called student community centers where they go
[21:54.800 --> 22:00.960]  to these little enclaves and reopen their their hurts their little problems with
[22:00.960 --> 22:05.720]  mommy and daddy and they take them to these isolated retreats and then they
[22:05.720 --> 22:09.680]  find people there who can take the program a little bit further and then if
[22:09.680 --> 22:14.760]  you're really really sleazy you get to stay behind to to attend the after party
[22:14.760 --> 22:19.240]  and then perhaps after that maybe you get to party with Janet La Palzano one of
[22:19.240 --> 22:24.440]  these mansion parties who knows that's a cult it's a cult it's a
[22:24.440 --> 22:30.280]  mind-control cult it's comes right out of the pages of Jonestown which again
[22:30.280 --> 22:36.040]  apparently was a US intelligence operation I got exposed they shut it
[22:36.040 --> 22:40.320]  down and everybody killed themselves absolutely and several people including
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.880]  Congressman Leo Ryan sacrificed their lives in order to expose this dark
[22:44.880 --> 22:50.440]  aspect of our national security University State well when we put this
[22:50.440 --> 22:53.320]  interview out and write articles about it tomorrow and it's again it's not
[22:53.320 --> 22:58.440]  rhetoric I say that neurotically because it's true University professor exposes
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.560]  government mind control programs on universities and that's what it is it's
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.160]  so bold that they would please keep getting into the facts and the
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.600]  techniques of how they do it but it's really as bold they try this here and I
[23:10.600 --> 23:14.880]  guess it's working like a charm except you're fighting back and many others are
[23:14.880 --> 23:19.640]  now fighting back it may backfire on them please keep elaborating well any
[23:19.640 --> 23:25.000]  number of professors my colleagues even at UC Davis are beginning to man up on
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.360]  this issue sorry if we're using the second language I got in trouble for
[23:29.360 --> 23:33.960]  talking to a provost and you know I understand we need to do that not
[23:33.960 --> 23:37.040]  because we're kind of just showing everything's program please continue I'm
[23:37.040 --> 23:40.880]  doing it as a deliberate provocative gesture just to antagonize these rats
[23:40.880 --> 23:47.440]  who are spying on me right now but yeah these well first of all let me
[23:47.440 --> 23:52.000]  establish I've done some research on Chancellor Linda Kate he who by the way
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.040]  is deducting 25% of my salary for the next five months and I call here and
[23:57.040 --> 24:00.400]  now for her immediate resignation as chancellor of the University of California
[24:00.400 --> 24:08.480]  Davis because she is engaged in actions that go counter to the Constitution the
[24:08.480 --> 24:13.440]  US Constitution and to the very principles of academic freedom so Linda
[24:13.440 --> 24:18.400]  Kate he stand down and while you're at it please take the president of the UC
[24:18.400 --> 24:24.480]  system Janet Napolitano with you and Dean Susan Kaiser who has stationed a
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.800]  emeritus professor in my classes both of them he's attending every single one of
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.800]  my lectures and taking copious notes so that he can pass it to the commissars so
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.160]  why don't you three resign leave us alone we're going to rebuild the University
[24:40.160 --> 24:44.520]  of California without you the people of the state of California the American
[24:44.520 --> 24:49.760]  people will prevail on this issue and by the way I've read about you in in
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.440]  student writings other things you've got some of the most attended classes you
[24:53.440 --> 24:56.800]  head up the department they tried to get rid of you you're promoting true
[24:56.800 --> 25:00.840]  classical liberalism and the young men and women love it because I'm not putting
[25:00.840 --> 25:04.240]  words your mouth they explain to people how successful you've been because you're
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.840]  your toto pulling back the curtain showing the man behind the curtain or the
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.320]  women behind the curtain that are literally engaged in in in cultural
[25:13.320 --> 25:17.640]  mind control because they know these these young people aren't able to get
[25:17.640 --> 25:21.480]  jobs now in this economy they got to screw them up mentally so they're
[25:21.480 --> 25:25.360]  adult and in a cult and don't know why they have no future so I mean this is
[25:25.360 --> 25:29.760]  really a sabotage of the American mind in a vulcanization but specifically
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.000]  talk about how popular you are that's why they're trying to get rid of you well
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.480]  in all modesty I was teaching introductory classes of 200 students and my
[25:39.480 --> 25:45.040]  classes were routinely oversubscribed and the University is so sleazy they
[25:45.040 --> 25:50.280]  put one of these controllers into the departmental chair of my department and
[25:50.280 --> 25:54.840]  he hired somebody specifically and then she hired four students snitches
[25:54.840 --> 26:01.280]  assistants to empty out my classes and she went on social media Twitter Facebook
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.120]  in order to do so now eventually she got thrown under the bus and that's a
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.000]  warning to all you snitches out there think you're going to get over by
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.840]  screwing with people whether it's me or someone else but eventually they're
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.760]  going to roll over on you so keep that in mind before you attend one of these
[26:16.760 --> 26:23.480]  bogus encampments these so-called safe spaces or before you turn your soul over
[26:23.480 --> 26:28.560]  to so-called the student community center but she got rolled over and as a
[26:28.560 --> 26:35.120]  result to this new academic year I'm Mr. Popular again my classes are
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.360]  already from the next quarter already are oversubscribed unless they pull
[26:39.360 --> 26:46.040]  some dirty tricks on me so yes I was I am the senior ranking professor
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.400]  definitely scared of you and that's the point is you've been through several
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.120]  years of persecution for teaching a class really giving young people true
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.280]  value on how the education system has been taken over this is invaluable that's
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.200]  right and they understand it Alex these are really super bright highly
[27:04.200 --> 27:09.440]  motivated young men and women and that is why I am so thoroughly invested in
[27:09.440 --> 27:14.120]  their future because their futures are future and I am not submitting to this
[27:14.120 --> 27:19.640]  notion that America the American economy is dead or dying in fact aren't my new
[27:19.640 --> 27:26.120]  area of emphasis is building up the new Silk Road economy as it's called I
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.280]  agree with you we could turn the economy back on any time they're trying to go
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.560]  into this post-industrial shutdown mode trying to get them ready for it that's
[27:33.560 --> 27:36.400]  why doing what you're doing will help create a new Renaissance and more
[27:36.400 --> 27:39.520]  professors are doing it let's get more into the technicals though because you've
[27:39.520 --> 27:43.760]  been to the Rockefeller program I mean this is a real operation how do they
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.080]  take these young people and get them where they're just hysterical in fear
[27:48.080 --> 27:52.960]  like Freddy Kruger is coming to get them when they hear there might be you
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.400]  know you're not banning the the people from wearing costumes and then they
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.840]  streak and scream and I mean act like someone just murdered their baby this
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.720]  is true mind control when you look at these people they're wild-eyed they're
[28:05.720 --> 28:11.400]  scared I mean what have they done to these people well first of all they
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.720]  have to hire a ethnically correct leader a vice chancellor they had the
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.520]  student affairs unit and that covers everything from an athletics to food
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.880]  service to the so-called student community center and she and I say she
[28:24.880 --> 28:29.960]  because it's typically a woman these days has to be a minority Latina or Asian
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.080]  American or African-American so she's there she's in place and then she
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.000]  staffs the entire operation with people who are sympathetic to the agenda and
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.680]  the agenda by the way comes from the Pentagon comes to the Department of
[28:42.680 --> 28:45.680]  Defense it doesn't come from the University of California definitely
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.720]  doesn't come from the professors and we have a principle of shared guard
[28:48.720 --> 28:54.240]  governance which is completely been discarded so they have that and at the
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.880]  ground level they have at the student community center we have a brand new
[28:58.880 --> 29:04.120]  building on our campus here at UC Davis and what they did is they threw all the
[29:04.120 --> 29:08.800]  student to the true student activists out of it out of the operation and they
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.240]  put these people who are maybe in their late 20s early 30s who always wanted to
[29:14.240 --> 29:19.240]  be popular when they were under graduates apparatchik correct and they
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.440]  have a master's degree it's just just a you know graduate degree to to administer
[29:25.440 --> 29:33.800]  the 18 and 19 year olds who are looking for legitimately a social cause they
[29:33.800 --> 29:38.320]  want a better society they roll model them they put them in you know you just
[29:38.320 --> 29:40.760]  like if you want to corrupt an 18 year old woman to make her a prostitute put
[29:40.760 --> 29:43.800]  her in with a you know 20 year old who guides her into it they just get them
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.760]  ready to pimp them directly and stay there this is inside Intel folks he and
[29:47.760 --> 29:54.520]  folks we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:54.520 --> 29:57.080]  network
[29:58.240 --> 30:04.240]  the DC police chief urges citizens to fight back against peristyle attackers
[30:04.240 --> 30:09.520]  speaking with 60 minutes on Sunday Washington DC police chief Kathy Lanier
[30:09.520 --> 30:14.040]  urges residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror
[30:14.040 --> 30:18.840]  attack or mass shooting whether it means run hide or fight if you're in a
[30:18.840 --> 30:22.920]  position to try to take the gunman out it's the best option for saving lives
[30:22.920 --> 30:26.640]  before police can get there linear said while acknowledging her latest
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.280]  suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have
[30:30.280 --> 30:34.680]  advised linear claim that taking action may be essential to prevent another
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.480]  massacre like the attack in Paris which left over 120 people dead we always
[30:39.480 --> 30:44.400]  tell people don't take action call 911 don't intervene in the robbery linear
[30:44.400 --> 30:49.920]  said we've never told people take action but it's a different scenario keep up

[33:16.240 --> 33:34.800]  by the way the University of Missouri Fox News is not reporting has appointed a
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.760]  new black interim president and I compare less if you got a black football
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.840]  coach or black president as long as they do a good job but this is clearly you
[33:43.840 --> 33:47.080]  must resign admit you're racist and we're giving your job because you're
[33:47.080 --> 33:55.520]  white I mean it's terrorism and it just shows what they can do and this is
[33:55.520 --> 33:59.640]  again federally globalist directed where they can make the universities all
[33:59.640 --> 34:04.160]  capitulate and do whatever they want because after they remove 20 or 30
[34:04.160 --> 34:07.360]  university presidents and chancellors they're gonna say now you will adopt
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.800]  100% our program you will now carry it out report you a Missouri names black
[34:13.800 --> 34:17.360]  interim president us today the governing board University of Missouri has
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.600]  selected a black law professor and deputy chancellor emeritus to serve as
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.320]  interim president of the university system multiple media outlets were
[34:25.320 --> 34:29.480]  reporting Thursday it'll only get worse now because it just it never stops
[34:29.480 --> 34:36.360]  Michael Middleton retired in August over 30 years at the school his selection
[34:36.360 --> 34:41.680]  comes three days after Tim Wolf resigned of incontroversy over his handling of a
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.760]  series of racially charged events and they're now calling it Yale a racially
[34:45.760 --> 34:55.240]  charged event because people freaked out and said banned costume parties I mean
[34:55.240 --> 34:58.680]  it's just crazy but it's not when you realize it's weaponized it's by design
[34:58.680 --> 35:05.140]  professor Darrell homomoto is our guest and he heads up the he's the senior
[35:05.140 --> 35:08.240]  ranking professor in the Department of Asian American Studies he's began to see
[35:08.240 --> 35:11.920]  this years ago as I've been writing about it and exposing it extensively
[35:11.920 --> 35:19.280]  before we go back to him ladies and gentlemen we cannot fund this operation
[35:19.280 --> 35:22.520]  without your support and you've been doing that so you've seen us expand
[35:22.520 --> 35:27.080]  hire more reporters send our reporters around the country in the world break
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.280]  more news have a bigger effect but I believe in the free market I know you're
[35:32.280 --> 35:34.760]  such great listeners that you'd buy products even they weren't the very
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.720]  best but I want you to be a repeat customer plus I want the good you know
[35:38.720 --> 35:44.240]  karma whatever you want to call it we bring you really true game changers I
[35:44.240 --> 35:48.320]  could have a hundred products out right now go to a major manufacturer they
[35:48.320 --> 35:52.760]  still be pretty decent private label an entire line for one of these big
[35:52.760 --> 35:58.160]  manufacturers and have a hundred products out in just a few months and make
[35:58.160 --> 36:03.040]  more money but I refuse to do that we go out and absolutely every product is
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.240]  what I call a game changer every product is like top scientists doctors
[36:07.240 --> 36:10.960]  researchers saying this is the missing link this is this is what people aren't
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.400]  getting sometimes real simple like truly pure clean deep earth source iodine
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.640]  survival shield nason iodine true nason iodine x2 because we've tested some of
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.640]  stuff out there it's not really nason iodine ours is whether it's the oxy
[36:26.640 --> 36:29.440]  powder that flushes out your intestines with higher level oxygen the time
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.120]  releases whether it is the liver shield whether it's our new product living
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.760]  defense harmful organism parasite cleanse dietary supplement at info wars
[36:38.760 --> 36:45.920]  life comm or info wars store.com these nutraceuticals are powerful lung
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.920]  cleanse a silver bullet is just 30 parts per million more than that can be toxic
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.960]  according to our experts still consult your doctors topical internal whatever
[36:54.960 --> 37:03.920]  you take silver bullet it is the best quality we could come out with and is
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.080]  lower than leading competitors so there's exact same stuff from the same
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.360]  manufacturers some of our stuff is private label a lot of its originally
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.320]  produced but but with big manufacturers so that's what it comes down to we've
[37:15.320 --> 37:19.440]  got a whole bunch of products we've gotten up to like 15 products the last
[37:19.440 --> 37:23.040]  three years we've got a few more coming online the next few months but I plan to
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.760]  kind of round stuff out with about 30 products because I'm not going to try to
[37:26.760 --> 37:31.720]  come out with like 500 great products which takes 15 20 years to do that's
[37:31.720 --> 37:34.720]  what young Jevvity's done I support them they got a great line of products
[37:34.720 --> 37:39.280]  infowarshealth.com you want to find Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 and
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.400]  pollen bursts other great products as well just amazing that supports the

[38:37.280 --> 38:42.160]  still vote is with your dollars and with your support that's why it's important
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.160]  to support professors like professor Daryl Hamamoto who's been threatened to
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.160]  be fired had his pay cut being harassed to tell the truth but I can tell he's
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.040]  more alive than ever because that's really the sustenance of why I was
[38:53.040 --> 38:56.400]  telling the truth but when you do spread the word about free speech when you
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.360]  support true classical liberals libertarianism whatever you want to
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.080]  call it when we take back the real mantle of renaissance and enlightenment
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.680]  and culture away from these tyrant control freaks and their minions we
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.000]  begin to turn the tide against this new dark age the system wants to bring in
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.440]  now I'm done ranting I apologize I've been ranting we'll go back to professor
[39:18.440 --> 39:25.040]  Hamamoto here at trindade.com you want to find his publications professor you
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.160]  got cut off getting into how they technician things how they break it
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.600]  down how they stable the young people how they run them through how they peer
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.400]  pressure them and just young people I mean it's like even my kids you know
[39:37.400 --> 39:44.760]  they're in school 13 11 and 7 other kids learn how to be mean and then my
[39:44.760 --> 39:47.720]  kids sometimes want to be mean back I try to teach you it doesn't matter you'll
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.240]  transcend this you know live your own life find the few people you like get
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.600]  along with them it's the same peer pressure cult and they kind of keep that
[39:56.600 --> 40:00.000]  going into college into the workforce everywhere else but I've learned if you
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.280]  tell children but also young adults about this like you're doing this is how
[40:03.280 --> 40:06.040]  you're being programmed this is how you're being socially meant to feel bad
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.200]  if you don't submit to this and then you feel accepted tribalism what you
[40:10.200 --> 40:15.400]  naturally need cultural by submitting to this you this is a fake culture you
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.080]  need to find true culture with real people and free association that does
[40:19.080 --> 40:25.640]  transcend race religion region you know ethnicity all this stuff true free
[40:25.640 --> 40:28.840]  market of ideas so I'm done ranting get into how the technicians operate and
[40:28.840 --> 40:31.280]  you've got the floor pretty much the rest of the hour I want you to break it
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.240]  down major whistleblower from UC Davis head of the Asian-American studies
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.640]  persecuted for years telling the truth I want you to get back into how they do
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.520]  it but also I'd like to ask you somewhere in there how did you begin to
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.000]  wake up was it when they put you through the Rockefeller program or were you
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.040]  always somewhat awake and then where do you see this going go ahead well to
[40:54.040 --> 40:59.480]  answer your last question first I was even as a young person and by the way
[40:59.480 --> 41:04.920]  they start tracking you in elementary school there's a reason why a certain
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.360]  group of kids are always taking these little standardized tests reading
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.000]  mathematics very early on today the so-called STEM program identifies
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.840]  students in elementary school and that's one of the reason why Jerry Seinfeld's
[41:18.840 --> 41:24.320]  daughter came back with that can to response about moving back to New York
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.560]  because it's a program and a lot of these students who are trained at UC
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.000]  Davis and other places at the so-called student community center do what's
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  called outreach that's that's a red flag word right there outreach to the
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.720]  elementary schools and to the junior high schools and high schools so by the
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.480]  time they come to the university they've already been primed and they've been
[41:45.480 --> 41:50.320]  pre-selected so far as the leadership track is concerned now within that there's
[41:50.320 --> 41:56.360]  a pincer movement between two student constituencies that are being used and
[41:56.360 --> 42:01.280]  you can tell by the amount of resources that are being allocated to these areas
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.960]  and you can also tell by the identification for example Linda Kotehi the
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.640]  chancellor at UC Davis she's an engineer by training and by the way she holds
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.640]  19 patents for antennas and antennas are key to this whole EMF regime that's
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.960]  part of the mind control system but she's has declared herself as part of the
[42:21.960 --> 42:27.720]  gender and sexuality studies even though she has no academic expertise in the
[42:27.720 --> 42:36.000]  area so that's a big area it's it's the GLBT QIA department and programs that
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.080]  the so-called student activists are being recruited from and those are the
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.760]  people that come into my class most recently in a sexuality class that's
[42:44.760 --> 42:49.840]  sitting the back and you showed a video earlier and they start questioning you
[42:49.840 --> 42:55.280]  aggressively they try to sweat you they'll wear a little fright wigs little
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.040]  purple wigs and just all of a sudden spontaneously as if they were mind
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.640]  controlled which they are and they'll start spontaneously asking you these
[43:03.640 --> 43:10.240]  questions all you have to do is break them down individually and and they
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.080]  begin to crumble another technique I've known is said yeah come up to the to the
[43:15.080 --> 43:19.120]  stage to the front of the stage here's an open microphone tell me what what you
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.520]  want to see in this class and they have nothing they have nothing by the way
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.280]  this is a technique that a lot of comedians stand up people like
[43:27.280 --> 43:31.840]  Seinfeld will use I'll just turn the light on the heckler and they don't have
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.320]  anything they're just they're there they have a program so getting back on point
[43:36.320 --> 43:41.600]  we have the the GLBT Q mafia that's out there and the other mafia is the
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.760]  children of illegal immigrants and supposedly underrepresented minorities
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.640]  on campus at UC Davis there is an office in the so-called Student
[43:51.640 --> 43:57.000]  Community Center called AB 540 that stands for California Assembly Bill 540
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.800]  the so-called a dream act which hasn't even passed yet it's not close to passing
[44:02.800 --> 44:08.720]  but the University of California has taken upon itself probably from orders
[44:08.720 --> 44:13.560]  from the Pentagon of DoD or the Wall Street the city of London bankers on
[44:13.560 --> 44:19.280]  orders from them to establish a center to normalize their presence not just in
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.480]  the University but in society it's not that they care about the
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.280]  children of illegal immigrants and I have nothing against them personally
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.120]  they're wonderful individuals the students I know many of them but
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.760]  they're going to be used as tools in the future out of gratitude they're gonna
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.880]  be the people who are in CPS the social workers the psychotherapists the teachers
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.560]  the people who are helping to bring in this larger globalist
[44:48.560 --> 44:51.840]  sure the Soviet Union always uses to interrupt was it so true what you're
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.280]  saying I just got to back you up the Soviet Union the Nazis all totalitarians
[44:55.280 --> 45:00.080]  use quote orphans within a ten-year training program are then the shock
[45:00.080 --> 45:07.000]  troops they are the Jung and absolutely and you were mentioning that there's a
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.840]  ethnically correct interim president appointed to the University of Missouri
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.240]  I call that process whereby administrators and certain faculty
[45:17.240 --> 45:22.200]  including assistant professors who need need to show that they're quote-unquote
[45:22.200 --> 45:28.560]  down with the students in order to get tenure I call that flat mail as in flat
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.040]  catchers and this comes from Tom Wolf this is the common strategy if you read
[45:34.040 --> 45:40.800]  a classic essay by Tom Wolf called mamaowing the flat catchers 1970 he
[45:40.800 --> 45:46.760]  talks about how the so-called liberals with a small L got behind the original
[45:46.760 --> 45:50.880]  Black Panthers and got into this what he calls radical chic and that's one of
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.520]  the reasons why you're not hearing a lot of professionals come forward at this
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.560]  point I think they're they're they're starting to but not in large numbers
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.560]  because they're still going at they're still operating on the basis of what was
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.000]  going on through the 60s and 70s they don't realize that this is a really
[46:08.000 --> 46:15.760]  serious Maoist Paul pot type takeover using the Jung and as a means as a tool
[46:15.760 --> 46:21.240]  for the totalitarian takeover and the Paul pot time I have their children as I
[46:21.240 --> 46:26.640]  mentioned of the refugees in my classes it's it's difficult selling them but if
[46:26.640 --> 46:31.160]  they can get them into the so-called student community center take them
[46:31.160 --> 46:36.600]  take them to these retreats so-called and by the way the other red flag
[46:36.600 --> 46:42.200]  letter word is leadership leadership retreats they take them into a remote
[46:42.200 --> 46:47.840]  location to University of California owned or leased property they isolate
[46:47.840 --> 46:52.880]  them they play these little trust games the trainers with the master's degrees
[46:52.880 --> 46:58.840]  and PhD level psychotherapists are there to oversee it they are all trained in
[46:58.840 --> 47:03.480]  neuro linguistic programming the Delphi technique all these different mind
[47:03.480 --> 47:07.160]  control protocols that come out of the Stanford Research Institute Research
[47:07.160 --> 47:12.520]  Institute the RAND Corporation completely weaponized behavioral science
[47:12.520 --> 47:18.000]  directed against 18 19 year old first-year students who are away from home
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.120]  they're ripe for cult membership and indoctrination induction along with the
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.640]  various cults that line up by the coffee remember under the 60s earlier
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.120]  template that sounded reasonable don't tell your kids what to do let them be
[47:31.120 --> 47:37.280]  their own don't be their parents they're now looking for parents like young gang
[47:37.280 --> 47:40.240]  members you know looking for a father figure and joining the the Crips or
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.560]  whatever they're now looking for mommy and daddy and they're given it this is
[47:44.560 --> 47:49.840]  so systematic that's absolutely correct and the court that I'm talking about
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.840]  their their parents typically have their head screwed on straight their
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.120]  immigrants they came to the United States to make a living to live in
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.320]  freedom and liberty so it's really really difficult and also their their
[48:03.320 --> 48:09.240]  family oriented the Latinos Latinos they come from the society and culture that's
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.400]  wonderful the parent culture so when they come to the University of California
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.040]  they have to unlearn all that so they are indoctrinated by this weaponized
[48:18.040 --> 48:25.560]  behavioral science it works better on 4th 5th 6 7th generation whites I found
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.400]  are the absolute worst and then blacks feel like they've got a you know been
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.240]  wrong which they were but that that chip is reinstated and then projected on
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.680]  everybody I mean am I accurate in saying from your perspective that whites and
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.520]  blacks are the easiest to get into the brainwashing or is that wrong that is
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.640]  correct and I would add to that 4th and 5th generation Asian Americans and 4th
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.960]  and 5th generation Latinos and Latinos it's a generational drift away from
[48:47.960 --> 48:54.440]  the vitality of the parent culture and so that's why it's so important to start
[48:54.440 --> 48:57.720]  reteaching instead of doing this quote-unquote theory in the English
[48:57.720 --> 49:03.720]  Department of History let's read the Nordic tales the medieval literature the
[49:03.720 --> 49:10.040]  the great works of art literature music so that we can get this new renaissance
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.520]  into gear here and that's where we're heading this is where we're heading
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.040]  despite the little petty time let's talk about your main mission I mean because
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.920]  that's really this I mean you you have a solution I've read it your essays your
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.560]  work I mean you know because you're an insider how to beat them and the new
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.200]  renaissance is here we give them the opportunity that there's a real
[49:28.200 --> 49:33.520]  renaissance and it's about them it's game over that's right first of all I'm
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.680]  getting my students to start reading nothing they don't have to read
[49:37.680 --> 49:44.640]  Dubliners or Ulysses by James Joyce which was purposely made difficult to
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.680]  understand so that you create jobs for professors of literature but even popular
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.960]  literature like Michael Creighton I mean before he was well let's say he died
[49:55.960 --> 50:01.280]  okay before he expired he was really really getting into the heart of this
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.800]  bio weaponization system with his novel next and a state of fear where he took
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.240]  apart the whole fake environmental scare and even had a bibliography in the back
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.160]  of his book and an author's statement now this is a man who has a medical degree
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.640]  from Harvard Medical School and he's a hugely popular writer so I get to say
[50:20.640 --> 50:25.800]  please we're coming up to Thanksgiving and the winter holidays you know read a
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.280]  novel and even if it has to be JK Rowling the Satanist you read it with a
[50:30.280 --> 50:35.280]  certain eye if you want to read Tolkien that's fine if you're a ringer fine but
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.400]  understand the the occultic and the social and cultural engineering and the
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.080]  Tavistock connections to to these forms of the mass mind control by the way one
[50:45.080 --> 50:48.720]  thing I found common to a lot of the current generation of students and this
[50:48.720 --> 50:52.560]  is true not just with Americans but I also taught a course this summer both
[50:52.560 --> 50:57.520]  for a full writers and so these are the best and brightest of young people
[50:57.520 --> 51:02.120]  from all over the world there's one common literary source that they all
[51:02.120 --> 51:07.960]  share and this is something that that needs to be looked into by people in the
[51:07.960 --> 51:12.000]  English department or comparative literature they've all read Harry Potter
[51:12.000 --> 51:18.120]  all the volumes these were the kids that stood in line until midnight waiting
[51:18.120 --> 51:22.200]  for the next volume to drop they've all read it systematically so there's
[51:22.200 --> 51:25.320]  something there this could be like the catcher in the rye of the current
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.080]  millennial generation it might be one of those Mark David Chapman sugar type
[51:30.080 --> 51:35.480]  deals but and by the way everything you say it is so backed up in fact I just
[51:35.480 --> 51:39.560]  want to talk about Dr. Nick baggage whose of course brother was a US senator
[51:39.560 --> 51:45.280]  his father congressman he's detailed thousands of patents but hundreds of
[51:45.280 --> 51:50.720]  them and DARPA and antennas and I even read articles in the Baltimore Sun on
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.960]  air where DARPA said you know at the local universities were testing systems
[51:55.960 --> 52:00.520]  with wavelengths to soothe the students so when you bring that up I don't know
[52:00.520 --> 52:05.600]  how much you can go into it sounds crazy but we're in 2015 he says don't worry
[52:05.600 --> 52:08.960]  about the fluoride in the water that's bad enough that yes they are in
[52:08.960 --> 52:14.320]  selective areas testing and and we know that it's patented for decades literal
[52:14.320 --> 52:19.920]  wavelengths with frequency pollution and then I look at the students that come
[52:19.920 --> 52:23.800]  out and protest us the Maoists they have tattoos a Mao on them black white you
[52:23.800 --> 52:29.560]  name it when I look at the the student that was attacking the professor you
[52:29.560 --> 52:34.320]  know they're at Yale at the free speech summit they it they can't walk they're
[52:34.320 --> 52:38.360]  kind of falling down they look crazy their eyes don't point the right
[52:38.360 --> 52:41.600]  directions and I don't go off of books cover but when I went out to this pro
[52:41.600 --> 52:46.240]  life demonstration and literal people showed a black white you name it don't
[52:46.240 --> 52:50.720]  look the same spiritually wise they were like the white people almost had
[52:50.720 --> 52:54.280]  like green skin they were all wearing black they would stumble into me and
[52:54.280 --> 52:59.600]  like but they all pulled up like a you know brand new black jaguars and stuff
[52:59.600 --> 53:03.280]  talk about the act of a chic and then we went and tracked them as we got a tip
[53:03.280 --> 53:08.520]  they're like at the police review boards with the UT professors literally setting
[53:08.520 --> 53:13.080]  up like a communist takeover and admitting it I mean it's just like
[53:13.080 --> 53:17.960]  that's who the elite are gonna put in charge is like weirdos stumbling around
[53:17.960 --> 53:22.240]  saying they love Satan that can hardly walk I mean there's something going on
[53:22.240 --> 53:26.720]  like is it spiritual is it chemicals what are they doing to these I mean we
[53:26.720 --> 53:30.720]  know about MK ultra and the unabomber you know at Harvard or whatever it was
[53:30.720 --> 53:36.520]  with the CIA MK ultra programming he was in that folks that's that's LA times
[53:36.520 --> 53:41.120]  I'm kind of ranting here it's just I'm noticing something that they're like
[53:41.120 --> 53:47.160]  zombies have you seen that absolutely their EMF zombies as I told you before
[53:47.160 --> 53:53.880]  chance to Linda Kata he has 19 unique patents on a Tana antenna technology to
[53:53.880 --> 53:58.080]  her name that it's not an accident that she was put into position because the
[53:58.080 --> 54:02.160]  University of California Davis also has a close connection an intimate
[54:02.160 --> 54:08.280]  connection with the Los Alamos nuclear labs and the Lawrence Livermore Edward
[54:08.280 --> 54:14.400]  Teller thought UC Davis was one of his favorite campuses so UC Davis is and it
[54:14.400 --> 54:17.760]  also has a national primate laboratory where they workshop all these different
[54:17.760 --> 54:23.440]  EMG and different types of you know I was led into the UT facility while I
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.120]  want to get arrested I wasn't led into it I was I was allowed to get camera into
[54:27.120 --> 54:30.840]  it from the psychology department hell on earth but you know none of the
[54:30.840 --> 54:36.240]  liberals want to stop that you know there's no discussion about that no yeah
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.160]  welcome to the monkey house and it's interesting that you brought up Dr. Nick
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.040]  Begich I was going to speak to some of the really early on discoveries or
[54:46.040 --> 54:50.520]  insights that Dr. Begich had and that was his his work on the harp what we're
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.600]  seeing here with students on campus is that crazed look that Maoist comm you
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.760]  look that you have seen in people both on tape and and in person that comes from
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.280]  EMF this is harp this is harp in action so ladies and gentlemen if you think
[55:05.280 --> 55:11.320]  this is the harp probe project there's just for our enemies foreign it's really
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.040]  for the people the American people and they're hitting our young people the
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.600]  most we know about the psychotropic so I was going to mention Dr. Peter Bragan's
[55:18.600 --> 55:24.200]  great work on psychotropic drugs we know that a large percent of percentage of
[55:24.200 --> 55:28.400]  not most of the young men and women are on some form of very powerful
[55:28.400 --> 55:32.840]  hallucinogenic drugs they should be taking nutraceuticals vitamin supplements
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.160]  and they also should be taking mandatory gym classes that's one of my
[55:37.160 --> 55:42.160]  suggestions that we need to bring back PE of K through 12 through middle and
[55:42.160 --> 55:45.960]  high school and also to the college and university so people can start getting
[55:45.960 --> 55:49.880]  class they have no social skills too I mean are you seeing that you need to
[55:49.880 --> 55:54.800]  look learn how to be true team players not not Maoist pull pot type of zombie
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.760]  players wow and so yeah it's it's definitely harp I think that's
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.840]  something that needs to be looked at much more closely last academic year a
[56:05.840 --> 56:11.680]  portable very very powerful antenna portable antenna showed up and people
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.000]  were talking about then it kind of went away but they're experimenting with it
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.560]  they're putting in new lighting systems supposedly smart lighting systems you
[56:20.560 --> 56:26.080]  name it that's even in USA today that it can be used to transmit data back and
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.440]  forth but also to calm the police officers in Minnesota where they put it
[56:31.440 --> 56:35.760]  in first and they just put out like a lot you like it's like Rasmussen pull
[56:35.760 --> 56:41.040]  national polls should we arrest global warming skeptics it's just kind of oh
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.120]  the lights calm the police officers I mean we're not making this up it sounds
[56:46.120 --> 56:50.280]  fantastical but it's all really going on I mean I remember five years ago six
[56:50.280 --> 56:53.600]  years ago exposing stingray systems and they wouldn't admit they were there now
[56:53.600 --> 56:56.720]  everybody's like oh of course there's secret cell towers grabbing everything I
[56:56.720 --> 57:01.440]  mean it's just I'm telling you it is a fantastical time to be alive as scary as
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.920]  it is professor isn't it exciting that we are conscious wonder trying to figure
[57:05.920 --> 57:11.920]  this out I mean it's an adventure it is an adventure I am so glad happy honored
[57:11.920 --> 57:17.640]  to be here in 2015 joining in this battle with you and the people Liberty
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.400]  loving people in America and around the world to take back our civilization and
[57:22.400 --> 57:27.200]  we are going to win because all I have to do is talk to the gangstalkers
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.560]  individually and they melt they break down the programming just disappears
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.880]  it's not that strong because you've got humanity and it's electrical exactly
[57:36.880 --> 57:40.680]  they know I'm real they know I'm sincere they don't they know I don't have an
[57:40.680 --> 57:46.040]  axe to grind or a hidden agenda if I did I would you know be on Wall Street or
[57:46.040 --> 57:50.600]  something but when you tell the truth the eloquent way you do and expose it and
[57:50.600 --> 57:53.680]  give the sources they've been looking for the truth they're already
[57:53.680 --> 57:56.880]  subconsciously smart that you're not teaching you anything you're just
[57:56.880 --> 58:00.440]  telling them what they already knew but was blinded you're just taking you're
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.560]  just opening the curtains and the lights coming in and that's why we are
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.920]  going to win is because humanity wants to succeed together to the stars it's
[58:07.920 --> 58:13.160]  going to happen we've just got to really work hard to try to make this
[58:13.160 --> 58:17.560]  transition period not as destructive as these wicked elites I would rather it be
[58:17.560 --> 58:20.680]  I'm going to go to break keep over five minutes or he probably got to go to finish
[58:20.680 --> 58:24.160]  up talk about some of your papers how we keep you at the university how we get
[58:24.160 --> 58:27.520]  what you're teaching in associate programs maybe to other universities I
[58:27.520 --> 58:31.920]  know there are a lot of other professors around the country of every race color
[58:31.920 --> 58:35.960]  creed religion that are also basically saying the same thing you're saying this

[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.880]  hole in the ground all you know how to do is to be cowardly pathetic failures who

[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.320]  deadlift or I got a cling they're like a mountain I gotta climb you're there as
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.120]  an obstacle your weakness your giant piles of fraud your lies your deception

[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.920]  nothing but an obstacle to make me strong you understand that you're an
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.480]  inanimate dead object like a boulder that I'm gonna climb and I'm going to
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:25.080]  climb you and I'm gonna make it past you and you're not gonna stop us in our
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:30.240]  long march to humanity's ultimate destiny oh you never thought about an
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.720]  ultimate destiny you don't like things like that people want destinies people
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.760]  want to do big things I hate myself so I hate you and I'm gonna project it on
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:50.600]  you and I'm gonna screw up your life yeah go ahead and try then you were
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:57.960]  forged by your god to be weak I wasn't made that way and and as weak as I am
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.400]  because believe me I'm only flesh and blood I am transcendent compared to you
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.360]  people I've already won thank Jesus Christ for that one
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.400]  one of the devil's biggest tricks is selling the idea that Satanism gives
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:22.320]  you free will and empowerment no it doesn't Christ gives you power Christ
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.240]  gives you will Christ gives you strength and the churches on purpose sell this
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.760]  image of an incredibly weak Christ figure so that you don't understand the
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:39.080]  power that it took to lay down to all that weakness and that patheticness to a
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:48.360]  bunch of bugs that was strength that was honor that was will and to take on at
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.480]  the same time all of our weakness and then to transcend it that's the great

[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.680]  pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news anti-vaccine parents to stop
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.840]  receiving child care benefits under Australian no jab no pay law the new
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.400]  changes that will take effect on January 1st 2016 are projected to save the
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.400]  Australian government over 500 million dollars over four years and how many
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.560]  children are not receiving their vaccines according to the Australian
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.920]  childhood immunization register it's 1.77 percent I thought all you needed was
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.960]  90 percent to have heard immunity the government believes that by removing the
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.360]  non-medical exemption it will reinforce the importance of immunization and
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.760]  protecting public health but what this is really about is the government wants
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.960]  to put anything in your body that they want and they want to make sure you

[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:29.000]  you know I have mixed feelings about the next hour because I've studied
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.200]  DARPA the government's advanced research laboratories the Defense
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:42.440]  Department's advanced research programs Eisenhower in 1961 when he gave his
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.280]  farewell address we've played the full 21-minute address here many times we've
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.240]  played the clip in fact we ought to queue it up where he talks about a
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.640]  technological elite in control of the military industrial complex creating a
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:03.960]  breakaway civilization and using the super advanced technologies to basically
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:09.720]  build backdoors into all of the culture and society to create a brain trust that
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.400]  did not deploy that knowledge to the general public but kept it to itself as
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:22.400]  a way to gain total hegemonic power I haven't read this book yet I've just
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.720]  got it a few days ago scanned over at this morning looked at some of the
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.720]  pictures read the synopsis read the reviews I've read some of the articles
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:36.160]  about it and let me tell you this weekend when I go to the local pool my
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.040]  kids I'm gonna be trying to sneak in an hour or so while they're swimming and
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.680]  fighting with each other or whatever over floats fighting friendly trying to
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:51.280]  read this because it's important and you know this show we get into all this we
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.320]  research it we think we know it all you read it all together because I've
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.760]  already started reading it it just you learn a lot from it because this is the
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.080]  real world I mean you think secret government programs ended with a
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.720]  Manhattan Project and the A-bomb I will assure you that was just the beginning
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.920]  of the shadow government and the National Security Act and the rest of it
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.960]  I'll never forget it was in the Baltimore Sun I talked about this many
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:20.160]  times like 18 years ago and they talked about DARPA practicing just testing in
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.000]  major cities through cell towers putting on calming waves for the public now
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.280]  usually it's schizophrenics that have had heavy metal toxification that they're
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.480]  not actually under cell phone tower control but I'd always heard that from
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.280]  people and then they're always reading in the paper and I'm like what is this
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.880]  is this something to condition me to get me ready for this so how deep does the
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:45.920]  rabbit hole really go we're not selling this book but it is a great pitch I'm
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.360]  giving it the Pentagon's brain and uncensored history of DARPA America's
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.640]  top secret military research agency Annie Jacobson author of the New York
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:00.200]  Times bestseller area 51 in operation paperclip you know I knew about
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.160]  operation paperclip and I'm gonna go to our guest when I was about six or seven
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:12.360]  of my grandfather would be sitting there around his round kitchen table talking
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:17.240]  about reentry devices and Merv technology and space bases and Werner von
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.760]  Braun and all the rest of it and he would talk about damn Nazis as he was
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.560]  you know in World War two a pilot and how he would in Texas go to these
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:33.040]  military bases when he was doing work for DARPA I've never been told all of
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.160]  them it was it was basically crowd control robots and stuff it was secret
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.520]  and he and he would just talk about how much he hated Nazis because he got out
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.720]  of whatever it was because it was Nazis that he would run into and I remember
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.840]  sitting around my my mom would be like he's a little eccentric my dad would
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.800]  like no he's not eccentric your grandfather's really smart but imagine
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.040]  you're six seven years old hearing about Nazis at US military bases believe
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:02.840]  me it it'll get your attention but that said let's now move on to our guest the
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.040]  Pentagon's brain Annie Jacobson thank you so much for joining us
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.160]  congratulations on your new book oh wow where does this start I mean where should
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.800]  we go Thomas something as big as DARPA well thank you so much for having me
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.560]  and I loved that intro fascinating about the Nazis so how about we start
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.360]  right there how about I tell you a fascinating story about Nazis and DARPA
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.680]  let's do it okay so the way I got interested in this book in the first
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.880]  place I was finishing up my operation paperclip Nazi scientist book and I
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.260]  learned that the first that there was a new agent I was wondering what von
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.840]  Braun was doing in the 50s after he had kind of settled in and was building
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:46.440]  rockets for the government and I learned that he was the first choice in 1958 for
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.840]  this brand new agency at the Pentagon called was then called ARPA now we know
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.320]  it is DARPA and von Braun is nothing if not ambitious so he says to the Pentagon
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.000]  well I will come and be your chief scientist of all your research military
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.960]  research agency however I need to bring 12 of my fellow Nazis with me and that
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.560]  was the line in the sand for the Pentagon they thought we can deal with one but
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.840]  not all 12 of them right here at the beating heart of the Pentagon and so
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.520]  instead Herb York became the director Wow and then they spun off and sent him
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.960]  over to NASA I guess and then he brought in Goddard and everybody else yes yes
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.760]  but here's another little Nazi link you might enjoy which is that you know you
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.760]  spoke of the of the military industrial complex you've run Eisenhower speech so
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.360]  specifically Herb York that chief scientist of DARPA first chief scientist
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.040]  wanted to know he was troubled he said in his memoirs to whom Eisenhower was
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.480]  referring specifically so when Eisenhower retired Herb York went to go see
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.800]  him at Eisenhower's home here in the California desert and got him to say who
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.840]  specifically it was he was afraid of and the two people he named were Edward
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:10.640]  Teller father of the hydrogen bomb and Warner von Brown Wow so much of our
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.240]  world has been shaped by these people it's just mind-boggling that's why I
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.320]  can't wait to read your book I'm greedily looking at it like it's a big a big
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.720]  cake I want to carve into accelerating into what got a lot of news you were
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:29.080]  talking about DARPA and brain chips and troops tell us about that yes so so much
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.200]  of this book I wrote is really about man and machine man's relationship with
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:40.120]  machines as we came out of World War two technology just takes off and when you
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.680]  get to the end of the book you learn about this new future idea which is
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.720]  actually very much part of the present but is accelerating us into the future
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:56.440]  which is the Pentagon specifically DARPA's plan to couple man and machine so
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.440]  that science fiction idea of cyborg is now becoming a reality at the Pentagon
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.680]  and by the way this is all dogma these are you know I pull quotes out of
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.760]  Pentagon unclassified reports that talk about we must accelerate our
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.800]  artificially intelligence weapon system we must take advantage of this new
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.600]  brain technology the Pentagon calls it neuro prosthetics but met you know you
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.520]  or I might call it brain chips and those are the plans to begin these and they
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.960]  are beginning these clinical trials where soldiers who have come back from
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.800]  Iraq and Afghanistan with cognitive impairment they're called brain wounded
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.280]  warriors by the Pentagon there's 300,000 of them who came home from those wars
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.400]  and in the clinical trials where they are now they're putting these brain chips
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:54.000]  into the soft tissue of the brain to restore cognitive functioning that's
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  the plan but what I also found in interviewing for example the Jason
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.440]  scientist that the Pentagon is being advised this is not a good idea and
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:09.840]  this is a direct quote because it could lead to high quality brain control
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:17.600]  Wow direct quote that is not Annie Jacobson idea about what might happen that's
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.840]  the Jason scientist who by the way have been advising DARPA since 1960 I
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.080]  interviewed Murph Goldberger for the book he was the co-founder of the Jason
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.360]  scientist and he just died but he shared with me a lot of fascinating
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.200]  information about you know advising DARPA about what weapons systems to
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:42.320]  design over the decade and then other futures depending on like Marshall and
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.320]  others I want to try to walk through some of those but my issue with it is
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.000]  it's like Volkswagen putting cheating software on their emissions testing the
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.360]  problem is my uncle was in a motorcycle accident he has epilepsy from it they
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.160]  they gave him a brain chip and a stimulator it's really helped his
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.280]  quality of life I'm all for it I'm not against technology the problem is these
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.560]  companies and corporations always want to piggyback something into it and it's
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:13.780]  so complex that how do you stop Trojan horses or how do you stop hacks once we
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:17.920]  start taking brain chips well absolutely and this is the heart of the
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:23.400]  matter it's the double-edged sword of these military systems that DARPA
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.840]  creates yes there are these amazing benefits that make their way into the
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.560]  population I see an uncle yes and also like your uncle brain chip I mean every
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:39.840]  every side has two sides in essence but here's the thing is that that which keeps
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.440]  you safe can also harm you and so for me just as a journalist I mean my job is to
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.240]  inform the public and so it's like and I love that you play eyes in our speech
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.240]  because he says in that second part of his military industrial complex speech
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.720]  you know these two ideas can live together you can have a very strong
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.360]  military you can have a necessary national defense but it must be in
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.480]  balance with what he calls an alert and knowledgeable citizenry and there's the
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:16.080]  rub that's why people it behooves them to know about these programs these are
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.440]  not you know things of science fiction novels look the DARPA director said just
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.200]  the other day at the Aspen conference everything is science fiction until it
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:33.160]  becomes real it is everything is magic until it becomes real yes and and the
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:38.760]  thing is that DARPA because their job is to create revolution in military
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.440]  affairs think about that word I mean a revolution is not a revolution if
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:48.040]  there's not an element of surprise and so DARPA is working on weapon systems
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.520]  20-25 years out they invented stealth I mean they didn't invent it but their
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:59.120]  scientists created stealth and then when stealth was unveiled during the goal for
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.920]  you know it took the enemy by surprise so what's the what is DARPA doing now and
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.360]  when I show you in the book what DARPA is doing that's unclassified that I was
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.000]  able to report on from interviewing scientists you get to decide for yourself
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.360]  okay so what is really going on well I can't wait to read the book I'm gonna
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.280]  come back from break I want to just talk about what you think are some of
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.640]  most important parts of the book it is a big book a lot of photos a lot of
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640]  diagrams a lot of information and you know for me this is the real world
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.760]  people talk about sports icons Hollywood it's all really boring when you
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.720]  realize that what we see with DARPA is only the tip of the iceberg of a giant
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:46.600]  submerged shadow technological system and as you said the stealth technology was
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:55.160]  25 30 years old when they rolled it out in 1987 1988 it's just amazing
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.640]  he'll be back stay with us inside the Pentagon's brain so listen up here guys
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:07.280]  my buddy Mark he overhears the management team at guns80.com and what
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.480]  they're saying is that between now and black Friday they're gonna put a

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:25.400]  broadcast as well the Pentagon's brain an uncensored history of DARPA America's
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:31.440]  top secret military research agency Annie Jacobson is our guest and Gerald
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.600]  Posner author of God's Bankers said Annie Jacobson's considerable talents and
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.400]  investigative journalists prove indispensable in uncovering the
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.840]  remarkable history of one of America's most powerful and clandestine military
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.720]  research agencies and she is a great storyteller making the tantalizing tale
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.920]  of Pentagon's brain from the depths of the Cold War the present day come alive
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.480]  on every page you know you've been nice and it kind of let me leave the
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.560]  interview at first but you're the expert on this and obviously the expert on your
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.440]  book it you heard my point going into break I mean this is a shadow government
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.560]  it did basically become what Eisenhower warned about to a certain extent and I
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.040]  think that adds the arrogance of Washington because imagine what they've
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:22.280]  got they're not telling us about but at a certain point still it's just humans
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:27.600]  that are running this whole thing yes should I tell you about one of the
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:33.400]  spooky programs yes please okay so we were talking about coupling man and
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.280]  machine that's the goal for the future but DARPA is already able to create what
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.320]  they call biohybrid that is their actual term for it and it's actually it's like
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:51.480]  part animal part machine and this is now 12 13 years old this program the
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.640]  success of it so back in 2002 they had their first public success DARPA
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.840]  scientists wired up a rat brain these were like with tiny wires the size of
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:09.800]  human hairs connected to electrodes and also connected to a microprocessor that
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.280]  was sewn into the rat back like a backpack then from 500 meters away the
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:23.680]  scientists remotely controlled this rat through a maze okay and this process has
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.520]  been ongoing of coupling more animals with machines and just last year DARPA
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.320]  scientists did the same thing with a moth so they inserted the electrodes these
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.720]  neuro prosthetics into the moth when it was in its poop a stage so think that
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.760]  through it's like this incredible analogy of metamorphosis so they put the
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.160]  electrodes in the poop a stage the worm stage and then the moth you know the
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:55.560]  wings blossom in essence and now the brain chips the body chip is part of
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.880]  the animal and the DARPA scientists were able to steer this mandica sexta moth
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:07.320]  that same way the moth only has a life cycle of 90 days so it was like a short
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:14.440]  experiment but you can see this movement toward being able to control humans in
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.920]  the same manner absolutely it's the end of free will you know if you sign up for
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.320]  it I mean and I think that's the rub I think that there's a lot to be said
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  about being aware of how these military applications you know are or not are not
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.360]  appropriate the government calls it the super soldier program I mean that's
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:45.560]  what it is giving warfighters enhanced cognition enhanced physiology we all know
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.760]  there's governors lifting weights or marching they can just flip a switch
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.640]  you can march a hundred miles or you can wear the super suit which by the way
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.520]  DARPA has teamed up with special forces now to create this palo super suit I
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.760]  mean it has you know it does everything it even has like blood hemorrhage control
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:11.280]  mechanism inside of it good God but you have to ask yourself what it where it's
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.000]  really going toward is a concept called transhumanism this idea and people who
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.480]  are pro transhumanism believe that it's actually a good idea that why not why
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.400]  shouldn't man with all his intelligence all his technology all his science be
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.320]  able to kind of control his own evolution by merging himself with machine
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.640]  but of course many other people think this is a really bad idea well I'm not
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:43.520]  against it in general but the elite we have basically sheep dip eugenics as you
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.640]  know at the end of World War two because Hitler gave it a bad name and turned it
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.440]  into transhumanism I think transhumanists are all eugenicists but
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.880]  that's what it came from oldest Huxley's brother Julian Huxley at the UN wrote
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.360]  papers admitting all this so my problem is there a lot of the elite want to use
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.200]  this for population control not to empower people and so I don't see us
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.240]  being given a choice as Ray Kurzweil says well you may not be augmented but
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:15.600]  you'll be like a bug basically I mean look this is definitely something worth
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.000]  discussing I think that's the whole point is that you know just to kind of
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.080]  like ignore it all is a bit like putting your head in the sand like an
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:30.360]  ostrich and leaving your neck exposed I mean you want you people want to be
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.960]  aware of of what is going on and any Jacobson stay there we gotta go to
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.920]  break absolutely let's come back and discuss that and walk through it because
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:43.080]  we're talking about the whole future of the world here any Jacobson.com is her
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.720]  website I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com we're talking about reality we're on
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:56.880]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.840]  while ISIS threatens to attack the US record number of legal immigrants are
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.880]  flooding into the country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.560]  barely a week after the November 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris France US border
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.600]  patrol revealed that nearly 3,000 unaccompanied children were caught
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.880]  crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks but just think of how
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.640]  many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:23.040]  caught it's probably at least 10 times more speaking on the subject House
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.880]  Representative Duncan Hunter said quote the greatest existential threat to this
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.000]  nation right now is this administration's open border policy. Hunter is
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.600]  speaking the truth ISIS is likely already exploiting President Obama's
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.400]  open border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country but here's
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.640]  something else you may not realize human traffickers are also taking advantage
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.520]  of Obama's open borders to enslave women around the world and import them as
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.520]  sex slaves into the US in other words Obama's lax enforcement immigration laws
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.920]  is fueling a war on women. This is Kit Daniels with infoworse.com and be sure

[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:29.520]  subject because it is the subject shadow government shadow technology
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.760]  super technologies super science it was science fiction is now reality and just
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.560]  from my own family experiences with my grandfather and then some other members
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:45.960]  the family I know there are huge secret government programs going on that are
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:52.120]  way more 20 30 40 50 years in advance depending on the science of what we even
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:58.360]  know about and we understand that from television and and so many of these
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.400]  other technologies it's dumbing us down our physical IQ is dropping that so so
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:09.280]  that's that that's not just that's not just the the the nurture it's it's the
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:17.160]  nature as well humanity is falling apart in many respects and so the answers to
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.960]  our future could be in the technology the problem is elites are very predatory
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:28.840]  on average historically and they're using it to control and everything they're
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.560]  doing is about ending free will and making us take what the government
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.680]  wants into our bodies i.e. vaccines back like we're against vaccine technology
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.000]  because we're just ignorant hillbillies no we know about all the recalls the
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.600]  problems the additives the immunity of the vaccine makers the fact they want to
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.920]  make a hundred and something vaccines mandatory we know it's linked to major
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.560]  problems and they just sell this thing of it's science take it and gmo it's
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.920]  science eat it oh really i got all these studies shut up and take it you know
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:03.080]  glyphosate never hurt anybody you can drink it okay lobbyists drink it i'm
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:11.080]  gonna drink that so that's my problem is so many of these corporate leaders are
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:17.000]  delusional they're on power trips they're narcissistic and who wouldn't be with
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.640]  billions of dollars and helicopters and all the power you want and hey i get a
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.160]  manhattan project to live forever that's really what this is the manhattan
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.240]  project for eternal life they're just using the pentagon and all of these
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:36.120]  operations as the focused compartmentalized template to siphon off the
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:42.040]  goodies and what happens when they do achieve artificial intelligence they
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.960]  may have already done it what happens when they do achieve for all intents and
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.120]  purposes eternal life then the future doesn't need us anymore
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.480]  the seven and a half billion people on this planet and when i talk to the top
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  tech people when i talk to the billionaires the ones that'll talk to me
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.840]  they say yo you're right uh when i go to these big meetings and i go to these
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.560]  big events i've talked to folks that have been the boulder bird
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.640]  they go we discuss why haven't we just released a bioweapon and wiped everybody
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.360]  out because you know the profane public doesn't
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:15.320]  deserve all this only us the you know these ascended gods deserve it
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.440]  so that's being discussed you need to understand that
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.000]  now that's a pretty heavy talk anne jakebson is our guest anne jakebson
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.360]  dot com the new book the pentagon's brain
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.960]  so i've set the table now and i want to try to give you the floor to really walk
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:34.120]  through all this i've laid out my fears my concerns where
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.920]  this is going the elite already kind of act like
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.800]  they've had some major breakthroughs and we don't exist anymore
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.000]  they don't even really care their propaganda doesn't work anymore so and i'm
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.360]  seeing a lot of digging in a lot of bunkers being built a lot of
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:50.840]  elites running off that find out about this to armored redoubts
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.320]  in new zealand i talked about this a decade ago it's now in the news
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.120]  whatever the billionaires whatever the top technicians that are given entry into
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:05.720]  this are being told uh makes them cry so kind of a
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.560]  heavy interview anne but where do you want to go with that
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.640]  well let's talk about fear for a moment and narrative because
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.960]  you know you and i are in the same business in essence i i mean i'm
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.720]  informed the public and so do you that's the job of the journalist okay
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.920]  so what i found really just at the edge of sinister
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.480]  um trying to maintain objectivity i find that word okay
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.200]  so because darpa now has a program that has to do with
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:41.000]  trust and it seems to have been born out of this idea
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.160]  that at the pentagon as the pentagon is moving toward
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.080]  autonomous robots toward hunter killer robots as we've been talking about
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:52.520]  merging man and machine merging animal and machine
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.800]  getting an army of drones on the battlefield that are part and parcel
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.320]  man machine um there's been pushback inside the pentagon
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.800]  these are doc documents i refer to in the book
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:05.400]  where people from the military commanders to the drone operators say
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:11.240]  this is a bad idea they mistrust the idea of coupling man and machine
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.080]  these yeah we need to build a world for humans and not just give ourselves
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.280]  over to it until we know it it works properly
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.200]  yes and these are actually individuals inside the military establishment
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.880]  saying you know the probability and consequences of failure are too great
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.120]  we don't want to go there and so what does the defense science board so you
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.120]  talk about the elite i'll tell you the defense science board is a group of
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.960]  elite advisors in the pentagon that very few people have
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:43.720]  heard of dsb and they advise both the president and they advise the pentagon
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:49.560]  and the dsb looks at this idea uh about mistrusting robots and they
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.240]  say this attitude must change we must have
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.720]  they call unambiguously for the rapid acceleration
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:01.560]  and the development of these ai weapon systems okay hold that thought separate
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.440]  from that right around the same time DARPA teams up with iARPA
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:12.280]  which is the cia DARPA that stands for intelligent advanced research project
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.440]  agency and they begin a program and this is where i talk to you about fear and
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.120]  about narration narratives it's called narrative networks
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.520]  and two and they're looking at how to develop techniques
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.520]  this is language from them to call to look at the effects
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.400]  of narrative on human cognition to look at the effects of how people can be
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.440]  influenced but specifically they're looking at it through
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.760]  chemical means and this is what i found sinister
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.680]  there's a chemical in the brain called oxytocin
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.320]  and it's often called the moral molecule it's released i'll give you an example
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.920]  when a mother is breastfeeding oxytocin is released
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.080]  that's that ultimate bond of trust between mother and breastfeeding child
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:02.520]  okay oxytocin well DARPA has a program to look at our
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.640]  oxytocin and see how it can be used in terms of trust
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.200]  separate from that a researcher in germany told scientific american recently
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:18.680]  that she did a study um injecting oxytocin in the nose of 64 men to see if
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.840]  she could erase fear and she said that's exactly what
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.000]  happened so you have to ask yourself what is going on with this idea
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.840]  of getting rid of fear
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:34.040]  well i've got the answer to DARPA if you just get your life together
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.640]  and get a purpose-driven life to stand up for honor and good people
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.160]  i can dose myself immediately and i have no fear knowing i'm doing it for
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160]  children i mean that's why they always say it's for the
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.120]  children it's for the children they know with psych warfare terms
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.840]  how to get us to release that at least people that are moral
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:53.400]  and manipulate us so this is this is so advanced there's obviously chemical
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.360]  warfare going on through so many of the additives
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.760]  i know you're an investigative journalist you don't go off into that but i can
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.520]  pull articles up and show you right now you're highly informed undoubtedly
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.440]  everything we're being told about is super ancient
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.640]  uh in in in modern terms you know ten years ago was ancient
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.800]  i remember seeing uh science papers when i was a kid
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.040]  uh you know laying around the house of like roaches that had
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.240]  silicon microchips they could control so DARPA talks about robo rat being 12
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:27.080]  years old that's their rollout of robo rat
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.000]  yes yes yes you're absolutely right i mean what you're talking what is going
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.920]  on 10 25 years down the road we find out you know or rather we find out now
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.080]  what has been going on look at drones drones i learned in researching my
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.520]  book on DARPA here that drones first made an appearance on the
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:49.800]  battlefield are you ready for this in vietnam and yet you know in 1968 there
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.960]  were these two drone systems called night panther and night gazelle okay
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.840]  and yet most people think drones made an appearance on the battlefield in
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.560]  afghanistan in 2002 i know my grandfather my grandfather
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.760]  sold it and then it was classified but he sold a crowd control robot
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.760]  that he developed uh at fort hood to the pentagon in like the 70s
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.800]  mmm that was part of the non lethal weapons program that was yes crowd control
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.240]  that was born out of you know what are we going to do about these vietnam
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.240]  protesters absolutely and then vietnam ended so they didn't they
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.520]  didn't buy them but the pro but those non lethal
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.200]  weapons have continued those really have a lot to do with crowd control
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.040]  and they um they were you know where they were developed many of the laboratories
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.120]  were actually in saigon during the war in thailand
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.560]  during the war because it was much easier to keep them
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.280]  far away from the public and disguise them as if they were being used
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.360]  um you know against you know the vietnam and vietnam when in fact
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.240]  as i report in the book they were actually being designed for
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.880]  use back home i covered a story about 16 17 years ago
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.880]  the sunshine project out of ut a professor and this is one of the only
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.000]  times we actually got visited and and then the and then they agreed to
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.120]  reclassify and they shut down the sunshine project
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.800]  but this was drones to be used to deploy chemicals
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.800]  for crowd control across the united states did you ever run anything like
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.880]  that well i didn't run in that's interesting
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.600]  drones dropping chemicals i mean i i learned about them the DARPA programs
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.320]  that had to do with kind of like shooting them out of
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.000]  cannons um or conventional weapons but obviously
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.920]  helicopter pilots might say no to spray a hallucinogen on austin texas or an
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.440]  opiate knockout gas the problem is it causes a lot of fatalities as a car
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.640]  wrecks and fires and stuff like that that's why they they call it unethical
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.680]  they keep it classified but they declassified this and then they
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.560]  reclassified it and uh and and it was they were
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.080]  so threatening to us that i just said fine i'd covered it
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:02.840]  then they went and shut down the ut project and then DARPA
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.240]  left it on the archive of google you can actually look it up
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.560]  they didn't google i guess refused to remove it i i don't know
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.760]  wow yeah it's that way back machine i found some stuff that way that is
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:18.680]  interesting i mean and and how ironic that the internet used to be called the
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:21.960]  ARPA net yes because it is a DARPA invention
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.800]  yeah well i just don't get why they have ut shut it down on the sunshine
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.440]  project shut it down and have us shut it down and then they just left it on
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.640]  google well they might not be able to get rid of it
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.720]  i mean that is what is interesting you know
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.000]  there are little stories about that all the time about researchers finding
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.200]  documents and say the national archives i write about one of them
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:45.880]  this giant program for the apocalypse um it was called the doomsday project and
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.840]  you know a researcher uncovers it makes it public
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.760]  then the department of defense steps in reclassifies it
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.240]  but it's still out there as it should be and so there's really nothing that the
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.800]  government can do about it at that point once it's
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.080]  on the internet as a pdf file or as part of the way back machine
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.000]  what about i've read your book yet i'm reading this weekend as i said the
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.640]  folks just tuned in we're talking to the pentagon's brain author annie
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:16.840]  jackson what about other governments and and and their DARPAs are their ARPAs
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:22.120]  what's your expert take on that well again there's where you have to really
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.640]  acknowledge that DARPA is a major force and it's major it's a major
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.080]  significant force for americans for national security i mean you must give
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:34.120]  credit where credit is due the agency was created
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.960]  when the russians beat us into space with spotnick
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.200]  and in all these decades since DARPA has done its job
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.520]  we've never been taken by technological surprise and you can be sure
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:52.760]  that there is a goal by other enemy nations be it russia or china or even a
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.400]  dark horse like saudi arabia i've been told to try to break one of these major
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.520]  barriers artificial intelligence cloning to embarrass the united states
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:06.120]  and you know kind of score that propaganda coup
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:12.120]  the uh russia has its own DARPA and in a couple statements its defense minister
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  has actually said you know something along the lines of out of DARPA is
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:19.560]  better than your DARPA there's a sinister menace
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.600]  idea that you know one day they're going to come out with
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:29.400]  their revolution and technology well i tell you america has been exceptional
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.280]  in many ways putin says you're not exceptional we've been exceptionally
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.040]  decadent exceptionally had other problems also a lot of exceptional
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.480]  things in a good way and uh there's no way to
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.560]  doubt that america's free market system coupled with
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.760]  uh corporate and government coordination has led the new renaissance
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.200]  but there's just such an attitude of status in people to not deploy that
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.480]  renaissance to the people and i think that's DARPA's
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.680]  biggest failure they did deploy the internet now they wish
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.480]  according to jay rockefeller and others they never would have
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.920]  so i guess maybe that's why they're scared is that they don't want to give
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.120]  promethean fire to the public
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.960]  well you know that's an interesting point you make and look at gps technology
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.760]  okay researching this book i was really surprised to learn
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.880]  that gps technology goes back to DARPA's first year in 1958 when they put
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.600]  satellites up so it was originally targeting
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.760]  technology i mean think about it of course it was
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.720]  artillery right yes it was like once laser guided bombs made an
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.480]  appearance in the end of the vietnam war now you could have this
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.560]  gps coordinates but you say how did it get into the public so
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.080]  the story goes like this you know um it's secret
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:44.840]  it was actually very easy to hack into believe it or not
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.080]  and so the military created a feature called selective availability and it
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.680]  was essentially an offset by several hundred feet
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:56.600]  so if somebody hacked into the military's gps system to drop a bomb in
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:59.960]  essence or target something they would be off by a couple hundred feet
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.960]  well during the clinton administration word came in
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.640]  that europe was going to develop you know sort of copy
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:11.240]  american military gps and make the system public
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:15.400]  and obviously have a huge industry around it and so clinton
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:21.720]  declassified DARPA's gps program got rid of the f a feature that offset feature
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.640]  and made it public and now the benefits of that are
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:30.280]  in you know the american system uh the monetary system look at google but they
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:34.200]  only do it when somebody else is going to innovate they have to that's why we
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.400]  need to keep national sovereignty and not have a global government
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:40.360]  i believe a global government will be the beginning of a new dark age because
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:45.160]  there'll be no incentive to innovate and of course that goes right along with
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:48.840]  my idea which is just educate the people i mean just know what is going on be
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.440]  alert and knowledgeable people often think that they
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:55.080]  you know well what is that what does that do i mean
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.680]  you and i both know from being in the business of information
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.080]  that you know what you look at what you read your eyeballs what you do
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.200]  all of that gets paid attention to and it all matters
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:13.000]  and it all has an an effect and i believe absolutely to my core
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.360]  that you know you talk about human augmentation well you can augment
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.720]  yourself just essentially by learning you really don't need a
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.320]  friendship exactly we become what we ingest what
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.160]  we look at and uh i know it keeps the public busy to have
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.720]  watched football all day but man these people are stupid
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:33.320]  and i mean i get folks like football i played football but that's not men i
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:37.720]  talked to that's all they talk about that it's just it's bizarre i didn't grow
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.080]  up around that and you know in hell my grandfather played you know
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.560]  football with with you know folks like uh tom landry at ut i'm not against
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.960]  football and i played football my dad played football
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.200]  mom you know it's just it's so weird where that's our culture when american
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.880]  culture really was about inventions trailblazing
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.560]  exploration and so i have a love hate relationship with DARPA because it seems
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.720]  so americana so good so innovative so wonderful
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.640]  but then it's got a dark side well you know
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.920]  don't get me wrong i interviewed 75 scientists and engineers uniquely
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.840]  affiliated with DARPA programs going back to the agency's beginning
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:23.880]  and almost the 100 majority raved about DARPA for this very
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.840]  american ideal of excellence that they say all these scientists say look DARPA
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.800]  gave me money let me give you an example there's a lim
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.640]  regeneration lab yes i said that correctly a lim
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.320]  regeneration lab here at uc uh irvine where scientists are working
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.520]  because they believe 25 30 years out humans
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:48.440]  will be able to regrow their limbs if they can do the research and stay there
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.160]  final segment riveting i want to come back with some of the
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.040]  incredible things they're looking at what they can be
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:58.920]  deploying just amazing what's the next big revolution stay with us

[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.960]  quantitative easing brought to us by the technocrats the federal reserve is
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:23.960]  going to do it's a rigged economy bring some final
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:26.760]  comments from my guests who i hope will come back as an expert on operation

[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:41.640]  briefly it's been sold out for months it is now back in stock but not for long
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:45.880]  that's not a sales tactic people love our products love our nutraceuticals
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:49.800]  they're game changers they're super high quality they have 4.8 reviews

[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.800]  power reviews and other big third-party respected sites
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.920]  because it's concentrated hardcore herbs in the case of liver shield that are
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:05.480]  known to have detoxifying effects you do it with the oxy powder and the apple
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.960]  cider vinegar and the olive oil on the sixth day
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:13.320]  with the epsom salts and well you've you've heard what callers have said we
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:16.760]  have informational videos about it i'm not going to go into details here
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:22.680]  infowarslife.com for me at least it was explosive
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.280]  and certainly made me feel a lot better have a lot more energy

[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:39.800]  you know before you do it but it's generally recognizes
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:44.440]  safe it's all FDA grass certified you know stuff that they say is safe herbs
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:47.960]  the point is together in conjunction it's it's not a game it's not a joke
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.880]  we don't sell stuff that's a placebo or a joke we sell stuff that's the real deal

[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:27.800]  other hour is coming up i meant to go to calls i meant to give the number out i
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:30.760]  just hogged the time with our guests and didn't so i apologize
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.360]  we'll open phones up with shift in the next hour with your economic comments
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:39.640]  or questions at 800-259-9231 well annie i'm impressed with
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:43.240]  your book that i've read so far just 30 pages or so i'm impressed with you
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.680]  want to read your other books we got about three minutes left in closing
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.720]  what are some of the other big advances that are coming out of DARPA i mean
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.680]  people talk about nasa and all these inventions isn't most of it DARPA
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.200]  most of it is DARPA i mean DARPA for example has a robot that
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:01.960]  that will go to mars it's called valkyrie and nasa
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.040]  designed it for DARPA challenge but um it's going to go to
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  mars and act like an avatar so it'll be controlled back here on earth
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:14.280]  but this valkyrie robot will be on mars ideally
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:18.040]  building a habitat which then the humans will go into
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.720]  so there's no doubt that DARPA is so future thinking DARPA likes to say DARPA
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:27.960]  makes the future happen but again people
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.040]  just will really benefit from having a handle
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:36.040]  on what that future may or may not look like because
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.760]  the one really spooky element of all of this that i came to was learning at the
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:45.240]  end of my book how you know defense contractors
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:50.920]  have become advisors to DARPA and that's a real problem because it
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:54.280]  you know it's what eisenhower warned against with the military industrial
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.880]  complex when you have a closed loop when the guys
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.600]  who are actually making money um building these robotic systems
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:07.000]  building these drones are the ones who are advising the pentagon
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  to create more drones create a system of robotic
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.800]  so they are controlling the future they're not just getting the money
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.360]  absolutely they are now controlling the evolution of human development

[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:34.440]  back in 1999 like 17 years ago we played new footage shot last month the marines
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:39.800]  released other than ramping up we're not saying a massive takeovers imminent
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.240]  it's an incremental frog in the pot and joe was telling me during the break
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.000]  about all the subtle threats he's getting past kernels he had calling up
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.440]  describe the heat you're getting on jade helm reportage
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:54.920]  i'm getting a lot of uh i would say not as much a negative i'm getting a lot of
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:58.360]  previous kernels are coming at me like why are you talking about this leave it
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:01.640]  alone stop stop you know you know we never did that
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:04.360]  you used to be a good soldier why are you talking about this you know and i'm
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.080]  like i think i'm still being a good soldier by
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.920]  questioning what's going on you know i maybe i wasn't able to question as much
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:13.640]  and then which is why i wasn't as highly liked
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:19.240]  because i never i wasn't a robot but i was born to question stuff i will
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:23.560]  continue to do that well the country's being dismantled in front of us
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.760]  i mean this is the thing though we've talked about we've talked about so many
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.640]  military exercises in the year that i've been here
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:35.080]  but not once do you get any kind of feedback hostile feedback from soldiers
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.800]  you know now you're getting all these people they're just jumping up and they
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:40.200]  seem like they just say the same thing all the time
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.040]  leave it alone why are you talking about it no just be a good soldier just leave
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.400]  it alone why why don't you say that when i talk
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.560]  about the dirty bomb exercise in california
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.840]  that was supposed to be a dirty bomb exercise but in fact what it was was
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:59.800]  you know rounding up a constitutionalist the sovereign citizens
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:02.840]  well that's the truth they've been given a traitorous mission
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.840]  they're scared they don't want to discuss it now the troops themselves we've
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:09.640]  talked to are upset and agree with us and like you want to go to see info but
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.080]  it's the officers that want to just go play golf
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:16.040]  they want to just get paid they want to get their little under the counter
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:19.480]  bonuses that everybody knows they get and
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.280]  listen guys we're going to lose the whole country
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.120]  this hit in 20 years ago that this is all coming to a head
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.920]  you better choose the right side well don't sign up with hitler
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.560]  okay it's not going to go well sorry go ahead a lot of the special forces guys
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.680]  that have reached out to me were i think more confused i think that they
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.840]  that we at info wars hate special operations guys and i had to talk to
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.920]  them like no it's not the operator that we have a problem with that's a total
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:50.280]  sigh op they don't even yeah but i mean it's it's the people at the top it's the
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:54.440]  ones who are making those plans it's the people to pentagon we don't
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:57.800]  really we don't have a problem with the everyday soldier i've had general
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:00.520]  stubble by who was the head of special forces on
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:04.840]  ten years ago five years ago three years ago saying this is all coming
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.400]  yeah i mean they were trying to get him involved in stuff like this 20 years ago
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.720]  they've been the globalists have been wanting to take over forever they're
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:14.280]  always trying we're here pointing out this mission
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.520]  takes us there and this is happening right when they're trying to go to
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.320]  driverless cars too they want to control our movement
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.680]  and they're doing these to put people into camps it looks like they're doing
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.640]  all these exercises they're testing all the control grids but but but let's be
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.240]  clear the public's awake folks are upset the majority of the troops we talk to
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.600]  agree with us but there is a minority of regular
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:36.680]  troops and then you've got the officers that are really engaging in a sigh op
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:39.880]  yeah and then you've got people like eric bowling again
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.120]  has this huge audience on fox and he's mocking us
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:47.640]  saying you know why are we talking about this this is all a conspiracy
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:50.680]  you know or not everything's a conspiracy leave it alone
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:55.080]  you guys are uh what a bunch of gullible nut bags or something like that he said
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:58.360]  so i i got on twitter this morning and i said hey
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.760]  i challenge you to come out here i was like you're starting to get really
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:04.600]  lippy you're starting to get jumpy why don't you have alex on your show
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:08.520]  are you afraid that you're gonna get a pierce morgan whooping
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.720]  i don't know if he's got the uh the tweet up or whatever but then he responded
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:14.440]  with i'll be i'll meet alex on the parking lot he's like meet me at the
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:20.280]  corner of like lex and something after recess or whatever
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:24.600]  but uh if these guys are scared i mean they want to pre-tape it they want to
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.200]  be able to go in and tell me to meet me at the corner of park and lex
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:31.240]  after school yeah so he's not gonna joke like we're little
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.480]  kids yeah now we're schooling him yeah he's
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:38.760]  scared he will not do it live because he knows he will get
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:42.280]  manhandling he didn't respond to say do it tape did he oh no he didn't say anything
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.160]  about that but look at this point i'll even do a tape
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.040]  because i'm gonna tape it and then i'm gonna show what they turned into yeah
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.320]  we take our own camera crew in there and show them what really happened yeah
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.760]  all right joe biggs we'll have more on this tonight we're gonna get into some
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:59.080]  victories we're having right now on gmo that they said was good
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:02.120]  all you pro vaccine people should rejoice at this news
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.880]  anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under australian
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:08.600]  no jab no pay law the new changes that will take
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.840]  effect on january 1st 2016 are projected to save the australian
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.800]  government over 500 million dollars over four years
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:19.080]  and how many children are not receiving their vaccines according to the
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.280]  australian childhood immunization register it's 1.77 percent i thought
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.120]  all you needed was 90 percent to have heard immunity the government believes
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.080]  that by removing the non-medical exemption it will reinforce the
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:33.640]  importance of immunization and protecting public health
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.600]  but what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.280]  your body that they want and they want to make sure you bend over and take it
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:43.960]  a footnote in the article is that by 2020 childless couples will overtake
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:47.000]  those with children now i know where the next muslim migrant

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:16.440]  coming up in the next hour hersey schmeiser
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:21.640]  the first farmer to prominently go up against
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.320]  monsanto and be victorious was first on with us when he started
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:31.880]  this fight 15 plus years ago he hasn't been on since
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:35.160]  knows on the nightly news once
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.880]  now monsanto has been derated from a good investment by major investment
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.760]  firms to a risky bad investment uh their profits are in trouble
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:49.720]  mcdonalds is in trouble they're both an allied operation
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:55.240]  this is franken food and they get up there and they lie
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:58.600]  and they say oh it's just like george washington carver
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:04.200]  crossing two tomatoes no because those tomatoes are closely enough related
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.480]  that they're able to breed together but just like if you get a
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:11.960]  donkey and a horse very similar to have sex
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:16.280]  they can procreate but they have a sterile offspring
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.840]  it's called a mule i'm not a geneticist but i know these basic things
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.760]  it's like a liger a tiger and a lion you can breed them
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.240]  the offspring a liger is sterile what happens when you breed two tomatoes
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:31.480]  together that are further enough apart that
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:35.080]  they're able to get together and share their different traits
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.520]  but they don't produce seeds or the seeds
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:44.200]  don't produce more fruit tomatoes a fruit for those who didn't know
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:48.840]  they've gone beyond that and created gmo where you'll have
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:53.960]  five 10 15 20 30 traits in it where it lasts longer it doesn't die
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.480]  bugs can't eat it if they do eat it they die because there's a natural
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.200]  pesticide produced then they argue well it's a natural pesticide yeah but you
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.560]  boosted a thousand times or more
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:09.240]  yeah the plant produces a pesticide or invites a fungus to grow on it that's
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:12.840]  poisonous but it's not at that level it's not
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:19.080]  inside the plant you wash it off didn't use to kill the honeybees

[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:45.240]  and that's since lawmakers have had to see it a few months ago the last two
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:50.120]  years while they've been writing this the corporate lawyers globally
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:55.240]  for this asia partnership congress can't see it
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.440]  i mean just think about that and it's the same thing who sits on these boards
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:04.760]  monsanto who sits on the imf advisory board who sits on the world
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.280]  trader organization board you guess that monsanto

[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.480]  and back when i would get jeffrey smith and
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.280]  hersey smizer and others on uh monsanto was suing people that criticized them
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.720]  them with slap suits they were and they still do but
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:28.280]  that intimidation didn't work folks that brought you age in orange

[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.640]  kill monkeys in lab tests i mean this isn't a joke monsanto
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:53.720]  is the most devilish company i could think of i mean they really are wicked
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:59.960]  uh and now the world is waking up every couple days a new country's banning
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.680]  the importation uh every new studies have come out linking it to cancer in
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:09.080]  humans the un has come out uh i mean humanity is
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.120]  awakening and by the way wasn't the of the didn't come from the top it was the
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.760]  un scientist so more and more just like
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.040]  fda scientist in 2000 and again a few years ago
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:24.440]  almost unanimously like 99 percent of them sent letters to their bosses saying

[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:32.920]  here's our studies here's our harvard studies it needs to be pulled out of the
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.600]  water it doesn't help the teeth you need a little bit of calcium fluoride this is
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.120]  hydrofluorosalic acid if you're gonna put it in there you
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.480]  need to put a little bit of calcium fluoride
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.720]  this is deadly poison they just reduced it by half in the water and have now
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:51.240]  banned it in all pesticides already banned worldwide
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.000]  we're having some devastating victories right now uh and this is very
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.440]  exciting and the man spearheading so much of this and we sell his books and
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.640]  his films jeffrey smith is international bestselling
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.960]  author award-winning filmmaker executive director of the institute for
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:06.600]  responsible technology and a leading spokesman on the
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.840]  health dangers of gmo's the most recognized consumer advocate promoting
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:14.920]  healthier non-gmo choices and he's the author of the
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.040]  documentary and the book genetic roulette he's the executive
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:20.600]  director of the institute for responsible technology
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:24.280]  non-gmo shopping guide dot com responsible technology dot com

[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:32.600]  dot com and support both of our operations jeffrey
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.600]  am i overstating and i mean we're overall winning the war we've been losing it
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:40.600]  horribly america's the dumping ground for everything we know that the test tube
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.560]  but if we were behind 50 points in a football game have we just come back
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:50.120]  37 points and we've got a quarter left and and are we just
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:53.960]  lobbing hail mary's and catching every one i mean it doesn't mean we won
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.600]  but are we not racing back to a global awakening i mean are we on the cusp of
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:03.320]  the new renaissance because because it was dark having you on 14 15 16 years
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.200]  ago that in persie schmeiser on 16 years ago when he first
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.200]  launched his operation uh now it seems like you know courts are coming out
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:14.200]  admitting monsanto planted their stuff on their crops monsanto's having things
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:17.880]  reversed i wonder about how they're striking back part
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.880]  two of this interview but but but am i accurate with you at the center of this
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:26.920]  who testifies to you know major uh political bodies worldwide
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.840]  where are we right now in the global fight to
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.200]  not have poisoned food well we're definitely winning
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:40.600]  alex and the chief victory is among consumers uh as you know in 1999
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.840]  consumer concern on gmo's caused a tipping point of consumer
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:47.720]  rejection and it was this very specific moment in time
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.800]  when the food companies realized that using gmo's was going to cost the money
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.680]  that moment in time was April 27th when unilever said no more gmo's
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:01.720]  in its european brands the next day nesli's said no more gmo's in its european
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.960]  brands the next week next week or two
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:08.040]  everyone else followed that tipping point of consumer rejection
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.600]  occurred in the natural products industry in united states in 2013
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:16.520]  when whole foods announced that when a product becomes third party verified
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.680]  as non-gmo it increases sales by 15 to 30 percent
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.440]  immediately thousands of products were enrolled in verification
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.680]  there's more than over 30 000 non-gmo verified products in the united states
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.160]  that tipped the natural products industry now we see products like cheerios
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:36.840]  and grape nuts and ben and jerry's and target home brands and soon
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.680]  hershey's all declaring non-gmo on their package
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:43.400]  as soon as they start increasing in market share
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:46.840]  in the united states the rest of the food industry will realize
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.000]  i can't wait till my chief competitor goes non-gmo before me
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.560]  or i'll start losing customers so we're looking for a tipping point of consumer
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.320]  rejection in the united states this year or at the very
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:02.600]  latest next year and we think there'll be a clean out of gmo's
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:05.480]  and direct ingredients over the next three years
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:09.800]  and for animal products over the next five and monsanto is caving in all over
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.400]  the world and pulling its push in europe for gmo's
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.920]  if i mean i liken this to hitler's collapse on the eastern front
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.280]  launching a counter offensive on the western front at the battle of the
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:23.080]  bulge i think that's the point we're at
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.680]  if we beat them at the battle of the bulge in the next couple years
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:31.880]  i believe we're seeing a collapsed level event of these operators
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:35.480]  not only that but we just got incredible ammunition from the world health
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:38.840]  organization last month that declared monsanto's
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:43.400]  roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate as a probable carcinogen
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:49.080]  since then 30 000 argentine medical doctors have petitioned their government
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:52.840]  to ban it the federal prosecutor in brazil has said
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.440]  that their government should ban it the president of columbia said they're no
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.200]  longer going to use it to spray on the cocoa fields to eradicate
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:03.800]  that trade it was banned in richmond in california
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:08.360]  and it continues to be a subject pardon bermuda just banned it
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:11.640]  bermuda so what's happening now is all over the world
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:15.720]  they're realizing that monsanto actually has known about these health dangers
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.240]  for decades in fact an epa document became available
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.240]  showing that there was concerns about cancer back in the late 1980s
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:26.120]  similarly there was evidence showing birth defects
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:30.200]  back in the 1980s it had been covered up by monsanto and regulators
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.880]  and it turns out in argentina the peasants that are sprayed
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.120]  with this roundup or glyphosate have much higher levels
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.880]  of birth defects 400 increase region-wide
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.760]  70 times in one hospital and an increase in cancer of 300 percent
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:51.400]  in one area and higher in other regions we also saw in china when they started
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.280]  introducing genetically engineered roundup ready
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.520]  soybeans for their soybean oil it was reported that
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:01.800]  cancer and heart disease and other problems skyrocketed
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.480]  i was there giving a presentation in beijing last year
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:08.760]  a general who was in the audience had earlier reported
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:12.680]  that he warned the government and warned the people that this new genetically
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:16.600]  modified roundup ready soybean oil was linked to all of these
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.520]  increase in diseases and the army of china
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:24.280]  thereafter refused to serve its own soldiers gmo's
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.680]  even though the government still allows the rest of the population to eat it
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:33.000]  in fact that came out in the news that the chinese elite are obsessed with non gmo
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.520]  and were found to have secret government-funded gardens
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:40.040]  it turns out that bush the past bush administration
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:43.880]  absolutely insisted that their kitchen be organic
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.360]  and evidently obama has followed through so it turns out that
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:52.200]  those that know the situation don't want to risk themselves in fact a former
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:55.480]  monsanto scientist told me that three of his colleagues
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:58.520]  were doing the safety stay there this is amazing i want to hear it when we come

[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.680]  ladies and gentlemen i get so excited about voting with our dollars voting
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:22.840]  with our euros voting with our yens our yon our rubles our shekels
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.040]  that's why they want to get rid of cash it's why they want to force you into
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:30.120]  big box stores it's why they want to make you only shop
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.360]  with the big mega corporations because they have a plan for a global monopoly
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.560]  monsanto and other big gmo companies have admitted they want to make
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:42.440]  everything gmo from trees to grass and patented
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:46.200]  now they're coming out and saying you know that words are going to be copyright
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.120]  where you supposedly can't use them in language
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:53.400]  they're now saying you can't work on your own car
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.760]  in fact this morning i was talking to a lady
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:01.320]  and she was telling me about her currig coffee maker
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.920]  and how she her one that she had for two years broke so she bought a new one and
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:09.000]  i said yeah i have one of those but i said mine's old she said well you put
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.720]  the new little canister in there it's not one of their coffees it won't work
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:17.320]  it's got a RFID chip in it she was a listener
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.920]  and she was telling me how she heard about that years ago and oh yeah
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:25.880]  and so you have to go in and basically put tape over it or cut the chip off
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:29.400]  so that her other in this case she said organic coffee we were having an
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:33.320]  organic discussion at the gym would go in there
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:37.320]  so see that's the type of monopoly they're trying to create and i'm kind of
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:40.920]  diverting often into another subject but it all connects we were talking
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:44.120]  about Volkswagen you buy a Volkswagen two years
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:47.160]  later your battery doesn't work you you go get a third-party battery same
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:50.600]  battery works great they remotely from the factory
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.480]  turn it off you have to go in and pay a hundred fifty dollar service charge to
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:59.720]  have them certify it as theirs now that's where all this is going
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:02.760]  and with this genetically engineered food that's where it's going this is a
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:05.480]  short segment mr. Smith long segment coming up you were going
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:09.240]  into victories right now i'm glad to hear from you the expert that that i'm
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:12.840]  not over estimating how exciting this is let me shift gears i'm gonna go back
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.960]  into good news and for the rest of the fight is the next segment in this
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:19.080]  short segment as we talked to jeffrey smith
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.240]  responsible technology dot com probably the leading spokesperson fighting the
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:26.920]  stuff on the gmo there's more cola and others
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:30.840]  but they cover you know the whole spectrum let me ask you this question
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:34.920]  how is the empire going to strike back what's what's going to be their battle
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:39.000]  the bulge counter-offensive what are they doing
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.720]  well they're spending millions of dollars now
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:45.640]  promoting the quote benefits of gmo's through media
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:49.960]  and also trying to discredit those of us like me and vodna sheev and others
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.160]  claiming that we are anti-science and uncredible
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.760]  so they're actually cornered against the wall and in discussions with my
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:00.040]  colleagues around the world it's clear that they're doing a full
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.320]  court press i'm here in ecuador where the country
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:08.360]  actually has a constitutional amendment saying that no gmo's are allowed
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:11.400]  if you look at wiki leaks the united states government
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.800]  had a plan to undermine the constitution here and get them to overturn it
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:19.880]  so they actually paid for bringing reporters from ecuador to the united
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:23.080]  states so that monsanto can train them how to
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:27.240]  report on gmo's and sure enough they started giving monsanto's
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.160]  false talking points in the press here in ecuador then they surrounded the
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.400]  president who does have the ability to overturn the constitutional
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.720]  prohibition and he came out saying that gmo's could increase yields by 400
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:42.520]  percent and he's now against the constitutional
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.600]  provision it turns out gmo's actually do not increase yields at all in fact
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:49.560]  many times decrease yields but agroecology
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.000]  which was recommended by the world's experts that increases yields which he's
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.360]  ignoring so they're focusing on the four targeted areas
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:02.200]  politicians media the general public and farmers and trying to use as much
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:05.960]  evidence as they can which is false to try and convince them that this is
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:09.400]  absolutely necessary to feed the world to save economies
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:12.760]  to prevent the use of agricultural chemicals all of which has been sure
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:17.160]  but the effects of it are so deadly we're 30 years into this nightmare
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:21.320]  that no amount of bs is ever going to paper over the prima facie
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.360]  reality well i'll talk about it in the next segment
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:28.680]  about the specific diseases that we now know are probably linked to gmo's i'll
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:31.400]  say probably but i'm very confident as thousands of
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:34.840]  physicians in the united states who are prescribing non-gmo diets
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:38.280]  they are very confident that these particular diseases are linked
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:42.040]  and why it's so important now not to not to just buy non-gmo
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:46.120]  but to buy organic because monsanto's glyphosate or roundup
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.800]  is sprayed on wheat barley lentil sweet potatoes potatoes
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.040]  sugarcane over a hundred different crops are now authorized to have high levels
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.320]  of glyphosate residue and it's sprayed just before harvest
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:01.640]  as a ripening agent briefly described in one minute what why glyphosate
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.320]  i mean they admit it grows breast cancer why is it so deadly
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:08.200]  well i can do it in one minute but we should spend a little more time
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.240]  it's it's noted it's definitely a probable cause to the gender card the
[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:13.880]  world health organization it's linked to birth defects
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:17.720]  it's an antibiotic that kills the beneficial gut bacteria it causes an
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.160]  overgrowth of negative gut bacteria it blocks the gut bacteria's ability to
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:24.600]  produce tryptophan which is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.760]  so it can affect mood behavior sleep blood sugar chemistry
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:33.480]  as well as obesity it also is linked to an endocrine disruptor
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.720]  it also blocks the liver's ability to detoxify stay there only to recap all
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:41.640]  that when we come back and i'm sure it's all an accident that these eugenicists
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:45.320]  that gave us all this other bad stuff at monsanto came up with this i'm sure it's
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:49.560]  all an accident we'll be right back we're on the march
[02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:58.920]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:04.600]  the dc police chief urges citizens to fight back against peristyle attackers

[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.840]  leneer urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:16.840]  in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting whether it means run
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:20.920]  hide or fight if you're in a position to try to take the gunman out
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:25.160]  it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there leneer said
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.080]  while acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous
[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:32.760]  tactics the police have advised leneer claimed that taking action
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:36.360]  may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in paris
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:41.320]  which left over 120 people dead we always tell people don't take action

[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:57.320]  so it's a bifurcated upper and lower house system
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.840]  and and and that is not my opinion that is the real
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:04.840]  political system of the globalist i first read about it
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:08.440]  in none dare call a conspiracy published in 1972
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:12.280]  two years before i was born and then i read none dare
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.480]  ever read none dare call a conspiracy by gary allen whose son
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:20.760]  runs and founded politico today uh the lake great gary allen i went and i read
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:23.400]  the books they recommended that they were quoting from
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.200]  tragedy and hope uh the angle american establishment both by carol
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:33.160]  quickly um other books like the
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:38.440]  technotronic era by zebigny brzezinski and others and you read those and they
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:41.800]  explain everything from their perspective
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.160]  so you need to understand uh this is about fighting a global monopoly we're
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:48.920]  going back to our guests i'm going to give the floor
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:51.880]  right through this long segments you can really break down what we know
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.920]  glibisthenes doing he's a major target so he puts provisos in there
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:02.760]  that's a whole other story here because monsanto went after farmers
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:07.080]  researchers scientists persecuted people i've had top genetic engineers on the
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:10.440]  show that were making millions a year who even own percentages i've had a
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:14.360]  bunch of them on uh in new potatoes that were coming out in new
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:17.400]  corn and they would say hey this is sterilizing the rats so this is killing
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:22.200]  the guinea pigs and they'd say shut up or you're fired
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:27.160]  so there's been a war a long history of persecution that i hope
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.040]  our guests can talk about maybe the next segment before he leaves us and before
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:34.520]  person smizer a true hero joins us because they've gone through hell
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.520]  to bring us to where we're now here kind of like they
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.400]  i think manipulated the vote in california and other states to not let gmo
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:45.480]  labeling happen but the fight educated everybody so even blew up
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:48.840]  bigger see george washington lost
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:53.000]  almost all the first battles for the first five years of the war
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.200]  then began to win the battles the last year and a half
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:01.000]  but every time they lost a battle they still
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.040]  escape with enough of a force to reconstitute to wear out the juggernaut
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:10.680]  so it's perseverance ladies and gentlemen that wins that's why if i get
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:13.880]  destroyed i get set up i get you know brought down
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:17.320]  believe me i get plenty of threats we're in the zeitgeist we're not touching it
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:22.200]  we're in it that matter because i know the war
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:26.200]  will be won and it's not some heroic reason i'm
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:29.160]  doing that it's self-preservation for the species
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:33.880]  i really do i'm an individual but when you become a real individual you then
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:37.560]  understand the collective they try to bring a collective that you submit to
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.520]  and give up your individualism no we as individuals gravitate to what
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.280]  what's the core of the human spirit the human drive and then we
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:48.600]  collectively radiate those ideas and actions and then build
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:55.400]  a harmonistic collective but the collective comes out of the individual
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:59.320]  not out of the collective and that's my own philosophy and own ideas but i know
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:02.680]  it's true and so i am the planet i am the people
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:06.520]  you are the people we are we are this species
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:11.080]  and and we have to decide that we care about everybody but that doesn't mean
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:15.800]  than being told oh do this to show your moral you've got to go do research to
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:18.600]  really follow the right path to really help people
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:21.960]  you can't just give away your free will to the false corporate collective
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:26.840]  that it tells you is moral i'm ranting now briefly we're running
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:30.600]  two specials right now powerful concentrated herbs

[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.480]  jeffrey smith at the tip of the spear so so so get into what it's doing to us
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:12.840]  where the rest of the fight's going and and and then
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:17.400]  people need to realize those that have gone through hell
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.360]  to stand up and tell the truth and thank god it's not in vain because we can
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.400]  save millions of lives if we uh go ahead and finally
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:28.680]  discredit this deadly chemical go ahead to jeffrey smith great
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.440]  thank you i'll talk about roundup i also want to talk about the new apple and
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.240]  potato before we break with a new technology
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:37.880]  that may be far worse than anything we've seen
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:41.800]  now roundup or glyphosate its active ingredient was originally
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:47.160]  patented as a descaler to clean industrial boilers and pipes
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.560]  that's because it chelates or grabs minerals all sorts of minerals
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:56.520]  all the metallic minerals zinc uh chromium magnesium manganese
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:00.680]  calcium all of those now when they discarded
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.360]  the uh glyphosate on the ground it killed the plants
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:09.080]  and so monsanto patented it as an herbicide now it turns out
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:13.640]  that it can deplete the minerals in the crops
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:17.480]  and the animals in the united states eat mostly roundup ready crops
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:20.760]  so the animals in the united states the livestock
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:24.600]  have a universal deficiency of certain minerals like manganese
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:28.760]  according to the veterinarians that send in organs for evaluation
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:31.880]  so we're eating weak and sick mineral deficient plants
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.960]  weak and sick mineral deficient animals and residues of roundup that further
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:39.320]  chelate or bind with our minerals making them unavailable
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:42.360]  mineral depletion is linked to a whole host of diseases
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:47.240]  now because it blocks certain minerals it's also an antibiotic
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.640]  but it's selective it kills the beneficial gut bacteria the lactobacillus
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.200]  the bifidus the stuff we pay for but not the negative stuff like botulism
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:59.560]  and salmonella and E. coli which can cause an overgrowth of the
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:03.480]  negative gut bacteria this alone can create holes on the intestinal
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:07.560]  walls called permeable gut or leaky gut and that's linked to cancer
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.400]  Parkinson's alzheimer's autism uh food allergies
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:14.440]  inflammation and autoimmune disease to name a few
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:17.960]  now some of our gut bacteria is used to produce
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:21.800]  what's called aromatic amino acids including tryptophan
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.080]  which is necessary for the production of serotonin
[02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:28.680]  serotonin is a good thing if we don't have enough serotonin
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:33.320]  we may not be happy we may be depressed sad etc it also regulates our blood
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:36.680]  sugar it also regulates our ability to say i'm full i can stop
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.880]  eating so if we have a deficiency of serotonin
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.720]  because roundup is blocking the production of tryptophan
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.320]  that could cause a whole effect in terms of mood behavior and health
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.080]  it also affects the melatonin which relates to sleep
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.360]  in addition it blocks another pathway in our liver
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:58.840]  that helps detox so that means all of the other poisons that we're exposed to
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:02.680]  may become amplified because the ability to detox through the liver
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:05.960]  is hampered it also is an endocrine disruption
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.800]  at very very tiny levels at parts per trillion
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.880]  at parts of the amount of glyphosate that's currently in our water supply
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.880]  now it can change the balance of estrogen and testosterone
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.640]  rats that were fed roundup in the water supply
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:24.840]  which was less than the amount allowed in the united states
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.680]  the females had more testosterone and lower estrogen
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:32.280]  the males had more estrogen and lower testosterone
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:36.200]  and it could also affect the aroma taste and what do we see here we see
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.880]  and it's just a fact they admit this but more butch women
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:43.720]  bigger women and i'm not attacking what's been done to them with the chemicals
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:47.640]  it's just a fact and more effeminate men lower sperm counts lower
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:52.120]  testosterone uh metrosexual activity and again the
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:54.440]  media always spends this like i'm bashing people for their sexual
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:56.760]  preference we don't even get into that folks it's a
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.440]  fact that in mammals but also in the runoff from fish
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.440]  you name it that this stuff's happening you look at prozac runoff
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:07.320]  uh and it's causing the fish to commit suicide
[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:12.440]  literally swimming up to birds not afraid uh it's causing risky behavior i
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:15.160]  mean we are just bathed in this garbage i know i'm
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.400]  digressing off into other chemicals but uh we know this is happening
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:22.680]  in addition to causing endocrine disruption
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.480]  it also can affect the ability of the sperm to to move because manganese which
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.200]  is chelated by glyphosate is needed for sperm mobility in fact
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:36.280]  when they fed genetically modified soy to female rats starting two weeks
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:39.240]  before they got pregnant more than half of their babies
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:42.680]  died within three weeks compared to 10 of controls
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.520]  for hamsters that were fed roundup ready soy which is sprayed with roundup
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:50.200]  by the third generation most were sterile some had hair growing in their
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:53.000]  mouths and they died at four or five times the rate
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.840]  now birth defects are also linked to glyphosate big time
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:01.240]  both in animals and in the human population in places like Argentina
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.240]  where they spray or spray a lot of that roundup also damages the
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:09.400]  mitochondria which means that we may get tired and there's a lot of diseases
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:14.280]  that can link to that it also is as we say a promoter of tumors and you saw on
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:18.680]  the screen just now some very very large tumors of rats this
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.240]  was a study done by serolini and others in europe where they fed
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:27.720]  roundup ready corn to rats for two years now
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:31.240]  the rats ended up dying at higher rates and earlier
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:34.280]  they had damage to their liver kidneys and pituitary
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.600]  and they also had multiple massive tumors now they didn't know whether it
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:42.280]  was the roundup or the GMO that caused the problem
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.680]  so as part of the study they fed roundup ready corn that had not been sprayed
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:50.120]  with roundup and that group had multiple massive tumors
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:53.880]  early death and organ damage and to another group they fed the roundup
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:58.440]  without the corn and that group also had multiple massive tumors
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.120]  early death and organ damage so the roundup was worse than the GMO
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:05.560]  well actually no both they both contain the same
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:08.760]  outcome early death organ damage and multiple
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:12.360]  tumors it's hard to know but we've tracked
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:18.680]  in the epidemiological trends what is related to the increase of GMOs or
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:22.040]  what's related to increase of roundup the list of diseases is
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.320]  astonishing that's from stroke that's from senile
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:28.840]  dementia that's from obesity that's from high blood pressure
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:32.200]  death's from intensity by the way we see all that going up i mean every week i hear
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.400]  about some 25 year old woman or 30 year old guy
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:40.680]  who just dies of a stroke it's just crazy and i talk to thousands of people
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.360]  who say when they get off of GMOs they get better from a lot of these same
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:47.400]  diseases and disorders in fact thousands of doctors
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.400]  are prescribing to people to stop eating GMOs i speak at those medical
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:54.440]  conferences and they tell me people are getting from these
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:57.880]  getting better from these same diseases and disorders the same ones that
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:01.800]  afflict the lab animals that are fed GMOs and the same ones that
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.560]  the farmers and veterinarians tell us their livestock gets better from
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.000]  when they start feeding them non-gmo corn and soy
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:12.040]  and so it turns out there's a correlation between
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.560]  the what's afflicting the lab animals what people are reporting getting better
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.240]  from the livestock getting better from pets are getting better from
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:22.360]  and those things that are on the rise in the u.s population
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:26.760]  now there was a mysterious kidney disease killing up to 25 percent of the
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:30.120]  labor force in central america among farmers working in
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.960]  sugarcane plantations they spray the sugarcane
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:37.800]  with glyphosate just before ripening i've seen the documentaries where you
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:40.920]  chose a sad little family and half of them are dying
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:44.760]  and then you go to the next village and the same deal it's just incredible
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.200]  now there was a study that showed that roundup we talked about how it chelates
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.600]  it binds with certain minerals it binds with arsenic
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:56.520]  and can smuggle that arsenic into the body where it gets into the
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:00.120]  kidneys then the situation the kidneys allows it to
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:03.080]  un-chelate so now you have two toxins in the kidneys
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:06.760]  you have glyphosate and you have arsenic and this is the theory of this
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:09.880]  mysterious kidney disease that's effect deflecting
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.480]  farm workers both in central america and in Sri Lanka they believe it's a
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:17.080]  combination of of glyphosate and arsenic sure what about the
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:20.280]  massive sicknesses in india associated with it
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:24.120]  oh yeah so there's all these people who touch the cotton plants
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:27.480]  either while they're harvesting or while they're cleaning it and get rashes
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:30.760]  all over their bodies they allow animals to graze on the cotton
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:34.360]  plants after harvest and thousands have died i visited one
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:37.240]  village where their buffalo 13 of them all of them died
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:41.080]  after eating the corn the cotton plants after a single day
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:45.240]  these same buffalo had survived eight years eating natural cotton plants
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.320]  after harvest so that's a bio accumulation yeah well bio accumulation
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:53.080]  is interesting because monsanto said that glyphosate is water soluble and
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:57.240]  can just go out of the body but it turns out the glyphosate amount in the breast
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.080]  milk in humans is so high it demonstrates that it
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:04.840]  does bio accumulate which means it's probably in higher levels of our milk
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:09.160]  and probably higher levels of our meat so it's also found in rain samples and
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:13.080]  air samples in 60 to 100 percent in the midwest where it's
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:17.000]  sprayed a lot it's found in our water samples and it's found in our urine
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.520]  in fact the amount is increased so much because the herbicide
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.360]  is now being resisted by weeds there was an increase in herbicides because of
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:27.560]  GMO sure it's a nightmare 16 years by 520
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:30.360]  you said it kills the soil they won't even work after a while that's why the
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:33.480]  farmer's income is suicide in india we're going to break i want to come back
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:36.280]  and then let you hit other key areas for this segment one other and then
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:39.080]  hersey spiser joins us at five after but let me ask you this
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.000]  in the next minute and a half if they knew about this in the eighties and i
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.040]  know about those studies and in their own internal concerns why would they
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:48.680]  approve this and roll it out i mean are these people
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:53.560]  directly like in like a hellraiser like some type of demons i mean
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:59.000]  what's their problem well we know from the FDA memos made public from a lawsuit
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.920]  that GMOs in general were described by FDA scientists as dangerous
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:06.280]  they said allergens toxins new diseases and nutritional problems
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:09.960]  may be created and we need to test them carefully but the white house had told
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:14.280]  the FDA to promote biotechnology because it was going to increase us exports
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.280]  and domination of world food trade so the FDA brought in Michael Taylor
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.280]  monsanto's former attorney later in vice president and then later back at the
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:26.840]  FDA as the u.s food safeties are to be in charge of the f of the GMO policy
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:31.240]  his policy ignored the scientists warnings claim the GMOs have no difference
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:34.920]  therefore no safety studies were needed and now the world is rejecting our food
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:38.600]  and it's doing the opposite thing exactly so it's a political influence over
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.520]  the scientific process almost every time and there's a new one a new example of
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:45.400]  like this i like to bring up after the break we'll do that and then i want to
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:48.920]  hear about some of the victims of monsanto folks you need to remember
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:55.080]  the true veterans of this war uh by the way folks this is so sick i i don't know
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:59.560]  what to say at this point it's just thank god people are waking up
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:03.400]  this is dan pillard you owe the irs money you can't pay our tax debts crippling
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:06.600]  you i've defended people from the irs for over 30 years

[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:13.480]  and i'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case

[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:40.120]  look at these headlines EU passes controversial GMO food law
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:44.280]  EU agrees to opt out deal for GMO imports
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.640]  monsanto secretly gave money to farmer caught contaminating organic
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:53.400]  farms with GMOs record US farmer switching to non GMO crops
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:58.360]  in 2015 hundreds of farmers block roads and protests among santo GMO crops
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:02.760]  thousands of polish farmers and GMOs land rights protests
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:06.200]  booming organics US farmers forced to import organic crops
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:10.360]  to meet non GMO demand that's what's in this TPP coming up
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:15.400]  is more forced deals to accept all this but then they won't let us label
[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:20.120]  and just make our own choice they're totalitarian
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:24.760]  now ladies and gentlemen i want to go back to our guests
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:29.160]  Jeffrey Smith responsible technology.org you can find his books his films
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:32.840]  there also in for store.com he's been with us for another five minutes the
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  next hour the Percy Smeiser joins us we're really focusing in on this today
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:39.640]  i've got some other geopolitical news i'm going to get to i haven't yet i said i
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:43.800]  would just so much of it it's on info wars.com and prisonbunna.com
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:47.480]  you wanted to get into one other issue before you got into
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.480]  the persecution that's that these groups just not just Monsanto it's a whole
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:54.440]  combine of these organizations but i'd say they're the biggest head on the
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:57.240]  hydra or i guess kind of the main head of
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:55:59.880]  Medusa but there's a lot of snakes up in her hair
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:04.920]  maybe that's the best analogy please continue sure by the way i'm in Ecuador
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:07.320]  today because there's one of your listeners
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:10.920]  heard our interview earlier on started studying my work and invited me
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:14.600]  to come and speak in Ecuador so thank you for that oh thank you brother
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.280]  i was on the daily show recently and they did a terrible job
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:23.160]  in their coverage of the new genetically engineered non-browning potato and apple
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.440]  i wrote a very long article on my website responsible technology.org
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.120]  as to why this new technology may be far more dangerous
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:36.600]  than any of the other type of GMOs produced it uses something called double
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:43.160]  stranded RNA now the code on the RNA little piece of RNA matches up with the
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:47.480]  code of the DNA and silences the gene
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:53.160]  so it silences the gene that produces the browning for the apple and the potato
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:57.000]  but it turns out that if we eat the apple and potato
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.680]  this double-stranded RNA code may match up with
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:07.240]  our gene code and silence or change our gene expression now as an example
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:10.920]  they fed some double-stranded RNA to honeybeats
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:15.480]  and it was supposed to have no effect it was supposed to be the control group
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:22.280]  it turns out it changed 1461 genes levels of expression that means
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.040]  10 percent of the entire genome of the honeybeats
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:29.320]  were affected when they were fed one single meal
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:34.280]  this is pure badness. Post on the RNA is what viruses are made of
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.440]  and when you then bring RNA into a plant or a human
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:41.160]  that's designed like this it's beyond a virus
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:45.240]  it's a turn off or turn on switch it just sounds like something
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.160]  that would give you cancer to me. Well it certainly could make changes
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:52.280]  that could possibly cause cancer but we don't know
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:56.040]  now the USDA's own scientists said we don't have
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:00.280]  an assessment available to protect the public and environment
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:04.120]  from this double-stranded RNA we need to completely revamp
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:08.600]  our risk assessment. Two years later without revamping the risk assessment
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:13.160]  the USDA went ahead and approved double-stranded RNA
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:17.800]  in food now their excuse their excuse as well as the excuse
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:21.880]  from regulators around the world is based on science that's 10 years old.
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:25.160]  Well think how insane this is though it turns brown to let you know it's not
[02:58:25.160 --> 02:58:28.120]  as fresh this is normal it's like a vampire
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:31.400]  injection so you don't need to have any oxygen but you still are alive
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:35.240]  I mean this is just this is insane I mean there's still
[02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:38.840]  these apples can last 18 days without turning brown
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:42.440]  the potatoes won't turn brown at all they'll just dry up and disappear
[02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:45.240]  and we don't know we're eating right. Stay there stay there sir we got a con
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:48.840]  gotta get up this is insane this gets worse by the

[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.840]  minutes we have dr group i want to shift yours out of the latest product years

[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:16.760]  worse life dot com living defense harmful organism cleansing dietary
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:22.600]  supplement 120 big capsules so so what is the best way to take this
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:26.680]  how should you take this but the best way is three capsules
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:31.720]  two times daily two to three capsules two times daily for six weeks
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:37.400]  that seems to be the best getting for us to get the best results with that i will
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:41.960]  say that um some people may experience a healing
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:45.720]  crisis to you whenever you start eliminating some of these harmful
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:49.400]  organisms or they start breaking open you you can
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:53.800]  have these dead organisms inside your body and they can start to decay or be
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:57.160]  in there for a little while until your immune system can flush them out
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:01.400]  so it's really good to drink a lot of extra water exercise get your blood
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.000]  moving and push all those out i also recommend that people do
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.120]  intestinal cleansing on a regular basis liver and gallbladder cleansing
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:15.000]  but all in all it's a it's results driven i mean we all have to understand
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.880]  that we live in a world where we're exposed to parasites
[03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:21.560]  all the time i'm almost scared to do it we have
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:24.920]  but but it's not that bad trust me i mean the liver cleanse is probably the
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:28.600]  hardest out of all the cleanses and it's easy for me it was easy for me
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:33.240]  yeah 99 percent of the people when they do a harmful organism cleanse
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:36.520]  maybe for the first few days they might be a little lethargic
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:41.160]  but after that they're able to slowly eliminate and their body starts
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:44.040]  their immune system starts to be built back up
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:48.360]  and they naturally get rid of these things why are you racist against
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:53.880]  penworms hookworms tapeworms amoebas and other things why were you raised to
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:58.200]  bigot you should accept it well the thing is there are
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:01.720]  good organisms too that live in our bodies and that's
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:05.640]  you know it's the it's always the fight against good and bad right so you want
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:09.400]  to have the as many good organisms in your body what are some of the good
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:13.000]  things all your probiotics your biodome inside your
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.640]  intestinal lining those are going to be all
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:18.840]  that's your first exposure point like we've talked about that's the extremist
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:21.400]  that has to be dealt with right that's the terrorist you mean
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:24.600]  yeah what we want to do is we want to have the good
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:29.240]  heart organisms in our body fighting against the bad organisms in our body
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:33.640]  it's like it's weird we have the same scenario in our lives but we also
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:36.680]  look at the environment look at a forest look at a desert it's all got that
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.920]  balance of stuff going on in it doctor group global healing center

[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:56.760]  when i think about how sensational this is if we expose this it could really
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:05:00.520]  damage the globalist global warming advocates are now
[03:05:00.520 --> 03:05:04.040]  blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change
[03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:08.200]  despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern u.s.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:11.960]  the climate words for all coalition released a report claiming that luxury
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:15.400]  apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in new york
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:18.040]  city these are new york city's largest buildings
[03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:22.200]  over 50 000 square feet in size which primarily consists of a mixture of
[03:05:22.200 --> 03:05:26.200]  luxury apartments commercial buildings and multi-family housing developments
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:29.720]  the report stated the report was released just as new york was
[03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:33.880]  being pounded by heavy snowstorms global warming advocates however
[03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:37.640]  will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change
[03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:40.920]  even though a few years ago they were predicting that the earth's
[03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:45.000]  ice caps would have dramatically melted by now but they really want you to live
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:48.200]  in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood

[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:14.200]  and the gcn radio network
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:18.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in this fourth
[03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:21.880]  hour and we have a big fourth hour coming up
[03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:25.640]  in the next segment we're going to be joined by documentary filmmaker mark
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:29.880]  hall he's done a film called killing ed i don't think it's been released yet
[03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:33.000]  we'll talk to him about the details of when and where it's going to be
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.800]  released but the key thing about this is this is a
[03:08:35.800 --> 03:08:39.240]  documentary about our schools what's going on in the schools a lot of people
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:42.280]  don't like what's happening with charter schools i
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:46.280]  want to see educational choice but i'm concerned when i see
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:50.120]  crony capitalism the problem i see with charter schools
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:55.160]  is that the the power the money is still being removed from the local community
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:58.120]  at a very high level that invites corruption but it also invites
[03:08:58.120 --> 03:09:02.120]  something else in this case which you really need to pay attention to
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:06.280]  this is a story and that really shows the worst case his film shows the worst
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:10.840]  case of what can happen with charter schools and i think the fatala gulen
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:14.920]  schools essentially controlled and run by an
[03:09:14.920 --> 03:09:21.720]  exiled islamic imam from turkey he proposed a transnational
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:25.800]  caliphate he called it an islamic state of being run out of turkey he was
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:29.960]  thrown out of turkey back in 1999 so that's how long the islamic state i at
[03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:34.200]  s has been around okay but of course he's not
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:39.720]  creating moderate rebels inside these countries that are already at war no
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:43.960]  the real thing we need to be concerned about is the education of our children
[03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:47.240]  and in other countries these schools that are run by the
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:51.560]  gulen movement are explicitly islamic
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:55.080]  they're religious schools and there's a lot of questionable things about these
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:09:58.760]  schools we're going to talk about that when he joins us in the next break i
[03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:02.040]  want to tell you about what we're going to do tonight with the
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:05.400]  live debate coverage our political science 3000 debate coverage is going to
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:09.480]  resume tonight with our celebrity big brother debate being held i think this
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:12.920]  one is in wisconsin the key thing is it's going to be fox news
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:16.360]  business that's going to be doing this it's going to be neil cavuto
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:19.560]  and another moderator asking them questions they say this is going to be
[03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:21.400]  different this one is really going to be
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:25.080]  about issues but of course it's going to be about jobs taxes the economy foreign
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:28.920]  policy the same stuff they always talk about you know will they talk about the
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:32.760]  militarized police state will they talk about the surveillance state
[03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:36.440]  will they talk about the war on our people that they call prohibition
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:40.840]  they actually do call it a war they call it the war on drugs actually it's a war
[03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:44.840]  of drugs against the american people we're going to talk about
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:47.960]  the candidates responses to that before we do real quickly i just want to let
[03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:51.800]  you know that we have a new product you just heard alex jones talking to
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:56.600]  dr group about this living defense by info wars statistics are clear nine out
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:10:59.640]  of ten people are infested with harmful organisms these toxic
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:02.920]  organisms can be transmitted by people by pets by food the
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:06.440]  environment so many other sources once they've made it into your body
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:10.680]  they steal your nutrients they release toxic waste so this is one way
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:13.800]  to get rid of toxic parasites it's a new product
[03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:17.640]  living defense we invited at info wars life dot com
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:20.840]  today they're going to one thing that i would like to see them talk about and i
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:23.240]  don't know if they will talk about this or not
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:27.720]  of course that is the candidates positions on drugs i guess we could call
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:31.000]  this the candidates on drugs you can say what have they been
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:35.400]  smoking i don't know but they're basically they they
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:40.120]  found a way to make themselves approachable to make themselves look
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:43.400]  like every man and of course we had carly
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:47.640]  fiorina was the first one to do this back in the first debate in september
[03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:51.000]  she talked about her daughter she says i very much hope that i'm the only person
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.800]  on this stage you can say this but i know there are millions of americans out
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:57.080]  there who will say the same thing my husband frank and i buried a child
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:02.120]  to drug addiction now she didn't tell you what kind of drug addiction that was
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:04.920]  because she didn't want to talk about the fact that she lost her daughter to
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:09.080]  prescription drugs and alcohol abuse and it was her stepdaughter who was an
[03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:12.040]  adult at the time similar thing is going on now
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:15.880]  with chris christie and jeb bush jeb bush if you remember
[03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:20.760]  when he was governor his daughter ran into some problems and he castigated the
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:25.240]  press for talking about that uh chris christie but now he's talking
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:28.200]  about it now now it's cool you know he this is the
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:33.480]  the new jeb can fix it bush this is the new jeb bush that doesn't wear
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:35.960]  tie doesn't work jacket either you know he just
[03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:40.520]  goes out and talks he's the every man that's the new approach and so
[03:12:40.520 --> 03:12:44.760]  now that new jeb bush is going to capitalize on his daughter's problems
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:47.400]  with drug addiction and you know what it is a problem
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:52.760]  here's an article that we had just last week of 46,471 drug overdoses
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:56.840]  more americans die from drug overdoses than from car crashes or guns but
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:00.600]  guess what the worst drug overdoses are from
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:05.080]  prescription drugs you know the same things that cause problems for
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:09.400]  carlie fiorina's daughter for jeb bush's daughter prescription drugs are
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:13.320]  they going to make those illegal i don't know
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:17.880]  also we had a report this weekend dea report says heroin
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:23.480]  and meth seizures are up 300 in arizona is that a sign that the war on drugs is
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:27.160]  working i don't think so i think this is a sign
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:31.400]  that we have the tip of the iceberg very similar to what we saw happening in
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:35.480]  the ant arctic remember we had reports of ant arctic
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:38.520]  ice flows melting off and breaking off that
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:41.960]  increasing dramatically and everybody said look at that the polar caps are
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:46.360]  melting and nasa nasa came out and said no
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:50.440]  based on our satellite information yes there is an increase
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:54.120]  in ice that is breaking up but if you look at other parts of ant arctica
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:13:57.720]  there are record amounts of ice there's a net increase
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:01.400]  of ice that's why you're seeing an increase and it melting
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:06.760]  in the in one area is because it is going up by record amounts it says
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:11.400]  similar situation where you see the heroin the meth
[03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:15.560]  showing up in record amounts 300 i think that's an indication
[03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:20.360]  that the trafficking has gone up we know that's what happened
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:24.040]  in afghanistan when america went into afghanistan
[03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:29.000]  the taliban had reduced the growing of heroin and when we went in there
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:33.640]  it went from about a 10 of the world's supply up into the upper 90s now every
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:36.600]  year they have a record crop since the american government has gone into
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:40.120]  afghanistan we've got a record crop of poppies that
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:43.320]  they use to make heroin and other opiates
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.360]  but the 2016ers as they say in cnn are now opening up about drug addiction
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:52.120]  fights because it is now cool it is now a way to connect with the people they
[03:14:52.120 --> 03:14:54.760]  point out jeb bush on the campaign trail new hampshire
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:15:00.360]  spoke in emotional terms he says uh i visited my daughter in jail
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:03.720]  i never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:07.640]  and then he did what i imagine he should have said right next
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:11.800]  after that is so i got her out you know there's not going to be any mandatory
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:16.840]  minimums for the bush clan are there that's the insanity of the drug war
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:21.000]  of course that started with the revered ronald reagan these mandatory minimums
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.080]  but in her case she was arrested in 2002 at the age of 24
[03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:28.840]  for trying to fill a false prescription she was sentenced to 10 days
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:34.040]  in jail 10 days 10 days not 10 years like your daughter would be sentenced
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:39.640]  no the bush daughter gets 10 days in jail and it's because of contempt
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:43.000]  because after they put her in a drug rehab program they found her with crack
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.080]  cocaine now let me tell you something
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:51.160]  if you were not a drug if you were not a bush drug pushing
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:54.440]  member of that family uh you were found with
[03:15:54.440 --> 03:15:58.040]  prescription drug abuse you were found with crack cocaine you would get a lot
[03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:02.040]  more than 10 days but now he wants to connect with everybody
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:06.760]  okay he wants to tell everybody that uh you know he understands that he feels
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:09.800]  our pain i don't really know what his prescription is i know that
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:13.320]  chris christy had a viral video this saturday when i looked at it it had
[03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:17.000]  over four million views he was saying okay fine
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:21.160]  they bumped me off of the debate but i'm gonna get to people with videos like
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:24.120]  this and they had a very slickly produced video
[03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:30.200]  ultra ultra close-up on his face and uh you know you could see so you could see
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:33.400]  the emotion very dramatic effect and he goes through a
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:36.760]  long story about a friend that he had from law school
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:40.360]  and he makes a case about how this guy had everything very successful
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:43.560]  uh in law school very successful as a lawyer
[03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:47.480]  uh he had a beautiful family a lot of money and all this he lost
[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:51.080]  everything because of prescription drug abuse
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:56.840]  he hurt his back he went to an md and the md put him on painkillers percosep
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:00.280]  and because of the percosep prescription
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:04.440]  he got addicted to that he lost his job he lost his money
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:08.120]  he lost his family and eventually he committed suicide you can see that if
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:11.720]  you're watching this you can see how tightly uh tight and close at his
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:16.280]  extreme close-up on chris christy because this is about a making a visceral
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:19.160]  connection with the public that's what this is really about
[03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:23.320]  so chris christy tells again like carlie for your rena telling about her
[03:17:23.320 --> 03:17:26.120]  daughter who was addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol
[03:17:26.120 --> 03:17:29.160]  chris christy tells about a friend that he had who
[03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:33.560]  died from prescription drug abuse and then they pivot
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:37.880]  to marijuana isn't that amazing isn't that amazing doesn't that tell you
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:40.840]  something certainly tells me something but of course
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:44.120]  it's interesting that chris christy says that he's going to
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:47.880]  shut down the 10th amendment for colorado and oregon and washington these
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:51.720]  states who have legalized marijuana because they realize
[03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:55.480]  that the war on drugs is a failure chris christy will say that it's a failure
[03:17:55.480 --> 03:18:00.680]  but then he wants to continue it his one his only concession is
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:05.080]  that he wants to imprison the drug sailors sellers and not the drug buyers
[03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:08.600]  well here's a news flash for chris christy we've been there
[03:18:08.600 --> 03:18:12.840]  we've done that we did that with alcohol prohibition we only went after
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:17.000]  the alcapones see what changed was under ronald reagan
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:22.360]  we went after the end user that's how abhorrent this thing has become
[03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:26.280]  the 44 years of failed policy we went after the end user
[03:18:26.280 --> 03:18:29.960]  yeah they only went after the drug dealers under alcohol prohibition and it
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:34.120]  was a failure and as chris christy a lawyer should understand
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:37.720]  we needed a constitutional amendment for alcohol prohibition where is your
[03:18:37.720 --> 03:18:41.400]  constitutional amendment chris christy to prohibit marijuana or any of the
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:45.240]  other things that you say you have the authority to throw us in jail for life
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:48.280]  about okay what you have done and what you need to
[03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:53.560]  understand is that these people who have foisted this war of prohibition on us
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:57.880]  it's not about using drugs because people are going to use drugs anyway
[03:18:57.880 --> 03:19:00.760]  aren't they aren't they still using drugs after 44 years
[03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:04.440]  that has been a total failure and he's right it has been a total failure in
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:08.200]  terms of trying to stop people from using drugs but it has been an immense
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:12.600]  success at creating very powerful monopolistic black
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:15.960]  markets for drug cartels it's been a success at completely destroying the
[03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:19.640]  rule of law it's been a success at creating a militarized police state
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:22.760]  and he wants to continue with that he wants to continue with that
[03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:26.600]  now bernie sanders says he wants to just for marijuana
[03:19:26.600 --> 03:19:30.200]  he has introduced a bill and fine better late than never where's he been for the
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:33.400]  last 44 years he wants to introduce a bill uh to
[03:19:33.400 --> 03:19:37.000]  basically take marijuana off the list clary clinton says well let's remove it
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:40.840]  from the FDA list it's not the FDA list that's schedule one through four list
[03:19:40.840 --> 03:19:44.920]  that was created by the un 10 years before nixon's war on drugs that's what
[03:19:44.920 --> 03:19:47.240]  this is really about the only person who got it right
[03:19:47.240 --> 03:19:51.400]  was donald trump 25 years ago will he have the guts to say it again
[03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:55.160]  that the only way to stop this this whole thing is a joke we have to legalize
[03:19:55.160 --> 03:20:00.600]  drugs to win the war we have to take away the profit from the drugs ours
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:06.200]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war
[03:20:06.200 --> 03:20:09.640]  each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better
[03:20:09.640 --> 03:20:12.520]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with
[03:20:12.520 --> 03:20:16.280]  food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:18.680]  storage i'm talking about staying warm in the
[03:20:18.680 --> 03:20:21.640]  cold here are some things for you to consider
[03:20:21.640 --> 03:20:25.000]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:28.760]  coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:32.840]  you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time when you
[03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:36.920]  need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time
[03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:40.520]  when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:45.160]  costly than you think for these answers go to fortressclothing.com

[03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:14.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this tuesday november 10th
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:20.040]  2015 joining me now is mark hall producer and director of a new
[03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:25.080]  documentary film called killing ed subtitled charter schools corruption
[03:24:25.080 --> 03:24:29.800]  and the glenn movement in america this is something that is is very important
[03:24:29.800 --> 03:24:34.040]  as alex was pointing out you need to understand what is going on i support
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:37.240]  freedom of choice and education i support parental involvement in
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:40.440]  education but we need to very carefully look at the
[03:24:40.440 --> 03:24:44.120]  structures that we're going to use with this certainly i think charter schools
[03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:47.400]  have a possibility of and we've seen this happen
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:50.440]  of crony capitalism there's a lot of money in this pot
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:53.960]  there's a lot of money we're going to talk about how much money the largest
[03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:58.680]  uh organization the largest network of charter schools gets is actually
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:05.160]  run by an islamic imam exiled from turkey and brought into the united states
[03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:07.400]  and he has the largest network of schools so
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:12.040]  mark when you did this you went went for i guess really the worst case example
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:15.800]  of what can go wrong with the charter school yeah absolutely david thanks
[03:25:15.800 --> 03:25:19.000]  thanks for having me here today um yeah killing it is
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.360]  really showing us the worst case scenario in this lightly
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:26.280]  regulated charter school system that we've set up in our country
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:29.400]  um i started shooting this film a number of years ago
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:32.600]  after seeing uh the ghoulin movement and its schools
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:37.240]  grow and in number here in texas they had the largest number of schools here in
[03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:43.240]  texas swiftly about 46 i believe now um just added one today you you were
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:47.000]  kind enough to bring us a press release and and get this this is coming from
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.760]  the austin police department talking about a new
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:54.040]  fatala ghoulin school that's being opened up here in austin
[03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:57.720]  that's one of the things that that really came out in this documentary was
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:02.200]  how the ghoulin movement has connected itself with law enforcement
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:06.120]  with congressmen with local and state government with contractors and all
[03:26:06.120 --> 03:26:09.160]  these different but they really are totally connected and of course there
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:12.040]  were there were pictures in your uh documentary of art
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:17.480]  osavado we've also got uh congressman mccall who is head of
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:21.080]  homeland security you would think he would know a little bit better you would
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:24.680]  think that he would uh vet this maybe he does yeah because we've seen what's
[03:26:24.680 --> 03:26:29.240]  going on with isis in syria in the middle east we've seen that when our
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:33.560]  government uh creates a terrorist arms a terrorist trains a terrorist gives them
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:36.440]  money uh they're moderate terrorists we got that
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:39.720]  picture up on our website today as a matter of fact they have a terrorist and
[03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:43.560]  has a guy in balaclava holding an ak-47 and
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:46.760]  then next to him the exact same picture but it says moderate terrorist because
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:49.880]  in his left hand he's holding a small american flag
[03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:53.320]  and so we have talked about how our government has been involved
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:57.560]  with the creation of isis with the creation of these
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:01.560]  jihadis using them as surrogates and wars but this is something that we all
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:04.760]  should be very much aware of very concerned about
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:09.000]  that this islamic cleric who floated the idea of the islamic state of a
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:13.320]  transnational caliphate way back in the 90s and was thrown out of turkey
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:17.080]  because of that is brought into the united states by the cia they give him
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:20.520]  letters of recommendation ran corporation uh
[03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:23.800]  former bigwig there gave him gave him letters of recommendation
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:28.600]  so he was brought into the united states ushered in by the cia even though
[03:27:28.600 --> 03:27:31.320]  many people opposed him who knew what he was about
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:34.440]  and now he's running the biggest network of charter schools in united states
[03:27:34.440 --> 03:27:37.880]  getting federal taxpayer money yeah exactly i mean
[03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:43.320]  we know that fatula gula came to united states in 1999 he had been indicted
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:47.000]  by the turkish government at that time for trying to overthrow
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:51.160]  the turkish secular government he was trying to install a theocratic
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:56.200]  government and he came to united states ostensibly on a medical
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:28:01.800]  reason for for diabetes i understand and he set himself up in the pokonos of
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:04.840]  northeastern pennsylvania where he lives with
[03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:09.480]  several hundred of his followers and he's operating this global islamic
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:13.240]  movement from that location now he's very gutsy in the in the
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:17.320]  documentary you actually go to the gates of his compound exactly very
[03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:19.960]  gutsy move right we've been there a couple of times
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:23.800]  and uh they're not happy to see us um they don't really want to live out in
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:27.320]  the open it's a very secretive group uh we know
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:31.160]  that their schools here in the united states are bringing in followers
[03:28:31.160 --> 03:28:35.640]  that follow him from turkey uh you know that that believe in the gulen movements
[03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:38.200]  agenda and they're teaching at these schools not
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:41.640]  only here in texas but all over the united states there's a lot of
[03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:45.640]  instructors who come in from turkey absolutely and and they always do this
[03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:48.520]  under the beard just like they're doing this the school that opens day and as i
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:51.480]  remarked to you when we were waiting you know during the commercial break so
[03:28:51.480 --> 03:28:54.920]  this is a strange time of the year to open up a new school
[03:28:54.920 --> 03:28:58.280]  uh you know in the middle of november but they're opening up a new school the
[03:28:58.280 --> 03:29:01.880]  austin police department is going to be there cutting the ribbon uh with them
[03:29:01.880 --> 03:29:05.400]  for this opening ceremony and they call them the harmony public
[03:29:05.400 --> 03:29:09.800]  schools stem uh based curriculum and that's science technology
[03:29:09.800 --> 03:29:13.400]  engineering and math but they always talk about the harmony schools of science
[03:29:13.400 --> 03:29:16.280]  and math yes that's the beard well that is one of the
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:19.720]  things that they're using i think to get our our support to get our
[03:29:19.720 --> 03:29:24.040]  politicians support is that we're somehow needing more stem
[03:29:24.040 --> 03:29:27.560]  you know teachers and we need more stem educated students
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:31.160]  but it's really just a ruse yeah yeah people are very much interested
[03:29:31.160 --> 03:29:34.280]  in having a science and technology education for their children rightfully
[03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:37.000]  so but the question we're going to address when we come back is
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:41.160]  are they getting that or are they getting a propaganda
[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:44.600]  education towards turkey towards islam say with us we'll be right back with
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:46.920]  mark hall
[03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:52.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:52.040 --> 03:29:58.840]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.840 --> 03:30:02.440]  hamtramck michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first
[03:30:02.440 --> 03:30:06.440]  majority muslim city in the us for example business owners routinely
[03:30:06.440 --> 03:30:09.800]  advertise their products in arabic and they can't obtain liquor licenses
[03:30:09.800 --> 03:30:13.320]  within 500 feet of a mosque but besides his cultural shift
[03:30:13.320 --> 03:30:16.840]  hamtramck also serves as a microcosm of america's economy
[03:30:16.840 --> 03:30:20.600]  hamtramck was the home of a chrysler automobile plant back during the muscle
[03:30:20.600 --> 03:30:24.440]  car era of the 60s and early 70s everything for implemeth barracudas
[03:30:24.440 --> 03:30:27.560]  the dodge charges were built at the hamtramck plant but now the plant is
[03:30:27.560 --> 03:30:30.920]  closed down just like america's manufacturing base when the u.s dollar
[03:30:30.920 --> 03:30:34.360]  was chosen as the international medium of exchange decades ago
[03:30:34.360 --> 03:30:37.960]  u.s still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the only
[03:30:37.960 --> 03:30:41.160]  reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global
[03:30:41.160 --> 03:30:44.280]  demand for the dollar but eventually other countries will stop accepting
[03:30:44.280 --> 03:30:47.640]  dollars for their products because we barely manufacture anything anymore
[03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:51.000]  and when that happens the u.s economy will close down just like the hamtramck
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:54.840]  automobile plant did so many years ago this is kit daniels and visit info wars

[03:33:34.600 --> 03:33:38.040]  there are many things that i learned from the film about the gulen
[03:33:38.040 --> 03:33:40.840]  movement and the schools that they've created here in the united states it is
[03:33:40.840 --> 03:33:44.280]  the largest charter school movement in the united states actually the largest in

[03:34:25.640 --> 03:34:29.480]  schools the possibility for corruption for crony capitalism
[03:34:29.480 --> 03:34:33.800]  with the charter school mechanism because there is a huge pot of money
[03:34:33.800 --> 03:34:37.000]  that is in the federal coffers is being handed out to anybody that can meet
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.640]  these qualifications to start to start a charter school
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:44.760]  so that is a probable problem right there okay we need to look at
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:49.080]  but you look at the very worst case the gulen movement
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:52.440]  and yeah go ahead i was just going to say i mean you know the new school that's
[03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:57.400]  open today is one of six here in austin uh you know they're educating roughly
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:01.160]  a little over 60 000 students across the united states now
[03:35:01.160 --> 03:35:05.240]  and they're bringing in you know many thousands of teachers who are followers
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:09.080]  of imam gulen on h1b visas to teach at the schools
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:12.840]  we talked a little bit about stem education a lot of the politicians that
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:16.520]  you see in the film are saying you know we need to have more teachers that are
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:19.800]  qualified to teach these stem subjects science
[03:35:19.800 --> 03:35:24.040]  engineering these technology subjects but really it's a ruse
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:27.480]  it's really a falsehood to bring in these followers
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:31.640]  from turkey who are you know they have sworn their allegiance to imam
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:35.400]  fatula gulen it is a religious movement it is a transnational
[03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:38.600]  caliphate that he's trying to set up he talked about an islamic state and got
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:41.960]  thrown out of turkey in the in the 1990s brought into the united
[03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:45.400]  states then by the cia to set this up that's everybody's concern is that what
[03:35:45.400 --> 03:35:49.000]  he is setting up here is not a bunch of schools of science and math
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:53.400]  but what he's setting up here is islamic madrasas like he has set up and is
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:58.360]  explicitly done in islamic countries some of his detractors have called his
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:02.840]  educational institutions educational jihad because what you see in the
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:05.560]  schools here in the united states and elsewhere
[03:36:05.560 --> 03:36:09.480]  is intense national terrification of their children
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:14.520]  so instead of teaching spanish as a language in many of the schools here
[03:36:14.520 --> 03:36:17.960]  on the border of mexico you're seeing these schools
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:22.200]  primarily teach turkish to these young children yes and and these are not
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:25.400]  turkish kids these are kids that come from a variety of
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:30.440]  backgrounds Hispanics you know caucasians african-americans
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:34.440]  and you know the question is why are they being so intensively taught
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:39.000]  a love of turkey when they should be taught something about our own country
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:42.280]  they bring them in with the beard of science and technology because that's
[03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.520]  what parents see as a future for their children
[03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:47.400]  getting a degree in engineering or something like that they can get a nice
[03:36:47.400 --> 03:36:50.920]  paying job with that and yet when they come into these schools as you show in
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:54.200]  your movie killing ed they come in and they're
[03:36:54.200 --> 03:36:57.880]  getting giving them a lot of turkish culture teaching them the turkish
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:02.520]  language sending them on trips to turkey exactly every year
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:06.200]  thousands of these children are going to turkey for the summer
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:09.960]  i've talked to parents that have gone on these trips we don't cover it very much
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:12.920]  in the film but you do see you know students from
[03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:17.000]  even public schools that somehow have been invited to go
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:20.360]  on these trips to turkey as a result of the gulun movement
[03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:23.320]  i think it's a disneyland experience when they go well they get it they can
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:26.200]  they experience that's not really the real turkey and i think this is what
[03:37:26.200 --> 03:37:30.200]  irks the secular turks that we should be supporting in turkey
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:33.800]  we should not be supporting a global islamic movement
[03:37:33.800 --> 03:37:37.320]  here in our country because they're getting an excess of 500 million dollars
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:40.840]  a year in taxpayer funds that's amazing these are
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:44.920]  funds that you and i are giving to our government
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:49.080]  and they're going directly to this organization now a lot of that money is
[03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:53.400]  going to the schools to operate the schools to pay salaries
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:57.000]  however you'll find that young teachers that are coming to work at these schools
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.720]  that are not affiliated with the gulun movement
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:04.200]  are being paid a lot less than the turkish teachers that are coming over
[03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:08.120]  now a part of that money evidently and apparently
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:13.960]  is being skimmed every year to go to the non-educational purposes
[03:38:13.960 --> 03:38:17.160]  that fatoula gulun has for his followers including
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:21.160]  what i consider a very soft civil war that's occurring right now
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:25.480]  in turkey yeah we see that happening all the time there's news of
[03:38:25.480 --> 03:38:28.840]  gulun followers being arrested by the erigan
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:32.200]  government and so there are people that are high in the
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:35.720]  turkish government that are trying to arrest and then release
[03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:39.880]  people who are gulun followers and then you know there's a back and forth they're
[03:38:39.880 --> 03:38:43.320]  they're arrested release arrested release and you point out it's an ongoing
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:45.880]  i said looks like they're on the cusp of the civil war you said it's kind of a
[03:38:45.880 --> 03:38:50.040]  soft civil war right now absolutely the gulun movement has taken over
[03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:55.880]  the judiciary in turkey elements of the police including secret police
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:38:59.880]  they tried to take over the version of the turkish version of the cia
[03:38:59.880 --> 03:39:04.600]  they were unsuccessful erdogan and gulun were friends they're both islamists
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:09.160]  erdogan runs the akp party he's just been reelected on november 1st
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:12.680]  with a majority he'd love to change the constitution of turkey
[03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:16.680]  but the gulun movement has been countering those efforts
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:21.560]  for many years now so we're supporting the wrong people with our tax dollars
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:26.040]  ultimately our money our money tax dollars is going
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:31.240]  to this very anti-democratic group in turkey it's going to a group of people
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:33.160]  here in the united states that are teaching
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:37.480]  over 60 000 students now and we don't seem to have
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:41.560]  the political will or the will in our law enforcement to do something about it
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:44.840]  there's this is something we've seen for decades all of my life
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:49.000]  we've seen the malinvestment in terms of foreign policy propping up
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:52.360]  dictatorships and so forth abroad and and seeing how that is making those
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:56.120]  countries worse and yet now with the charter school movement
[03:39:56.120 --> 03:39:59.000]  using the gulun movement using the charter school
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:02.840]  uh uh structure we're doing the same thing to our country
[03:40:02.840 --> 03:40:07.640]  exactly and it's worth noting that many of our political leadership have been
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:12.840]  on trips to turkey as well yes and we could only cover several hundred
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:15.640]  that have gone we we think there's more than that
[03:40:15.640 --> 03:40:19.240]  but you'll see in the film dozens and dozens of people you mentioned mike
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:24.840]  mccall sheila jackson lee um senators uh the
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:28.200]  washington post is currently you know there's been an investigation a
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:30.920]  congressional investigation in the ethics of this
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:35.720]  um and so there's a real problem here the film discusses that
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:39.800]  and of course the gulun movement has made hundreds and hundreds of millions
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:45.240]  of dollars off of us um to advance their goals which are not
[03:40:45.240 --> 03:40:48.600]  you know they're not democratic democratic goals yes absolutely and i
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:51.720]  want to before we run out of time i want to play a trailer
[03:40:51.720 --> 03:40:54.840]  for your movie killing ed i should have done that a little bit earlier give
[03:40:54.840 --> 03:40:57.880]  people a taste of what this is about we're going to play this trailer when
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:01.160]  we get to the points where that you have a turkish speakers on there that are
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:06.600]  subtitled for the trailer i'll narrate that let's run that trailer right now
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:11.480]  a charter school is a public school there is some regulation that don't apply
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:15.320]  to charters so if we can change much more rapidly than in traditional school
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:19.000]  districts they're privately managed schools that are
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:23.240]  funded with taxpayer dollars it's a perfect storm that's destroying
[03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:28.680]  american public education this is about money this is about politics and it's
[03:41:28.680 --> 03:41:32.360]  harmful to our democracy i would say about 300 kids are supposed to use this
[03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:35.240]  playground there seem to be some treatment
[03:41:35.240 --> 03:41:40.360]  differently of minority students minority teachers
[03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:45.640]  and females it's not a good environment for anybody
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:49.320]  i've never known a school to be rated by the federal bureau of investigate this
[03:41:49.320 --> 03:41:51.960]  is the first there's a lot of perception that kipp is the
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:57.800]  largest turkish school operator in the united states yeah it's not
[03:41:57.800 --> 03:42:01.400]  most americans are not aware that the largest charter chain in america is
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:05.400]  run by a group of turkish men associated
[03:42:05.400 --> 03:42:08.120]  with an imam who happens to be very politically
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:12.600]  powerful in turkey we started writing about how the fatala
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:17.000]  gulen movement organized in turkey they accused us journalists of being part of
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:24.280]  a terrorist organization we were detained then arrested
[03:42:24.280 --> 03:42:28.360]  because the fatala gulen turkey is less democratic
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:32.840]  this is an amazing that a group that is this powerful in turkey is also running
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:37.000]  the largest network of charter schools and americans don't know about it
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:41.400]  america isn't aware of this the gulen movement is so
[03:42:41.400 --> 03:42:46.600]  sly by the time you realize this it will be too late
[03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:50.840]  let's not lose sight of the fact that what this whole process needs to be about
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:58.280]  is the student
[03:42:58.280 --> 03:43:02.440]  well mark with the help of your your documentary hopefully
[03:43:02.440 --> 03:43:05.400]  people realize what is going on before it is too late
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:09.160]  there's an excellent website you said you're familiar with this of course
[03:43:09.160 --> 03:43:13.560]  because you know a lot of research on this a guide to the gulen's movements
[03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:17.160]  movements activities in the u.s look this up because this is for gulen
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:21.080]  charter school parents and teachers and for concerned community members this
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:23.960]  is a great website do you know the address of this
[03:43:23.960 --> 03:43:27.960]  website i don't have anything out that i've got you know it's it's c a s i l
[03:43:27.960 --> 03:43:33.880]  i p s is the organization cosy lips okay and i believe it is gulen
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:37.880]  charter schools dot weebly dot com i may be
[03:43:37.880 --> 03:43:41.800]  incorrect but this is an excellent resource we're just google
[03:43:41.800 --> 03:43:45.240]  a guide to the gulen movements activities in the u.s you'll probably find it
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:48.520]  from that title right there and i'll read you real quick quote here the gulen
[03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:51.480]  movement is secretive its activities and methods are complicated
[03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:55.320]  internationally obscure in a constant state of flux difficult to grasp however
[03:43:55.320 --> 03:43:58.600]  the essence of the movement can be summed up in a single sentence
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:02.760]  written by a researcher his last name is azepek in his 2009
[03:44:02.760 --> 03:44:06.520]  thesis he attended gulen schools and turkey has extensive direct contact with
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:09.720]  the movement and he says the primary objective of the gulen movement is to
[03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:12.840]  increase its share of power and of course that power
[03:44:12.840 --> 03:44:17.160]  is organized around an islamic state absolutely
[03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:19.960]  it's very troubling that our law enforcement as you see in the film
[03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:24.760]  fbi raids in four states it's gone on for six years there've been no deportations
[03:44:24.760 --> 03:44:29.000]  there's been no arrests we cover the bribery of a state official or attempted
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:32.680]  bribery of a state official in louisiana keep one of their schools open
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:36.360]  but fortunately louisiana did the right thing they investigated it
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:40.040]  we go through that report with people that were you know involved
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:44.520]  yes it's very powerful it's there's just so much going on it's a complex story
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:47.400]  here we know you're talking about the fbi is
[03:44:47.400 --> 03:44:50.120]  investigating this and yet we see that the cia
[03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:53.480]  brought him in we have the same kind of thing going on here in america that's
[03:44:53.480 --> 03:44:57.000]  going on in turkey you got a divided government some factions
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:00.360]  will enable him some factions will oppose him the same thing is happening
[03:45:00.360 --> 03:45:03.400]  here in america we have members of the american
[03:45:03.400 --> 03:45:06.680]  government that enable gulen that brought him in talk about that talk
[03:45:06.680 --> 03:45:10.120]  about the cia we alluded to that earlier how they got him into the country
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:13.160]  we don't spend much time about this connection in the film because it's
[03:45:13.160 --> 03:45:17.720]  very difficult to to prove anything with the cia is very
[03:45:17.720 --> 03:45:22.040]  dark and mysterious however i will say that the connections with the gulen
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:26.120]  movement seem to be well established by those that live in turkey they understand
[03:45:26.120 --> 03:45:31.160]  that gulen schools in central asia some of the thousand plus schools that they
[03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:34.280]  operate around the world were places that many
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:38.680]  cia agents were working right after the fall of the ussr
[03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:42.760]  so there's been a connection with high-level government
[03:45:42.760 --> 03:45:46.840]  members in our own government with cia when i
[03:45:46.840 --> 03:45:50.840]  was doing research for this film i talked to prosecutors that opposed
[03:45:50.840 --> 03:45:55.160]  the extension of fatoula gulen's visa status here in the united states some
[03:45:55.160 --> 03:46:00.280]  years ago it led to a lawsuit in 2008 who were the people
[03:46:00.280 --> 03:46:04.520]  that swore out affidavits that said that gulen was a man of
[03:46:04.520 --> 03:46:09.080]  you know impeccable background in a true educational leader from around the
[03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:12.520]  world it was members of the cia it was a member of the
[03:46:12.520 --> 03:46:16.040]  turkish a former u.s. ambassador to turkey one of those
[03:46:16.040 --> 03:46:21.240]  members was grand fuller who you may know of he's been very active in
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:25.720]  promoting political islam around the world so there's a lot of connections
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:29.480]  here that need to be looked at further yes yes very very
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:31.960]  troubling you know we were talking about how they use
[03:46:31.960 --> 03:46:35.880]  science and technology for beard and you have a very
[03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:39.640]  very good expose of that in your film showing how they use
[03:46:39.640 --> 03:46:42.440]  science fairs talk about that explain that to the audience well one of the
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:45.720]  things that the gulen movement has done in the united states and other
[03:46:45.720 --> 03:46:49.080]  countries around the world is set up science fairs
[03:46:49.080 --> 03:46:52.600]  now the science fairs are very interesting they're they're a way to
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:56.760]  stair step their their their profile here in the united
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:47:00.840]  states about three quarters of the students that go there are from gulen
[03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:04.680]  charter schools and from schools from around the world so we actually went
[03:47:04.680 --> 03:47:10.200]  to one of those gulen science fairs called i sweep in houston and
[03:47:10.200 --> 03:47:13.880]  talked to some of the children who i don't think were really well well aware
[03:47:13.880 --> 03:47:16.520]  of what they were presenting to the people at the fair
[03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:20.760]  it has come out in documents especially in the louisiana investigation
[03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:24.680]  that teachers turkish teachers the administrators that are
[03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:27.480]  trying to make a lot of money through these charter schools
[03:47:27.480 --> 03:47:31.800]  we're actually creating those projects for the kids just to stand in front of
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:35.560]  and and to look good of course almost everybody you know it seems wins an
[03:47:35.560 --> 03:47:38.040]  award it's something that they can brag about they
[03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:41.080]  can take back to their charter schools and say you know our kids are really
[03:47:41.080 --> 03:47:45.240]  doing well at these these science fairs but it's it's a falsehood
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:49.480]  again using science as a beard for what the real objective is so the teachers
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:52.680]  create the science project have the kids stand there in front of it
[03:47:52.680 --> 03:47:56.600]  and not just that not just students within that particular school district or
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:47:59.720]  even within that state as you pointed out they're bringing in students from
[03:47:59.720 --> 03:48:03.560]  all over the world as you showed in your documentary film to make it look
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:07.080]  very large to show impressive projects that were done by
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:10.200]  adults for them to bring in students from all over the world for these
[03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:14.040]  science fairs and then they bring in local and state officials
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:17.800]  to see this and they just kind of walk by these different projects and say oh
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:20.040]  that's great there's a kid and look at what he did yeah
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:24.200]  exactly i mean this is i want to be very clear that i do not believe that the
[03:48:24.200 --> 03:48:27.960]  gulen movement or members of the movement are are violent they're not
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:32.200]  what we see on televisions from syria they're much more sophisticated
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:35.880]  in how they're trying to see achieve what is a similar goal
[03:48:35.880 --> 03:48:39.880]  which in my opinion is the reestablishment of an Ottoman empire
[03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:44.920]  let's say an Ottoman empire in Turkey gulen is very much a neo-automaniast i
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:48.760]  think his followers are that way too they're followers of saeed
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:52.360]  mercy who believed in science so they do have the science in their
[03:48:52.360 --> 03:48:55.400]  background they're not they're not science at
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:58.440]  they're not against science at all so this is one thing that you do see in
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:02.680]  their schools and i think it's also very attractive to parents
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:05.800]  well you show in your uh in your documentary
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:09.320]  some of the Turkish instructors that they bring in and they're not
[03:49:09.320 --> 03:49:13.160]  they don't have any educational background per se they they mix them in
[03:49:13.160 --> 03:49:16.680]  with domestic teachers who come in and they
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:19.960]  have many of them have turned into whistleblowers but that's the amazing
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:23.560]  thing about they they bring them in because of their loyalty to the gulen
[03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:26.680]  movement and then pay them an inflated salary but then
[03:49:26.680 --> 03:49:29.800]  demand that they tithe back 20 percent of it
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:33.720]  exactly it the tithing is between 10 and 30 percent
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:37.800]  it's also dependent on the regions of the country as you see in the film
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:41.400]  the gulen movement some years ago about five or seven years ago divided the
[03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:45.400]  united states into five regions and they send the teachers into these
[03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:49.000]  five regions and of course they're making more money let's say in new york
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:53.160]  city than they would here in austin texas but yes there is a bag man
[03:49:53.160 --> 03:49:57.320]  that comes along for every pay period and he's taking a percentage of their
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:02.040]  paychecks these h1b teachers from turkey that are followers of gulen
[03:50:02.040 --> 03:50:05.400]  that money is being brought back to pennsylvania
[03:50:05.400 --> 03:50:10.680]  and it's being used for their purposes and non-educational purposes
[03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:14.280]  you know it is very troubling to look at this and like i said
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:17.880]  i i support parental involvement i support parental choice
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:21.480]  i know charles israeli has been very negative for quite a while about
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:24.280]  charter schools and i really had not looked into what
[03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:27.960]  she had to say about charter schools certainly if you've got a pot of money
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:31.560]  that somebody can put together some kind of a business structure present a plan
[03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:35.480]  to someone without a lot of supervision that just invites corruption
[03:50:35.480 --> 03:50:39.240]  and crony capitalism so we're going to talk about that when we come back briefly
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:42.280]  this whole structure and the issues with charter schools when we come back i'm
[03:50:42.280 --> 03:50:47.160]  talking to uh mark hall the producer and director of killing ed
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:58.200]  charter schools corruption and the gulen movement in america will be right back
[03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:05.080]  my name is don whiskin in 1994 i lost my 62 year old father to complications of
[03:51:05.080 --> 03:51:09.640]  bypass surgery in 1977 my 44 year old brother was found
[03:51:09.640 --> 03:51:12.200]  dead in his apartment he suffered a heart attack
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:15.960]  in january of 98 my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed
[03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:20.920]  21 days later my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:25.560]  he waited too long in june that same year i almost joined them at 42
[03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:29.720]  what did i do i took a seven herb formula i now call extendivite made from

[03:54:23.480 --> 03:54:28.120]  charter schools and what can go wrong a worst case example of it is the glenn
[03:54:28.120 --> 03:54:32.440]  movement getting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money to set up
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:36.280]  islamic focused schools we're going to go back and talk to mark about that
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:39.320]  real quickly we're going to find out when this is going to be available where
[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:42.680]  you can get information on it because this is a very important film to see i
[03:54:42.680 --> 03:54:46.920]  saw the uh an advanced uh screening of it and that's one of the reasons that
[03:54:46.920 --> 03:54:50.440]  we've got uh mark here before we get back to that i just want to let you know
[03:54:50.440 --> 03:54:53.880]  real quickly that today we have introduced a new product living defense
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:58.200]  at info wars life dot com uh and i'm not going to cover that right now we've
[03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:02.120]  covered that earlier and dr group talked to alex earlier in the program but
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:07.240]  basically it's a way to clear out infestation of harmful organisms a way
[03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:11.960]  to get rid of toxic organism in in your system you can find that at info wars
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:15.880]  life dot com now quickly because we've got a short segment here i want to come
[03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:18.760]  back we saw some of the things in the trailer that we saw bill gates tell us
[03:55:18.760 --> 03:55:23.160]  what bill gates is involvement is with this uh islamic
[03:55:23.160 --> 03:55:26.680]  imam who wants to set up a multinational caliphate
[03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:30.840]  well the gates foundation the gates found family foundation is given
[03:55:30.840 --> 03:55:34.120]  hundreds of millions of dollars to advance the charter school movement in
[03:55:34.120 --> 03:55:38.200]  the united states we know that some of that movement has gone to the schools
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:41.880]  operated by the gulen gulen movement here in the united states there's other
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:46.600]  family foundations as well elie brode uh the del family foundation here in
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:51.240]  austin um numerous the walmart family foundation
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:54.760]  too has given quite a bit of money and these people are not uh they're not
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:58.760]  interested really in what's best for the the public or our
[03:55:58.760 --> 03:56:01.640]  children yes they're they're interested in advancing
[03:56:01.640 --> 03:56:05.560]  something you know beyond us they're they're unaccountable we tried to talk
[03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:09.080]  to the person that's in charge of the charter school
[03:56:09.080 --> 03:56:13.240]  grants they're at the gates foundation in seattle they're they don't want to
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:17.160]  talk to anyone they're totally beyond that i want to also mention something
[03:56:17.160 --> 03:56:20.920]  too i don't want it to to be um thought that these
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:24.840]  schools are vote are overtly teaching islam
[03:56:24.840 --> 03:56:28.520]  there's no indication to me that i can find that they're teaching islam however
[03:56:28.520 --> 03:56:31.640]  in the united states in the united states they are operating schools that
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:35.160]  teach religion in germany that are publicly funded
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:38.760]  we think there's schools that are doing similar things in australia
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:42.520]  um and of course if they do that and there there's allegations that they are
[03:56:42.520 --> 03:56:45.160]  doing that they would have to do that covertly or they would lose the hundreds
[03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:48.520]  of millions of dollars that they get in public absolutely and and one of the
[03:56:48.520 --> 03:56:51.480]  things too i think is worth mentioning is through the cultural
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:54.680]  education that children are getting about turkey and going to
[03:56:54.680 --> 03:56:57.640]  turkish uh to turkey and visiting turkish schools
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:03.080]  there that are religious in purpose um you know they are being acclimated to
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:06.120]  understand islam from a very particular view
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:10.520]  we have muslims in the film who have been arrested who have been put in jail who
[03:57:10.520 --> 03:57:13.800]  have been tortured by the gulen movement outside of the
[03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:16.680]  united states and this is not the islam that they know
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:20.920]  so it's important to try to understand you know the complexities of this
[03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:23.960]  oh yeah there's a lot of different flavors of islam and if you want to go
[03:57:23.960 --> 03:57:26.440]  back and look at christian denominations especially
[03:57:26.440 --> 03:57:29.320]  around the time of the reformation the competition back and forth between
[03:57:29.320 --> 03:57:33.240]  catholic and protestant and other not nominations we see that happening with
[03:57:33.240 --> 03:57:36.680]  the war in syria i mean you've got the the sunnis the she is the
[03:57:36.680 --> 03:57:41.320]  wahhabists i mean they're at each other's throats very much so so we
[03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:44.520]  we see that happening but you know i guess as we're talking mark
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:48.360]  one of the things that concerns me about all of this is the fact that
[03:57:48.360 --> 03:57:52.200]  parents are just not involved enough in their children's education you have to
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:54.760]  be involved you have to understand that there are people out there
[03:57:54.760 --> 03:57:58.840]  who want to socially engineer society who want to control your children and use
