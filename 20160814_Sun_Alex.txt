[00:00.000 --> 00:16.280]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:16.280 --> 00:22.840]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:22.840 --> 00:33.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.400]  It is the 14th day of August 2016 and I'll be quite honest with you.
[00:39.400 --> 00:46.120]  I cannot remember dealing with a story that I know is more dangerous.
[00:46.120 --> 00:51.440]  I'm not one that likes to go to fireworks stands and to play around with a blow torch.
[00:51.440 --> 00:59.720]  I'm not one to go to a TNT explosives factory and run around firing automatic weapons into
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.920]  the storage lockers.
[01:01.920 --> 01:07.000]  I am not a person that plays with fire unless I absolutely have to do it to expose corruption
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.360]  and tyranny.
[01:12.360 --> 01:19.600]  As everyone knows, we covered the RNC in Cleveland for five days and we've had a lot
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.360]  of secret service contacts, former secret service contacts on air that have talked about
[01:25.360 --> 01:29.280]  the basic corruption of the government in general but haven't actually gotten into what
[01:29.280 --> 01:32.160]  they saw inside the White House.
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.360]  Now we've had a few authors on since then who were secret service agents previously.
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.040]  Some of them senior who have gotten into some of the corruption that they personally witnessed
[01:42.040 --> 01:45.440]  because the stakes are so high.
[01:45.440 --> 01:52.760]  But the White House really is focused on trying to stop leaks because it's leaks that
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.400]  will basically bring their criminal operation justice.
[01:57.400 --> 02:03.000]  Now when we were in Cleveland, the secret service reached out to us and said we appreciate
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.440]  what you guys are doing trying to stop the murder of police and the overthrow of the
[02:06.440 --> 02:14.360]  country, stand by for some information.
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.520]  In the last week, through an intermediary that's law enforcement as well, we'll just
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.640]  stop right there, we were given that information.
[02:25.640 --> 02:31.080]  And now we understand why MSNBC, CNN, hundreds of publications conservatively have been out
[02:31.080 --> 02:36.440]  lying about us saying that we are the progenitors or the people that first gave birth the idea
[02:36.440 --> 02:38.360]  that Hillary has health problems.
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.880]  When she spent almost a year in the hospital in 2013, that was a big national story.
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.400]  Brudge talks about it constantly because it's credible.
[02:47.400 --> 02:50.640]  I'm not trying to dodge the credit, we just don't deserve it.
[02:50.640 --> 02:56.720]  They've had the Daily Beast and CNN, MSNBC say Paul Watson and Alex Jones is the source
[02:56.720 --> 03:00.640]  of the made up conspiracy that Hillary's ill.
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.440]  Hillary's clearly having mild seizures when she's under flashing lights.
[03:04.440 --> 03:05.440]  Hillary's clearly having trouble walking.
[03:05.440 --> 03:09.440]  In fact, I forgot to print it, it was an article from this weekend, just type the headline
[03:09.440 --> 03:11.520]  in, Hillary couldn't get up.
[03:11.520 --> 03:17.280]  And then she gave an interview and said, during the DNC, I was so tired that I couldn't get
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.280]  up.
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.600]  I mean, the point is something's wrong with the lady.
[03:22.600 --> 03:29.480]  Well, the Secret Service has reached out to us and basically said, we think you're the
[03:29.480 --> 03:34.720]  folks that are best to put this out because you won't try to spin it.
[03:34.720 --> 03:39.760]  And we've got the scoop on Hillary's health issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.160]  And the special things the Secret Service has to do for her, so that she doesn't basically
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.040]  fall down her face in convulsions.
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.440]  Joe Biggs is part of this story with me, he's one of the folks involved in it.
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.400]  In fact, I offered to leave him out and others out, but he wants to be part of this, part
[03:57.400 --> 03:58.400]  of the risk.
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.040]  But I'll tell you, walking down the hall into the studio, I'm not a stupid person and I
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.280]  know how dangerous this is.
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.200]  So please pray for us and please pray for this Republic and please pray that the truth come
[04:09.200 --> 04:10.200]  out on every front.
[04:10.200 --> 04:12.880]  There are more criminal investigations of Hillary that have been started, Trump is starting
[04:12.880 --> 04:16.880]  a nationwide movement to stop election fraud and to get poll watchers, absolutely what
[04:16.880 --> 04:17.880]  we needed.
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.600]  Just proving again, this guy is the real deal, but I'm very honored regardless of what happens
[04:22.600 --> 04:29.400]  in this fight to be associated with the men and women in this nation, but also around
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.920]  the world to see the threat that the Democratic Party and Republican Party establishment is
[04:34.920 --> 04:39.680]  and who have gone through hell and high water to expose the globalist and support Donald
[04:39.680 --> 04:40.920]  Trump.
[04:40.920 --> 04:44.920]  I am really honored to be associated with all of you that see through the propaganda
[04:44.920 --> 04:50.760]  that have strong wills and who have their spirits pointed towards God.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.280]  I wouldn't have this any other way, but this is going to be newsmaking straight ahead.
[04:55.280 --> 04:58.800]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[04:58.800 --> 05:12.040]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.160]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[05:16.160 --> 05:19.800]  it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[05:19.800 --> 05:23.800]  right there, I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like bing, everything
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.480]  just kind of clears up, it's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read
[05:28.480 --> 05:33.120]  about it, find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.200]  really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.000]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  done it without brain force.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.960]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.480]  brain force and came in.
[05:48.480 --> 06:10.600]  You'll find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:10.600 --> 06:21.600]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:21.600 --> 06:28.640]  It's not an issue of credibility, it's an issue of safety, but safety for individuals
[06:28.640 --> 06:34.200]  is outlaid by the needs of my children, your children and everybody else's children to
[06:34.200 --> 06:37.600]  have a civilization in the future.
[06:37.600 --> 06:46.080]  It is quite frankly with a heavy heart that I am forced to expose inside information on
[06:46.080 --> 06:50.280]  Hillary Clinton's medical condition for public interest and national security.
[06:50.280 --> 06:55.640]  I personally do not like to be the one to have to get in the arena with her machine.
[06:55.640 --> 07:02.160]  She may be faltering and basically degenerating into what will ultimately become her death
[07:02.160 --> 07:10.680]  in the future, but I do not seek to get in the arena with the king tyrants that back
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.720]  this witch, but we are coming up the start of the next segment, going to get into secret
[07:16.720 --> 07:26.720]  service information leaked directly to infowars.com that started in Cleveland and then as they
[07:26.720 --> 07:31.640]  said they would, they got the information to us so that it can't be tracked back to
[07:31.640 --> 07:36.640]  the individuals, but this is directly from the United States Secret Service, who you
[07:36.640 --> 07:42.160]  see they've been hyping up all these scandals against and demonizing in preparation for
[07:42.160 --> 07:49.320]  trying to intimidate the agency into going along with the high treason taking place in
[07:49.320 --> 07:56.040]  the Obama administration, but also in the Clinton Foundation and more.
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.240]  Secret Service told us they're giving us this information because they think that we'll
[08:00.240 --> 08:04.840]  or present it and will not spend it and quite frankly, they didn't think anybody else would
[08:04.840 --> 08:06.240]  have the courage to do it.
[08:06.240 --> 08:12.280]  They said you want it, you got it and we are going to push it here in about 10 minutes
[08:12.280 --> 08:14.680]  out on air.
[08:14.680 --> 08:17.640]  Now let's go to drudgerreport.com right now.
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.880]  You notice we have the top link on the internet you can get Milwaukee Night of Shame, go ahead
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.920]  and click that link infowars.com, boil down article by Paul Joseph Watson that has already
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.600]  had over a million plus readers today.
[08:32.600 --> 08:38.000]  And I bring that up to point out that we broke the Mayak Secret Homeland Security Report
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.120]  to go after veterans.
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.440]  We broke much of the fast and furious information.
[08:41.440 --> 08:46.280]  We broke the Benghazi info about it being a arms shipment program out of the State Department
[08:46.280 --> 08:47.520]  with Hillary and her foundation.
[08:47.520 --> 08:49.960]  All of it started here.
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.640]  The Justice Department threatened to first imprison and then kill one of our witnesses
[08:55.640 --> 09:00.160]  and then proceeded to kill another one of our witnesses and then proceeded to threaten
[09:00.160 --> 09:03.000]  yours truly.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.720]  So let's just get something straight here.
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.960]  We're not trying to win gold ribbons or blue ribbons about being men, but I want listeners
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.480]  to understand the proofs in the pudding info wars doesn't make up jack crap.
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.400]  We have our own analysis of things you can call spin.
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.880]  Like I'm pro second amendment, I argue points for it, but we tell the truth and we're incredibly
[09:24.880 --> 09:25.880]  credible.
[09:25.880 --> 09:32.240]  And that's why we are now one of the fastest media, fastest growing media outlets in the
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.240]  world.
[09:33.240 --> 09:34.760]  It's why we're one of the dominant media outlets.
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.000]  Forget mainstream news.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.760]  I mean, we have more listeners and viewers an hour conservatively than CNN's biggest
[09:40.760 --> 09:41.760]  shows.
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.440]  But so does a lot of other talk radio.
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.440]  It's a joke.
[09:44.440 --> 09:54.160]  MSNBC, CNN, all of it is just big giant $300 million studios are more that they just sit
[09:54.160 --> 10:00.840]  there and pushing their garbage.
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.120]  But you have to understand that this is not pearls before swine.
[10:04.120 --> 10:08.360]  And when this information came through and was confirmed in the last few days, I called
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.160]  up bigs and I said, okay, we're getting ready to go with this, but I said, I'm going to keep
[10:12.160 --> 10:13.160]  you out of it.
[10:13.160 --> 10:14.160]  This is dangerous.
[10:14.160 --> 10:16.160]  He said, no, I want to be involved.
[10:16.160 --> 10:18.160]  I want to be in the danger with you.
[10:18.160 --> 10:19.720]  So I just want to stay on record.
[10:19.720 --> 10:23.600]  No one else knows this information, but bigs of myself here at info wars because there's
[10:23.600 --> 10:26.280]  no reason for them to take risk when they're not involved.
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.600]  This is not like WikiLeaks, who's all been proven to be accurate.
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.240]  Remember, they should deny that was accurate, which is just emails and more of that's coming
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.720]  on Hillary and and Soros just got hacked and the entire Democratic Party just got hacked
[10:36.720 --> 10:39.240]  by folks inside probably the U.S. government.
[10:39.240 --> 10:40.240]  Sorry, information.
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  It's not the Russians.
[10:41.240 --> 10:42.680]  Russians have done that too.
[10:42.680 --> 10:48.480]  The whole world liberals like Jillian Massons are scared of Hillary because this is a dangerous
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.760]  person and the communist Chinese are behind her.
[10:52.760 --> 11:00.320]  The good news is the FBI, Defense Intelligence, the Secret Service.
[11:00.320 --> 11:01.320]  They're not perfect.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.320]  Nobody's perfect.
[11:02.320 --> 11:06.200]  This country's full of corrupt people and good people, but they understand Hillary is
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.960]  a communist Chinese agent gave him the missile secrets, the delivery systems gave North Korea
[11:10.960 --> 11:11.960]  new reactors.
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.760]  I mean, she's really bad.
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.840]  She's the one giving the Russians one fifth of our uranium.
[11:17.840 --> 11:20.480]  If Trump had done that, I'd say no way, Trump.
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.160]  See, that's how she does it all Trump, you're with the Russians over here.
[11:24.160 --> 11:27.760]  Meanwhile, she got one fifth of our uranium transfer, the Russians, I'm not against the
[11:27.760 --> 11:28.760]  Russians either.
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.200]  The point is they're there for their interest, but you're an American citizen.
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.160]  You engage in, especially as someone elected is foreign oath to screwing us over.
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.760]  It's called high treason when you're at a high level of government and you're involved
[11:42.760 --> 11:43.760]  in that.
[11:43.760 --> 11:50.000]  It's high treason working with the foreign power.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.480]  So even the New York Times admits all of this.
[11:52.480 --> 11:59.560]  I mean, this woman got $35 million herself to give the Russians one fifth of our uranium.
[11:59.560 --> 12:02.560]  Treason doesn't even cover it.
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.720]  So we're reaching a spectacular moment where almost the entire military is awake.
[12:07.720 --> 12:09.040]  Most of the police are awake.
[12:09.040 --> 12:10.040]  They should be better be.
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.280]  I mean, Obama and George Soros and Hillary just financed hundreds of millions trying
[12:13.280 --> 12:16.240]  to cause a race war in this country.
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.680]  We are two minutes to midnight people and I'm not going to sit here at a critical juncture
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.080]  like this and wait for other people to bring this out.
[12:22.080 --> 12:23.760]  And that's also what the Secret Service told us.
[12:23.760 --> 12:25.680]  We're going to go through all this on the other side.
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.040]  They said, big news is coming out soon because she's deteriorating and they can't cover
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.400]  it up anymore.
[12:34.400 --> 12:37.520]  So call your friends, your family, your neighbors, whoever.
[12:37.520 --> 12:41.520]  We're going to take this interview with bigs coming up in this info and we're going to
[12:41.520 --> 12:45.280]  punch it out tonight before the show is even over at six o'clock central.
[12:45.280 --> 12:51.120]  They're now are in 48 minutes to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and Kate Daniels is going
[12:51.120 --> 12:57.280]  to write a basic article on it and then Paul Wassel write a big one in the morning.
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.080]  But this is serious business.
[13:01.080 --> 13:05.760]  Very serious business.
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.880]  You know, I didn't jump the gun and I didn't give sources, obviously.
[13:10.880 --> 13:16.880]  Two weeks ago, 15 days ago, two, two Saturdays ago, I went on air and I said, Donald Trump
[13:16.880 --> 13:18.560]  needs to come out and expose election fraud.
[13:18.560 --> 13:21.240]  They're going to plan to steal the election in battleground states.
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.840]  I already knew that internal polling showed real scientific polling where people really
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.280]  poll to actually know where they're at showed Trump ahead like 12 points, 10 points, depending
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.800]  on which one in Florida, seven to 10 points ahead in a battleground state Pennsylvania.
[13:37.800 --> 13:38.800]  That that means landslide.
[13:38.800 --> 13:45.840]  That doesn't happen to Reagan dead heat in California way ahead in Utah, Georgia.
[13:45.840 --> 13:50.040]  Does anyone believe Hillary's really ahead in Utah and Georgia of Donald Trump?
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.800]  I mean, this woman is one of the most unpopular people in history.
[13:52.800 --> 13:56.160]  Point is there's inside polling going on 24 seven.
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.000]  The Democrats know everybody knows Reuters and others have been caught adding 15% more
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.720]  Democrats to samples.
[14:01.720 --> 14:05.280]  So the interview 65% Democrats 45%.
[14:05.280 --> 14:09.640]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.760]  They think we're complete and total morons.
[14:13.760 --> 14:21.880]  They think we're the biggest idiots in the world 65% Democrats 35% Republicans.
[14:21.880 --> 14:25.600]  And then wonder why she's 10 points ahead and they admit they're doing it.
[14:25.600 --> 14:27.720]  I mean, it makes my head spin.
[14:27.720 --> 14:28.720]  That's just Reuters.
[14:28.720 --> 14:30.880]  Others are doing the same type of stuff.
[14:30.880 --> 14:36.200]  The fixes in they have pulled that all the stops they are hysterical on every channel
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.160]  because they know Trump is going to have a mega massive landslide and they don't know
[14:41.160 --> 14:43.920]  how to steal one like that.
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.720]  They don't know what to do.
[14:46.720 --> 14:50.280]  I'm telling you, they could pull a false flag, start a war, set off a nuke.
[14:50.280 --> 14:51.680]  I mean, they are capable.
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.400]  The globalist conquered this country through fraud, through economic espionage.
[14:55.400 --> 14:56.480]  They've conquered most of Europe.
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.160]  They've conquered lots of other areas of the world.
[14:59.160 --> 15:01.880]  Trump is pulling out of the bridge, it's saying it's an unelected tyranny.
[15:01.880 --> 15:02.880]  People are waking up.
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.040]  They are in panic mode in the financial times of London, in the Economist magazine, in the
[15:07.040 --> 15:10.680]  Washington Post saying world governments in trouble, Trump and the populace are killing
[15:10.680 --> 15:11.680]  us.
[15:11.680 --> 15:12.680]  It's Hillary or bust.
[15:12.680 --> 15:15.800]  And if they steal a nomination from Sanders, they'll do anything.
[15:15.800 --> 15:21.000]  So Trump's come out and said that cheating is the only way he can lose Pennsylvania.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.520]  It's because they got internal polls folks that are done to really give them scientific
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.520]  info, even USA Today's admitting that major PR firms that actually do sampling off the
[15:30.520 --> 15:38.040]  Internet think Trump's going to win, show to the big social network systems.
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.040]  That came out last week, too.
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.400]  That's why they're freaking out.
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.000]  It is a massive repudiation of globalism, political correctness, all of it, and they're
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  scared.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.720]  So now Trump's launching an initiative to organize folks into poll watchers.
[15:49.720 --> 15:52.800]  We're going to break it all down straight ahead on Alex Shodes.
[15:52.800 --> 15:54.320]  History is about to happen.
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.720]  Stay with us.
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.560]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.760]  scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.

[16:57.800 --> 17:02.560]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.040]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message.
[17:06.040 --> 17:07.040]  Here's why.
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.960]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[17:10.960 --> 17:11.960]  So please listen.
[17:11.960 --> 17:17.200]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators,
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.440]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[17:21.440 --> 17:22.440]  sun.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.920]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[17:26.920 --> 17:29.320]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[17:29.320 --> 17:32.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.600]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.120]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[17:41.120 --> 17:43.200]  price for infowars listeners.

[20:02.440 --> 20:13.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.240 --> 20:20.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:20.800 --> 20:28.840]  It was a little more than three weeks ago that The Huffington Post, Time Magazine, you
[20:28.840 --> 20:36.600]  name it, were horrified to see us at the RNC with the most powerful red badges where we
[20:36.600 --> 20:39.680]  could go anywhere we wanted to.
[20:39.680 --> 20:43.560]  And the amendment behind the Secret Service lines, you name it, it was just a big news
[20:43.560 --> 20:50.320]  story that InfoWars was inside the RNC apparatus.
[20:50.320 --> 20:55.640]  And now we see the Republican Party establishment that Trump and the libertarian constitutionalist
[20:55.640 --> 21:01.600]  movement has defeated so far, coming in and saying, don't give any of your money to Donald
[21:01.600 --> 21:05.440]  Trump, even though he's giving almost all the money, like he's supposed to by law,
[21:05.440 --> 21:07.040]  to Republican candidates.
[21:07.040 --> 21:10.720]  Donald Trump is the one raising money for the Republican Party right now.
[21:10.720 --> 21:12.480]  So the whole establishment is against him.
[21:12.480 --> 21:18.880]  Well, it was at the RNC three and a half weeks ago when it kicked off that Joe Biggs
[21:18.880 --> 21:24.240]  and I and others were able to talk to the Secret Service quite a bit off record.
[21:24.240 --> 21:32.800]  And we were told that in the next month or so, get ready for some very powerful information
[21:32.800 --> 21:38.840]  concerning Hillary Clinton, and we said more leaks, more emails, and I said, no, dealing
[21:38.840 --> 21:39.840]  with her health.
[21:39.840 --> 21:43.520]  And I said, okay, I'm not going to handle this.
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.520]  Joe Biggs was there, Joe wanted to handle it, a lot of people are former military and
[21:48.520 --> 21:53.360]  police and things like that will just stop there, and I said, you handle it.
[21:53.360 --> 21:56.240]  And sure enough, in the last few days, the contact came through, they said would come
[21:56.240 --> 21:57.240]  to us.
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.240]  This is not done over phones.
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.240]  This is not done.
[21:59.240 --> 22:00.640]  This is all done in person.
[22:00.640 --> 22:08.240]  And this individual came to Austin, met with Biggs, and this is from the Secret Service
[22:08.240 --> 22:12.240]  of the United States, and they said they're doing this because of national security interest
[22:12.240 --> 22:14.760]  and basically the public has the right to know.
[22:14.760 --> 22:22.360]  So Joe, obviously, we've seen MSNBC CNN demonizes for even daring to raise this, but we're not
[22:22.360 --> 22:23.360]  the ones raising it.
[22:23.360 --> 22:27.000]  She was in the hospital for almost a year in 2013-2012.
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.520]  She admittedly had all these blood plots.
[22:28.520 --> 22:34.000]  She's falling down, she's stumbling, she's acting like she's having these mini seizures,
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.800]  and then basically a lot of other things are happening, but we have info on the preparations
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.840]  that have been made for her, what's going on, and the fact that the Secret Service told
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.640]  you and told us, get ready, they're going to have to make some announcements soon.
[22:48.640 --> 22:50.080]  So Joe, let's be very careful.
[22:50.080 --> 22:54.160]  Let's walk word through word exactly what you were told.
[22:54.160 --> 22:58.360]  So yes, from the source that I was contacted by in the Secret Service, this gentleman came
[22:58.360 --> 23:05.000]  out and said that they know that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  Now think about that.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.440]  That makes a lot of sense.
[23:07.440 --> 23:12.320]  The fact that she's had multiple concussions, we've seen these seizure-like symptoms from
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.880]  her where she starts uncontrollably twitching, and that could lead her to fall, which could
[23:17.880 --> 23:21.640]  give her those concussions, which has also led to the blood clots, and so forth, and
[23:21.640 --> 23:22.640]  so on.
[23:22.640 --> 23:26.040]  So it makes a lot of sense to see how this is starting to unfold.
[23:26.040 --> 23:31.720]  Now what I was told is that she has Parkinson's, and on top of that, there's been over a quarter
[23:31.720 --> 23:37.560]  of a million dollars done to the vehicles that transport her to add an extra step or
[23:37.560 --> 23:39.920]  whatever to help her because she has trouble.
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.840]  There's a little handicap system that lowers down, that she steps on and it rises up.
[23:44.840 --> 23:48.760]  To help her out because she has trouble climbing stairs, and we've been calling this.
[23:48.760 --> 23:51.800]  We've been talking about this, Paul Joseph Watten's written about it, you've talked
[23:51.800 --> 23:54.120]  about it, and people say, oh, this is just made up.
[23:54.120 --> 23:56.560]  No, no, this is coming from the Secret Service inside.
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.120]  And let's not forget, we've got all these neurologists like Ben Carson and others coming
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.720]  out, even the Fox Medical team, and saying she shows signs of neurological disorder.
[24:04.720 --> 24:09.480]  Dr. Steve Pachennick, who ran whole medical facilities, says she's clearly got some sort
[24:09.480 --> 24:10.640]  of neurological problem.
[24:10.640 --> 24:12.960]  Why not just release the full medical records?
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.880]  Exactly, and the other thing that the source came out and said as well is, is one of the
[24:17.880 --> 24:22.080]  main reasons she probably hasn't been giving this many press conferences is due to the
[24:22.080 --> 24:26.240]  fact that from these Parkinson's that she has, from these seizures she's been having,
[24:26.240 --> 24:28.000]  it's being caused by flashes.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.640]  So when she stands in front of people, you see that one video where she uncontrollably
[24:31.640 --> 24:33.240]  just starts, you know, bobbling her head.
[24:33.240 --> 24:37.080]  They specifically said, because we have the list here, epileptic type events, but also
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.280]  Parkinson's which is causing her to fall down, causing more head traumas, because reportedly
[24:42.280 --> 24:44.560]  the strokes are getting closer and closer.
[24:44.560 --> 24:45.560]  Let's get into that.
[24:45.560 --> 24:48.560]  And I think a big event's coming, they're going to have to announce it soon.
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.440]  The Secret Service said that they're scared, but because if any kind of flash or strobe
[24:52.440 --> 24:55.640]  light is used around here, it sets off a seizure.
[24:55.640 --> 24:58.440]  So that is why they wanted to tell us, they want to make this known.
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.840]  They want to give this to us exclusively to have this kind of information to put it out,
[25:02.840 --> 25:06.800]  because you know, most new sources are going to be too scared to even go on record to release
[25:06.800 --> 25:07.800]  this kind of.
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.800]  Well, most new sources, the email show from WikiLeaks is that just came out a month ago
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.800]  and then the guy that reportedly made me the source that released him and ended up getting
[25:13.800 --> 25:19.360]  shot four times in the back, and of course that's being investigated right now.
[25:19.360 --> 25:22.840]  It shows right there, she was giving orders to hundreds of media outlets of exactly what
[25:22.840 --> 25:23.840]  to say.
[25:23.840 --> 25:25.320]  Debrae Washerman-Schultz was.
[25:25.320 --> 25:26.320]  Yeah.
[25:26.320 --> 25:27.600]  I mean, look at what's going on.
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.680]  She's in contact with George Soros.
[25:29.680 --> 25:32.280]  People have been dying that have been trying to release stuff about it.
[25:32.280 --> 25:34.040]  This is a dangerous thing to deal with.
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.200]  Soros is right now are meeting with the Clemsons and meeting with others.
[25:37.200 --> 25:39.320]  Now, they told us more.
[25:39.320 --> 25:40.960]  Just walk through everything word for word.
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.080]  They told us, let's start at the beginning, Joe, and repeat everything because let's get
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.080]  it all out there.
[25:45.080 --> 25:46.080]  All right.
[25:46.080 --> 25:47.160]  So the Secret Service contacted me.
[25:47.160 --> 25:49.880]  They said that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease.
[25:49.880 --> 25:54.320]  They've spent over a quarter of million dollars on these stairs that go down from the vehicles
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.600]  to allow her to be able to step down from the vehicle to the ground because she has
[25:58.600 --> 25:59.720]  trouble walking.
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.480]  They said that any kind of flashes or strobes will set her off into a seizure, and that's
[26:05.480 --> 26:06.760]  why they wanted to come to us.
[26:06.760 --> 26:11.680]  They wanted to contact us and get us this information because they knew we would be able to get
[26:11.680 --> 26:12.680]  this out.
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.080]  We wouldn't be scared to do it.
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.400]  And it really makes a lot of sense when you watch all these videos, the fact that she's
[26:18.400 --> 26:20.520]  refusing to go do all these different news.
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.040]  It had been a year since she did a press conference, and the one she did, she seemed completely
[26:25.040 --> 26:26.040]  addled.
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.040]  Yeah.
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.240]  We need to go question the press because we know this is right from the Secret Service,
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.760]  but I noticed at her press conferences, where are the flashes?
[26:32.760 --> 26:35.840]  You don't really see those like you do at a Trump event where they're everywhere, which
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.000]  we know cause of folks with epileptic type disorders.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.320]  I mean, that's just WebMD to go into these convulsions.
[26:42.320 --> 26:43.320]  Yep.
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.400]  I mean, we could go to another event and see.
[26:45.400 --> 26:48.680]  We could try to go in with a flash or strobe of some sort and see if we can get in.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.760]  If they say no, you can't bring that in, but then I can bring it into a Trump rally.
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.760]  Exactly.
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.360]  We need to go to more rallies with a big flash.
[26:54.360 --> 26:55.360]  We're here to take photos.
[26:55.360 --> 26:58.320]  I don't know if you can't because I remember not seeing those.
[26:58.320 --> 26:59.320]  Yeah.
[26:59.320 --> 27:00.320]  It's really odd.
[27:00.320 --> 27:03.120]  It's really odd because, like you said, when you go to a Trump rally, you see flashes
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.120]  everywhere.
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.120]  It's like he's at a sports arena.
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.120]  It's like a superstar.
[27:06.120 --> 27:08.120]  Well, let's expand on this then.
[27:08.120 --> 27:13.000]  I don't want to give away too much, but I mean, this is directly from the Secret Service
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.200]  where we were told, get ready, we're going to get you something in the near future.
[27:17.200 --> 27:20.240]  This individual is going to be contacting you and then sure enough, that happened.
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.440]  So this has all been done like Matt Drudge says you got to meet in a parking garage now,
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.480]  like deep throat if you want to do this.
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.760]  I remember Matt Drudge exposed Monica Lewinsky and for months they said it was a conspiracy
[27:30.760 --> 27:31.760]  theory.
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.640]  Well, this is not a conspiracy theory.
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.160]  We have broken the Mayak report when Homeland Security said they were going to go after
[27:37.160 --> 27:39.240]  veterans and gun owners and nobody believed it.
[27:39.240 --> 27:41.760]  We got that from the federal marshals and others.
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.720]  And then when folks didn't believe that, state police gave me a similar document and it was
[27:44.720 --> 27:46.680]  confirmed to be real.
[27:46.680 --> 27:48.200]  We've broken the Benghazi information.
[27:48.200 --> 27:49.280]  I mean, fast and furious.
[27:49.280 --> 27:53.000]  We have been at the tip of the spear on so many big issues and that's why the mainstream
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.120]  media wants to act like they're the only ones that will cover news.
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.080]  Now, they're the ones that won't cover news like them saying there's no election fraud
[27:59.080 --> 28:03.600]  in our history or saying, you know, that Hillary didn't steal the nomination from Sanders.
[28:03.600 --> 28:05.600]  Well, everybody knows that's not true.
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.480]  So I really think we've reached a point where they're in crisis.
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.600]  Other points, Joe Biggs.
[28:13.600 --> 28:15.120]  It's coming down to the wire.
[28:15.120 --> 28:20.160]  Her health is fading very fast and it kind of makes you wonder what's going to happen
[28:20.160 --> 28:21.800]  if they're really trying to lift her up.
[28:21.800 --> 28:24.840]  I mean, it's almost like this is the week in a Bernie's.
[28:24.840 --> 28:27.160]  They're doing everything to hold her up.
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.840]  You see these guys walking alongside of her, injecting her with different stuff just like
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.360]  everywhere when she's walking with governors, they've been told they're right by her ready
[28:34.360 --> 28:35.360]  to grab her.
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.480]  Just to keep her going just a little bit longer, a little bit more, a little bit like
[28:39.480 --> 28:41.200]  what are they trying to do?
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.600]  It's so confusing to try to find out why they're trying to push her so far.
[28:46.600 --> 28:47.600]  I agree.
[28:47.600 --> 28:48.600]  Stay there.
[28:48.600 --> 28:50.320]  I want to come back and talk about where you think we go from here.
[28:50.320 --> 28:51.320]  Stay with us.
[28:51.320 --> 29:02.160]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been
[29:02.160 --> 29:03.880]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[29:03.880 --> 29:08.280]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[29:08.280 --> 29:13.440]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.200]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.640]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[29:20.640 --> 29:25.400]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[29:25.400 --> 29:27.840]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[29:27.840 --> 29:33.280]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[29:33.280 --> 29:39.080]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[29:39.080 --> 29:40.720]  ever concerning iodine.
[29:40.720 --> 29:42.640]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.880]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[29:46.880 --> 29:49.160]  any optimum health regimen.
[29:49.160 --> 29:57.080]  Look up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[29:57.080 --> 30:00.600]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[30:00.600 --> 30:01.960]  It took you over a year to do it.
[30:01.960 --> 30:03.680]  Why is this so good?
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.320]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[30:08.320 --> 30:13.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  my system.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.040]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[30:22.040 --> 30:27.120]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[30:27.120 --> 30:28.400]  going on everywhere.
[30:28.400 --> 30:29.400]  These are all parasites.
[30:29.400 --> 30:32.120]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.360]  You have the neem in there.
[30:33.360 --> 30:36.440]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[30:36.440 --> 30:39.720]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[30:39.720 --> 30:40.720]  All right.
[30:40.720 --> 30:42.920]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[30:42.920 --> 30:46.800]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfoWarsLife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[30:46.800 --> 30:53.000]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.240]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[30:55.240 --> 30:58.520]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[30:58.520 --> 31:00.400]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:00.400 --> 31:02.440]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:02.440 --> 31:05.320]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:05.320 --> 31:11.360]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:11.360 --> 31:16.320]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:16.320 --> 31:21.280]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:21.280 --> 31:26.400]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:26.400 --> 31:28.120]  you can to purify your air.
[31:28.120 --> 31:33.120]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:33.120 --> 31:36.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:36.120 --> 31:38.320]  The general public doesn't.
[31:38.320 --> 31:42.240]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:42.240 --> 31:45.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:45.880 --> 31:49.440]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:49.440 --> 31:52.640]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:52.640 --> 32:17.920]  You know why this system is so revolutionary today, then fullwarstore.com.
[32:17.920 --> 32:21.200]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[32:21.200 --> 32:23.760]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[32:23.760 --> 32:27.040]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[32:27.040 --> 32:31.000]  your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.540]  nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[32:35.540 --> 32:39.720]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids
[32:39.720 --> 32:45.240]  that needs to do its healing work, you need to check out infowarsteam.com.
[32:45.240 --> 32:49.560]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition, head over to infowarsteam.com.
[32:49.560 --> 32:51.400]  This body will be very grateful.
[32:51.400 --> 33:02.440]  On the web at infowarsteam.com, that's infowarsteam.com.
[33:02.440 --> 33:27.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:27.720 --> 33:37.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, we're here live, well back tomorrow,
[33:37.920 --> 33:38.920]  Lord willing.
[33:38.920 --> 33:44.040]  11 a.m. central, and then Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. central, we're 33 minutes, 45 seconds
[33:44.040 --> 33:45.040]  in this worldwide broadcast.
[33:45.040 --> 33:48.200]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[33:48.200 --> 33:50.920]  This is a particularly jam-packed Sunday show.
[33:50.920 --> 33:55.880]  It's important that everybody be aware of each piece of the transmission.
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.000]  This segment, I filed a special report that I shot yesterday, I'm working 7 days a week
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.760]  right now, this is so important, our republic is on a knife's edge, to go either way.
[34:04.760 --> 34:09.720]  On the U.N. admitting it's brought in 5 million Muslims, most of the military age men, to
[34:09.720 --> 34:10.800]  overthrow Europe.
[34:10.800 --> 34:15.600]  They actually admit it, even in mainstream news, that is coming up in the next segment.
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.480]  Then, I have a breakdown of Donald Trump eclipse, where he's come out and said they're involved
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.400]  in election fraud, we're doing internal polling, it doesn't match up with what they're saying,
[34:25.400 --> 34:28.640]  we need poll watchers nationwide, especially in battleground states.
[34:28.640 --> 34:32.320]  We've got somebody now ready to battle this fraud, this is a big deal.
[34:32.320 --> 34:39.840]  We've got Hillary, it turns out, 98% of her charitable contributions were to herself and
[34:39.840 --> 34:42.280]  her own foundation.
[34:42.280 --> 34:48.240]  We've got just all these new hacks of Soros and Hillary, as the world fights back against
[34:48.240 --> 34:49.240]  what they see as Hitler.
[34:49.240 --> 34:53.600]  I mean, the whole world is just like liberal groups, you name it, are like freaking out,
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.640]  because when they get in their emails, they see pure evil.
[34:57.640 --> 34:59.840]  So that is all coming up.
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.480]  We also have a very powerful Second Amendment piece, where it shows Charlton has to myself
[35:04.480 --> 35:09.640]  and many others saying, from my cold dead hands, if they try to repeal the Second Amendment,
[35:09.640 --> 35:12.280]  you can't, we have the right to defend ourselves.
[35:12.280 --> 35:15.360]  That's all Trump said a few weeks ago, if he said it kind of watered down, they're
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.760]  acting like it's the end of the world, because they admit they're coming for the guns.
[35:18.760 --> 35:26.360]  They want to legitimize that, from the Washington Post to the New York Times to Rolling Stone,
[35:26.360 --> 35:28.280]  they say it's now time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[35:28.280 --> 35:32.320]  Remember, they always denied that, so we're two minutes to midnight.
[35:32.320 --> 35:33.320]  They're making their move.
[35:33.320 --> 35:35.520]  This is a jam-packed transmission.
[35:35.520 --> 35:44.240]  I've been up here basically most of the weekend, because it's such a critical time.
[35:44.240 --> 35:47.240]  And other parts of the world are trying to pull out of the New World Order and globalism,
[35:47.240 --> 35:48.880]  this unelected corporate system.
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.760]  Now Joe Biggs, finishing up, we were there.
[35:53.760 --> 35:56.720]  I tried on deepened videotape, and when we go through checkpoints, the Secret Service
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.400]  would cheer us, because they know we're awake to what's happening.
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.160]  I'm not going to get into what happened inside the convention center, but it was surreal.
[36:06.160 --> 36:09.400]  Because these people are freaked out by what they've seen behind the scenes with Hillary.
[36:09.400 --> 36:11.720]  I mean, she treats everybody like crap that's been admitted.
[36:11.720 --> 36:12.720]  She does horrible things.
[36:12.720 --> 36:18.640]  She stole the cutlery and then George Washington's plates, they sold the Lincoln bedroom.
[36:18.640 --> 36:23.080]  I mean, they just, they are trash.
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.360]  And Joe recapping, as you say, you've gone over a thing, and I'm going to go over a
[36:28.360 --> 36:29.360]  thing.
[36:29.360 --> 36:32.920]  But the big issue, as they said, there's a big announcement coming.
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.840]  She's deteriorating quickly.
[36:35.840 --> 36:39.440]  We believe it's Parkinson's, but they won't say what it is.
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.520]  Let's be clear, the Secret Service doesn't know.
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.240]  They just say she's followed by medical doctors with these tranquilizer pens for convulsions.
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.040]  She has to be helped into vehicles.
[36:48.040 --> 36:55.040]  They put in basically handicap access for her to be specific, and they're really concerned.
[36:55.040 --> 36:56.040]  Recap Joe Biggs.
[36:56.040 --> 36:57.040]  Right.
[36:57.040 --> 37:00.640]  So we, back at the RNC, we actually met with a couple of individuals.
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.320]  This one guy reached out, really thought that we would be a good source for this.
[37:05.320 --> 37:08.440]  Said he had some information about Hillary Clinton.
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.240]  So we vetted who they were.
[37:10.240 --> 37:11.240]  Exactly.
[37:11.240 --> 37:15.480]  It took a few weeks, but like they said, they would get ahold of us when the time came to
[37:15.480 --> 37:16.480]  get us this information.
[37:16.480 --> 37:20.560]  And what we were told is they believe that she has Parkinson's disease.
[37:20.560 --> 37:22.840]  She has trouble with a lot of stuff.
[37:22.840 --> 37:23.840]  He's falling down.
[37:23.840 --> 37:25.120]  In fact, they said more and more.
[37:25.120 --> 37:26.120]  Yes.
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.120]  And it was asked how much.
[37:27.120 --> 37:28.120]  And they said, well, there's different units.
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.320]  There are different groups on detail, but it's bad.
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.880]  Missed a point where they have to have quarter of a million dollars of upgrades done to any
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.200]  kind of vehicle that she's going to be traveling in whatsoever to be able to give her that extra
[37:40.200 --> 37:43.680]  bit of help because we've seen a multiple pictures with Hillary Clinton where people
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.320]  are helping her up, dragging her almost like we can at Bernie's just to get her up to the
[37:48.320 --> 37:49.320]  podium.
[37:49.320 --> 37:54.640]  And then you see her kind of have these conniption fits where it's like a grand mall seizure
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.040]  or some kind of seizure, epileptic seizure where you see her just her head going back
[37:59.040 --> 38:00.880]  and forth like a bobble head.
[38:00.880 --> 38:05.840]  And what we were told is a lot of this is being caused from flashes and strobe lights,
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.720]  which is why she's probably not been doing any kind of press conferences or anything
[38:11.720 --> 38:12.720]  to that nature.
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.080]  And by the way, Julius Caesar had this as well, was trying to cover it up.
[38:17.080 --> 38:18.080]  Yeah.
[38:18.080 --> 38:19.600]  So this, this has happened a lot historically.
[38:19.600 --> 38:21.600]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[38:21.600 --> 38:24.520]  We have this information.
[38:24.520 --> 38:25.520]  We're putting it out.
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.840]  It fits in with all the other information we've seen.
[38:27.840 --> 38:28.840]  This is unprecedented.
[38:28.840 --> 38:31.240]  The Secret Service covered up for FDR.
[38:31.240 --> 38:33.080]  They covered up for Kennedy's broken back.
[38:33.080 --> 38:36.240]  You know, his back was repaired, but he was still in great pain.
[38:36.240 --> 38:39.320]  They covered up for some stuff with Reagan when he started getting a little Alzheimer's
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.520]  eat towards the end.
[38:40.520 --> 38:42.760]  They covered up for Nixon, his pill popping.
[38:42.760 --> 38:47.040]  It what does it tell you about Hillary that they're, they're willing to expose her?
[38:47.040 --> 38:49.680]  I mean, how long are they going to have to hold her up?
[38:49.680 --> 38:51.240]  She can't do this job on her own.
[38:51.240 --> 38:52.520]  This is not like she's in there.
[38:52.520 --> 38:53.520]  I get it.
[38:53.520 --> 38:54.520]  She's not in yet.
[38:54.520 --> 38:55.800]  So if she was elected, that'd be one issue.
[38:55.800 --> 38:56.800]  She's not yet.
[38:56.800 --> 38:57.800]  They're warning people.
[38:57.800 --> 38:58.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.600]  But here's the thing though, is she a distraction away from something even bigger to take a
[39:02.600 --> 39:05.240]  distraction away from something else that's going on?
[39:05.240 --> 39:10.200]  Because if her help is deteriorating, deteriorating just like this, and there's probably a good
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.280]  chance she's not going to be able to stand up on her own soon, do we need to be looking
[39:14.280 --> 39:16.560]  at Cain more?
[39:16.560 --> 39:18.200]  Do we need to be looking at Obama's or?
[39:18.200 --> 39:23.120]  All I know is I can't believe what cowards the mainstream media are because I openly
[39:23.120 --> 39:25.160]  said to folks, I said, listen, I'm not stupid.
[39:25.160 --> 39:26.160]  Okay, we got the courage.
[39:26.160 --> 39:27.800]  You mean we're dumb enough to put this out?
[39:27.800 --> 39:28.800]  Okay.
[39:28.800 --> 39:30.800]  The only reason I'm going to put it out is there's evidence that's going on and I don't
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.080]  think you're bad people, but let me guess, you've probably talked to other folks and
[39:35.080 --> 39:37.160]  we were told no, we don't trust other people.
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.400]  So I guess they know how backstabbing the mainstream media is.
[39:41.400 --> 39:47.880]  I've got sources in Joint Special Operations Command, SOCOM, all kinds of different places.
[39:47.880 --> 39:52.280]  The people reach out to us for information all the time and it always comes out to be
[39:52.280 --> 39:53.280]  true.
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.600]  The fact that you were talking about how there was a Saudi Arabian vomit with 9-11 and no
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.680]  one believes you forever until earlier this year when they came out and said that there
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.360]  was an involvement with those guys and now families are trying to sue Saudi Arabia.
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.400]  Well, sure, we had that from the FBI right when it happened.
[40:07.400 --> 40:09.440]  We break tons of information.
[40:09.440 --> 40:10.440]  So this is serious.
[40:10.440 --> 40:14.000]  When people like that reach out to us and give us this information, it's because they
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  trust us.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.200]  It's because they know we're going to handle this the right way.
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.360]  We're not going to be cowardly.
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.360]  We're true Americans.
[40:19.360 --> 40:22.720]  We're going to get this out and we're going to break it and make, we're going to force
[40:22.720 --> 40:25.360]  the mainstream media to talk about.
[40:25.360 --> 40:26.360]  That's right.
[40:26.360 --> 40:28.720]  This is a common cause candidate.
[40:28.720 --> 40:32.160]  He's exposing election fraud, open borders, globalism, the fraud of the media.
[40:32.160 --> 40:34.560]  He said today, I'm running against the mainstream media.
[40:34.560 --> 40:35.760]  He is.
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.600]  And so, hey, he's common causing.
[40:37.600 --> 40:39.240]  We got to just do the right thing, brother.
[40:39.240 --> 40:41.360]  And I appreciate your courage, Joe.
[40:41.360 --> 40:42.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[40:42.360 --> 40:43.360]  Really do.
[40:43.360 --> 40:44.360]  All right, great job.
[40:44.360 --> 40:45.360]  You and Kit work on this story.
[40:45.360 --> 40:49.040]  I appreciate you guys up here on Sunday night and Paul Watson is going to obviously do
[40:49.040 --> 40:50.040]  a big report tomorrow.
[40:50.040 --> 40:51.040]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.160]  And thanks to the rest of the crew and you, the viewers out there.
[40:54.160 --> 41:02.320]  It's a great responsibility to have to, I mean, I'll be honest with you, I have seen a lot
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.160]  of dirty tricks behind the scenes in the last few years and they've not been coming from
[41:06.160 --> 41:07.160]  Obama.
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.320]  It's always from the Clintons just in preparation for their reign of terror that's coming.
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.120]  And I was on air back in the nineties when they were in power and I was told, you're
[41:14.120 --> 41:16.160]  being fired for talking about the Clintons.
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.200]  And I said, is this from the Clintons?
[41:18.200 --> 41:19.200]  They said, yeah, you bet it is.
[41:19.200 --> 41:20.680]  They were on a power trip.
[41:20.680 --> 41:25.440]  Camerot communications, uh, which is East Coast firm, they gave me six weeks to stop
[41:25.440 --> 41:26.440]  doing it.
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.080]  Of course, I just went and got syndicated somewhere else, uh, I'm not complaining.
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.680]  I'm just telling you that was for just exposing Waco and, and, and, you know, having Larry
[41:35.680 --> 41:38.640]  Nichols and people on and talking about Monica Lewinsky.
[41:38.640 --> 41:40.920]  Can you imagine what they think right now about this?
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.400]  I mean, all the major media outlets attack us almost every day and say lies about a CNN,
[41:45.400 --> 41:46.400]  MSNBC.
[41:46.400 --> 41:49.880]  I'm just saying, I need your prayers because my kids are counting on me and I'm not complaining.
[41:49.880 --> 41:52.760]  I just, I feel really good doing this.
[41:52.760 --> 41:55.880]  I feel good in my gut and my soul, but there's also kind of like a heaviness like, man, why
[41:55.880 --> 41:56.880]  do you got to do this?
[41:56.880 --> 41:58.880]  And that's kind of the little bit of coward.
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.280]  I mean, I just, let's backslap that guy around against the wall and say, you know what?
[42:02.280 --> 42:03.560]  You sit right over there in the corner.
[42:03.560 --> 42:04.560]  We're doing this.
[42:04.560 --> 42:07.800]  Um, but Hillary's obviously very, very ill.
[42:07.800 --> 42:11.560]  If you want to support us, we have a lot of specials that are ending today.

[42:47.600 --> 42:48.600]  for granted.
[42:48.600 --> 42:52.200]  Spread the links or articles and videos that this live show to everyone you know or tell

[42:55.040 --> 42:56.200]  Special report coming up.
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.200]  It's key.
[42:57.200 --> 43:00.080]  Joe Binks here with info wars.com.
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.880]  Same media that labels Hillary health questions, conspiracy theories, demand McCain's medical
[43:04.880 --> 43:11.520]  history in 2008 double standard exposed as 59% of voters demand to see Clinton's medical
[43:11.520 --> 43:12.520]  records.
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.960]  Back up by Paul Joseph Watson, CNN reported on how McCain was forced to give select members
[43:17.960 --> 43:23.280]  of the media a three hour glimpse at his medical records after intense speculation put him
[43:23.280 --> 43:28.040]  under pressure to prove to the public that he was physically fit for office because he
[43:28.040 --> 43:30.920]  would have been the oldest president ever.
[43:30.920 --> 43:36.040]  McCain had already released 1500 pages of medical records back in 1999.
[43:36.040 --> 43:41.600]  However, despite Hillary being just two years younger than McCain was in 2008, CNN reported
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.720]  that those demanding the release of Clinton's health history in 2016 were being conspiratorial.
[43:46.720 --> 43:51.760]  The network also bashed Matt Drudge for posting photos of Clinton being helped up steps during
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.560]  a campaign stop in South Carolina.
[43:54.560 --> 43:58.280]  This has been Joe Binks with info wars.com.

[48:15.040 --> 48:22.600]  run over while watching fireworks displays and the state run media tells the public it's
[48:22.600 --> 48:31.640]  not Islamic for more than a thousand years Europe has battled Islamic invasions but in
[48:31.640 --> 48:38.480]  the 21st century Europe and the rest of the Western world faces a new type of war powerful
[48:38.480 --> 48:45.400]  central banks the United Nations the military industrial complex combining forces with jihadist
[48:45.400 --> 48:52.560]  Islam to finally bring down Europe we are witnessing World War three it doesn't look
[48:52.560 --> 49:04.440]  like past wars it's a stealth war conducted by traders from within more times than I can
[49:04.440 --> 49:10.880]  even remember I'll be on an international television program or a local radio show or
[49:10.880 --> 49:16.680]  sitting down to do a magazine interview and the reporter will look at me and say oh if
[49:16.680 --> 49:22.800]  there's this big secret world government where is it tell us who runs it and I look at them
[49:22.800 --> 49:30.200]  and I say it's not secret who runs the TPP it's not secret who runs the IMF and World
[49:30.200 --> 49:39.080]  Bank it's not secret who runs the UN it's the programs and operations of these institutions
[49:39.080 --> 49:49.760]  that are secret quasi secret and that claim diplomatic immunity or state immunity in modern
[49:49.760 --> 49:58.760]  parlance this is the new royalty every time you get to the bottom of who is funding disarming
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.880]  populations around the world it's Goldman Sachs every time you get to the bottom of
[50:03.880 --> 50:09.600]  who's opening up borders and destroying sovereignty it's Goldman Sachs every time you find out
[50:09.600 --> 50:15.560]  who's financing all this anti-family anti-fatherhood propaganda it's Goldman Sachs followed by
[50:15.560 --> 50:22.720]  JP Morgan and others behind him and so it's not any surprise that the head of the UN
[50:22.720 --> 50:30.520]  migrant program who was the founder of the European Union but now who runs the immigration
[50:30.520 --> 50:36.120]  the invasion of third world populations it wasn't any surprise that Peter Sutherland
[50:36.120 --> 50:45.360]  the chairman of Goldman Sachs globally openly said that he wants to use third world populations
[50:45.360 --> 50:52.040]  to undermine national homogeneity and it doesn't stop there with Goldman Sachs they have been
[50:52.040 --> 50:59.320]  installing their former vice presidents and directors as the presidents and prime ministers
[50:59.320 --> 51:06.360]  of places like Greece and Italy and they call it technocracy not dictatorship Goldman
[51:06.360 --> 51:13.400]  Sachs is literally the devil it is the top of the pyramid it is the scourge it's like
[51:13.400 --> 51:20.680]  the Nazis we fought in World War two it is the progenitor of all of the crises we face
[51:20.680 --> 51:26.280]  coming out of the new world order but the anti-white racist garbage is only the cover
[51:26.280 --> 51:31.560]  the elite want to destroy the free market system and the basic freedoms and liberties
[51:31.560 --> 51:38.160]  that the West has promoted that's why it's been allied with orthodox radical Islam for
[51:38.160 --> 51:45.280]  a very long time and now we're witnessing true 21st century warfare so it doesn't come
[51:45.280 --> 51:54.600]  as any surprise to discover that the chairman of Goldman Sachs Peter Sutherland who formerly
[51:54.600 --> 52:02.440]  ran the UN program on global governance who is the founder of the European Union took
[52:02.440 --> 52:09.160]  a demotion a few years ago to head up the United Nations migrant council this is the
[52:09.160 --> 52:15.080]  weapon that he admits in major interviews they plan to use to quote undermine national
[52:15.080 --> 52:23.760]  sovereignty and homogeneity now you talk about racist towards western culture and white people
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.360]  this is the idea that because there are countries that are indigenous to white people they must
[52:29.360 --> 52:36.800]  be undermined and they don't argue that they should bring in say northern annuets or that
[52:36.800 --> 52:44.040]  they should bring in people from Brazil for that matter no or folks from Asia they argue
[52:44.040 --> 52:50.840]  that you bring in the incredibly barbarous stone age populations that still have slavery
[52:50.840 --> 52:55.600]  in North Africa and the Middle East and other areas and it was Peter Sutherland four years
[52:55.600 --> 53:01.520]  ago that advertised migrants to come to Europe and worked with Turkey to open up migration
[53:01.520 --> 53:08.920]  routes through Syria and other areas into Europe then Merkel advertises to the world
[53:08.920 --> 53:15.960]  that you should come to Germany Hollande advertises come to Germany and you'll get three hot meals
[53:15.960 --> 53:21.840]  and a roof over your head and a job now it was over a year ago that we began to see local
[53:21.840 --> 53:26.360]  newspaper articles in Germany reporting on them throwing elderly Germans out of their
[53:26.360 --> 53:34.920]  homes in section 8 housing and moving the invaders in 80% of which are military aged men and
[53:34.920 --> 53:40.680]  we knew following the UN program this was next France wants members of the public to
[53:40.680 --> 53:47.240]  take in immigrants as official centers can't cope they have hundreds of these centers and
[53:47.240 --> 53:53.360]  are building more but because they're advertising for millions more to come five million have
[53:53.360 --> 53:57.360]  already come the last three years they're telling the citizens you need to take them
[53:57.360 --> 54:03.680]  into your home and now they're saying we may even charge you tax money if you don't take
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.760]  them into your home if you don't take jihadist Muslims into your home this is the designed
[54:09.760 --> 54:17.040]  collapse of Europe bringing in uncomfortable outside sharia law radical Wahhabist and the
[54:17.040 --> 54:22.800]  same week that France announced that the French better let the invaders into their homes the
[54:22.800 --> 54:28.840]  Germans came out and are meeting with leaders of German industry even talking about tax
[54:28.840 --> 54:35.160]  cuts for them but only when they hire the Muslim invaders out of North Africa or out
[54:35.160 --> 54:40.840]  of the Middle East or central Asia and Reuters and the Associated Press all reported like
[54:40.840 --> 54:47.960]  it's a wonderful good thing this is social engineering in the UN's own words to bring
[54:47.960 --> 54:56.720]  down Europe bringing in unskilled in many cases disease is Lomasist who are culturally
[54:56.720 --> 55:03.040]  diseased with their incredibly oppressive political and religious system that way the
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.600]  governments have cheap laborers who can be clients of the state who can then be made
[55:07.600 --> 55:12.080]  to be constabulary they're already hiring to be police police chiefs you name it to
[55:12.080 --> 55:17.600]  then bully the former indigenous population into submission while the German French and
[55:17.600 --> 55:22.440]  other governments play referee over them that's why from Sweden to Germany the police
[55:22.440 --> 55:28.120]  have been ordered to cover up migrant rapes and more the French and German governments
[55:28.120 --> 55:32.600]  have basically declared martial law or civil emergencies and are putting troops on the
[55:32.600 --> 55:39.460]  streets to suppress citizens that criticize the central government's traitorous activity
[55:39.460 --> 55:44.600]  France has declared emergencies on their highways as commerce grinds to a halt buses
[55:44.600 --> 55:51.280]  are fire bombed there are robberies by the hundreds every single day because open season
[55:51.280 --> 55:58.320]  has been declared by the EU member states to help destroy national sovereignty make
[55:58.320 --> 56:05.160]  no mistake this is only a beta test for the rest of the world the UN's secret weapon
[56:05.160 --> 56:11.760]  is billions of desperate starving people the problem is most third world populations
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.680]  when they come to the West are actually happy to be part of the free market system and don't
[56:15.680 --> 56:23.160]  want to burn down cities and rape women but the EU and the UN do have over a billion Muslims
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.760]  and many of them are ready to take action many of them are ready to loot and it just
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.400]  so happens they're right next door if you take away anything from this special report
[56:34.400 --> 56:41.400]  understand this we're not witnessing misguided bleeding heart liberal policies this is an
[56:41.400 --> 56:47.720]  admitted program to overthrow the West this is an admitted program to bring in barbaric
[56:47.720 --> 56:53.640]  cultures that destroy the basic tenets of classical liberalism and who better to carry
[56:53.640 --> 56:59.760]  it out than globalist corporate henchmen and women like Merkel and Hollande who have the
[56:59.760 --> 57:07.280]  mammal of being liberals you have been warned and the attacks happening in Europe are only
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.080]  the beginning of what we're going to see here in the United States as well all right that
[57:13.080 --> 57:19.600]  report is up on info wars.com I suggest everyone spread it to the forewinds it is red linked
[57:19.600 --> 57:24.920]  the UN admits its plan to overthrow the West I mean we've got mainstream BBC news articles
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.760]  where they're saying it like it's good they just hide the thing in plain view coming up
[57:29.760 --> 57:36.120]  Trump is battling back just like Nigel Farage of UKIP in the UK exposing the fraud the plan
[57:36.120 --> 57:41.280]  to steal the election and we have the proof history continues to happen when we start
[57:41.280 --> 57:48.520]  the second hour call everyone you know and tell them tune in now the if you ever wanted
[57:48.520 --> 57:52.640]  a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously low

[58:07.640 --> 58:12.680]  run silently emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.520]  summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer

[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:57.720]  hit mansions because you have taken america's restraint for weakness you've taken our kindness
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:03.600]  for weakness and if you saw the things I saw at the RNC and if you saw the things I've
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:09.080]  seen elsewhere you would not be playing games with the u.s. military and other groups right
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:14.200]  now that's not a threat everybody knows I'm not the guy that gets up here and acts tough
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:21.840]  and everything I'm not the guy that tries to call for violence I don't want that if
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:27.480]  I talk to talk I walk to walk but I'll tell you one thing the new world order better be
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:33.040]  watching its ass because not just here but all over the world people don't like being
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:36.480]  run by foreign corporations they don't like being conquered by foreign groups they don't
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:41.040]  like being treated like they're dumb they don't like seeing their kids treated like crap either
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:46.640]  and they don't like seeing the media try to create all sorts of weird division and create
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:51.680]  race wars let's go to drudgereport.com it's the top story there at least it was 10 minutes
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:58.160]  ago and drudge has got the most expansive coverage of it if you go up to the right hand
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:04.840]  corner there at drudgereport.com it goes over all of this in followers has great coverage
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:09.640]  as well but I think drudge is even more extensive specifically on this subject it's not loading
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.880]  for me I just I just had it and just hit refresh and it's messed up here on my computer probably
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:20.320]  getting too much traffic or something but drudge goes over a bunch of these different
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:26.080]  different headlines where you've got people that we have on video saying we're not making
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:32.600]  enough money let's go kill white people or let's attack white people I mean I'm not exaggerating
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:38.280]  I got up at about 6 30 this morning went and got a cup of coffee started cooking some eggs
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:45.820]  and sausage on the stove and got my iPad out and went to drudge and was like oh my god
[1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:51.000]  Milwaukee was burning last night oh boy oh there's an info wars story about a couple
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:00.360]  hours later Paul Watson's and it's just surreal it was I sat there and watched like 15 videos
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:06.120]  of just the most racist mindless garbage and just innocent white people being drug out
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:10.520]  of cars and beaten up and I didn't even play it because I'm not even one to demonize people
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:17.520]  and it's not that I censored it I just I just kind of self censored I realized in Ferguson
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.600]  last week a black lady's being blocked in traffic by black lives matter she barely bumps
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:29.280]  a vehicle and bumps some people that are in her way so they unload into her car you imagine
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:33.720]  of a white mob would have unloaded into a black lady's car or if guys with Mexican flags
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:38.200]  were you know you're beating up a white lady it's okay but the other way around it's not
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:45.240]  and the point is this is all just dumb down people you can find every race color and creed
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:50.920]  being pushed into all this by the media and again I'd play these clips on radio but I
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:54.560]  gotta be honest we've got a skeleton crew of four people up here on Sunday including
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:04:01.440]  a rider I guess five people right now we can't go through and beat 15 videos that have got
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:05.640]  every third word is a cuss word I'm not I mean I mean you know how folks speak nowadays
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:10.000]  I don't care if they're white trash or black trash or whatever they just every other word
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:17.480]  is cuss words and it is mind-blowing to hear all this and let's get some more white people
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:23.760]  let's get them let's attack them blah blah blah it goes on and on and on and on and on
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:30.920]  and on and on and then you go read and they've got black witnesses on tape going yeah this
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:37.160]  guy victim fell over the gun gets out and waving at the cops so they shoot him like
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:42.440]  I said more black people get struck by lightning and killed every other killed by police and
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:47.680]  I'm sure cops are some bad cops I'm sure they do bad stuff sometimes try them but man it's
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:53.960]  not the main story in the country and George Soros a freaking Nazi collaborators the one

[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:07.480]  had to back off Donald Trump is amazing and I want to just say this to all of you before
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:11.760]  I go to this other news item I want to salute all of you no matter what color your skin
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.360]  is or where you're from what your religion is or lack thereof that the courage and and
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:23.040]  the gut instinct but also the intellectual acumen to know that Donald Trump's the real
[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:27.080]  deal and it was hard to do a year and a half ago but now with the whole political system
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.080]  against him foreign leaders the pope the Mexican president the Chinese president all these
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.400]  mass murderers all these criminals all these multinational corporations the republican
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:42.400]  party establishment everybody we hate from Carl Robes George Herbert Walker Bush to just
[1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:48.320]  you name it and the democratic party and all the cheating and Google and Facebook all trying
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:55.400]  to scam it and all their lies I mean wow we were right about Donald Trump he is the man
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:09:06.120]  with the plan and mainstream media dying dinosaur media from CNN to MSNBC to ABC this week I'm
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:09.080]  not going to play these clips most talk show hosts even limbaugh and I'm not against limbaugh
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:13.440]  but he played clips of media talking about it we don't even do it 90% of the time I'm
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:18.960]  not going to sit here and play clips of them crapping their little britches over the fact
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:26.680]  that I say one thing and then Trump says it two days later need a little news flash Trump
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:30.680]  sees what's going on he doesn't need to get it from me he's got internal polls he's no
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:33.960]  he knows he's ahead and all these battleground states and then he sees these polls where
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:41.120]  they take 15% more samples bunch of companies are doing it to put Hillary over the top see
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.960]  used to polling agencies didn't want to completely discredit themselves so they do different
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:49.880]  scams for clients but they all got together it's clear I mean they suddenly at least
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:54.960]  six companies I know of are getting Hillary a 10 to 15 point lead by sampling more democrats
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:00.080]  than republicans so I mean they're just literally destroying their industry like mainstream media
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:05.320]  has done to themselves and attempt to put in crooked Hillary this is epic so that special
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:14.720]  reports coming up but first I don't know what headline to come up with on this because headlines
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:20.760]  are half a battle Donald Trump proven right on second amendment statement or is this the
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:28.800]  second amendment statement the media hopes you don't look at
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:34.360]  because it's such an epic clip this happened over a week ago is the number one new story
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:41.080]  in the country still that Donald Trump said well that she's gonna point three or four
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.320]  Supreme Court judges and then they're gonna take your guns what do you do then I mean
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:50.080]  I guess some second amendment folks might want to do something else that was actually
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:59.840]  a watered down someone milk toast and in fact if I have a beef with Trump it's that second
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:06.600]  amendment defense everyone has said since 1775 you come to take our guns war starts
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:11.640]  I've said it on national TV the former head of the NRA has said it Charlton has said Wayne
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:17.520]  LaPierre has said it congressmen have said it it is a cliche that well of all those fails
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:22.920]  we got the second amendment it's in the Declaration of Independence are right in duty to overthrow
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:31.600]  a tyranny we're trying to do it peacefully so they are flipping out all over the news
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:37.240]  saying he went to mark on for Hillary's assassination we have Joe Biden we're gonna play the clip
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:42.360]  when he was running mate with Obama saying if he tries to take my shotgun or my Beretta
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:46.600]  my my shotgun or my handgun I'm gonna shoot him cuz I got two of them you know I'm gonna
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:50.160]  go after Obama he basically says I got he's gonna have a problem we got Hillary saying
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:56.200]  Obama isn't gonna win in 2008 the primary because you saw what happened to Bobby Kennedy
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:01.960]  now those are clear threats he just says if she tries to take all the guns you know once
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  she gets into office and then and the courts say your guns are banned I guess you'll have
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:10.400]  to only have a second amendment that's a fact what he said but they didn't make a big deal
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:14.800]  about it when Charlton has to the senator I said it they said it about Trump because
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:19.600]  now they admit they want to bend guns in countless publications from Rolling Stone
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.000]  the New York Times you've seen it time to repeal the second amendment at least they're
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:33.200]  being honest about it so here is Donald Trump telling it like it is and being demonized
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:38.000]  and then basically everybody else making the same statement they want to make you feel
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.640]  dirty about saying there's some lie in the sand when Santa Anna comes to take the guns
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:48.040]  or King George III does that you're not gonna lay down that there's some point at which
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:57.480]  you'll stand up Hillary wants to abolish essentially abolish the second amendment by the way and
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:08.360]  if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks although the
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:19.160]  second amendment people maybe there is I don't know from my cold dead hands anybody that
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:26.040]  wants to make me unarmed and helpless people that want to literally create the proven places
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:31.160]  where more innocents are killed called gun-free zones we're gonna beat you we're gonna vote
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:35.440]  you out of office or suck on my machine that's why you're going to fail in the establishment
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:40.320]  knows no matter how much propaganda the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.680]  guns I've had enough let me explain something for the new world order okay you're not getting
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:50.400]  our guns 1776 started when you tried to get him your bastards and his charleston has been
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:57.400]  famously said from my cold dead hand you sons of bitches you got that you're not getting
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:04.000]  our firearms do you understand this far no further with your damn dictatorship I'm sick
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.240]  of it you know the right to bear arms it's because that's the last form of defense against
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:15.680]  tyranny to say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:21.920]  down if you want to come and take him Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns Mao took
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:26.040]  the guns that El Castro took the guns you go show this took the guns and I'm here to tell
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:33.240]  you 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearm I must tell you the right
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:39.200]  to defend yourself the right to keep and bear arms does not protect your right to shoot
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:46.400]  deer it protects your right to shoot at the government when it is taken over by tyrants
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:15:02.080]  these are the quintessential American right the right to be left alone
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:06.160]  now in completion that's the clip they don't want you to see all Trump is saying is pure
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.520]  Americana just classic America and they're rejecting pure Americana like lower taxes
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:16.880]  and things like it's evil and here's Joe Biden in 2008 VP running mate of Obama Santa
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:32.760]  of Obama comes after his Beretta he's gonna have a problem 50 times more extreme than
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:44.000]  what Trump said and now he's coming for our guns admitting he wants to ban him so now
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.480]  you see if you're a new viewer a new listener because here's the issue they want everything
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:51.680]  compartmentalized patriots people that are awake we're awake you got to realize though
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:55.760]  the general public raised in their crap filled diapers in front of TV they don't know their
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:01.480]  head from a hole in the ground we're selling a product DNA force that is the very best
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:06.680]  nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.600]  force for us it's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:16.160]  I think it's very very important what the aging process is is when the cell replicates
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:22.200]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:27.240]  but when it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.920]  clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances in the world it works like an antioxidant
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:38.960]  it works to repair nerve growth factor so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount

[1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:23.120]  lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I was watching Milwaukee
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:29.880]  Sheriff David Clark has been a frequent guest and a patriot up there as Milwaukee burns
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:35.520]  and his white people are attacked all over the different areas of the city he's just
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:38.640]  shaking his head it's like there's witnesses that are guys waving a gun threatening to
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:45.200]  kill police he's a convicted robber and then he's killed so people run around burning things
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:48.720]  that's coming up that would have been our top story today obviously but there's all
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:52.720]  this Hillary news from the Secret Service that we covered earlier if you missed it there's
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:57.600]  all these attacks on the Second Amendment but I was sitting there this morning and this
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:01.160]  afternoon watching different clips of the Black Lives Matter leaders and people that are there
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:07.040]  and it's like cartoon it's like a joke Black Lives Matter supporter rich people don't give
[1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:14.640]  us enough money so we burn down our neighborhoods that's actually a quote and I'm like they
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:21.400]  don't give us money so we hit ourselves in the head with a hammer and it's just this
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:26.360]  total entitlement culture where people don't want to get good grades they don't want to
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:35.360]  try to get a job rich got all this money and they ain't trying to give none I'm quoting
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:41.440]  about to steal this cracker's car and just last week we've got the video of Ferguson
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:45.640]  I'm gonna play it later they're just blocking our road and a woman barely bumps the guys
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:49.040]  she just pulls a gun out and starts shooting her and she's a black woman of course she
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:53.280]  never heard about it because she's a black lady so who cares Black Lives don't matter
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:59.880]  when another black person kills them 550 something plus that was a few weeks ago in the first
[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:07.000]  eight months of this year in Chicago black on black deaths 2,400 something shootings
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.200]  two plus thousand are black on black you're not gonna hear Jack crap about that and there's
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:22.400]  a thing I actually care about those people but I'm sorry it's just crazy that we're
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:28.000]  allowing multinational globalist organizations to have us all fighting with each other all
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.560]  multinational companies screw this whole country over and ship our jobs overseas and we're
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:38.040]  busy having riots all over the country for four or five years running when more black
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:41.280]  people die every year from being struck by lightning and killed by cops I mean I'm not
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:47.000]  defending excesses of police God knows it goes on but it's just statistically not even
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:51.960]  on the radar screen I'm gonna stop right there speaking of Hillary Clinton Trump claims
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:55.880]  cheating is the only way she can lose he can lose Pennsylvania we're getting to that
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:23:00.560]  Soros has been hacked hundreds of documents leaked entire Democratic Party's been hacked
[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:06.280]  report six 96% of Hillary's charitable giving goes to her own foundation to herself her
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:11.920]  money laundering organization but before we get to all of that I wanted to play a great
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:16.480]  in our a and for radio listeners all narrated for you visually where it shows Hillary or
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:21.400]  an actress getting on a plane that looks like Hillary and you'll see in clips of herself
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:25.840]  on the news talking about disarming the American people because she's got bodyguards
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:31.800]  but she wants to be able to take your guns here's the clip she's one of the wealthiest
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:38.800]  women in politics combined income $30 million towards the world on private jets protected
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:44.280]  by armed guards for 30 years but she doesn't believe in your right to keep a gun at home
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:51.880]  for self-defense I fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today and out
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:57.480]  of touch hypocrite she'd leave you defenseless the NRA political victory fund is responsible
[1:23:57.480 --> 1:24:03.640]  for the content of this advertising and out of touch hypocrite it's beyond being hypocrites
[1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:10.120]  she wants you disarmed so she can have your way so she can do whatever she wants to you
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:15.320]  and I for one am totally sick of it and all these true liberal organizations like WikiLeaks
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:21.480]  everybody else are hacking the DNC by the way Julian Assange is admitted they've gotten
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:28.200]  into the Republicans they've gotten into Trump true this is very easy to do there's nothing
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:33.360]  there and what they find in Hillary system is so scary they are they are risking their
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:40.040]  lives to tell you what's going on and I can tell you that yes the WikiLeaks information
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:44.600]  will deal with Hillary directly ordering State Department officials to stand down and to
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:51.000]  allow the shipments of arms to Al Qaeda which they renamed ISIS and Assange believes that
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:57.640]  will bring her down that's why Trump is coming out saying she's the founder of ISIS along
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:05.560]  with Obama but the mainstream media is not all powerful but they're still able to divert
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:11.240]  the attention because some of their supporters are that stupid I've had some people that
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:21.840]  I've known for 10 years come up to me one in a gas station yesterday and no two days
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.840]  ago two days ago time flies and say Alex I'm really ashamed to use support in Trump and
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.520]  I was looking at this guy and I went excuse me you remember me and I said yeah I've seen
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:35.640]  you some rallies and stuff well you know he's a rich guy and I said since when are you a
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:39.520]  class warfare person he wants to have better trade deals we need rich people we don't even
[1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:42.960]  have rich people to pay their money off government inside deals oh whatever you're just with
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:47.240]  Trump I said are you with Hillary no but I said oh let me guess you're Ted Cruz well
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:53.760]  yeah you're like a Pharisee that Christ talked about who's just so holier than now when that
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:58.360]  guy's a Goldman Sachs minion it's just it's crazy and I've had that the last week two
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.760]  different people on the street go Alex I'm ashamed to you let me tell you something I'm
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:09.320]  not ashamed to you I'm sad for you I am so proud of the people out there that support
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:16.200]  liberty that have been awake and involved for so long that can see the Trump is making
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:21.480]  a real go at bringing down the new world order and is doing so many amazing things and has
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:26.600]  such incredible courage to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in different contracts
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:31.720]  and TV contracts and entertainment contracts and have his family attacked and go through
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:37.560]  so much hell in fact I did I'm putting on the spot I'm getting neurotic about having
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:40.640]  to read this every week can you guys pull up Teddy Roosevelt's in the arena bow and
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:50.280]  please we left office because the in the arena says it all and I was thinking about trying
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:55.800]  to shoot a special video talking about all the great things Trump's done I mean talking
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:00.200]  about the Clinton death count talking about the open borders talking about one sided trade
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:04.240]  deals talking about carbon taxes being a fraud talking about ISIS and all kind of being
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:08.000]  run by the globalist talking about vaccines being dangerous and you should check into
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:17.440]  it yourself talking about election fraud talking about everything he does is to expose the
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:22.080]  new world order and Donald Trump here's the key to everything Donald Trump thinks you're
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.960]  smart enough to hear complex thoughts Donald Trump thinks you're complex enough and smart
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:30.280]  enough to hear the real truth and he believes you're going to do something about it and
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:36.600]  be able to change them now you are going to prove Donald Trump right or wrong but I'll
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:43.560]  tell you this these polls are as funny as the $3 bill or as Obamacare being free they
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.480]  admit their fate Donald Trump's going to win in a landslide unless they steal it he's preparing
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:51.120]  to fight it that's coming up in the next segment but first getting back to this quote they've
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:55.360]  got it on screen it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:59.840]  strongman stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:04.600]  to the man who was actually in the arena whose face is marbed by the dust and sweat and blood
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:10.320]  who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:15.960]  without error shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:22.280]  enthusiasm the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who is it best in
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:28.240]  the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:34.960]  while daring greatly so that his shell never be the place so that his place shall never
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:42.840]  be with those cold and timid souls who know victory nor defeat all right we're going to
[1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:49.840]  come back get into the situation in Milwaukee the big liberal socialist enclave of happy
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:57.760]  socialism but it's all going to hell that's where George Soros targets we'll be back

[1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.560]  then i'll be back tomorrow 11am to 3pm we'll be taking calls got a bunch of big guests
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:25.480]  you name it i didn't take calls today because we've got riots in milwaukee burning buildings
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:33.360]  police cars we've got all of this major news we've got our secret service news that hillary
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:36.720]  clinton does have a neurological disorder that's getting much worse than she's trying
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:43.440]  to cover it up it's crazy but first going to milwaukee even the associated press is
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:49.200]  the establishment admits this guy was a convicted felon robber running around waving a gun at
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:57.400]  police i mean you wave a gun at me i'm going to shoot you just don't care if you're white
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:06.160]  black what color you are and again they know that we're inherently liberal as americans
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.640]  they know that by liberal i mean we we we don't hate people for color they are so they play
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:15.440]  on our heartstrings like this it's funny that david clarkson critical of obama saying he's
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:19.320]  a cop here last week and now this is happening there but it's all just part of the climate
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:24.040]  in general so there's a few of these clips of people running around seeing the loot cars
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:29.400]  attack the white people we bleep this there's more than 15 videos on info wars dot com we've
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:53.400]  got two we've had time to to bleep so here's one of them
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:36:06.040]  they're yelling black power they go there's a white cracker get them
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:33.040]  white get them this is kkk level man dumb down racist
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:44.360]  by the way people say oh that's racist to make fun of his inner city voice it was a white
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:37:02.880]  guy let's kill them black people they make the squad cars leave
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:32.200]  oh they just beat up a white person for no reason now she's like
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:37.520]  oh she they just beat up a white person for no reason it's like as if some white person
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:42.840]  driving down the highway was out to get you though the average white person is this guilt
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:48.840]  ridden person that hates themselves that's what's so crazy is this is going to recruit
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:55.120]  white people to actually be racist it's all engineered you know you got to really thank
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:58.880]  Obama and George Soros and goblas for this we've got one more of these clips we actually
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:03.600]  got a bunch more of these clips let's go ahead and roll this one this is from a walkie because
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:13.800]  some guy waving a gun a police cut shot here it is black power in the small man police
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:21.400]  train with guns all day long you can just wave a gun dumbest thing I've heard of they
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:28.840]  are yelling black power robbing people's vehicles and again ignorant dumb people are
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:33.080]  racially based it's tribalism whites do it blacks do it the thing is the media has advertised
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:40.880]  it for blacks to do is a good thing to create division now that car's on fire and then create
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:45.760]  this right down a society they use Muslims in Europe they create minority manipulations
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:51.640]  here in the US they've tried to organize Mexicans into all this Mexicans on average don't do
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:39:05.640]  this this is the final fact the walkie wisconsin yeah Milwaukee wisconsin wow we really showed
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:14.240]  everyone we drug some white people out of cars and burned them this is how sick society
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:20.280]  has gotten as a whole and the videos uncensored are on info wars dot com we're on a lot of
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:25.520]  broadcast TV and radio stations cable systems we cannot air profanity here and I don't want
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:30.920]  to anyways but you want to see an uncensored it's at info wars dot com and present planet
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:40.040]  dot com right now there's a lot of censorship going on we're going to be covering it throughout
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:47.320]  the week but this other clip black lives matter supporter rich people don't give us enough
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:53.080]  money so we burn down our neighborhoods we have a chance to play this one yet we haven't
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:57.000]  gotten to that I know we have skulls and crew and when you got dozens of videos on how you
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  could get to them I watched that this morning and I was like what this is a quote rich people
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:13.880]  don't give us enough money so we burn down our neighborhoods that's written like a joke
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:20.440]  that's a quote I saw that this morning by the way this guy is like a black lives matter
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:32.920]  leader who's been on TV look what George Soros does he gives a crazy dumbass like this guy
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:39.440]  a platform on TV and then he goes out and he says rich people don't give us enough money
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:44.080]  so we burn down our neighborhood it'd be bad enough to say rich people don't give us money
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:49.440]  so we burn down their neighborhoods it's like you don't give me any money so I shoot myself
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:57.680]  in the head man I'm telling you I don't mean to be involved in unintentional comedy but
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:06.040]  this stuff's getting rich as they burn down their own neighborhoods and I just feel sorry
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:13.480]  for these people it's just like trendies out there it did it did it all right that video
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:19.000]  black lives matter riders target whites for beat downs they were quote hunting whites
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.400]  in the streets they're beating up all the white people is the quote and I love how they do
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:31.440]  it in Milwaukee and other liberal areas because I mean just a news flash I pull up to a checkpoint
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.240]  and it's the police with a car wreck or police doing something on my guns under the deal I
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:39.320]  pulled the checkpoint you're burning cars attacking people I'm gonna try to turn around
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:43.680]  and go over the medium if I'm blocked I'm gonna get out and say stand down right now
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:47.240]  the minute you don't stand down I'm defending my family and I'm not looking for trouble
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:51.640]  but I just see this type of stuff and there's a we all know why you don't do it in places
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:56.200]  like Texas you saw what happened to ISIS when they tried their crap up in Garland and sure
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:00.040]  there'll be some cases where you can go shoot some people in the back like Dallas like Cowards
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:03.400]  and get away with it but at the final equation you're gonna get your ass kicked and I don't
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:07.560]  mean black people I don't have a score to settle with black people I want everybody
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:13.800]  to be free in an open good society but stuff is getting crazy and it's so racially based
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:18.400]  and it's all run by these wicked globalists that pulled this different stuff in different
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:23.600]  countries and it's so frustrating we're gonna go to break them back and introduce the final
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:28.920]  big piece where Donald Trump calls for you to support DonaldJTrump.com his campaign website

[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.640]  this country please support those affiliates right now though let's go ahead and go to
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:04.120]  this special report where donald trump asked you to stand up for the integrity of our elections
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.960]  why is the establishment so scared of donald trump because they know he's a maverick they
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:14.200]  know he operates on his own they know that he's gone up against the establishment and
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.160]  not let them basically squeeze him in business deals they know that he understands we've
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:24.120]  got a lot of one-sided trade deals with china and other nations and you've got this political
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:29.480]  class of insiders that don't want us to actually have a president that represents us they're
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:36.440]  globalist and trump isn't quote getting his information from alex jones trump was there
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:42.480]  during the primaries when he was winning states by 78 percent like california and they were
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:47.160]  announcing that they were going to take all the delegates from him or in colorado they
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:52.760]  just suspended the election in other states like louisiana he would win and they would
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:59.360]  give the delegates to ted cruz then the media spun it like he was being a sore loser because
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:04.640]  despite the fact he was winning the popular vote the republican party was saying no trump
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:13.280]  stood up to that the rnc was forced to back down and the voters will and the law was followed
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:19.280]  not the republican rules and so trump again doesn't care of the mainstream media criticizes
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.000]  him and laughs at him and makes fun of him he's coming out and saying we have a lot of
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:31.760]  evidence of retail voter fraud and preparations for election fraud and trump has been talking
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:37.320]  about california and illinois and others that have had bills that have even gotten to the
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:46.280]  governor's desk to let illegals who've been off the plane one day vote but then they look
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:51.920]  at trump and go oh we're not involved in any election fraud or retail fraud we're not going
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:56.680]  out and getting illegals registered to vote even though project veritas and others are
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:02.560]  able to do it all the time on video our investigative journalists have documented how easy it is
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:07.080]  even in a state like texas that has more controls so the democratic parties over here
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:14.040]  trying to legalize illegals voting and there's evidence of it all over the country going on
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:20.120]  in past elections or dead people voting or democratic operatives voting multiple times
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:24.800]  but they want to tell you that's not going on even though it's admitted that kennedy
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:30.040]  back in 1960 stole illinois now i'm going to get into some of the history of election
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:33.880]  fraud and also voter fraud here in a moment and talk about how the democrats of the media
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:38.120]  are ridiculous claiming they don't know what it is when it's historic and anybody with
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:42.600]  an iq above 70 knows about it but first i want to give you the good news trump has heard
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:46.240]  our call he's heard your call he knows the history of fraud he knows how they tried to
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:51.280]  steal the primaries from him and they did steal it from bernie sanders unfortunately
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:57.040]  so donald trump is announcing on his official website an area for people to organize and
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:03.720]  get ready to be poll watchers and also be exit pollers to document who's actually voting
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:10.240]  for who because here's the big secret donald trump is doing his own internal polling with
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:16.880]  some of the top bipartisan pollers in the country he wants real polls not spend polls
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:21.960]  where roiders samples 15 percent more democrats to claim hillary 15 points ahead i mean this
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:26.600]  is ridiculous there's all sorts of fraud they're gaming google they're not listing him as a presidential
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:31.800]  candidate they're trying to rig the debates i mean we've seen the incredible scams and
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:36.520]  trump's not going along with it he is up front calling it out calling for local law enforcement
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:41.200]  to watch for it calling for poll watchers to watch and calling for exit polls which
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.360]  have historically been three to five percent margin of error which is incredibly accurate
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:51.680]  so he's announcing hey i've got my own internal polling showing i'm ahead in ohio by seven
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:57.760]  points showing i'm ahead in pennsylvania by about ten points showing i'm ahead in florida
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:05.200]  in some internal polls by 15 and these are real random polls showing in some polls trump
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:10.720]  is three points ahead in california margin of error dead heat instead the democrats are
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:15.960]  so arrogant they're claiming with their fake polls he's going to lose georgia he's going
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:24.720]  to lose texas he's going to lose utah ladies and gentlemen internal polls not just by the
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:32.480]  trump campaign but by other major institutions show trump on average seven points ahead in
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:39.200]  basically uh california strongholds for the democrats new york that's why they are crapping
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:44.200]  their pants if trump was so far behind in all these so-called polls when just two weeks
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:49.080]  ago he was ten points ahead before they changed the methodology why would they be panicking
[1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:53.640]  and saying he's dropping out and saying his wife's a prostitute and saying he's an illegal
[1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:58.440]  alien and all this crap they've made up they're doing it because they're panicking because
[1:52:58.440 --> 1:53:05.520]  it's hard to steal a landslide election and they know trump is aware of the fact that
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:10.680]  the ap and five other media outlets called california for standards a day before the
[1:53:10.680 --> 1:53:17.600]  election even had and it's the shadowy voter pool organization that will nationally try
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:21.920]  to put out the fake numbers coming up on november eight this is an incredible time to be alive
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:27.560]  because donald trump isn't one of these mummies like john mccain or mitt romney that's going
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:33.080]  to sit there and take a stolen election in fact it was in 2012 the trump came out and
[1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:39.080]  said there's no way i've talked to my political experts that mitt romney lost this mccain
[1:53:39.080 --> 1:53:45.200]  was hated in 2008 obama was the messiah was probably elected by even bigger numbers than
[1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:52.120]  we saw a lot of evidence there was some cheating at stand four years later obama in 2012 was
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:58.720]  very unpopular there were eight million more voters in 2012 than there were in 2008 but
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:04.760]  mitt romney got less votes than john mccain did and guess what donald trump called he
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:14.440]  called bs bravo sierra because that's what it is they admit the stock market's rig now
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:19.520]  they admit that the interest rates are rigged they admit the currency rates are rigged they
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:24.600]  admit all this stuff's rigged by insiders now and these globalists are stealing elections
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:29.440]  all over the world in some areas goldman sacks is putting its its corporate executives in
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:36.040]  in in italy and in places like greece without even having an election and going it's okay
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:42.320]  we install leaders now and then here comes donald trump saying excuse me excuse me we've
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:48.880]  been doing our own polling and we're way ahead in all these states and so if sirs hanky panky
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:54.920]  something went on here but i don't just believe donald trump i've gone and looked at the methodology
[1:54:54.920 --> 1:55:00.240]  you should too with all these polls you see sometimes you have to go five six pages back
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:05.640]  clicking to find their so-called methodology and you're going to see the frauds they're
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:10.320]  engaged in they're calling old phone numbers of known democratic voters they're calling
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:14.600]  independence in the vote independence when they're really democrats they're they're sampling
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:20.640]  10 to 15 points more of democrats in the overall poll to skew it this is so obvious they think
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:27.920]  we're stupid but here's the good news we're not good liberals real liberals like julien
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:33.360]  assange who actually have the hacked emails document that they stole the election from
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:39.200]  sanders and are planning it for trump and more is about to come out the truth is the
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.040]  whole world sees the evil that's grown here in the u.s. and as bad as the republican party
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:50.120]  is that's ally with the democrats the world sees that it's the democratic party that's
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:56.480]  really running the corrupt combine that's hijacked the station and the world not just
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.800]  americans are standing up and speaking out my final statement is this donald trump has
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.000]  had the courage to tell the truth the courage to not let them steal the republican nomination
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:13.080]  from him and the american people and now he sees evidence of fraud in these national polls
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:17.800]  compared to scientific polls that he and others are having conducted and he's saying we need
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:25.080]  to watch this and that he needs us in battleground states there's 10 of them at least arguably
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:31.840]  12 to be involved and organize with the trump campaign to legally and lawfully at a proper
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:38.240]  distance conduct exit polls so that we can actually document what's happening and don't
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:43.400]  forget we've got the democrats trying to legalize the illegals voting and trying to pass laws
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:47.120]  where there's no id most states don't make you have an id so they can engage in this
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:52.720]  fraud trump is absolutely right that we should always be vigilant about our elections we
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:57.480]  should always be vigilant about our government our founders told us over and over again that
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:03.500]  the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and anyone that tells us not to be vigilant
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:09.520]  needs to be looked at very very closely i'm alec shone signing off for info wars dot com
