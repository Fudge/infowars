[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.320]  it's already Tuesday the second day of June 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones we've
[00:28.320 --> 00:32.840]  got several very informative guests joining us today you can see who our
[00:32.840 --> 00:37.000]  guests are in the guest box at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com in the
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.280]  upper right hand corner but before we go there wow the whoppers that are in the
[00:43.280 --> 00:48.320]  news again today I was aware of the globalist agenda to roll this out but
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.720]  not this quick the new thing that's gonna get really hot and you're gonna be
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.960]  phobic if you don't like it now that they've moved on to their final phase
[00:59.960 --> 01:06.680]  with Caitlyn Jenner and the rest of it is becoming disabled by choice not
[01:06.680 --> 01:16.200]  chance trans-abled see they're able people feel like imposters in their
[01:16.200 --> 01:23.080]  fully working bodies they need to chop their arms and legs off I first saw a
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.280]  documentary probably 12 13 years ago at South by Southwest and I forget the
[01:27.280 --> 01:33.440]  name I got invited to a couple of showings as a media person and I went
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.240]  to it and it showed these gay men that had moved to Mexico where it was
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.520]  legal it wasn't legal here in the US and he chopped both his arms and legs off
[01:42.520 --> 01:46.000]  because he chopped one arm off that wasn't enough in the other arm and then
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.040]  one leg and then he wore a diaper and lived in a box and his lover took care
[01:52.040 --> 01:55.600]  of him and changed his diaper now of course that's completely degenerate
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.160]  completely perverted completely satanic completely and totally sick and
[02:01.160 --> 02:06.920]  they're gonna move and make you pay for it now if somebody thinks they're a
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.600]  woman a lot of the genetics are there there are studies that some people have
[02:13.600 --> 02:21.160]  a woman's brain in a man's body or a man's brain in a woman's body especially
[02:21.160 --> 02:25.200]  all the chemicals in utero early on in the development I mean some of that's
[02:25.200 --> 02:30.360]  going on and the hormones in the food it's on record that it confuses every
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.200]  other advanced form of life other mammals amphibians fish you name it so
[02:35.200 --> 02:41.800]  I'm not up here judging people but the agenda behind pushing all of this is the
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.760]  confused society and break everything down and make the natural systems the
[02:46.760 --> 02:53.960]  set default systems basically anathema and every time I mentioned there was
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.040]  another documentary I read about I think was in Texas monthly I didn't see it
[02:57.040 --> 03:04.480]  where people go and they chop fingers off arms off but also the big thing is
[03:04.480 --> 03:10.280]  they'll get molten lead pour on their backs to have big scarification or they
[03:10.280 --> 03:16.160]  like to get shot with 357 magnums in the article I read threw up under the
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.200]  chest but missing the heart to blow a huge shrapnel hole in the back and those
[03:21.200 --> 03:26.240]  are real sexy supposedly well now it's in the national post the biggest paper in
[03:26.240 --> 03:32.200]  Canada out of Ottawa can go read all about it today for those of you that
[03:32.200 --> 03:35.920]  think I'm making this stuff up this is the new big push and you're just not
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.480]  cool enough to understand how wonderful it is to be shot with 357 magnum or how
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.480]  cool the bullet holes are and you know what in a sick way I get that better than
[03:45.480 --> 03:49.440]  having arms and legs chopped off I mean I don't see that at any level other than
[03:49.440 --> 03:54.920]  cool to be taken care of and all this stuff and being helpless and I guess in
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.040]  a helpless population that's into that that's the religion that it'll become
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.440]  sanctified it'll become like a religion but yeah I've seen women that think you
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.960]  know scars all over guys are sexy and I guess in a way it's manly when
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.920]  somebody's got scars on them especially fighting scars or bullet wounds or
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.800]  whatever and an archetypal level in the tribe we see the old warriors with scars
[04:15.800 --> 04:20.200]  all over them is as tough or you could see a veteran with an armor leg blown
[04:20.200 --> 04:26.200]  off and you recognize that sacrifice instantly and at a primitive level you
[04:26.200 --> 04:29.840]  you feel an appreciation towards them but I'll assure you they don't like their
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.120]  armor leg being blown off and if they did something was wrong with them very
[04:35.120 --> 04:43.000]  sick very very sick but see that's because I'm a trans abled phobic and
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.080]  they're now as I predicted years ago coming out and calling it pedophobic
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.920]  Nambla is in courts in Australia the UK and other major countries and they've
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.840]  got judges agreeing with them that raping children is loving and that we
[04:55.840 --> 05:02.200]  are pedophobes the latest case of big pharma and government vaccine cover-up
[05:02.200 --> 05:05.520]  is brought to you by Cheryl Atkinson the former CBS reporter who was
[05:05.520 --> 05:08.840]  instrumental in outing the Justice Department's fast and furious program
[05:08.840 --> 05:13.000]  she writes government wipes recent vaccine injury data from website and
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.440]  March the health resources and service administration our HRSA removed more
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.920]  than a year's worth of vaccine injury data from its charts now concessions one
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.600]  by flu shot victims shows 42 when in actuality it's 88 total Tdap cases

[05:33.200 --> 05:39.240]  vaccine victims since 2006 shows 127 when actually it's 198 since 1988 the
[05:39.240 --> 05:42.640]  federal government has paid money to vaccine injured victims to the tune of
[05:42.640 --> 05:47.360]  3.1 billion dollars this money comes from fees of every vaccine dose given in
[05:47.360 --> 05:51.840]  this country which means you not big pharma is paying for all this safe and

[08:33.480 --> 08:40.440]  cool man is that you on the Facebook? Is there a Facebook page of you with a
[08:40.440 --> 08:43.440]  hammer and sickle? I don't think so.
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.440]  How do you get your abortions paid for? I pay for them.
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.440]  Upwards of 50. Really? Oh yeah.

[09:08.440 --> 09:10.440]  I'm being aggressive.
[09:10.440 --> 09:12.440]  I'm being aggressive.
[09:16.440 --> 09:20.440]  These are the guys that attack Alex Jones.
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.440]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.440]  This is a live transmission we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.440]  edition coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas in FEMA region 6.
[09:49.440 --> 09:55.440]  It was easier to control a million people literally it was easier to control a
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.440]  million people than physically to kill a million people.
[10:00.440 --> 10:09.440]  Today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[10:09.440 --> 10:25.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[10:40.440 --> 10:50.440]  I've been saying that this is an emergency transmission for 20 years on air.
[10:50.440 --> 10:56.440]  We've been broadcasting live from occupied former U.S. territory in FEMA region 6.
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.440]  People thought that was a little bit cheeky a little bit hokey a little bit
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.440]  corny a little bit over the top 20 years ago and they thought it was still a
[11:05.440 --> 11:10.440]  little bit of a joke 15 years ago but then since then they've gone from
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.440]  thinking maybe maybe we really are in occupied territory to saying absolutely
[11:15.440 --> 11:21.440]  Alex and it's worse than you say because the bottom has fallen out.
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.440]  There are no restraints anymore on tyranny other than our non-compliance and
[11:26.440 --> 11:30.440]  our voting with our dollars and those are still massive resistance points but
[11:30.440 --> 11:34.440]  when you talk about government and institutions the dam has broken at the
[11:34.440 --> 11:40.440]  federal level. The federal government is fully captured and fully run by
[11:40.440 --> 11:49.440]  foreign globalist interest. There are a few final citadels of reason.
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.440]  Like Senator Rand Paul and he is decried as an enemy of the state for
[11:54.440 --> 11:59.440]  standing with the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[11:59.440 --> 12:06.440]  And I come on air almost every day and I'm stunned now because basically
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.440]  everything I talked about 20 years ago has now happened and now what we're
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.440]  talking about is coming next in the next five to ten years will happen but by
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.440]  then we won't be on the air if they complete their takeover.
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.440]  I mean we know the enemy plan we know how hardcore it is we know how real it
[12:25.440 --> 12:32.440]  is and I just wish the general public knew how much peril they were in.
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.440]  I mean we got really bad people getting control who premeditatedly plan to
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.440]  carry out scientific wickedness because that's who they are.
[12:43.440 --> 12:46.440]  Let me just give you the headlines and we'll see if I can control myself.
[12:46.440 --> 12:49.440]  I've never been able to do this. Back when I was first on air 20 years ago I
[12:49.440 --> 12:52.440]  could go through all the headlines and just read them but it's becoming
[12:52.440 --> 12:56.440]  neuroses where I just cannot just hit the headline and then go back over and I
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.440]  have to just hit four or five stories and then stop on one.
[12:59.440 --> 13:02.440]  It's like the owl and the old Tootsie Roll commercials.
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.440]  Can we find that? How many? You go to the wise old owl to find out how many
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.440]  licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll and this is how many licks
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.440]  does it take Mr. Owl? He says let me see. One, two, three, punch, three.
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.440]  It's just too hard not to bite but this is why I'm freaked out every time.
[13:22.440 --> 13:27.440]  Mr. Turtle, how many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
[13:27.440 --> 13:31.440]  He never made it without biting. Ask Mr. Owl.
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.440]  Mr. Owl, how many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
[13:36.440 --> 13:43.440]  Let's find out. One, two, three, three.
[13:43.440 --> 13:48.440]  How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
[13:48.440 --> 13:51.440]  The world may never know.
[13:51.440 --> 13:54.440]  That's right but today is the day.
[13:54.440 --> 14:01.440]  I'm going to read at least 50 news headlines without biting.
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.440]  Associated Press.
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.440]  FBI behind mysterious surveillance aircraft over U.S. cities.
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.440]  Salon. Continued bulk data collection by NSA.
[14:16.440 --> 14:21.440]  It's part of Rand Paul's white privilege racism.
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.440]  It's hard not to comment on that one.
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.440]  Cultural cleansing of Christian males. Pat Buchanan.
[14:30.440 --> 14:36.440]  Video Muslims prefer Sharia when blasphemy laws in the U.S.
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.440]  and the United States.
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.440]  Bilderberg 2015, elites prepare for nuclear and economic devastation.
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.440]  Special report, infowars.com. Video, that's coming up.
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.440]  Rule by the corporations, TTIP, the Corporate Empowerment Act.
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.440]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[14:58.440 --> 15:05.440]  Hacked emails expose George Soros as Ukraine Puppet Master.
[15:05.440 --> 15:10.440]  Florida court rules off the grid living illegal.
[15:10.440 --> 15:15.440]  Main takes major step towards removing concealed weapons permit mandate.
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.440]  Liberals worship Caitlyn Jenner as transgender goddess.
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.440]  Cult-like adulation is downright creepy.
[15:23.440 --> 15:25.440]  Cult's the word.
[15:25.440 --> 15:28.440]  Obama prepares to restrict guns outside of law.
[15:28.440 --> 15:31.440]  Make Sturconian announcement.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.440]  Trendies ready for ultimate wearable.
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.440]  Chip implanted in their skin used for payments.
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.440]  All being announced.
[15:43.440 --> 15:48.440]  U.S. delivers 2,000 rockets for Iraq but holds half back.
[15:48.440 --> 15:54.440]  Obama, I will never engage in politics in which I'm trying to divide people.
[15:54.440 --> 15:57.440]  Oh, that's funny. That's a good one.
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.440]  You've never been at war in East Asia either, right? Big brother loves me.
[16:02.440 --> 16:05.440]  Double plus good.
[16:05.440 --> 16:09.440]  Let me just stop right there on that stack.
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.440]  Vince Vaughn is as pro-gun as it gets.
[16:13.440 --> 16:19.440]  Makes powerful announcements. Will be targeted.
[16:19.440 --> 16:26.440]  Teachers complain chaos reigns at St. Paul's schools spend millions on white privilege training.
[16:26.440 --> 16:32.440]  Pentagon anthrax scandal spreads to Canada.
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.440]  They're mailing anthrax all over the place.
[16:35.440 --> 16:38.440]  They did it before back in 2001 on again.
[16:38.440 --> 16:41.440]  Does that count as biting into the Tootsie roll? Not exactly.
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.440]  How ABC World's News Tonight became a ratings winner.
[16:45.440 --> 16:47.440]  That's total spin. They've all plunged.
[16:47.440 --> 16:50.440]  It's just this is the turd that's floating at the top.
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.440]  Excuse my French but the allegory does fit, doesn't it?
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.440]  Sometimes the vulgar in the repertoire of the semantical lexicon
[16:58.440 --> 17:04.440]  is the proper colloquialism in the nomenclature to communicate the larger verbiage
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.440]  to the population as a whole.
[17:09.440 --> 17:15.440]  Study. Pain killers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicides.
[17:15.440 --> 17:17.440]  CBS News.
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.440]  Oh, another conspiracy theory comes true.
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.440]  Not brushing your teeth can lead to dementia and heart disease.
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.440]  That's been known forever but now more studies.
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.440]  That's just some of what we're going to be going over.
[17:34.440 --> 17:36.440]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance.
[17:36.440 --> 17:44.440]  Transabled people are like imposters in their fully working bodies
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.440]  and the new move, National Post, is you're going to pay for people to have their arms and legs chopped off
[17:49.440 --> 17:54.440]  and live in baskets and be pushed around by their perv deadies.
[17:54.440 --> 17:57.440]  Oh, of course, it's sexual nature.
[17:57.440 --> 18:02.440]  Continuing, we're going to break all of this down.
[18:02.440 --> 18:06.440]  Company launches a mood changing wearable that zaps brains.
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.440]  Well, that's the TV already does to you and this is a headline out of courts.
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.440]  We now spend more than eight hours a day consuming media.
[18:16.440 --> 18:20.440]  Google's project gets it right.
[18:20.440 --> 18:24.440]  New wearable genes, that ties into all that information.
[18:24.440 --> 18:31.440]  Ten years without a hurricane hitting, it's Florida's lucky streak about to end.
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.440]  Al Gore said we had record hurricanes last year even though we had the lowest amount since the National Weather Service
[18:36.440 --> 18:39.440]  said since 1960.
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.440]  Who cares if we didn't have any hurricanes last year that hit the U.S.?
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.440]  Al Gore said it was devastating. We had record amounts and he said the Antarctic melted.
[18:48.440 --> 18:53.440]  That matters. The largest ever recorded ice.
[18:53.440 --> 18:56.440]  How far the ice reaches and how thick it is.
[18:56.440 --> 18:58.440]  Doesn't matter. Al Gore controls reality.
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.440]  It's like when Winston's be told by O'Brien in 1984 when he's torturing him.
[19:02.440 --> 19:06.440]  He says, listen, don't think that we can't spend the laws of gravity with our mathematicians.
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.440]  It won't matter. We don't really do it. We'll torture you till you believe it.
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.440]  How many fingers am I holding up?
[19:13.440 --> 19:17.440]  Four. Tortures him. No, I'm not. How many? Five, ten, twelve, fifty.
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.440]  He goes, that's right. You will say I'm holding up what I tell you and you'll believe it.
[19:22.440 --> 19:25.440]  He holds up four fingers again.
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.440]  He tells him he sees five and he sees five.
[19:28.440 --> 19:36.440]  He goes, now I'm going to free you. Now you've been cured.
[19:36.440 --> 19:42.440]  Obama never said that Obamacare was free. He always said it would triple prices.
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.440]  That's right. That's right. And he always said there were death panels.
[19:46.440 --> 19:49.440]  That they were good for the old people and the veterans.
[19:49.440 --> 19:52.440]  Of course, he said none of that was true, of course it is, but it doesn't matter.
[19:52.440 --> 19:59.440]  We've got to learn to love Big B. Big B. Big Brother. I love you. Thank you, Obama.

[23:55.440 --> 24:15.440]  Come, comment, take it.
[24:15.440 --> 24:25.440]  Alright, earlier at the start of the broadcast, if you just joined us, I talked about a story out of the National Post, the big national paper of Canada out of Ottawa, their capital.
[24:25.440 --> 24:38.440]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled people, learn that term. Your children will be taught about it. They'll come to you and say they want their fingers and arms chopped off and legs chopped off. I'm not joking.
[24:38.440 --> 24:46.440]  And if you don't let them, the state will have a run and say that you're abusing your children and will take them from you. This is actually what I'm predicting 10 years from now, maybe even five.
[24:46.440 --> 25:02.440]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled people feel like imposters in their own fully working bodies. And it was about, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago, I don't buy tickets to South by Southwest, but I was invited to go down as media and see some of the films.
[25:02.440 --> 25:15.440]  So I just randomly had a pass I've been given and I went in to one that was about, I'm forgetting the name of it, but we were able to Google it and find it, a nugget porn.
[25:15.440 --> 25:21.440]  Basically, it's one of the terms used, but it's the people that have their arms and legs chopped off. I mean, you never stop.
[25:21.440 --> 25:32.440]  Then they usually commit suicide after that because they're into death, they're into being helpless, and it's a sexual perversion that comes out of the, quote, gay community, but nothing can be perversed out of the gay community.
[25:32.440 --> 25:48.440]  I'm sorry. So it's the new, wondrous thing. They also shoot each other with 357 magnums and blow big holes in each other and then try to mutilate the wounds so they're big and ugly and then do things with the wounds.
[25:48.440 --> 26:02.440]  But notice the rollout of it is it's a wonderful new thing. They're these poor victims and they just have the opposite of the syndrome where you can't feel your arms or your legs.
[26:02.440 --> 26:10.440]  Well, here they just don't feel connected to them. They just don't feel like they're part of their body. It's oppressing them and they're transabled by becoming disabled.
[26:10.440 --> 26:23.440]  They also for 20-something years have bug chasers, men who go around wanting to get HIV or hepatitis. And then you have the men that give it to them where men will go.
[26:23.440 --> 26:34.440]  I mean, you can read the Rolling Stone article about it and others and have like 50 guys line up and do, you know what, inside of them hoping to catch some diseases.
[26:34.440 --> 26:43.440]  And then if you don't like that and don't want your five-year-old taught about it, again, you hate the gay people. And this is where decadent collapsing societies go.
[26:43.440 --> 26:56.440]  And then they sell tolerance and then it never ends. So it goes on to say, becoming disabled by choice, not chance, transabled people feel like imposters in their fully working bodies.
[26:56.440 --> 27:05.440]  Again, parental discretion is advised. This is part of the Humanities series to learn the wonderful humanities.
[27:05.440 --> 27:14.440]  When he cut off his right arm, very sharp power tool, a man who now calls himself one-handed Jason, let everyone believe it was an accident.
[27:14.440 --> 27:20.440]  But he had for months tried different means of cutting or crushing the limb that never quite felt like his own.
[27:20.440 --> 27:29.440]  Training himself on first stage so he wouldn't bleed to death, even practicing on animal parts sourced from a butcher.
[27:29.440 --> 27:38.440]  So see, you're not Jeffrey Dahmer asked, no, you're an artist. My goal was to get the job done with no hope of reconstructing or reattaching.
[27:38.440 --> 27:44.440]  So you should have gone and helped people in charity. You should have gone and climbed mountains. You should have joined a boxing club.
[27:44.440 --> 27:52.440]  But no, how much you want to bet this guy mommy did everything for him? My goal was to get the job done and it goes into him.
[27:52.440 --> 27:59.440]  It's the dark side of rights inflation. Why activists should reject the impulse to frame all grievances as human rights.
[27:59.440 --> 28:06.440]  And that's because they are now pushing it as a right in Germany.
[28:06.440 --> 28:15.440]  East German sex spies to negate and crack everything you need to know about Canada's scandalous history and then it breaks it all down.
[28:15.440 --> 28:26.440]  It says his goal was to become disabled. Now, they're rolling out a QTC case for you and then posing it like should this be a new right and a new cool thing we pay for?
[28:26.440 --> 28:34.440]  Like sex changes. Hey, you want to get a sex change? That's your issue. I shouldn't have to pay for your elective medical procedures.
[28:34.440 --> 28:43.440]  Like a nose job. I don't want to pay for your daughter's nose job because she wants to look like a Barbie doll and wants to chop her noble nose off.
[28:43.440 --> 28:53.440]  Understand? Oh my gosh, you hate women. No, I don't. I'm sick of paying for everything.
[28:53.440 --> 29:07.440]  Come back from break, Matt. Here in the office, I was back in the back having a debates with folks saying no. This is not something where people just don't recognize their body parts.
[29:07.440 --> 29:17.440]  That's the cover. This is actually a sicko movement that's in the mutilation is generally sexually connected.
[29:17.440 --> 29:23.440]  And Matt goes, oh yeah, I knew guys going to college. They were into nugget porn. I went, that's right.
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.440]  That's how the people make money on the side that are when you live in a box with your arms and legs cut off.
[29:27.440 --> 29:34.440]  And your and your perv daddy, that's what they call him, I guess, comes over and does things to you and then puts diapers on you.
[29:34.440 --> 29:42.440]  And I'm sorry to talk like this, folks, but we're not going to let him roll this out up front. It's cute and fun to sell it to our kids just like they sell Prozac and Ritalin.
[29:42.440 --> 29:47.440]  We're going to destroy it up front.
[29:47.440 --> 29:58.440]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.440 --> 30:15.440]  It becomes more apparent every day that movie stars who don't swear allegiance to leftist dogma are targeted and in some cases blacklisted altogether.
[30:15.440 --> 30:21.440]  Does that mean you're not a liberal? The reporter asked to its downy responds. Are we promoting a movie?
[30:21.440 --> 30:29.440]  Then went on to assert that he is not a Republican or Democrat. Now, actor Vince Vaughn is in hot water for standing up for gun rights.
[30:29.440 --> 30:36.440]  It's not about duck hunting. It's about the ability of the individual. It's the same reason we have freedom of speech Vaughn said.
[30:36.440 --> 30:46.440]  And he's right. And he's not the only one. Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis and Carl Malone, to name a few, are also outspoken advocates for the Second Amendment.
[30:46.440 --> 30:53.440]  I know that standing up for individual rights isn't as trendy as saying men are misogynist from birth, but it is something we need nonetheless.
[30:53.440 --> 31:16.440]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.

[33:12.440 --> 33:20.440]  Tom Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.440 --> 33:34.440]  You probably have never heard me talk about nugget porn or trans-abled. That's not the name of it. By the people that practice it. That's the new politically correct term to push it.
[33:34.440 --> 33:51.440]  But we're covering it now because we have to because they're getting ready to roll it out worldwide as the new proversion. Because once they can destabilize your central nervous system to accept things that aren't natural, the globalists can push their other agendas once you don't have any morals or murring.
[33:51.440 --> 33:54.440]  This is a scientific takeover plan.
[33:54.440 --> 34:06.440]  Oh, you're just not cool. You don't like to chop your fingers and then your arm off and, you know, you don't think it's sexy to cook your own arm and eat it. That's also part of this whole genre.
[34:06.440 --> 34:12.440]  Out of Hellraiser. Out of Dante's Night Circle.
[34:12.440 --> 34:20.440]  But then they want you, and that's what the Canadian News is reporting on, the National Post, they want you to pay to have their arms and legs cut off.
[34:20.440 --> 34:26.440]  That way it's done properly and done by professionals.
[34:26.440 --> 34:33.440]  Now, in case you think I'm lying, as everyone I mentioned is people don't believe me, we'll put it on screen for TV viewers, Rolling Stone on Bug Chasers.
[34:33.440 --> 34:44.440]  Just type in men who are in search of death, cover story, Rolling Stone, 2003. I covered it 20 years ago.
[34:44.440 --> 34:53.440]  People who want to get HIV, who want to have solidarity with folks that have it, and then they get it and then they become givers.
[34:53.440 --> 35:01.440]  And people sign contracts so they can't be indicted because it's a felony to obviously give somebody HIV if you know you've got it and you don't tell them.
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.440]  It's like, please give me the gift. Oh, it's so trendy.
[35:05.440 --> 35:17.440]  This is what happened in every society that got decadent, where there was too much food, too much water, too much freedom, six societies formed that demand unlimited everything from the productive.
[35:17.440 --> 35:34.440]  And then the productive that, you know, women who never get tired of their husband, men who love their wives or love their girlfriends, people that, you know, I never get sick of a Dosecki's Lager and cheese enchiladas or fajitas.
[35:34.440 --> 35:47.440]  I know folks who are like, I got to go have escargot or I got to go have Karzoo Marzoo, rich people pay $1,000 a plate for in New York that's maggots and rotting cheese.
[35:47.440 --> 35:57.440]  I've been in New York restaurants when I've been up there and well-to-do folks have invited me out to dinner and I've seen Karzoo Marzoo on the special little insert.
[35:57.440 --> 36:10.440]  By the way, they got illegal stuff in New York that's human bones out of catacombs that they fly in out of Italy, the mafia does, I forget the name of it, and they boil it in a delicious soup.
[36:10.440 --> 36:16.440]  You know what? I don't think I'm going to have the human bone soup. You know what? I'm not going to have the maggot cheese.
[36:16.440 --> 36:22.440]  I think I'm going to have the veal piccata.
[36:22.440 --> 36:32.440]  And then to folks like, oh, that's a baby cow. How evil of you. The point is, see how the mindset is twisted or anything sick or degenerate is automatically elevated.
[36:32.440 --> 36:38.440]  Oh, you just don't get it. Oh, no, I get it. I get it.
[36:38.440 --> 36:46.440]  It's not like I live some repressed lifestyle growing up in Dallas, Texas in the 80s and 90s and then coming to Austin.
[36:46.440 --> 36:52.440]  It's not like I haven't been around the block. I understand all this stuff because I've seen people I've known that have gotten into it.
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.440]  It's like the drug culture, the self-destructive culture. That's what this is about.
[36:57.440 --> 37:03.440]  That's why gay men have the lowest life expectancy of anyone in the world.
[37:03.440 --> 37:10.440]  In the world. People say, oh, it's just not accepted. It's because they're not liked. No.
[37:10.440 --> 37:17.440]  It's because it's a nihilistic party culture on average. On average, it's destructive.
[37:17.440 --> 37:24.440]  And I'm not here judging anybody. You don't freak me out. Two guys together.
[37:24.440 --> 37:31.440]  It's that I know that it's unhealthy in the spectrum.
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.440]  Now, are people that are into that lifestyle on average, higher IQs? Do they create a lot of stuff? Absolutely.
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.440]  Is there some nice things about that whole destructive culture?
[37:41.440 --> 37:47.440]  Certainly, it has some manifestations that are positive, but in the whole, no.
[37:47.440 --> 37:52.440]  Alone, mean, treating each other badly.
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.440]  Incredible promiscuity. It is death.
[37:57.440 --> 38:01.440]  The wages of sin are death. What was that headline from Rolling Stone?
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.440]  In search of death.
[38:07.440 --> 38:18.440]  In search of death, wanting to get HIV, wanting to get hepatitis, wanting to chop your arms and legs off, wanting to live 20 years.
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.440]  I was reading this one article about one of these guys living in a box.
[38:22.440 --> 38:33.440]  They'll be walled off in a box except when their owner shows up to change them and feed them and rape them and all the rest of it.
[38:33.440 --> 38:39.440]  And then usually the abuse gets bad when they'll be left for days and then they beg and wiggle around in their own excrement.
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.440]  And I'm sorry to be gross, but let's just get all this out in the open and then beg to be taken care of.
[38:44.440 --> 38:56.440]  Suddenly, their lover, close quote, leaves them to die with flies all over them in their closet, in their basket, in their cardboard box.
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.440]  And now taxpayers, just like I've got to pay for abortions if I live in Travis County, Austin, Texas,
[39:02.440 --> 39:11.440]  chopping babies up is liberal and trendy. Well, now chopping your own arms and legs off is trendy.
[39:11.440 --> 39:18.440]  So if you want to know what's hot at UT or what's the big deal that college is around the country, let's bring Matt on.
[39:18.440 --> 39:23.440]  I recently graduated from college, worked in radio and TV, works here in our office.
[39:23.440 --> 39:26.440]  And I was having an argument back there explaining that this is not really an argument.
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.440]  I was saying, no, the media's shelling this is they just don't like their limbs.
[39:30.440 --> 39:40.440]  In the main line, where this came from is homosexual men wanting to hurt their bodies and wanting to catch HIV and wanting to commit suicide
[39:40.440 --> 39:46.440]  and wanting to be hurt. And it's incredible. It's mentally ill.
[39:46.440 --> 39:52.440]  I mean, if a heterosexual went out and sort of hacking themselves with a hatchet, they'd be thrown in a mental institution and should be.
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.440]  But no, no, no, no. When an artist does it, you know, Vincent Van Gogh was insane, folks.
[39:59.440 --> 40:07.440]  Probably had lead and mercury poisoning when he cut his ear off and gave it to the prostitute for payment because she wouldn't give him anymore.
[40:07.440 --> 40:15.440]  He was in love with her. And you can call that romantic, but it was still mental illness to take a razor blade and chop his ear off.
[40:15.440 --> 40:23.440]  Was he a genius? Absolutely. Was he mentally ill? Absolutely.
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.440]  Matt, tell us about Nugget porn.
[40:27.440 --> 40:37.440]  Well, you know, once you get into Nugget porn, there's really no going back. Or at least I hear.
[40:37.440 --> 40:43.440]  But again, none of this exists. We're just being hateful without getting into too much to tell what we have to expose.
[40:43.440 --> 40:46.440]  So folks know what to look out for out there as this is being pushed.
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.440]  What do you make of them rolling it out in the news that it's the new cute, cool thing to do?
[40:51.440 --> 40:59.440]  Well, I don't know what to say other than it's a great conversation starter.
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.440]  Have you ever seen Nugget porn?
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.440]  Can I admit that on there?
[41:05.440 --> 41:08.440]  If you want to tell the truth or don't, I mean, you told me earlier you haven't.
[41:08.440 --> 41:22.440]  No, it was a big joke, but it is a great conversation starter. People think you're very progressive and Nuggets are people too. And so they should be admired.
[41:22.440 --> 41:28.440]  OK, so you're being serious. Describe what university you were going to and the worship of the Nuggets.
[41:28.440 --> 41:40.440]  So up at Illinois State, you can catch my roommates or I running around just, you know, messing with people. But yeah, it is a real thing.
[41:40.440 --> 41:43.440]  And it is kind of sick.
[41:43.440 --> 41:47.440]  Yeah, you guys were just joking about it because it was or they were talking about because it was sick, you told me.
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.440]  But there were folks that were into it.
[41:49.440 --> 41:56.440]  And are you serious that folks were saying this was in the trendy circles, something that was to be admired?
[41:56.440 --> 42:01.440]  I guess it's called a nugget because there's no arms or legs. It's more like a snail.
[42:01.440 --> 42:12.440]  Yeah, it's a it's a sick slang term and you can find it on answers.com. I'm searching for it right now.
[42:12.440 --> 42:21.440]  Well, the issue here is this is real. How prevalent was the discussion or the viewing, if you know, of Nugget porn?
[42:21.440 --> 42:28.440]  It's obviously got a niche. It's a pretty well known name and it's right here on answers.
[42:28.440 --> 42:37.440]  And so they're saying nugget porn is when a person has no legs or arms and nugget and the porn but is self explanatory.
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.440]  It generally very disturbing seeing women of such disability put through such things.
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.440]  They are normally forced to take part in in these films.
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.440]  Yeah, it's basically horrible rape porn in in in my view from I've never seen it because I will not look at such things.
[42:52.440 --> 42:54.440]  That it's about people that want to see oppression.
[42:54.440 --> 43:00.440]  Another big sexy thing that we covered a few years ago, according to these people, is the torture of animals.
[43:00.440 --> 43:05.440]  Beautiful women stomping on kitty cats stomping on puppies, sometimes stomping their brains out.
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.440]  I will not watch it, but I've read the criminal reports of folks indicted for doing it to make the porn.
[43:11.440 --> 43:15.440]  In fact, guys, will you look up what the name of torturing animals and porn is?
[43:15.440 --> 43:17.440]  But it's also super trendy.
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.440]  And the liberals say this should be accepted when it's sexual because it's a form of art.
[43:21.440 --> 43:24.440]  And again, I guess that would be torture animal foe.
[43:24.440 --> 43:30.440]  I'm against raping children, so that would be that'd be a pedofobe.
[43:30.440 --> 43:38.440]  And I guess if you're against paying for or having people to chop their arms and legs off, I am a trans-abled foe.
[43:38.440 --> 43:44.440]  Would you say that you're a trans-abled foe or a nugget foe, Matt?
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.440]  Yeah, I'm not really into that. That kind of freaks me out.
[43:48.440 --> 43:53.440]  All right. Well, anything else you'd like, but I mean, you're serious that up there where you went to college,
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.440]  there were some people that actually were like, what, don't you dare joke about this?
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.440]  This is super elegant. Or were you joking?
[44:00.440 --> 44:06.440]  It was a joke to us, but other people reacted a lot of different ways.
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.440]  There were people who, you know, accepted it.
[44:09.440 --> 44:15.440]  There are people who got freaked out and would just drop the conversation right there and leave.
[44:15.440 --> 44:18.440]  Do you want to pay to have someone's arms and legs chopped off?
[44:18.440 --> 44:22.440]  How are my tax dollars going to that?
[44:22.440 --> 44:24.440]  They are pushing to have people pay for it.
[44:24.440 --> 44:25.440]  That blows my mind.
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.440]  Oh, it's makers of crush porn videos in Philippines sentenced to life in prison.
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.440]  There you go.
[44:30.440 --> 44:34.440]  Crush porn, a tiny kitty or puppy. You kill it.
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.440]  And, you know, we ran into those commies. They were just like, I kill my kids. I love it.
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.440]  It's like this. I can hurt little things. I've got power. There's nothing you can do.
[44:44.440 --> 44:51.440]  That might be a good question for them. If they know anything about nugget porn, they might.
[44:51.440 --> 44:54.440]  Who knows? They're such wonderful students of history. Who knows?
[44:54.440 --> 44:57.440]  All right. Thank you, Matt.
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.440]  Nugget porn, crush porn.
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.440]  And again, folks, fighting this almost promotes it.
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.440]  But I've told you there's stuff a lot worse than what we talk about on air. That's some of it.
[45:10.440 --> 45:12.440]  And then it just gets worse.
[45:12.440 --> 45:14.440]  They've had famous cases in Europe.
[45:14.440 --> 45:21.440]  I'll have Watson run a new article just boiling it all down in England, in France, in the Netherlands, in Finland,
[45:21.440 --> 45:27.440]  in just all those countries where they'll find a dungeon under some police chief's house, you know,
[45:27.440 --> 45:34.440]  with 18 skeletons of two-year-olds in it and some two- and three-year-olds in cages that weigh one-half what they should
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.440]  and satanic pentagrams. I mean, you know, it's just that's who runs things, okay?
[45:40.440 --> 45:47.440]  And then you look over here with all the pedophiles in Congress. This is what they're into.
[45:47.440 --> 45:52.440]  They look at Marilyn Monroe and she's disgusting.
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.440]  And they think we're bad because we like Marilyn Monroe.
[45:57.440 --> 46:06.440]  They look at a horse or a dismembered body or a child or a dead animal,
[46:06.440 --> 46:12.440]  and they see beauty because they are demons.
[46:12.440 --> 46:22.440]  The Prince of El, best friends with the Prince of Wales, highest level security clearance in the royal family,
[46:22.440 --> 46:30.440]  had necrophilic sex in the hospitals with the dead children and had a secret torture area for the little girls in the charity he ran.
[46:30.440 --> 46:37.440]  And while he raped them, he would tell them that Satan was going to inhabit them and suck their soul.
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.440]  And now they've declared national security because they're beginning to find the dead bodies.
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.440]  That's who's coming for you when they get your guns. That's who wants full control.
[46:46.440 --> 46:50.440]  And once they get a tyranny in place, they will do it to everybody.
[46:50.440 --> 46:55.440]  They want to pull down everything that's good. They want to destroy basic human liberty.
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.440]  They want to overturn everything wholesome. They are coming. They are coming.
[47:00.440 --> 47:08.440]  You think it's bad? You've seen nothing. This is only the enemy scouts we've already run into.
[47:08.440 --> 47:14.440]  We haven't even been hit by the center of their vanguard.
[47:14.440 --> 47:18.440]  And they all have that crazed look of Savelle. You want to know how he looks?
[47:18.440 --> 47:21.440]  You're watching us on TV. You can put that headline back up there.
[47:21.440 --> 47:28.440]  Celebrities' arrests could soar after horrified police discovered Jimmy Savelle's secret lair.
[47:28.440 --> 47:31.440]  And you see that look in his face? That's the trendy liberal.
[47:31.440 --> 47:41.440]  Hi. Oh, yes. I want to help kids like the Sandusky Foundation with trouble little boys and girls.
[47:41.440 --> 47:50.440]  And of course Savelle was a big anti-gun guy and a big liberal because he really wants to help you and your family.
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.440]  What does Melissa Harris Perry say on MSNBC? Your kids belong to us.
[47:56.440 --> 48:03.440]  I'll get you and your little dog, too.
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.440]  And when I look at these people, I can see them. I know who they are.
[48:07.440 --> 48:15.440]  And they've got giant masters of good police, good social workers, good people who are compartmentalized and are so good.
[48:15.440 --> 48:25.440]  They can't recognize what they're right next to. And they are just like, just like the 18, 17-year-old women
[48:25.440 --> 48:32.440]  that would see the non-threatening Ted Bundy in his gray suit and his yellow Volkswagen,
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.440]  going, hey, let's go have some ice cream. Let's go see a movie.
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.440]  You sure are a beautiful young lady.
[48:40.440 --> 48:43.440]  The back of his mind, I'm going to torture her for a month straight.
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.440]  I'm going to bite chunks out of her. I'm going to make her beg for her mommy and daddy are never coming.
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.440]  That's the music I like to hear.
[48:51.440 --> 48:57.440]  So you just remember that I've studied these psychopaths. I know them and I'm the opposite of them.
[48:57.440 --> 49:04.440]  I am a sheepdog, 110%. I'm looking for other sheepdogs that want to take these people on and want to get in there politically with these wolves.
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.440]  And we will tear them down. We will destroy them.
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.440]  I have an instinct to nurture and build up the innocent. I have an instinct to smash the brains out of perverts,
[49:13.440 --> 49:20.440]  smash the brains out of pedophiles, kick their teeth and drag them down, bring them low, throw them into the sea.
[49:20.440 --> 49:26.440]  Burden's too good for them. Hanging's too good for them.
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.440]  According to a scene out of heavy metal, they should be cornered into little pieces and buried alive.
[49:32.440 --> 49:38.440]  And if you don't have that instinct to hate predators that want to feed on innocent, you're not alive.
[49:38.440 --> 49:45.440]  Now, before I go any further, we're going to come back from breaking shift gears into world news,
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.440]  the attack on the Second Amendment, bombshell news on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[49:50.440 --> 49:56.440]  But briefly, when I announced that we're selling out of survival shield, Nacin Ionix II with the incredible properties
[49:56.440 --> 50:03.440]  and just it's the good halogen and just what it does is a game changer in my body. I know it's amazing.
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.440]  Just a chain reaction. You got to go through the detox first though. It hits most people in two weeks.
[50:08.440 --> 50:13.440]  It's hardcore. Hardcore, the amount of energy it's given me. You name it.
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.440]  Infowarslife.com. And I started announcing we had a limited supply. I thought it'd take three weeks to sell out.
[50:18.440 --> 50:24.440]  At current rates, it's going to sell out in about five, six days. Infowarslife.com.
[50:24.440 --> 50:29.440]  We've never sold out of X2. We sold out of original survival shield a couple times.
[50:29.440 --> 50:38.440]  The problem is that the process is really hard to do because it's pure to put into gas form and then inject it into the organic palm oil.
[50:38.440 --> 50:47.440]  And we are running low on the supply of crystals itself. It could be a few months till we get more and then after that, who knows.
[50:47.440 --> 50:52.440]  I hate to even announce that because it's a good selling issue up front, but it's true we're running out.
[50:52.440 --> 50:58.440]  So mid-term, long-term, we could never have it again potentially. Infowarslife.com.
[50:58.440 --> 51:04.440]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[51:04.440 --> 51:10.440]  And I go, Doug, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting. ISIS is already here.
[51:10.440 --> 51:17.440]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me. If they don't know ISIS as you already, they got no clue. I'm taking care of myself.
[51:17.440 --> 51:23.440]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30-shot magazines, great prices. They've even got the Hillary Special.
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.440]  Guns80.com. That's 844-2Guns80Guns80.com.

[51:58.440 --> 52:05.440]  It's very easy to be a criminal. All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[52:05.440 --> 52:11.440]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[52:11.440 --> 52:16.440]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[52:16.440 --> 52:22.440]  A phone line. You shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[52:22.440 --> 52:26.440]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.440]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[53:27.440 --> 53:36.440]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve us debt.
[53:36.440 --> 53:43.440]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[53:43.440 --> 53:50.440]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[54:10.440 --> 54:20.440]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central, we're here live. You see, once I get into subjects like this, so people understand what we're fighting.
[54:20.440 --> 54:28.440]  Just like abortion leads to killing babies, killing the handicapped, killing old people, putting veterans on don't treat list.
[54:28.440 --> 54:34.440]  This all comes out of Snuff porn. And I should have said that at the first. Joe Jennings said this all comes out of Snuff porn.
[54:34.440 --> 54:45.440]  Snuff porn has been going on for 100 years since film started. And it's where men, women, children are killed on tape. Hollywood gets busted all the time importing it out of Eastern Europe.
[54:45.440 --> 54:56.440]  It's kept very, very quiet. But the FBI does bust people. And the descriptions of Snuff porn in a national Italian TV piece that came out a few years ago was incredible.
[54:56.440 --> 55:04.440]  By the way, they fired both the reporters that put it out. It was true. They were paying upwards of $50,000 per VHS tape. That's how it was put on there.
[55:04.440 --> 55:10.440]  Non-digital of two-year-olds in Russia being raped and their heads being blown off.
[55:10.440 --> 55:16.440]  And look, I don't normally talk about stuff like this, but it's in the news. People need to know.
[55:16.440 --> 55:22.440]  And then Joe Biggs ran up here and said the back office told him he had to come tell the story because they're back there watching and listening right now.
[55:22.440 --> 55:32.440]  Joe Biggs ran into this. And that's where Crush porn comes from, herding dogs, herding cats. You get arrested for that, so people do it with rats and mice.
[55:32.440 --> 55:43.440]  And wait till Joe Biggs tells the story. I meant to shift gears into other news, but we're putting bookends on this right now to understand the type of just abject evil being pushed.
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.440]  I mean, what's next? Joe Biggs.
[55:47.440 --> 55:57.440]  Yeah, so I had a friend back in Charlie's, one of my best buds. He started dating this new girl, really attractive lady, but none of us knew what she did.
[55:57.440 --> 56:08.440]  It was really mysterious. And we kept asking her, she wouldn't say, well, one day we were at a party and I guess she had had a few shots and decided to open up.
[56:08.440 --> 56:19.440]  And I said, well, what is it that you do? And she goes, well, I get paid to wear lingerie, have a robe over the top, then we get a webcam, film it.
[56:19.440 --> 56:32.440]  I stripped down and I wear high heels and I squash cockroaches, goldfish, mice, rats, and it's a fetish porn called Crush porn.
[56:32.440 --> 56:39.440]  Which is really just people that want to see snuff films, but can't pay for it. And again, this is what evil is, folks.
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.440]  This is what's running our Congress. This is why they're doing such evil stuff.
[56:43.440 --> 56:49.440]  That's why they're doing all these terrible anti-human things because these are people that have lost their souls.
[56:49.440 --> 56:52.440]  And Joe, you were telling me that she was incredibly beautiful.
[56:52.440 --> 57:05.440]  What they're into is the destruction of innocence, taking God's creation, a beautiful woman that should be a wife, a mother, and turning her into a killer of innocence, taking a mother, getting her to kill her babies.
[57:05.440 --> 57:07.440]  That's what this is all about.
[57:07.440 --> 57:16.440]  Yeah, she only had to do it a few nights a week. I mean, she had enough money to have a, you know, a Mercedes Benz and a BMW and a nice house.
[57:16.440 --> 57:29.440]  And, you know, we started noticing something was up when her feet really smelled horrible and it was from all those, you know, animals and rats and bugs that she was squashing like butterflies out of control.
[57:29.440 --> 57:34.440]  I can never look at her the same again.
[57:34.440 --> 57:40.440]  And someone actually pays for that to wash it. They actually get off on that.
[57:40.440 --> 57:47.440]  I tell you, it's unbelievable. Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[57:47.440 --> 57:54.440]  Again, I mentioned this mutilation porn stuff a long time ago and they have news articles saying I made it up.
[57:54.440 --> 58:01.440]  Kind of like I mentioned, the chemicals they put in the water make people become basically multi-sexual by design and give you cancer.
[58:01.440 --> 58:03.440]  That's all mainstream news now.
[58:03.440 --> 58:14.440]  This is all planned, folks, and it's just pure evil. It's all about feeding the desires of wicked, twisted, degenerate, aberrant people.
[58:14.440 --> 58:22.440]  And that's why they want to make us basically accept what they're doing. That's their ultimate fetish, is conquering us.
[58:22.440 --> 58:25.440]  This is scum of the earth conquering us.
[58:25.440 --> 58:33.440]  I mean, Rand Paul came out and said we shouldn't be 1984 and have illegal spying and they had an FBI informant in Ceylon writing articles saying he's racist
[58:33.440 --> 58:40.440]  because we should all be spied on and have no rights to unify us under tyranny is the ultimate liberality.
[58:40.440 --> 58:48.440]  See, they're sick cults of tyrants. They're filth. They love the aberrant nature of being spied on.
[58:48.440 --> 58:57.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars.com
[58:57.440 --> 59:04.440]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[59:04.440 --> 59:13.440]  So I refused. Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms.
[59:13.440 --> 59:21.440]  HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots, their listeners of the radio show.
[59:21.440 --> 59:29.440]  And they want to support the broadcast. It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones, go to their website, HD firearms.com
[59:29.440 --> 59:35.440]  buy right off their website and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice. You can pick it up at the gun show.
[59:35.440 --> 59:48.440]  You can pick it up at the local sporting goods store. Whatever you do, get your head down firearm today. The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms, HD firearms.com
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:22.440]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:29.440]  Alright, if you just joined us, we're segueing out of the nightmare first hour that I don't like covering but had to be covered.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:38.440]  The media now is pushing articles, the National Post and others. The new trendiness is to have your arms and legs cut off and have taxpayers pay for it.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:47.440]  So that's the next thing they're pushing. I mean, why are you against it? These people are plagued by their arms and legs and you're just not cool enough to understand it.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:01:00.440]  Meanwhile, I want to come back in the next longer segment and get into several very important video clips that I have here dealing with a situation in the South China Sea.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:09.440]  Obama says I will never engage in politics in which I'm trying to divide people. That is, of course, another inverse satanic statement by the devil.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:19.440]  You know, they say demons talk backwards. That's what all this is. It's hilarious. President Obama sternly warns China about South China Sea expansion.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:31.440]  US pipeline records China's artificial islands. China threatens. That happened last week, but now we have the audio of the encounter. We're going to play some of that.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:45.440]  We're going to get into what's happening on Capitol Hill in the aftermath of Senator Rand Paul's filibuster two days ago, exposing the Patriot Act and holding up its reauthorization,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:52.440]  which means they'll probably stay to terror attack now and say that it's his fault. He's even said that, basically, that they hope that happens.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:02:08.440]  Our own Wayne Madsen is up on Capitol Hill at the National Press Club, where Rand Paul and others are set, I guess it's happening right now, to talk about the 28 pages.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:21.440]  And how it senators have said he's having the press conference with former Senator Bob Graham, who's read the secret pages that Saudi Arabia bare minimum was quarterbacking the attack.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.440]  Our government stood down. That is over the top bombshell validates everything we said about it being an inside job.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:36.440]  I mean, it's an inside job. If I open the door to let a burglar in to rob the house, doesn't mean I'm the burglar. It means open the door.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:44.440]  I knew he was going to do it. I heard he was going to do it. And so I bought a bunch of extra stuff and got insurance on it knowing he was going to rob.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:52.440]  So I didn't get an insurance money. That's an inside job. And bare minimum, it is an inside job. We knew that day one.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:03:04.440]  Now, of course, from there, it gets into different agencies involved in the attacks, piggybacking bombs in the buildings on top of the attacks to then make sure they got the insurance money
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  and destroyed all the records that were in there. I mean, it goes on and on, but we're going to have Wayne Madsen is going to start joining us once a week.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.440]  I talked to Wayne yesterday. He does want to get on board with us.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:23.440]  So I'm going to start flying him around the country like I do Joe Beggs at least twice a month to different important events or investigative stories that we're working on.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:32.440]  And he'll be joining us once a week on the radio TV show and he'll be writing articles five days a week for info wars dot com.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.440]  He's a real hardcore journalist, former NSA officer, major whistleblower, really honored to have Wayne Madsen.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:45.440]  We're finalizing the plan this week. I'll be working with us five days a week full time Wayne Madsen on the info wars team.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:51.440]  But that's why I better not skip network breaks like I've already done today.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:04:07.440]  I better not not plug because it's expensive to fly Joe Beggs to Phoenix and to different cities around the country like Maryland.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:14.440]  It's expensive to send three reporters Paul Watson from England from Albion.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:22.440]  Rob, dude, Josh Owens from Texas are all going to Bilderberg. This is one of the most important Bilderbergs ever because they're discussing from our inside sources the future of World War Three.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.440]  They have a special report on that coming up as well after the break.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:34.440]  And we're going to be sending them there. I would love to go and see the Alps. It's in the Alps on the Swiss border.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.440]  I would love to go and be interviewed by the media and hang out in Europe, but I've just got too much to do here.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:51.440]  But now I've got the forces, the skeleton crew, but nevertheless the forces to really magnify our intel and warn the world and the public.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  So that's why it's important to go to infowarstore.com and fund our operation. We're getting great high quality products for prices.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:11.440]  Fresh off their victories against manspreading for which multiple people have already been arrested in places like New York, feminists are now setting their sights on the highest target possible, Almighty God.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:24.440]  The article, Feminist clergy wants Christians to refer to God as she breaks down how an activist group over in England, women in the church or watch, has already had success putting female bishops in the church.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.440]  But they didn't stop there. The chairperson for watch was quoted as saying,
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:36.440]  The reality is that in many churches up and down the country, something more than almost default male language about God is already being used.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440]  She told the Telegraph,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  Quietly, clergy are just talking about God as she, every now and then.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:52.440]  Keeping in mind that multiple times throughout the Bible, Jesus refers to God as his father, not his mother, his father.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.440]  You can find this and many other reports on infowars.com.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440]  hdfirearms.com
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.440]  of 1776 lives at head down firearms hdfirearms.com
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440]  Hey, how you doing? Good, brother.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:08.440]  Just recently start using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.440]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:21.440]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.440]  Into the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.440]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:38.440]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.440]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:48.440]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:57.440]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.440]  Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen will join us from Capitol Hill, the National Press Club,
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:32.440]  where Rand Paul, the senator and Senator Bob Graham, the former senator, are currently giving a speech
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  dealing with the 28 pages redacted from the 9-11 report that senators that have seen it, congressmen that have seen it,
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:46.440]  like Walter Jones, who's been on this show, Congressman Jones, says shows our government stood down on 9-11
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.440]  and that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked the attacks bare minimum. That makes 9-11 an inside job as we warned you,
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.440]  because our government knew bare minimum let it happen as the pretext to take American liberty.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  And now 15 years later, Al Qaeda is reborn as ISIS and has taken over much of the Middle East,
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.440]  being rewarded for a job well done on 9-11.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:15.440]  And Defense Intelligence leaked last week to Judicial Watch the fact that indeed our government's funding Al Qaeda
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:22.440]  and the Wahhabist arms, the Salafist, all out of Saudi Arabia, and this is a western backed takeover
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.440]  of the Middle East by jihadis to kill every Christian they find.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  Bombshell, intel, bottom of the hour.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.440]  Coming up, I want to get into feminist clergy, want Christians to refer to God as she.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  I'm going to tell you what's behind that. We're also going to get into this amazing news story that is so, so important
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:55.440]  out of CBS for something like 19.5% of Americans are on some type of anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.440]  Painkillers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicide.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  Also, Vince Vaughn, we knew he was a patriot, but now Vince Vaughn is his pro-gun as it gets.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.440]  And he came out in a GQ magazine and sounds like he's Alex Jones, so, or Ron Paul.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.440]  So, good job to Vince Vaughn.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:24.440]  I think he's got some good comedy movies as well, but I'll certainly next time I'm looking at films, you know, there on the Netflix or whatever.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  I'm not a big media consumer, but I do watch movies a few times a week.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.440]  I used to, I've been so busy, I haven't been lately, I'll definitely queue up a Vince Vaughn.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.440]  You vote with your dollars or you lose everything.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.440]  And that goes for this show and we appreciate you.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.440]  And that goes for supporting our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:56.440]  And as I was saying earlier, I'm going to send three reporters to Austria to the Alps, the Austrian Alps, to cover Bilderberg 2015.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.440]  That is one of the most important years ever.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.440]  This video report is up on infowars.com.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440]  We're going to tweet it out at Real Alex Jones.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.440]  Bilderberg 2015, prepare for global conflict.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.440]  Prepare for what could be World War III in their own words.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.440]  Bilderberg, at least prepare for nuclear war and global conflict.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.440]  The video is on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:25.440]  If you're a radio listener, you can simply watch the free feed at infowars.com forward slash show or share the YouTube video.

[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.440]  It's toxic at levels above that.

[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.440]  And that's the ace of spades when it comes to this card game of life.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.440]  But you gotta be willing to play that card and stick to your guns.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.440]  So infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:53.440]  I'm done ranting on that subject, but I should add briefly, before we go to this special report on Bilderberg, that it's bittersweet.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.440]  I've never, in the couple years we've had survival shield X2, deep earth crystal source, nascent iodine, the good halogen.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.440]  Just done amazing things for my glands, my health.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440]  You've heard the Ray reviews.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.440]  Try it out for yourself.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440]  Supports the broadcast.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:13.440]  Consult your physician first, because if you've already got a iodine deficiency, then it can be spectacular,
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.440]  including with detox once you get it in your body.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:24.440]  We found this source because it was hard to get the other clean source out of kelp and have it pass California standards.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:30.440]  That's why everybody else that has it can't pass California standards, basically, that are so high they're not meant to be able to be passed.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440]  Well, ours does in the test.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.440]  We have them on the website, infowarslife.com.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  So we found this other deep earth source, mined in the United States, between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.440]  The problem is, when these companies go in for this, they're usually going for helium or something else.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]  It's a byproduct.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.440]  It's very expensive to extract.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440]  And again, the website says 8,000 feet.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.440]  It's between 7 and 12.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.440]  We can just put that on there.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.440]  And it's just amazing.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440]  I mean, it's bright purple crystals.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440]  You put on a hot plate.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.440]  It turns purple gas and goes into the air.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440]  I mean, that's how magic this stuff is.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.440]  And we are running out of it.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]  We're not just running out of a current supply.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440]  We're running out of the crystals.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.440]  We'll probably end up getting another supply, but it's a big deal to jump through all the hoops.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:28.440]  infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139, 888-2533139.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  We have giant discounts when you get two packs, five packs, or 10 packs.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.440]  infowarslife.com, or 888-2533139.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  I'm going to stop belaboring that.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440]  All right.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.440]  Let's go to John Bowne's report.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.440]  Infowars reporter John Bowne reporting on some of the key intel we've gotten.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.440]  We do have sources very close to Bilderberg.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.440]  We do have a lot of their agenda already.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  We'll be publishing that ahead of our crew arriving.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  Again, Paul Watson, Rob Dube, and Josh Owens will all be in place there.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.440]  So we're sitting our news director there, as well as one of our best cameraman.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.440]  And Paul Watson, one of our best writers of our amazing team,
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  we're going to have massive coverage of this key Bilderberg, and here's why it's so important.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.440]  The Bilderberg Group will coalesce June 9th through the 14th in the Austrian mountains at the Inner Alpen Hotel.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:37.440]  How many of these instigators of widespread tyranny will be discussing their million-dollar safe bunkers between meetings,
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  as they hide like moles while their hellish plans are unleashed on the gullible masses?
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440]  It's called a panic rule.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440]  What?
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  It's a safe rule.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  Castles keep in many evil times.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  Ford concrete walls, varied phone line not connected to the house's main line, the virulent ventilation system,
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.440]  and a bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440]  What's to keep someone from prying open the door?
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  Steel. Very thick steel.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:09.440]  A decade ago, safe rooms would only have been of interest to A-list celebrities who wanted to protect against stalkers.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.440]  But they are now becoming popular with elites who wish to guard against potential civil unrest,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.440]  which could cause crime rates to skyrocket in the aftermath of an economic collapse.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:28.440]  According to a New York Times report, the typically 8 feet by 12 feet bulletproof rooms are an increasingly sought-after means of the elite feeling protected,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.440]  just as moats and armies protected them in centuries past.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.440]  Wealthy individuals, including foreigners who are more familiar with such stringent security measures,
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:45.440]  are having safe rooms installed to protect their personal possessions as well as their own physical safety against potential domestic disorder
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.440]  that could arise out of sudden economic collapse.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:56.440]  This huge disparity is not because of some flaw in capitalism or because of the Reagan tax cuts or even the greed of Wall Street.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.440]  The problem is central banks that are out of control,
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  printing money like no one ever imagined and have created a massive worldwide financial inflation.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:14.440]  And when you have a financial inflation, the people that own the stocks and the bonds get the windfall.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.440]  After 9-11, he got requests for one or two safe rooms a year,
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.440]  but that number has recently jumped to more than 20 rooms annually.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  Probably do about 25 this year, did about 21, 22 last year, but we're looking at possibly going up to maybe 30 the following year,
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440]  so we just see an increase every year.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.440]  The notion that the elite are making preparations for mass civil disorder is no conspiracy theory,
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.440]  fearing global unrest and the possibility of another major conflict.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.440]  Many members of the elite have been buying remote property and land in places like New Zealand.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.440]  A lot of very wealthy and powerful people are quite afraid right now.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.440]  They see us on an unstable trajectory. They don't see our political institutions being,
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.440]  which you might call representative, responsive in pulling things together.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.440]  Things are getting more and more dangerous as say, Ferguson, Missouri brings to bear.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.440]  Honestly, Johnson is president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking,
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  an organization founded and bankrolled by billionaire George Soros,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:16.440]  who himself is funding the very same movement aggravating the civil unrest, the Black Lives Matter movement.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:22.440]  These two men, Frederick Young and Philando Hunter, were sentenced on this day to life in prison without parole
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:28.440]  for robbing, torturing, murdering the two teens who had been in Detroit trying to buy drugs.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:33.440]  I'd like to say sorry to the families of Iona Jones, Michael Brown, Eric Gardner,
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.440]  and I want to apologize to them for not being able to get justice for their loved ones who was murdered in cold blood
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.440]  and in respect for the peaceful process. I want to say hands up, don't shoot, Black Lives Matter.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.440]  The risk of domestic disorder is also heightened by the fact that distrust in government and leadership
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.440]  in the United States and other Western countries continues to remain near historic lows.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:00.440]  Corruption, social alienation, and lack of community, all of which were contributing factors to the 2011 London riots
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.440]  are all creating a powder keg situation that could blow at any moment.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:11.440]  The United States government's inability to fund social programs could also lead to the seizure of private pension funds.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.440]  The creation of the Euro was all about not creating a strong Europe,
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:30.440]  but it was about making sure that each nation would no longer have control of its own fiscal fate.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:37.440]  That they would be stuck competing against each other by reducing services and provided by the government.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  So that is keeping your workforce. And he was very blunt about it, but that's the purpose of it.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:48.440]  It's not to make Europe stronger, it's to make the nations within Europe impotent.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.440]  And that was his philosophy.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.440]  And that's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT, Ross Perot was right, the race to the bottom,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.440]  and we got the SPP North American Union documents three years ago when judicial watched suit and got them,
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.440]  and they said they had all these corporate chiefs there at the governmental meeting
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.440]  telling the Secretary of State of Mexico, Canada, and the United States what to do,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:20.440]  and they said we're going to lower the US and Canada to the level of Mexico just as we've done with the Euro
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:26.440]  so there's nowhere to run, nowhere to compete, and now we're going to play nations off against each other
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:33.440]  all over the world, Asia, European Union, North American Union to basically get all the tax money for bankers
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.440]  as bailouts and take people's pension funds, and now we see Bloomberg reporting that federal regulators
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.440]  are preparing to take at least half of people's pensions in the US.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:52.440]  As real wages drop, it will also become increasingly harder to pacify younger generations via consumer culture.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:58.440]  Lifestyles built around the acquisition of products will become harder to maintain as the economic environment worsens.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:03.440]  These factors, when combined with further police brutality and a growing sense of injustice,
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.440]  almost guaranteed to cause more civil unrest over the next two years,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:16.440]  fulfilling economist Martin Armstrong's tradition that he seems political uprising will erupt by 2016 in the United States.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:22.440]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.440]  And that's from last night's nightly news. That's why it's so important to watch the nightly news.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:34.440]  It's always 30 minutes long. We're going to an hour later this month, full time, but some nights it's five hours long.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:44.440]  In fact, last Friday night, covering the Draw Muhammad contest in Phoenix, we were live for four and a half hours.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:52.440]  On election night, eight hours. So that's why it's important to be a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:59.440]  All right, we just skipped this network break. I want to say again, hi to all the stations and affiliates out there and the listeners.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:09.440]  Let me now go ahead and launch into this piece of news that I already mentioned, but I wanted to tell.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:16.440]  This is from CBS News. We have it linked on Infowars.com.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:29.440]  Just like we kept hammering the studies that were out there that fluoride sevenfold increase in bone cancer, brain damage, IQ reductions, fractures in bones, just you name it, Harvard studies and others.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.440]  We kept hammering because of lawsuits and other things. The feds have now said lower it by half and ban it in pesticide.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:47.440]  And we're just going to continue hammering the SSRIs and other anti-anxiety medications because as a family, they make people psychotic killers.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:55.440]  Not everybody, but a goodly percentage. Every mass shooter I've ever seen has been on one of these.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:02.440]  And as soon as I heard some guy was wandering around like a zombie a couple years ago and shot a cop for no reason in Wal-Mart,
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:08.440]  I said that guy was going to be probably on Xanax or something. It was Xanax.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:14.440]  Because you can take the stuff like that and go to bed and just wake up and basically sleepwalk.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:23.440]  But they'll never prosecute the companies. They'll always throw the zombie in prison as if that does anything.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:33.440]  Pain killers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicide, CBS Atlanta, for the first time ever. That is not true.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.440]  Scientists have linked prescription drugs that affect the central nervous system to an increased risk of committing homicide.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:49.440]  Is that why we forced about 12 years ago all Prozac derivative drugs to say it can cause psychotic breaks and make you kill people and commit suicide?
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.440]  It was known when they tried to approve it in the 70s and they couldn't.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:06.440]  European researchers found that people who were taking a class of tranquilizers called, and I can't pronounce this, benzodiazepines.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440]  Benzodiazepines.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:18.440]  Benzodiazepines were more likely to kill someone than those who were not taking these medicines, reports, live science.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:25.440]  Yeah, that's why Joe Biggs has told the story. I did some research and talked to other combat units and it happened to them as well.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:34.440]  But when they were on daily patrols getting blown up by IEDs every few weeks, getting shot at every day, killing people almost every day,
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.440]  they ordered them to take classic opiates.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.440]  And that's also to addict them and then claim their drug addicts later.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:49.440]  But I'd have Joe come in and tell you the story, but they knew it because it made them basically machines.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:56.440]  While compromising them, Elvis was ordered to go on speed when he was in the Army. That has been declassified.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  They would make him play so many shows, they said, listen, you will take this, you will do it.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  It's all part of the control. European researchers found that people who were taking a class of tranquilizers,
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.440]  those drugs are used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and panic disorders.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:20.440]  Panrelievers such as opioid medication C and anti-inflammatories were also found to increase a person's risk of homicide.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  I think that these chemical substances affect the impulse control of a person, said Dr. Jari Tillowan, lead author and the professor told Medical Daily.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.440]  The only surprising result was the painkillers also increased the risk.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  There has been one time since I was 18 years old that I have been in a fight.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  One time I got attacked by guys in a parking lot politically, but that was separate.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:55.440]  There's been one time where somebody kind of got in my face and I just grabbed him and started choking him up against the wall.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.440]  And that was when I partially dislocated my shoulder about 12 years ago.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:07.440]  And I was paking painkillers because I was just in so much pain and I was on painkillers at the time.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.440]  And I just had, it was like I was a zombie. I wasn't even on that much.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.440]  I'd driven to the grocery store, somebody snorted off to me, walked up and got in my face, and I just didn't even think.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.440]  I just grabbed him by the neck, put him up against the wall and was just squeezing their throat.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  And I was like, whoa, whoa.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:33.440]  I left. I think I, the person didn't call the cops. And I just thought, oh my gosh, it's the painkillers.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.440]  I've been on the painkillers three days.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  And I mean, imagine our troops are being put on this stuff, ladies and gentlemen, and it removes inhibition.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  And it puts basically the animal centers of the brain in control, very, very scary.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:54.440]  Shifting gears, something that my dad, who's a dentist and oral surgeon, always told me and he had little brochures.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  He'd show patients when he was signing them up to, you know, get quarterly teeth cleanings.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:06.440]  One of the most important things you can do in your life is not just moderate exercise and good clean water and eating organic foods and supplementation.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.440]  And that's not that I'm some health expert at Beach Boy.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  I didn't care for 15 years, turned into the job of the hut. I'm changing my life now.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.440]  But I do know what if I speak.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.440]  I remember my dad, because I was a dental assistant for a couple of years, part time.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  He would go over the fact in the studies that plaque getting under your gums causes infections.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.440]  It's an area for really bad anaerobic bacteria to get into your bloodstream.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  They then colonize the heart valves and basically eat your heart valves.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.440]  So it's very important to get your teeth cleaned.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  Deep scaling.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.440]  And here it is in the independent, of course, they're saying it's the first time ever.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.440]  They always say that when it's an old story, they've republished.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  Not brushing your teeth can lead to dementia and heart disease.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.440]  That's right. It grows brain plaques as well.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  Allowing bacteria to build up in the chips and cracks along the surface of the teeth can lead to gum disease, which damages cells around the body.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440]  You can tell Alexander Ward is not a dentist.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  No, it's not so much the chips on the top.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.440]  It's the gum line down in the roots into the blood vessels, brother.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  It's not stuff so much going through the roots at the top. It's the bottom.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  The study shows that 89% of people believe to have bad teeth contribute towards somebody's age with 40% admitting that they have never considered how their smile could be affecting their appearance.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:36.440]  Later this week, BBC will air the first of two part series examining written oral hygiene, examining our attitude towards taking care of our teeth.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.440]  Now, why is it a joke that brits don't take care of their teeth?
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:56.440]  The documentary also shows that those with chronic inflammation can lead to damage of the circulars system, circulation system, and vital organs with research showing that bad gums, I guess they do get it right finally, can be linked to the development of illnesses including heart disease and Alzheimer's.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:05.440]  35% of people said that a good smile was the first thing they noticed about someone, although many overlooked the need to look after their teeth in later life.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:18.440]  Yeah, I mean, if you like dying of heart attacks or having your valves failed and it's not whitening your teeth or just brushing the surface, you have to floss and you have to get below the gum line.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:26.440]  And if you don't do this every quarter, you're going to have to be numbed up to have it done. You're going to bleed all over the place. It's going to be stinking in a mess and it's going to hurt for a week.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:37.440]  But me, I mean, my dad, he's retired now, so another dentist, but they're not going there, no deadening, they go way below the gum line, bam. And it's just, my gums are all elastic.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:58.440]  Praise God I've got such good teeth. But believe me, take care of your gums, folks. It's one of the most important things you can do at your first line of defense.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:20.440]  She writes, government wipes recent vaccine injury data from website. In March, the Health Resources and Service Administration, or HRSA, removed more than a year's worth of vaccine injury data from its charts.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:31.440]  Now concessions won by flu shot victims shows 42 when in actuality it's 88. Total Tdap cases compensated since 2006 shows 103 when it's actually 129.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:43.440]  And concessions won by vaccine victims since 2006 shows 127 when actually it's 198. Since 1988, the federal government has paid money to vaccine injured victims to the tune of $3.1 billion.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:52.440]  This money comes from fees of every vaccine dose given in this country, which means you, not Big Pharma, is paying for all this safe and effective treatment.

[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:27.440]  You're generally being overrun, but as a military leader you know you can win the fight.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:37.440]  Generally you get on your horse with your best people and go right at the center of the enemy with a battle charge and a roar with your flags,
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.440]  getting everybody whipped up with a bold gambit to show that the battle can be won.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  And that's what I'm doing here is I'm rallying Patriots worldwide.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  Patriots that are pro-human, Patriots that are truly wanting to progress towards the stars,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  not progress and be progressive like cancer, like the globalists,
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:07.440]  who want to build a true liberal society of open ideas and freedom, not a cult of globalism.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:11.440]  We're here to take back those terms, we're here to take back the planet,
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  and what we're selling, freedom, is a lot more popular than what they're selling, tyranny.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.440]  They've just mispackaged it, it's easy to shoot down the globalist politically,
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440]  you just got to have the will to do it.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:32.440]  If you Google the name Rand Paul, and you click the news tab, as I've done here in the TV studio,
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.440]  Governor Pataki, Rand Paul made a terrible mistake.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  Rand Paul video, violated Senate rules, you know, all these demonization.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  Lindsey Graham would be devastating for the GOP to nominate Rand Paul.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  And it goes on to demonize Rand Paul.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.440]  How dare him get up and admit there's illegal spying that the courts have already ruled illegal.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.440]  How dare him say they can't record every phone conversation without warrants.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  How dare him, he's just horrible.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.440]  How dare him say the president shouldn't be a dictator.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.440]  How dare him say that, you know, we should be nice to puppy dogs.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  They're inverting reality, acting like what he did was radical.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.440]  But breaking out of Politico one hour ago, Rand Paul says,
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  Declassify 9-11 report pages on Saudi Arabian involvement in 9-11.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:45.440]  And our very own Wayne Madsen is on the hill, right outside the hill in DC.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.440]  He's just been at the National Press Club.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.440]  And he was there covering the historic presentation by current Senator Rand Paul,
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  former Senator Graham, 9-11 commissioner and others,
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  who have seen the secret 28 pages and what it entails.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.440]  Walter Jones, the congressman from North Carolina was also there,
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:13.440]  frequent guest on this transmission.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  So joining us is Wayne Madsen to break all of this down.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.440]  I tell you, Wayne, it's obviously very dangerous what Senator Paul's doing.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.440]  He's a leader. He's a doctor. He's a family man.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.440]  He's showing he's bold on the Constitution and rights.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.440]  He's showing that he's nonpartisan when it comes to defending our republic.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:37.440]  He's the only senator to actually get up and try to shoot down the Patriot Act
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  and put himself right in the face of the globalist so-called juggernaut.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.440]  This is true leadership. This is true Americana.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.440]  And if we don't support this as a people, if we don't admire this,
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.440]  if we don't see this as heroic in the face of incredible tyranny,
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:02.440]  then we can't get mad at politicians who become statesmen down the road
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.440]  for not doing something. They're blackmailed. They're harassed.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  They're targeted by the media. They go through all sorts of dirty tricks.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.440]  You've got to be super clean to be able to do what he's doing.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.440]  And he has really gone up a notch in my view from me liking him, trusting him,
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  admiring him, not liking some of the politics he's played,
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  but still knowing he's the best real politician out there in the polls
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.440]  who is a statesman that could beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  And he's on a warmonger. He wants to cut off foreign aid.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  But I tell you, I think he's in real danger now.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440]  They're trying to politically assassinate him. I want to get your take on that.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.440]  But first, you were there for the presentation.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  We don't have filters here and just have to read what Politico says.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.440]  Wayne Madsen, former NSA officer, award-winning investigative journalist,
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  bestselling author, WayneMadsenReport.com,
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  who broke the Hastart-Pito ring news back in 2006 on this broadcast
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.440]  and at WayneMadsenReport.com joins us now.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  Wayne Madsen, thank you.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440]  Yes, Alex. Thanks.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.440]  Well, the press conference was at 10 o'clock today,
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.440]  the Senate Congressional Visitors Center.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.440]  And Senator Paul led off the press conference
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  announcing his support for a Senate bill
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:27.440]  to basically urge the president to declassify the 28 pages
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.440]  from the Joint Congressional Report of 2002 on the failures of 9-11
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  and joining Senator Paul,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.440]  former Senator Bob Graham from Florida
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.440]  who was the actual chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  who has, of course, read those 28 pages,
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  was the last final CHOP authority on those 28 pages
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.440]  with the rest of the report.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.440]  And he urged, and he has been urging, the White House.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440]  I know he's visited the White House
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  and the senators and to declassify the pages.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  And Senator Paul announced that he has two co-sponsors
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.440]  for this Senate bill that would declassify the 28 pages.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.440]  And they are Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon,
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.440]  and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, I should say, of New York.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  And he said he's also planning on attaching this bill
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.440]  as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act next week.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:42.440]  So there are two avenues to get this through.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.440]  On the House side, we had Representative Jones,
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.440]  Representative Lynch and Representative Massey speak.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:55.440]  What we heard from both Senator Paul and the congressmen
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.440]  from the House side are that they have resistance
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  from the bipartisan leadership in both houses
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.440]  on getting this through.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440]  They have very few co-sponsors.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440]  And it's quite clear that the leadership,
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.440]  and that's Mitch McConnell in the Senate
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  and John Boehner, the House Speaker
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.440]  and various chairman of various committees
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.440]  are just trying their darned us to block this effort.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  And Senator Paul made an interesting comment
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440]  during his presentation.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.440]  He said that the Saudi government has expressed support
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.440]  for releasing the 28 pages.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:39.440]  So I asked him a question at the press conference,
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  who in the Saudi government would be in favor of that
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:45.440]  because the President, King Salman,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  was the governor of Riyadh Province for 9-11.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  And I understand from talking to Saudi opposition forces,
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.440]  and these are democratic opposition forces
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.440]  that several kind of members pass through Riyadh
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.440]  when Salman was governor of Riyadh
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.440]  on their way to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.440]  And they were given a logistical support cash
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  and a whole lot of support
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.440]  by the President, King of Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  Yeah, that sounds like in a movie
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.440]  when the guy has a dead body in his trunk.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440]  And he says, sure, search my car,
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.440]  just trying to play a confidence game.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.440]  We know from different folks we've had on,
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.440]  like Springman and others, from the visa section in Jeddah,
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.440]  that they were basically ordered by the CIA
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  to let the 15 of the 19 hijackers in,
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  even though they were flagged as terrorists.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.440]  But when I get excited about Rand Paul, it's for this reason.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.440]  He comes out, he points out that they've lied to us about spying on us.
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440]  He points out it's not been used to stop terror.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.440]  He points out that we've been helping fund ISIS.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  He brings up the fact that, hey, Saudi Arabia was loud in 9-11.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.440]  Don't claim I'm against national security.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  Release the information.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.440]  He really seems to be in their face right now.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  A lot of politicians are saying, we don't like your strategy.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.440]  You're not playing it safe.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  You're going to lose now for doing this.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  It doesn't matter. He's doing the right thing.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.440]  And it shows how alien that is to the mindset in Washington.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  What do you make of what Rand Paul's doing and taking a leadership role in this?
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:20.440]  Well, he had, you know, I've covered the politics here for a while.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  And to hear a Democrat like Bob Graham,
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.440]  a former governor of Florida and a longtime Democratic senator,
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440]  was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.440]  was actually thanking and praising Rand Paul for his efforts,
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.440]  as were the members from the House side,
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  including Democratic Congressman Stephen Lynch from Massachusetts.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.440]  I mean, it smells and looks like old-fashioned statesmanship
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.440]  but actually trying to have a free country.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.440]  Yeah, I was somewhat surprised to see a spirit of bipartisanship
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.440]  at that press conference today.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.440]  I should also add that there was a Republican Virginia state senator
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:15.440]  in the audience and he has also proposed a resolution urging the 28 pages.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.440]  You know, that's just a sense of the, that would be a sense of the Virginia Senate.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  They don't have any authority over that type of thing,
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  but he's introduced a similar resolution in the Virginia Senate.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.440]  Well, I happen to know Rand Paul for 20 years,
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.440]  and I can tell folks he's the real deal.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.440]  They're coming after him more than anybody.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  I think that for anybody who's smart, folks should know,
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  he's then the man to nominate out of the Republican field.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.440]  The first lady from there on the East Coast,
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:53.440]  Ms. Lindsey Graham, has come out though demonizing him,
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:57.440]  saying he'd be a horrible choice for a Republican nominee.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:02.440]  But the word is that Lindsey Graham might be getting ready to run.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.440]  Well, he has, I think, his announcement I think is,
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:10.440]  either he's done it this week or he's planning to do it this week.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  And yeah, there's, I would urge some of his opponents
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  to just send people to Columbia, South Carolina.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.440]  I've heard about him in South Carolina
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:27.440]  from a well-known journalist for the state newspaper,
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.440]  and that is the record, that's the paper record in South Carolina,
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  covers state politics in the state capitals.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:40.440]  So these people are well aware of Ms. South Carolina's past,
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.440]  shall we say, exploits in the state.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.440]  So he's fully compromised.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  I mean, if he comes out of the closet, then he wouldn't be as dangerous.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  We're not attacking him because he's gay.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:53.440]  We're attacking him because they can blackmail him with the information.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.440]  And he's a hypocrite because he has sponsored a lot of anti-gay legislation.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.440]  But the major thing is if he does come out,
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.440]  he's of course not going to be a, not only will he not be elected president
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.440]  or get the Republican nomination, he probably won't get,
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  win a seat again if he runs for reelection from South Carolina.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.440]  So this is the dilemma that he faces because of his total hypocrisy.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.440]  Well, I mean, he thinks he's going to attack Rand Paul.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440]  We're not going to attack him right back.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440]  He's another thing coming.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.440]  We're committed to this fight.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.440]  We know he's a dangerous person.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  We know he represents a dangerous mafia.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  And yes, everybody should recognize we have wavos the size of, you know,
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440]  bowling balls to even be talking about these issues.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.440]  But it's time it all comes down.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.440]  It's time the house of cards comes down.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  It's time that all of them, Boehner, all of them that are compromised.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.440]  What's the, I know you studied Boehner.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  And I know he's tied in with Haster and the rest of that jolly crowd.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.440]  What's the dirt they've got on Boehner?
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  I mean, when he's doing stuff that's 87% unpopular, like TPP with his,
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:00.440]  with his crew, with his state constituency, I mean, they've got to have something
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.440]  big on old Boehner.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.440]  I know he famously handed out tobacco company checks on the floor of the house
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  in the nineties that was illegal, basically, and then claimed it was legal.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:11.440]  But I mean, what else do they have on this guy, the speaker of the house?
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  Well, I don't want to talk about his drinking because we've had very successful
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:19.440]  members of Congress in the past who were also alcoholics.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.440]  So you can't use that.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.440]  That can't be used as any sort of negative.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.440]  When you talk about the past, and many of these were, you know, they may have been
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  drunks, but they were also statesmen.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.440]  We talk about former House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Minority Leader
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.440]  Everett Dirks and, and, and then Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.440]  Now, some of them, of course, were an alcoholic synonymous, but, but they got the
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.440]  job done.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:51.440]  So, yes, of course, Boehner is known as pretty much a, you know, a lush fish.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  Yeah.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  Basically, yeah, he's, he's, they call him Mr. Merlot.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.440]  He likes his red wine.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.440]  And, but I think, you know, when you talk about Boehner, you got to talk about the
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.440]  lobbying.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  Apparently there was talk about him having an extramarital affair with a, with a top
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  lobbyist some years ago.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:16.440]  So, yes, there is a taint of scandal there, but, and I really think that Boehner did
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.440]  not want to serve another term in Congress.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  Apparently he's been promised some big, big job.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440]  He wants to move to Florida.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  He bought a big house in Florida.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  So, clearly he's looking at retirement.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.440]  He wants to cash in on the looting of America.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.440]  Yeah.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  And, you know, so he can, he can buy the best Merlot after he's retired.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440]  And play golf all day.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  Yeah.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.440]  So it sounds like his greatest crime then in the club is he's not a pedophile because
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:45.440]  it seems like you got to be a pedophile to be up in the top these days.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  Right.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  I think he, you know, I mean, he's very useful to some people, but I think he's, he's a rather
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  aloof speaker.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  We have to really look at his staff, senior staff members.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  And that would be as a speaker.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  He has his own staff as speaker.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.440]  They're separate from his staff where he represents his district in Ohio.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  And also you got to look at some of the committee chairs that he's appointed to these top committees.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:20.440]  So I think the problem with Boehner is his, his relative aloofness and from, from, you
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:26.440]  know, day to day matters and, but, but the, I'm not going to hold the drinking against
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  them because as I say, we've, we've had in the past.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  Well, we'd be hypocrites then too.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  So let's just get real.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.440]  Yeah, right.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  Exactly.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:42.440]  And, but, but, but I really want to say that in answer to my question, Senator Paul said,
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:47.440]  well, I asked him, I said, who's specifically in the Saudi government because of the, and
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:53.440]  I think King Salman as Governor Riyadh, his name is all over the 28 pages.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.440]  And he said he, he'd have to get, you know, get that information.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  He couldn't recall who that official was, but the word I got today was that the reason
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  this bill has been totally unsuccessful in getting more Senate support is because the
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  Bush family is putting direct pressure on Mitch McConnell.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.440]  And we know that, you know, he's the other Senator from Kentucky and the sensibly, you
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  know, Rand Paul and McConnell, they have a sort of a mutual supportive relationship politically
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  and both Republicans from the same state, but that the Bush family and the oil companies
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:39.440]  and the Saudi lobbyists and the Saudi embassy here is really putting a full court press
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  on making sure.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  Sure.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  Well, for those that don't know, you broke it at the time.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.440]  It was in the Miami Herald.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440]  It was in the London Guardian.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:53.440]  The Bushes were at a Carlisle group contractor breakfast that morning in DC at the Bin Laden
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  table.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:01.440]  George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41 was there eating with them when the attacks took place.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.440]  They were allowed to all fly out of the country when air traffic was grounded.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.440]  So they don't want this whole Bush Saudi connection being opened up.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  And I think knowing Rand Paul in his speech, that was a little bit of a backhand.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  He's probably been threatened by the Saudis.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  That was a backhanded threat, probably that, oh, and I know you want this released like,
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.440]  like, you know, oh, you really want us to serve a search warrant on you.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.440]  It's kind of a, I think it was more of a snarky remark.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  Right.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  It could, it could have been.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  I mean, he, he also said there's, he's talked about the bipartisan support from various
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:45.440]  committees, current and former committee chairs, former intelligence agency officials averged
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.440]  this report to these 28 pages to be released.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  But Senator Graham, former Senator Graham held up another document.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440]  Let's talk about that document when you come back.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.440]  And I want to get the latest on the giant gerbil Dennis Astrid.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.440]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US politicians argue
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.440]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.440]  Arm your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:37.440]  Infidelbodyarmor just won't quit.

[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:36.440]  You've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation and man wasn't made to live

[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.440]  journalists.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.440]  McBreen worked for Scripps Howard News Service and others.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  Wayne Madsen's worked for a bunch of big mainline institutions, famous author, written for you
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.440]  name it.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:03.440]  We've got all these other great reporters here as well that have worked in TV and radio.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.440]  And we're hiring more people.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  I plan to hire about three more camera people, maybe two or three more reporters, investigative
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  journalists, two or three more writers, and then that's it.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  I don't tend to grow anymore because it's a lot to manage.
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  But we just need to be able to have two crews be in different places at one time and still
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  have a crew here to do reports in Austin and in studio.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.440]  And I've basically got two crews right now.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.440]  But when holidays come up, I've got one crew.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:35.440]  So it's a balancing act.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:40.440]  Your support financially is what is allowing it for me to be able to hammer out a deal
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  to have Wayne Madsen come to work full time.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  That's five days a week with us as an investigative journalist.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:51.440]  And some of the stuff he's got planned is movie dangerous as dangerous because it's important.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:55.440]  I mean, we're not playing games here is what I'm saying.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.440]  I'm not going to go up against the globalist and do it with my mittens on.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.440]  The gloves are off.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  We want a free country.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  We're not going to be enslaved.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  Fortune favors the bold to quote.
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.440]  John Paul Jones, founder of the U.S. Navy.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  I have only begun to fight.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.440]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.440]  So thank you all for being prisonplanted.tv members and visiting info or store.com.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.440]  All right, Wayne, we got about three, four minutes left for the segment ends.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  You said that Senator Graham, who is heavily involved in 911 investigation, you name it.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  His rather 28 pages that show Saudi Arabia was heavily involved.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.440]  Our government helped cover it up.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  That's bombshell right there.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  We got another document, Wayne Madsen.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  Yes, Senator Graham held up another document from the Treasury Department.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:58.440]  It was a classified document and it was about a Saudi organization with strong ties to the Saudi government that funded Al Qaeda and obviously funded some of the hijackers.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  This document was, he showed us the document.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:11.440]  It was probably about 90 to 100 pages and he flipped through every page and every single page was blacked out.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:17.440]  There wasn't one item there that was left open for public use.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:24.440]  So he's urged that document as well to be released by the Treasury Department.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  Does this scare the real perpetrators of 911?
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:39.440]  I think from what I understand from people who read the 28 pages, it's not so much what it says in the text.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  It may be what's in the footnotes and reference material is cited and think of it as an onion.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:52.440]  And when you start peeling back the onion, you get down to different layers and it opens up different avenues for investigation.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:58:00.440]  And that's obviously what the intelligence agencies and the Bush family, and I say Bush family,
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:06.440]  we got to think of their extended family, the Dick Cheneys, the Donald Rumsfelds and whatnot.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:16.440]  Don't want this information to see the light of day nor do the oil companies and they're so tied in with them that of course have this relationship with the Saudi government.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:23.440]  In closing, Wayne, what are they going to do when this ends up coming out or it's already basically out?
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:27.440]  Defense Intelligence says our government's running al-Qaeda. What are they going to do?
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:35.440]  Well, I mean, it's going to, I think, show people that we're lied to on a daily basis.
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:38.440]  Wayne, hold on. Back at 60, we'll do five more minutes and let you get back to reporting.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.440]  He's up there on Capitol Hill right now.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.440]  Thank you for listening to me.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  They also are having an event at the National Press Club, that's how I got that confused, but this was at the Senate Press Area. We'll be back.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  This is an evolutionary secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:48.440]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:24.440]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  Dr. Steve Puchenick says he's got some interesting info on Jade Elm and he's against it.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  We're going to be talking about that coming up.
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:36.440]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist now on the infowars team, we're finalizing that.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  Reporting from Capitol Hill where Rand Paul and others just gave a bipartisan presentation on the former Senator Bob Graham who wasn't on the 9-11 Commission.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:53.440]  Why was I saying that? I get confused. So many names, they all mixed together with this whole Saudi connection coming out.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.440]  Other points that you were about to add to that and where do you see all this going?
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  Because obviously folks in the military are upset if Defense Intelligence leaked last week.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  And this was confirmed to be a real leak that indeed the Army said we're ordered to fund Al Qaeda, fund the cell office, which is Al Qaeda as well, basically ISIS.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:21.440]  I mean, this really shows that why they're scared of leaks.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:37.440]  Yes, and then we just had a revelation from the State Department. They admitted that the former head of the Tajikistan Special Forces trained by Blackwater on a State Department contract is now a top field commander for ISIS.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  So here we have yet another fact toy that indicates that ISIS is a construct of Western intelligence facilities.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  How do they think they're going to get away with this?
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:59.440]  Well, I think the fact is that we're seeing more and more of these revelations and they're being confirmed by the agencies.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:10.440]  Of course, the Defense Intelligence Agency tried to warm its way out of that report that you mentioned about that it was the policy to create a cell office principality in Syria,
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:23.440]  to bring down Bashar Assad and ultimately the Iraqi government, which is a lie against very close ties with Iran.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:31.440]  But I don't think we see the resistance now from the agencies or people that want to get the truth out.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:41.440]  Your job was internal security at the NSA, but we see them going after folks like William Benny and Drake and others.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  But you've talked about how they spend a lot of their time now just spying on people in government, but it's not going to work when more and more people just start leaking.
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:57.440]  They can't stop everybody. We could see leaks at any time that could bring down the globalist. I think that's why they want to have an internet kill switch and things like that.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  Well, I think we're seeing more people going through more documents like the DIA report.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:12.440]  Whatever the document was, it indicated, yes, this guy from Tajikistan had other specials forces was in fact drained by Blackwater.
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:23.440]  I think people are getting smart on how to go through these documents, whether they're as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request or other from other sources.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  I think we're getting better at what we're doing.
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  And it's beyond the spin of, sure, we created Saddam, then he turned on us, or we created Bin Laden, then he turned on us.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:46.440]  No, they are funding these groups whole cloth now and commanding them to engage in war crimes to destabilize the world, then attack the West so they can legitimize the police state.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.440]  And this is a dead duck politically. It's not going to fly in my view.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  Right. And we had families there today at this press conference. I should mention that one young boy, 14 years old, was four days old when his father was killed on 9-11.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:14.440]  And the daughter of one of the victims said, we are the children of 9-11. They made a personal appeal to President Obama to release the 28 pages so they can at least have some closure.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  They say they don't trust their government anymore. And that's a theme we heard. We, the children of 9-11, do not trust our own government.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  All right. Wayne Madsen, great job. WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.440]  We'll be talking to you more in the next few days about official capacity here at InfoWars. Welcome to the team, buddy.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  You bet. Thank you.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.440]  All right. There goes Wayne Madsen reporting from Capitol Hill. You know, the reporters shattering in the background.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  I've got a few words to say about a house of cards when we come back on the other side. I know I'm not talking about the HBO television show or Netflix or whatever it is.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:05:07.440]  No, I mean, the Real House of Cards. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:24.440]  Are we promoting a movie? He then went on to assert that he is not a Republican or Democrat.
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:33.440]  Now, actor Vince Vaughn is in hot water for standing up for gun rights. It's not about duck hunting. It's about the ability of the individual.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:39.440]  It's the same reason we have freedom of speech, Vaughn said. And he's right. And he's not the only one.
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:46.440]  Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, and Carl Malone, to name a few, are also outspoken advocates for the Second Amendment.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:53.440]  I know that standing up for individual rights isn't as trendy as saying men are misogynist from birth, but it is something we need nonetheless.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:06:18.440]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  Here are the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:33.440]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.

[02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:07.440]  It's all a sigh of the threat fusion centers, the militarization of police, military on the streets, TSA on the streets.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:15.440]  During the Boston bombing, half of the houses in the city searched without warrants. Women drug out of their homes at gunpoint.
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:26.440]  It's all an exercise of power. It's all a conditioning program to train the American people to accept what is only normal in third world dictatorships.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:36.440]  Will we allow our journey towards despotism and tyranny to be complete? Or will we turn the situation around and restore our beloved Republic?
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:43.440]  The police in National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.440]  We need to make sure too that whenever we knock on doors people refuse to leave, we need to make note, call it out.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:09:01.440]  They say there are no orders to use force just strong persuasion, sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  You say guns will be taken? No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:17.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide now well into the third hour of this June 2nd, 2015 transmission.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  A lot of really important news up on infowars.com.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.440]  Rand Paul joins fight to release secret 9-11 documents.
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  Goldberg 2015, elites prepare for nuclear economic devastation. Liberals worship Caitlyn Jenner as transgender goddess.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  That's what's important as we see the world destabilize. Florida court rules off the grid living illegal.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:44.440]  Hacked emails expose George Soros as Ukraine puppet master.
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:47.440]  Paul Craig Roberts is an article ruled by corporations.
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.440]  Trendy's ready for the ultimate wearable implantable microchip under their skin.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.440]  Obama, I will never engage in the politics in which I'm trying to divide people.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:02.440]  Talk about a 1984 statement at some of the news on infowars.com right now.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.440]  I haven't gotten to FBI behind mysterious surveillance aircraft over cities.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  Plains carrying video, cell phone, snooping technology hidden behind fictitious government front companies.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.440]  I told you about this, I don't know, more than 10 years ago.
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.440]  They've got not just the FBI.
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  The EPA has them. The FDA has them.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.440]  The Department of Energy has them. And they're just fleets of sessness.
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.440]  And they fly around Department of Energy, Department of the Interior.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:39.440]  If you build a barn on your property when you're not supposed to, you know, they come and find you.
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.440]  They use predator drones on people because the cows have come on their property in South Dakota.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.440]  No, North Dakota, three times under law that you can then take the cows. They did that.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.440]  So they had predator drones from the Air Force come in.
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.440]  We reported on it. They made fun of us and said that wasn't happening.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  Coming up at about 40 after when Steve Pettening leaves us, I will break that down in detail.
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:07.440]  But I'm glad that's finally hitting the news.
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:17.440]  But before we go any further, I wanted to just bring up the fact that Jade Helm is still coming up in July and August.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  I don't expect it to be a military takeover at that time.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  We said day one, it's conditioning to train our military to accept it, to train the public to accept it.
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.440]  And it's been in the Army times, the Army War Colleges reported at Stars and Stripes,
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.440]  that the military is, quote, training to crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:37.440]  And it's training for domestic insurrection.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.440]  While George Soros, the Democrats, and the State Department and the Justice Department have been caught,
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.440]  trying to foam in any political angst in this country against the police themselves,
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:55.440]  when there's a lot of bad police and a lot of bad training, most of it's federal, it's still a scapegoat.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:03.440]  And so they want to preemptively start unrest so Obama can be the savior this summer as economic problems and other things intensify.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  And as Al Sharpton said, they want to federalize the states and brand any state actions to secure security and order as racist.
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.440]  Dr. Steve Pacenek joins us, former head of psychological operations of the State Department,
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:25.440]  one of the guys that helped found Delta Force, did a lot of secret military operations before that.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:32.440]  And of course, he covered a bunch of books with Tom Clancy, the late great.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:38.440]  And he joins us now to give us his take on Jade Helm and a lot of other issues that are going on.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:46.440]  I want to ask you about blackmail in Congress with the pervert rings that seem to permeate things and where he sees the election going.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  Also, he thinks of Rand Paul calling for the 28 pages to be released.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  Steve Pacenek.com. Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:59.440]  It's always a pleasure, Alex. I want to thank you for what you did in bringing up Jade Helm.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.440]  Actually, I was not aware of it. I live in the South near Georgia.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.440]  And actually a couple of people came up to me and asked me about it.
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.440]  When I checked into it, I was incredulous.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  I couldn't believe that we would spend $10 billion on a game that has no value whatsoever that is not even remotely related to human terrain,
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:31.440]  which means psychological warfare, understanding cultures, understanding distant cultures, understanding different topographies.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:41.440]  And using that in Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, it actually mirrored, and I couldn't believe that General Adorno hadn't read my book,
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:47.440]  State of Emergency, where it's exactly what I wrote about when the federal government came into the state government,
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.440]  actually in Nevada and Texas and Colorado, over water rights.
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  You know, I forgot that's one of the last books you wrote. I hadn't even thought of that.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.440]  You basically predicted that in one of your books.
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  And then there's another book that just came out that Colonel Schaefer wrote where the same thing happens.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.440]  We got to get Schaefer back on because he said, I can't tell you what's classified, but I've put it in a novel,
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:12.440]  and I wondered if he was trying to warn us of something.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  Well, I warned you about it in State of Emergency, where I literally took an actual episode from Nye County, NYE County, Nevada,
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  over water rights, and the federal government came in and confronted our National Guard and state troopers.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  And to me, this was the beginning of the Second Civil War.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:40.440]  And I couldn't believe when I read that General Adorno, who really is not qualified to be in a military command post anymore,
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  he was a consultant to Condoleezza Rice. He was never trained in psychological warfare.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  He was never trained really in counter-terrorism.
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:57.440]  He's the kind of political general that we've had all along, from McCrystal to McRaven to Mullins to, you know,
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.440]  a whole bunch of these generals who've done absolutely nothing.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  And in light of the fact that we are literally losing men, money, and time and our allies in Palmyra, Syria,
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:16.440]  where I was there during the Second Iraq War, and losing men and money and allies in Iraq,
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:21.440]  where we have been spending billions, if not trillions of dollars, since the Bush administration,
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:29.440]  I find this incursion into Texas, into Southwest America, absolutely incredible.
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.440]  Let me expand on this, because you are an expert in these areas, I know, ran a lot of military operations.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:35.440]  So let me dig into this with you.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:39.440]  As a layman, I can just read all the admissions that the Pentagon that they like,
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.440]  they're being ordered to prepare for civil unrest, taking over states, you name it.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  And it looks like it's pointed at legitimate state actions, so it's very tyrannical.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  But showing Texas is hostile, showing Southern California is hostile, Utah is hostile,
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:59.440]  they admit in the early document it's to win hearts and minds, it's to simulate illegal activity,
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:05.440]  it's to study culture, clearly then they're talking about our culture, buying people off.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.440]  So if their intent was to condition us to accept military on the streets, this is blown up in their face.
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:17.440]  But from your research, now looking at it, what does Jade Helm indeed look like, just a total waste of money?
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:25.440]  It looks like a total mess and a disaster and an indictment of the U.S. military,
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:32.440]  because they have been losing more and more wars since 9-11, which you know was created by Bush and Cheney.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:40.440]  They have destroyed more countries, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and now they're in the process of other countries,
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:43.440]  of literally losing them, they're all over Africa.
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.440]  What in God's name is our military and special forces doing all over Africa?
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:54.440]  Fighting different insurgencies when we're not winning anything, we have no national security interest,
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:59.440]  and the Chinese are coming into every area that we're in and buying their way.
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:07.440]  They don't have any kinetic actions whatsoever, yet our military has failed for the past 30 to 40 years.
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.440]  I would do what General Marshall, George Marshall did when he started to implement World War II.
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:16.440]  I would fire the first 600 Navy admirals and generals.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:21.440]  We have had nothing, nothing but incompetent military senior officials.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:29.440]  I understand it's incompetent overall, but what do you think looking at it, was the establishment's plan to launch this term?
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:33.440]  I don't think the establishment is that clever or that effective or that brave.
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:36.440]  Quite frankly, most of our generals are not very brave.
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:42.440]  They are men who really want to stay into the system so they can garner their pensions
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:45.440]  and then make money in the military industrial complex.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.440]  They don't have the guts to become tyrannical.
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.440]  You don't have that kind of man here.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:52.440]  You don't even have it in Obama.
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:57.440]  You basically have men who are following orders, just like the Germans did.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:04.440]  Okay, well who's given the orders then because that sounds even scarier to have incompetence poking China and Russia.
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:06.440]  That's correct.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:08.440]  Now you hit it on the head, Alex.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.440]  That's what I wanted to inform you and your people is that this is beyond incompetence.
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.440]  This is gross negligence and incompetence, but I don't mind firing them.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.440]  I don't mind if they stay in their forts, fourth place or hood.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:25.440]  I mind paying $10 billion for a totally useless exercise,
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:31.440]  which at the same time exacerbates any concerns that we have about the government,
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:36.440]  reaffirms the fact that we, the American people, do not trust our civilian leaders,
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:41.440]  our military leaders, our intelligence leaders, or our legislative leaders.
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:46.440]  In fact, what's happening with this very exercise and why I thank you and your audience
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:51.440]  is that it reaffirmed that under no condition do we have any trust whatsoever,
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.440]  whether you're a Republican, Democrat, etc.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:55.440]  So it's a good message to send.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:57.440]  Don't ever try to bring in martial law.
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  You can't. I mean, when I needed the military and I needed the FBI in a hostage situation,
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:05.440]  they were incompetent.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.440]  They immediately said, no, doctor, I have Posse Comitatis.
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.440]  I said, fine, don't come in, but don't bother me.
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:18.440]  And then the FBI couldn't handle repelling when they had a hostage situation in the Hanasi Muslims.
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:20.440]  So what you have to do...
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.440]  I ought to have you on for a full hour sometime about the stuff that's declassified
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:26.440]  on some of the famous hostage situations that you've...
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.440]  Well, my point is very simple.
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:33.440]  You have a make-believe military that is in fact losing men in a Waka Moli game
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:39.440]  where they're creating all kinds of episodes and incidents and crises all over the world
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:44.440]  thanks to Bush, Cheney, Carter, Clinton, and Carter, the Secretary of Defense.
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.440]  Stay there. Stay there. I mean, it sounds like Project Loki.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:51.440]  Sounds like Loki runs our foreign policy. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.440]  When you're listening to the radio and you hear...
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.440]  We interrupt this program to bring you a special news product.
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:59.440]  You listen closely. Your pulse rate increases and you wonder if you're prepared
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:02.440]  for whatever man-made or natural disaster has occurred.
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:06.440]  If food became unavailable, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:11.440]  Have you checked and found emergency food can cost as much as $300 for a month's supply
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:15.440]  and is full of weird chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:02.440]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:07.440]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:12.440]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine, but with a trusted Big Berkey water filter,
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.440]  you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:20.440]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:27.440]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:31.440]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:38.440]  The gold standard in water purification, and our filters last for years at less than 2 cents per gallon.
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:42.440]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:49.440]  Call 1-877-99-Berkey, or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:01.440]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids,
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:04.440]  and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:09.440]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:12.440]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.440]  Not fun.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:17.440]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb,
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:22.440]  then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:27.440]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:30.440]  My name is Errol. I'm 74 years old.
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:33.440]  You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing.
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:37.440]  I played pickleball, and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement,
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.440]  I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:43.440]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder,
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:47.440]  but now I'm getting much better results using One World Way.
