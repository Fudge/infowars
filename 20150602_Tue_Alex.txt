[00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:06.336]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:08.099]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.881]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.463]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:19.535]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:21.377]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:24.799]  It's already Tuesday, the second day of June 2015.
[00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.222]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.364]  We've got several very informative guests joining us today.
[00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:39.170]  You can see who our guests are in the guest box at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.573]  But before we go there, wow, the whoppers that are in the news again today.
[00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:49.197]  I was aware of the globalist agenda to roll this out, but not this quick.
[00:00:50.598 --> 00:01:13.935]  The new thing that's going to get really hot, and you're going to be phobic if you don't like it, now that they've moved on to their final phase with Caitlyn Jenner and the rest of it, is becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled, see they're abled, people feel like
[00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:18.296]  Impostors in their fully working bodies.
[00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.200]  They need to chop their arms and legs off.
[00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:28.667]  I first saw a documentary probably 12, 13 years ago at South by Southwest and I forget the name.
[00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:38.774]  I got invited to a couple of showings as a media person and I went to it and it showed these gay men that had moved to Mexico where it was legal.
[00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:40.656]  It wasn't legal here in the U.S.
[00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:49.062]  and he chopped both his arms and legs off because he chopped one arm off and that wasn't enough and the other arm and then one leg and then he wore a diaper and lived in a box.
[00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.718]  And his lover took care of him and changed his diaper.
[00:01:53.718 --> 00:02:05.885]  Now, of course, that's completely degenerate, completely perverted, completely satanic, completely and totally sick, and they're going to move and make you pay for it.
[00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:12.048]  Now, if somebody thinks they're a woman, a lot of the genetics are there.
[00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:16.911]  There are studies that some people have a woman's brain in a man's body or a
[00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:24.538]  Man's brain in a woman's body, especially with all the chemicals in utero, early on in the development.
[00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:26.039]  I mean, some of that's going on.
[00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:32.720]  And the hormones in the food, it's on record that it confuses every other advanced form of life.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.121]  Other mammals, amphibians, fish, you name it.
[00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:43.883]  So I'm not up here judging people, but the agenda behind pushing all of this is to confuse society and break everything down.
[00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:51.160]  And make the natural systems, the set default systems, basically anathema.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:11.135]  And every time I mention, there was another documentary I read about, I think it was in Texas Monthly, I didn't see it, where people go and they chop fingers off, arms off, but also the big thing is they'll get molten lead poured on their backs to have big scarification, or they like to get shot.
[00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:24.205]  With 357 magnums in the article I read, threw up under the chest, but missing the heart to blow a huge shrapnel hole in the back, and those are real sexy, supposedly.
[00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:29.529]  Well, now it's in the National Post, the biggest paper in Canada, out of Ottawa.
[00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.852]  You can go read all about it today, for those of you who think I'm making this stuff up.
[00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:41.597]  This is the new big push, and you're just not cool enough to understand how wonderful it is to be shot with a 357 magnum, or how cool the bullet holes are.
[00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:43.658]  And you know what?
[00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.881]  In a sick way, I get that better than having arms and legs chopped off.
[00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.163]  I mean, I don't see that at any level.
[00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:52.626]  Other than, quote, wanting to be taken care of and all this stuff.
[00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:54.308]  And being helpless.
[00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:59.052]  And I guess, in a helpless population that's into that, that's their religion, that it'll become sanctified.
[00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:00.073]  It'll become like a religion.
[00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:05.637]  But yeah, I've seen women that think, you know, scars all over guys are sexy.
[00:04:05.637 --> 00:04:12.521]  And I guess in a way, it's manly when somebody's got scars on them, especially fighting scars or bullet wounds or whatever.
[00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:18.345]  At an archetypal level in the tribe, we see the old warriors with scars all over them as tough.
[00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:28.392]  Or you could see a veteran with an arm or a leg blown off and you recognize that sacrifice instantly and at a primitive level, you feel an appreciation towards them.
[00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:30.994]  But I'll assure you, they don't like their arm or leg being blown off.
[00:04:31.634 --> 00:04:34.976]  And if they did, something was wrong with them.
[00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:36.837]  Very sick.
[00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:38.698]  Very, very sick.
[00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:43.300]  But see, that's because I'm a trans-abled phobic.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.683]  And they're now, as I predicted years ago, coming out and calling it pedophobic.
[00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:57.248]  NAMBLA is in courts in Australia, the UK, and other major countries, and they've got judges agreeing with them that raping children is loving, and that we are pedophobes.
[00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:09.156]  The latest case of big pharma and government vaccine cover-up is brought to you by Cheryl Atkinson, the former CBS reporter who was instrumental in outing the Justice Department's Fast and Furious program.
[00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:13.040]  She writes, government wipes recent vaccine injury data from website.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.344]  In March, the Health Resources and Service Administration, or HRSA, removed more than a year's worth
[00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:20.966]  of vaccine injury data from its charts.
[00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:26.530]  Now concessions won by flu shot victims shows 42 when in actuality it's 88.
[00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.272]  Total Tdap cases compensated since 2006 shows 103 when it's actually 129.
[00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:31.514]  And concessions won by vaccine victims since 2006 shows 127 when actually it's 198.
[00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:34.056]  Since 1988 the federal government has paid money to vaccine injured victims
[00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:44.545]  To the tune of 3.1 billion dollars.
[00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:48.350]  This money comes from fees of every vaccine dose given in this country.
[00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.996]  Which means you, not Big Pharma, is paying for all this safe and effective treatment.
[00:05:52.996 --> 00:05:55.339]  You can read more about vaccines at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.120]  Rob Due reporting.

[00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:29.853]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:39.139]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.942]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:04.077]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:11.403]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:19.490]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.471]  The bad news is
[00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:28.479]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine are running low.
[00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:33.284]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:40.652]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:40.652 --> 00:07:43.555]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:50.738]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:54.740]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:07.557]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[00:08:07.557 --> 00:08:16.003]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[00:08:16.003 --> 00:08:19.746]  And how many did I adopt?
[00:08:19.746 --> 00:08:21.067]  I kill my kids!
[00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.268]  I kill my kids!
[00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:33.156]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.177]  That's pretty cool, man.
[00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:38.959]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:41.060]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:43.292]  I don't think so.
[00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:46.575]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:47.296]  I pay for them.
[00:08:47.296 --> 00:08:47.696]  Really?
[00:08:47.696 --> 00:08:49.618]  How many do you pay for them?
[00:08:49.618 --> 00:08:51.039]  Upwards of 50.
[00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:51.419]  Really?
[00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:53.141]  Oh yeah.
[00:09:03.715 --> 00:09:05.356]  You, you piece of s**t!
[00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:07.196]  Bunch of misogynist mother f**kers!
[00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:09.417]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:11.818]  Father, you're being aggressive.
[00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:16.300]  I'm being aggressive?
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:27.945]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:33.007]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:34.383 --> 00:09:36.325]  This is a live transmission.
[00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:40.570]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday edition.
[00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.515]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:53.464]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[00:09:53.464 --> 00:10:01.911]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[00:10:01.911 --> 00:10:07.756]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control.
[00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:17.912]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.374]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:45.973 --> 00:10:50.626]  I've been saying that this is an emergency transmission for 20 years on air.
[00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:55.237]  No, we've been broadcasting live from occupied former U.S.
[00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.618]  territory in FEMA Region 6.
[00:10:57.618 --> 00:11:05.064]  And people thought that was a little bit cheeky, a little bit hokey, a little bit corny, a little bit over the top 20 years ago.
[00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:08.646]  And they thought it was still a little bit of a joke 15 years ago.
[00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:19.134]  But then, since then, they've gone from thinking maybe, maybe we really are in occupied territory to saying, absolutely, Alex, and it's worse than you say.
[00:11:19.134 --> 00:11:20.815]  Because the bottom has fallen out.
[00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:28.531]  There are no restraints anymore on tyranny other than our non-compliance and our voting with our dollars.
[00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:35.833]  And those are still massive resistance points, but when you talk about government and institutions, the dam has broken at the federal level.
[00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:42.655]  The federal government is fully captured and fully run by foreign globalist interests.
[00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:45.536]  There are a few final citadels of reason.
[00:11:49.895 --> 00:12:00.242]  Like Senator Rand Paul, and he is decried as an enemy of the state for standing with the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:12:00.242 --> 00:12:05.485]  And I come on air almost every day and I'm stunned now.
[00:12:05.485 --> 00:12:10.989]  Because basically everything I talked about 20 years ago has now happened.
[00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:19.314]  And now what we're talking about is coming next, in the next 5 to 10 years, will happen, but by then we won't be on the air if they complete their takeover.
[00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:32.461]  I mean, we know the enemy plan, we know how hardcore it is, we know how real it is, and I just wish the general public knew how much peril they were in.
[00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:42.488]  I mean, we got really bad people getting control, who've premeditatedly planned to carry out scientific wickedness, because that's who they are.
[00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.180]  Let me just give you the headlines, and we'll see if I can control myself.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.881]  I've never been able to do this.
[00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:56.665]  Back when I was first on air 20 years ago, I could go through all the headlines and just read them, but it's become a neuroses where I just cannot just hit the headline and then go back over it.
[00:12:56.665 --> 00:12:59.806]  I have to just hit four or five stories and stop on one.
[00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:02.687]  It's like the owl and the old Tootsie Roll commercials.
[00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:04.428]  Can we find that?
[00:13:04.428 --> 00:13:05.308]  How many?
[00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:06.889]  You go to the wise old owl to find out.
[00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.228]  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll?
[00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:15.609]  Mr. Turtle, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll?
[00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:18.649]  I never made it without biting.
[00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:18.989]  Has Mr. Owl.
[00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:36.434]  Mr. Owl, how many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll Center of a Tootsie Pop?
[00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:38.394]  Let's find out.
[00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.375]  One, two, three, three.
[00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:48.778]  How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll Center of a Tootsie Pop?
[00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:51.979]  The world may never know.
[00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:54.859]  That's right, but today is the day.
[00:13:54.859 --> 00:13:59.661]  I'm going to read at least 50 news headlines without biting.
[00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.652]  Associated Press.
[00:14:04.652 --> 00:14:07.594]  FBI behind mysterious surveillance aircraft over U.S.
[00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.796]  cities.
[00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:12.237]  Salon.
[00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:22.424]  Continued bulk data collection by NSA is part of Rand Paul's white privilege racism.
[00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:26.007]  It's hard not to comment on that one.
[00:14:26.007 --> 00:14:28.368]  Cultural cleansing of Christian males.
[00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:28.989]  Pat Buchanan.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:40.385]  Video, Muslims prefer Sharia on blasphemy laws in the US.
[00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:45.488]  Bilderberg 2015, elites prepare for nuclear and economic devastation.
[00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.909]  Special report, InfoWars.com.
[00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:50.491]  Video, that's coming up.
[00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:54.753]  Rule by the corporations, TTIP, the Corporate Empowerment Act.
[00:14:54.753 --> 00:14:55.974]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:07.153]  Hacked emails expose George Soros as Ukraine puppet master.
[00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:11.658]  Florida court rules off-the-grid living illegal.
[00:15:11.658 --> 00:15:16.162]  Maine takes major step towards removing concealed weapons permit mandate.
[00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:19.605]  Liberals worship Caitlyn Jenner as transgender goddess.
[00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:22.328]  Cult-like adulation is downright creepy.
[00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.006]  Colts the word.
[00:15:26.006 --> 00:15:29.168]  Obama prepares to restrict guns outside of law.
[00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:32.151]  Makes draconian announcement.
[00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:33.311]  Trendies.
[00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:35.653]  Ready for ultimate wearable.
[00:15:35.653 --> 00:15:37.494]  Chip implanted in their skin.
[00:15:37.494 --> 00:15:40.697]  Used for payments.
[00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:43.639]  It's all being announced.
[00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:43.939]  U.S.
[00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:49.103]  delivers 2,000 rockets for Iraq but holds half back.
[00:15:49.103 --> 00:15:49.663]  Obama.
[00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:53.366]  I will never engage in politics in which I'm trying to divide people.
[00:15:54.701 --> 00:15:55.962]  Well, that's funny.
[00:15:55.962 --> 00:15:57.323]  That's a good one.
[00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.404]  We've never been at war in East Asia either, right?
[00:15:59.404 --> 00:16:02.726]  Our big brother loves me.
[00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:03.466]  Double plus good.
[00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:10.010]  Let me just stop right there on that stack.
[00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.073]  Vince Vaughn is as pro-gun as it gets.
[00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.394]  Makes powerful announcements.
[00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:17.155]  Will be targeted.
[00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.131]  Teachers complain chaos reigns as St.
[00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:30.214]  Paul schools spend millions on white privilege training.
[00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:33.135]  Pentagon anthrax scandal spreads to Canada.
[00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:35.516]  So they're mailing anthrax all over the place.
[00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:37.777]  Well they did it before, back in 2001, went on again.
[00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:40.958]  Does that count as biting into the Tootsie Roll?
[00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:41.458]  Not exactly.
[00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:45.849]  How ABC World's News Tonight became a ratings winner.
[00:16:45.849 --> 00:16:46.649]  That's total spin.
[00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:47.910]  They've all plunged.
[00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.011]  It's just this is the turd that's floating at the top.
[00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:55.272]  Excuse my French, but the allegory does fit, doesn't it?
[00:16:55.272 --> 00:17:06.156]  Sometimes the vulgar in the repertoire of the semantical lexicon is the proper colloquialism in the nomenclature to communicate the larger verbiage to the population as a whole.
[00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:10.228]  Study.
[00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:16.010]  Painkillers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicides.
[00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.891]  CBS News.
[00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:21.812]  Oh, another conspiracy theory comes true.
[00:17:21.812 --> 00:17:24.633]  Not brushing your teeth can lead to dementia and heart disease.
[00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:30.235]  That's been known forever, but now more studies.
[00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:34.437]  That's just some of what we're going to be going over.
[00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:36.837]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance.
[00:17:36.837 --> 00:17:38.258]  Transabled people
[00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:54.662]  Are like imposters in their fully working bodies and the new move, National Post, is you're going to pay for people that have their arms and legs chopped off that want to live in baskets and be pushed around by their perv daddies.
[00:17:54.662 --> 00:17:57.742]  Oh, of course, it's sexual in nature.
[00:17:57.742 --> 00:18:02.524]  Continuing, we're going to break all of this down.
[00:18:02.524 --> 00:18:06.585]  Company launches mood-changing wearable that zaps brains.
[00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.665]  Well, that's what the TV already does to you.
[00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:10.706]  And this is a headline out of Quartz.
[00:18:11.854 --> 00:18:16.716]  We now spend more than eight hours a day consuming media.
[00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:20.218]  Google's project gets it right.
[00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:21.378]  New wearable jeans.
[00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:24.920]  That ties into all that information.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.881]  Ten years without a hurricane hitting.
[00:18:27.881 --> 00:18:30.002]  It's Florida's lucky streak about to end.
[00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:39.492]  Well, I mean, Al Gore said we had record hurricanes last year, even though we had the lowest amount since the National Weather Service said since 1960.
[00:18:39.492 --> 00:18:40.273]  But, I mean, who cares?
[00:18:40.273 --> 00:18:43.574]  We didn't have any hurricanes last year that hit the U.S.
[00:18:43.574 --> 00:18:45.175]  Al Gore said it was devastating.
[00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.816]  We had record amounts.
[00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:48.777]  And he said the Antarctic melted.
[00:18:48.777 --> 00:18:51.078]  Doesn't matter, it's the largest ever recorded.
[00:18:51.078 --> 00:18:53.760]  Ice.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.701]  How far the ice reaches and how thick it is.
[00:18:56.874 --> 00:18:58.754]  Doesn't matter how Gore controls reality.
[00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:06.836]  It's like when Winston's been told by O'Brien in 1984, when he's torturing him, he says, listen, don't think that we can't suspend the laws of gravity with our mathematicians.
[00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:08.296]  It won't matter if we don't really do it.
[00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:10.797]  We'll torture you until you believe it!
[00:19:10.797 --> 00:19:13.837]  How many fingers am I holding up?
[00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:14.497]  Four.
[00:19:14.497 --> 00:19:15.037]  Tortures him.
[00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:15.717]  No, I'm not.
[00:19:15.717 --> 00:19:16.218]  How many?
[00:19:16.218 --> 00:19:17.638]  Five, ten, twelve, fifty.
[00:19:17.638 --> 00:19:18.778]  He goes, that's right.
[00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:22.459]  You will say I'm holding up what I tell you and you'll believe it.
[00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:23.619]  He holds up four fingers again.
[00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:27.798]  And he tells him he sees five and he sees five.
[00:19:27.798 --> 00:19:31.123]  And he goes, now I'm gonna free you.
[00:19:31.123 --> 00:19:33.386]  Now you've, now you've been cured.
[00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:40.259]  Obama never said that Obamacare was free.
[00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:42.980]  He always said it would triple prices.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.861]  That's right.
[00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:44.681]  That's right.
[00:19:44.681 --> 00:19:47.002]  And he always said there were death panels.
[00:19:47.002 --> 00:19:49.563]  That they were good for the old people and the veterans.
[00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.043]  Of course, he said none of that was true.
[00:19:51.043 --> 00:19:51.683]  Of course, it is.
[00:19:51.683 --> 00:19:52.824]  But does it matter?
[00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.345]  We've got to learn to love Big B!
[00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:56.745]  Big B!
[00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:57.485]  Big Brother!
[00:19:57.485 --> 00:19:58.706]  I love you!
[00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.206]  Thank you, Obama!

[00:22:06.287 --> 00:22:11.048]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.

[00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:56.946]  Come and take it!
[00:24:01.387 --> 00:24:08.395]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:08.395 --> 00:24:12.759]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:14.261]  Already the second day of June 2015.
[00:24:16.693 --> 00:24:26.097]  Alright, earlier at the start of the broadcast, if you just joined us, I talked about a story out of the National Post, the big national paper of Canada, out of Ottawa, their capital.
[00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:32.921]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled people, learn that term, your children will be taught about it.
[00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:37.465]  They'll come to you and say they want their fingers and arms chopped off and legs chopped off.
[00:24:37.465 --> 00:24:38.807]  I'm not joking.
[00:24:38.807 --> 00:24:43.251]  And if you don't let them, the state will hover in and say that you're abusing your children and will take them from you.
[00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:45.694]  This is actually what I'm predicting ten years from now.
[00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:46.355]  Maybe even five.
[00:24:47.628 --> 00:24:54.791]  Becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled people feel like imposters in their own fully working bodies.
[00:24:54.791 --> 00:25:03.053]  And it was about, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago, I don't buy tickets to South by Southwest, but I was invited to go down as media and see some of the films.
[00:25:03.053 --> 00:25:15.598]  So I just randomly had a pass I've been given and I went in to one that was about, I'm forgetting the name of it, but we were able to Google it and find it, a nugget porn.
[00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:22.434]  Basically, it's one of the terms used, but it's the people that have their arms and legs chopped off, and you never stop.
[00:25:22.434 --> 00:25:30.759]  Then they usually commit suicide after that, because they're into death, they're into being helpless, and it's a sexual perversion that comes out of the, quote, gay community.
[00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:33.480]  But nothing can be perverse out of the gay community, I'm sorry.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.802]  So it's the new wondrous thing.
[00:25:35.802 --> 00:25:45.228]  They also shoot each other with .357 Magnums and blow big holes in each other, and then try to mutilate the wounds so they're big and ugly.
[00:25:46.448 --> 00:25:49.951]  And then do things with the wounds.
[00:25:49.951 --> 00:25:53.154]  But notice the rollout of it is it's a wonderful new thing.
[00:25:53.154 --> 00:26:02.301]  There are these poor victims and they just have the opposite of the syndrome where you can't feel your arms or your legs.
[00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:04.483]  Well here, they just don't feel connected to them.
[00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:06.324]  They just don't feel like they're part of their body.
[00:26:06.324 --> 00:26:11.208]  It's oppressing them and they're trans-abled by becoming disabled.
[00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.730]  They also, for twenty-something years, have bug chasers.
[00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:19.527]  Men who go around wanting to get HIV or Hepatitis.
[00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:23.710]  And then you have the men that give it to them, where men will go.
[00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:35.220]  I mean, you can read the Rolling Stone article about it and others, and have like 50 guys line up and do you know what inside of them, hoping to catch some diseases.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.605]  And then if you don't like that and don't want your five-year-old to talk about it, again, you hate the gay people.
[00:26:40.605 --> 00:26:43.087]  And this is where decadent collapsing societies go.
[00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:48.035]  And then they sell tolerance, and then it never ends.
[00:26:48.035 --> 00:26:57.641]  So, it goes on to say, becoming disabled by choice, not chance, trans-abled people feel like impostors in their fully working bodies.
[00:26:57.641 --> 00:27:02.364]  Again, parental discretion is advised.
[00:27:02.364 --> 00:27:06.506]  This is part of the Humanities series, to learn the wonderful humanities.
[00:27:06.506 --> 00:27:11.750]  When he cut off his right arm, very sharp power tool, a man who now calls himself one-handed Jason,
[00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:15.776]  Let everyone believe it was an accident.
[00:27:15.776 --> 00:27:22.077]  But he had for months tried different means of cutting or crushing the limb that never quite felt like his own.
[00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:30.499]  Training himself on first aid so he wouldn't bleed to death, even practicing on animal parts sourced from a butcher.
[00:27:30.499 --> 00:27:32.520]  So see, you're not Jeffrey Dahmer-esque.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.640]  No, you're an artist!
[00:27:34.676 --> 00:27:39.177]  My goal was to get the job done with no hope of reconstructing or reattaching.
[00:27:39.177 --> 00:27:41.358]  So he should have gone and helped people in charity.
[00:27:41.358 --> 00:27:42.998]  He should have gone and climbed mountains.
[00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:44.499]  He should have joined a boxing club.
[00:27:44.499 --> 00:27:45.499]  But no.
[00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:49.780]  How much you want to bet this guy mommy did everything for him?
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.461]  My goal was to get the job done and it goes into him.
[00:27:52.461 --> 00:27:55.301]  It's the dark side of rights inflation.
[00:27:55.301 --> 00:28:00.283]  Why activists should reject the impulse to frame all grievances as human rights.
[00:28:00.283 --> 00:28:01.423]  And that's because they are now
[00:28:04.445 --> 00:28:06.707]  Pushing it as a right in Germany.
[00:28:06.707 --> 00:28:13.112]  East German sex spies to negate and crack everything you need to know about Canada's scandalous history.
[00:28:13.112 --> 00:28:14.173]  And then it breaks it all down.
[00:28:14.173 --> 00:28:18.276]  It says his goal was to become disabled.
[00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:26.803]  Now, they're rolling out a cutesy case for you and then posing it like, should this be a new right and a new cool thing we pay for?
[00:28:26.803 --> 00:28:27.704]  Like sex changes.
[00:28:27.704 --> 00:28:29.125]  Hey, you want to get a sex change?
[00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.186]  That's your issue.
[00:28:30.186 --> 00:28:33.568]  I shouldn't have to pay for your elective medical procedures.
[00:28:34.451 --> 00:28:35.932]  Like a nose job!
[00:28:35.932 --> 00:28:43.396]  I don't want to pay for your daughter's nose job because she wants to look like a Barbie doll and wants to chop her noble nose off.
[00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:44.076]  Understand?
[00:28:44.076 --> 00:28:48.879]  Oh my gosh, you hate women!
[00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:49.979]  No I don't!
[00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:51.960]  I'm sick of paying for everything!
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:00.085]  Now when we come back from break, Matt, here in the office I was back in the back having a debate with folks saying no.
[00:29:01.547 --> 00:29:07.612]  This is not something where people just don't recognize their body parts.
[00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:10.555]  That's the cover.
[00:29:10.555 --> 00:29:16.440]  This is actually a sicko movement that's into mutilation and is generally sexually connected.
[00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:21.611]  And Matt goes, oh yeah, I knew guys going to college that were into nugget porn.
[00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:23.291]  I went, that's right.
[00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:34.516]  That's how the people make money on the side that are, when you live in a box with your arms and legs cut off and your, and your perv daddy, that's what they call him, I guess, comes over and, and, and, and does things to you and, and then puts diapers on you.
[00:29:34.516 --> 00:29:42.779]  And I'm sorry to talk like this, folks, but we're not going to let them roll this out up front as cute and fun to sell it to our kids, just like they sell Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:44.300]  We're going to destroy it up front.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.406]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.406 --> 00:29:55.012]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.478 --> 00:30:08.126]  It becomes more apparent every day that movie stars who don't swear allegiance to leftist dogma are targeted and in some cases blacklisted altogether.
[00:30:08.126 --> 00:30:10.408]  Earlier this year, Robert Downey Jr.
[00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:15.853]  was berated, rather pathetically I might add, by a reporter for not being liberal enough.
[00:30:15.853 --> 00:30:17.234]  Does that mean you're not a liberal?
[00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:21.318]  The reporter asked, to which Downey responds, are we promoting a movie?
[00:30:21.318 --> 00:30:25.161]  He then went on to assert that he is not a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:30:25.161 --> 00:30:25.362]  Now,
[00:30:26.022 --> 00:30:29.684]  Actor Vince Vaughn is in hot water for standing up for gun rights.
[00:30:29.684 --> 00:30:31.364]  It's not about duck hunting.
[00:30:31.364 --> 00:30:33.805]  It's about the ability of the individual.
[00:30:33.805 --> 00:30:37.167]  It's the same reason we have freedom of speech, Vaughn said.
[00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:38.387]  And he's right.
[00:30:38.387 --> 00:30:39.948]  And he's not the only one.
[00:30:39.948 --> 00:30:46.091]  Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, and Carl Malone, to name a few, are also outspoken advocates for the Second Amendment.
[00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:53.854]  I know that standing up for individual rights isn't as trendy as saying men are misogynist from birth, but it is something we need nonetheless.
[00:30:53.854 --> 00:30:59.096]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:06.298]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:38.852]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:32:38.852 --> 00:32:42.634]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:54.338]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:08.667]  You want answers?
[00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:10.528]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:21.217]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.217 --> 00:33:28.483]  You probably have never heard me talk about nugget porn or transabled.
[00:33:28.483 --> 00:33:29.424]  That's not the name of it.
[00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:32.487]  By the people that practice it.
[00:33:32.487 --> 00:33:35.309]  That's the new politically correct term to push it.
[00:33:35.309 --> 00:33:39.053]  But we're covering it now because we have to, because they're getting ready to roll it out.
[00:33:39.053 --> 00:33:40.094]  Worldwide.
[00:33:40.094 --> 00:33:42.236]  As the new perversion.
[00:33:42.236 --> 00:33:51.584]  Because once they can destabilize your central nervous system to accept things that aren't natural, the globalists can push their other agendas once you don't have any morals or murring.
[00:33:51.584 --> 00:33:53.386]  This is a scientific takeover plan.
[00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:56.305]  Oh, you're just not cool.
[00:33:56.305 --> 00:34:03.527]  You don't like to chop your fingers and then your arm off, and you know, you don't think it's sexy to cook your own arm and eat it.
[00:34:03.527 --> 00:34:06.968]  That's also part of this whole genre.
[00:34:06.968 --> 00:34:08.089]  Out of Hellraiser.
[00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:13.030]  Out of Dante's Ninth Circle.
[00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:21.433]  But then they want you, and that's what the Canadian News is reporting on, the National Post, they want you to pay to have their arms and legs cut off.
[00:34:21.433 --> 00:34:24.074]  That way it's done properly and done by professionals.
[00:34:26.567 --> 00:34:29.270]  Now in case you think I'm lying, has anyone ever mentioned that people don't believe me?
[00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.013]  We'll put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:34:31.013 --> 00:34:34.157]  Rolling Stone on bug chasers.
[00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:38.922]  Just type in men who are in search of death.
[00:34:38.922 --> 00:34:40.024]  Cover story.
[00:34:40.024 --> 00:34:40.785]  Rolling Stone.
[00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:41.285]  2003.
[00:34:41.285 --> 00:34:42.207]  I covered it 20 years ago.
[00:34:45.387 --> 00:34:54.197]  People who want to get HIV, who want to have solidarity with folks that have it, and then they get it, and then they become givers.
[00:34:54.197 --> 00:35:01.465]  And people sign contracts so they can't be indicted, because it's a felony to obviously give somebody HIV if you know you've got it, and you don't tell them.
[00:35:01.465 --> 00:35:03.707]  It's like, please give me the gift!
[00:35:03.707 --> 00:35:04.708]  Oh, it's so trendy!
[00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:11.971]  This is what happened in every society that got decadent where there was too much food, too much water, too much freedom.
[00:35:11.971 --> 00:35:22.873]  Sick societies form that demand unlimited everything from the productive and the productive that, you know, never get, women who never get tired of their husband.
[00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:25.914]  Men who love their wives or love their girlfriends.
[00:35:25.914 --> 00:35:32.976]  People that, you know, I never get sick of a Dos Equis lager and cheese enchiladas or fajitas.
[00:35:35.256 --> 00:35:47.967]  I know folks are like, I gotta go have escargot, or I gotta go have carzoo marzoo, that rich people pay a thousand dollars a plate for in New York, that's maggots and rotting cheese.
[00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:57.775]  I've been in New York restaurants when I've been up there, and well-to-do folks have invited me out to dinner, and I've seen carzoo marzoo on the special little insert.
[00:35:57.775 --> 00:36:01.719]  By the way, they got illegal stuff in New York that's human bones out of catacombs.
[00:36:03.038 --> 00:36:10.820]  That they fly in out of Italy, the Mafia does, I forget the name of it, and they boil it in delicious soup.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.340]  You know what?
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.360]  I don't think I'm going to have the human bone soup.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:13.820]  You know what?
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.421]  I'm not going to have the maggot cheese.
[00:36:17.421 --> 00:36:21.702]  I think I'm going to have the veal piccata.
[00:36:21.702 --> 00:36:24.423]  And then the folks are like, oh, that's a baby cow!
[00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:26.543]  How evil of you!
[00:36:26.543 --> 00:36:28.644]  The point is, see how the mindset is twisted?
[00:36:29.718 --> 00:36:33.939]  Where anything sick or degenerate is automatically elevated to, oh, you just don't get it.
[00:36:33.939 --> 00:36:35.379]  Oh no, I get it.
[00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:39.040]  I get it.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.362]  It's not like I lived some repressed lifestyle growing up in Dallas, Texas in the 80s and 90s.
[00:36:44.362 --> 00:36:46.742]  And then coming to Austin.
[00:36:46.742 --> 00:36:48.023]  It's not like I haven't been around the block.
[00:36:49.091 --> 00:36:52.935]  I understand all this stuff because I've seen people I've known that have gotten into it.
[00:36:52.935 --> 00:36:56.218]  It's like the drug culture, the self-destructive culture.
[00:36:56.218 --> 00:36:57.239]  That's what this is about.
[00:36:57.239 --> 00:37:03.965]  That's why gay men have the lowest life expectancy of anyone in the world.
[00:37:03.965 --> 00:37:05.046]  In the world!
[00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:06.828]  People say, oh, it's because it's not accepted.
[00:37:06.828 --> 00:37:08.409]  It's because they're not liked.
[00:37:08.409 --> 00:37:08.590]  No!
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.642]  It's because it's a nihilistic party culture on average.
[00:37:15.642 --> 00:37:17.543]  On average, it's destructive.
[00:37:17.543 --> 00:37:20.504]  And I'm not here judging anybody.
[00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:24.506]  You don't freak me out two guys together.
[00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:29.148]  It's that I know that it's unhealthy in the spectrum.
[00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.671]  Now, are people that are into that lifestyle on average hierarchies?
[00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:36.191]  Do they create a lot of stuff?
[00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:37.752]  Absolutely!
[00:37:37.752 --> 00:37:42.333]  Is there some nice things about that whole destructive culture?
[00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:47.975]  Certainly, it has some manifestations that are positive, but in the whole, no.
[00:37:47.975 --> 00:37:53.277]  Alone, mean, treating each other badly.
[00:37:53.277 --> 00:37:55.477]  Incredible promiscuity.
[00:37:55.477 --> 00:37:56.678]  It is death.
[00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:59.733]  The wages of sin are death.
[00:37:59.733 --> 00:38:01.814]  What was that headline from Rolling Stone?
[00:38:01.814 --> 00:38:07.235]  In search of death.
[00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:09.936]  In search of death.
[00:38:09.936 --> 00:38:17.317]  Wanting to get HIV, wanting to get hepatitis, wanting to chop your arms and legs off, wanting to live 20 years.
[00:38:17.317 --> 00:38:21.038]  I was reading this one article about one of these guys living in a box.
[00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:30.025]  They like to be walled off in a box except when their owner shows up to change them and feed them and rape them and you know all the rest of it.
[00:38:33.297 --> 00:38:36.640]  And then usually the abuse gets bad where they'll be left for days.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.442]  And then they beg and wiggle around in their own excrement.
[00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.784]  And I'm sorry to be gross, folks, but let's just get all this out in the open.
[00:38:41.784 --> 00:38:43.725]  And then beg to be taken care of.
[00:38:43.725 --> 00:38:54.034]  And then finally, their lover, close quote, leaves them to die with flies all over them in their closet, in their basket, in their cardboard box.
[00:38:56.818 --> 00:39:07.448]  And now taxpayers, just like I've got to pay for abortions if I live in Travis County, Austin, Texas, chopping babies up is liberal and trendy, well now chopping your own arms and legs off is trendy.
[00:39:11.297 --> 00:39:18.481]  And so, if you want to know what's hot at UT, or what's the big deal at colleges around the country, let's bring Matt on.
[00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:26.846]  I recently graduated from college, worked in radio and TV, works here in our office, and I was having an argument back there explaining that this is not really an argument.
[00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:30.488]  I was saying, no, the media is selling this as they just don't like their limbs.
[00:39:30.488 --> 00:39:36.992]  In the main line, where this came from, is homosexual men wanting to hurt their bodies.
[00:39:38.396 --> 00:39:43.400]  And wanting to catch HIV, and wanting to commit suicide, and wanting to be hurt.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.001]  And, uh, it's incredible.
[00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:47.362]  It's mentally ill.
[00:39:47.362 --> 00:39:52.986]  I mean, if a heterosexual went out and started hacking themselves with a hatchet, they'd be thrown in a mental institution and should be.
[00:39:52.986 --> 00:39:53.787]  But no!
[00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:54.688]  No, no, no!
[00:39:54.688 --> 00:40:00.952]  When a artist does it... You know, Vincent Van Gogh was insane, folks.
[00:40:00.952 --> 00:40:05.655]  Probably had lead and mercury poisoning when he cut his ear off and gave it to the prostitute.
[00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:06.136]  For payment.
[00:40:07.005 --> 00:40:08.405]  Because she wouldn't give him anymore.
[00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.145]  He was in love with her.
[00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:16.607]  Now you can call that romantic, but it was still mental illness to take a razor blade and chop his ear off.
[00:40:16.607 --> 00:40:18.147]  Was he a genius?
[00:40:18.147 --> 00:40:21.948]  Absolutely.
[00:40:21.948 --> 00:40:23.128]  Was he mentally ill?
[00:40:23.128 --> 00:40:25.148]  Absolutely.
[00:40:25.148 --> 00:40:28.949]  Matt, tell us about Nugget Porn.
[00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:35.310]  Well, you know, once you get into Nugget Porn, there's really no going back.
[00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.130]  Or at least I hear.
[00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:38.853]  But again, none of this exists.
[00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:41.134]  We're just being hateful.
[00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:46.137]  Without getting into too much detail, what we have to expose is so folks know what to look out for out there as this is being pushed.
[00:40:46.137 --> 00:40:51.320]  What do you make of them rolling it out in the news that it's the new cute, cool thing to do?
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:59.665]  Well, I don't know what to say other than it's a great conversation starter.
[00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:00.926]  Have you ever seen nugget porn?
[00:41:03.304 --> 00:41:05.145]  Can I admit that on air?
[00:41:05.145 --> 00:41:08.306]  If you want to tell the truth or don't, I mean, you told me earlier you haven't.
[00:41:08.306 --> 00:41:14.329]  Yeah, no, it was a big joke, but it is a great conversation starter.
[00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:22.572]  People think you're very progressive and nuggets are people too, and so they should be admired.
[00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:23.632]  Okay, so you're being serious.
[00:41:23.632 --> 00:41:27.674]  Describe what university you were going to and the worship of the nuggets.
[00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:37.623]  So up at Illinois State, you can catch my roommates or I running around just, you know, messing with people.
[00:41:37.623 --> 00:41:42.429]  But yeah, it is a real thing and it is kind of sick.
[00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:56.085]  Yeah, you guys were just joking about it because it was, or they were joking about it because it was sick, you told me, but there were folks that were into it, and are you serious that folks were saying this was in the trendy circle, something that was to be admired?
[00:41:56.085 --> 00:41:59.006]  Because I guess it's called a nugget because there's no arms or legs.
[00:41:59.006 --> 00:42:01.186]  It's more like a snail.
[00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:08.489]  Yeah, it's a sick slang term, and you can find it on Answers.com.
[00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:09.669]  I'm searching for it right now.
[00:42:12.042 --> 00:42:14.750]  Well, the issue here is this is real.
[00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.964]  How prevalent was the discussion or the viewing, if you know, of nugget porn?
[00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:23.517]  Well, it's obviously got a niche.
[00:42:23.517 --> 00:42:28.662]  It's a pretty well-known name, and it's right here on Answers.
[00:42:28.662 --> 00:42:37.269]  And so, they're saying... Nugget porn is when a person has no legs or arms, a nugget, and they porn, but it's self-explanatory.
[00:42:37.269 --> 00:42:45.637]  It's generally very disturbing seeing women of such disability put through such things they are normally forced to take part in in these films.
[00:42:45.637 --> 00:42:47.798]  Yeah, it's basically horrible rape porn.
[00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:55.161]  In my view, I've never seen it because I will not look at such things, that it's about people that want to see oppression.
[00:42:55.161 --> 00:43:00.263]  Another big sexy thing that we covered a few years ago, according to these people, is the torture of animals.
[00:43:00.263 --> 00:43:05.805]  Beautiful women stomping on kitty cats, stomping on puppies, sometimes stomping their brains out.
[00:43:05.805 --> 00:43:11.107]  I will not watch it, but I've read the criminal reports of folks indicted for doing it to make the porn.
[00:43:11.627 --> 00:43:15.309]  In fact, guys, will you look up what the name of torturing animals in porn is?
[00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:17.250]  But it's also super trendy.
[00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.653]  And the liberals say this should be accepted when it's sexual because it's a form of art.
[00:43:21.653 --> 00:43:24.755]  And again, I guess that would be torture animalphobe.
[00:43:24.755 --> 00:43:29.177]  I'm against raping children, so that would be a pedophobe.
[00:43:30.518 --> 00:43:38.740]  And I guess if you're against paying for or having people chop their arms and legs off, I am a trans-abled phobe.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:44.622]  Would you say that you're a trans-abled phobe or a nugget phobe, Matt?
[00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:45.922]  Yeah, I'm not really into that.
[00:43:45.922 --> 00:43:48.383]  That kind of freaks me out.
[00:43:48.383 --> 00:43:48.883]  All right.
[00:43:48.883 --> 00:43:50.103]  Well, anything else you'd like?
[00:43:50.103 --> 00:43:55.185]  But I mean, you're serious that up there where you went to college, there were some people that actually were like, what?
[00:43:55.185 --> 00:43:56.345]  Don't you dare joke about this.
[00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:57.446]  This is super elegant.
[00:43:57.446 --> 00:43:58.886]  Or were you joking?
[00:44:00.903 --> 00:44:06.524]  It was a joke to us, but other people reacted a lot of different ways.
[00:44:06.524 --> 00:44:09.545]  There were people who, you know, accepted it.
[00:44:09.545 --> 00:44:15.507]  There were people who got freaked out and would just drop the conversation right there and leave.
[00:44:15.507 --> 00:44:19.047]  Do you want to pay to have someone's arms and legs chopped off?
[00:44:19.047 --> 00:44:21.688]  How are my tax dollars going to that?
[00:44:21.688 --> 00:44:22.588]  That really blows my mind.
[00:44:22.588 --> 00:44:24.269]  They are pushing to have people pay for it.
[00:44:24.269 --> 00:44:25.709]  That blows my mind.
[00:44:25.709 --> 00:44:29.550]  Oh, it's makers of crush porn videos in Philippines sentenced to life in prison.
[00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:29.930]  There you go.
[00:44:31.209 --> 00:44:32.610]  Crush porn.
[00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.611]  A tiny kitty or puppy, you kill it.
[00:44:34.611 --> 00:44:38.354]  And you know, when we ran into those commies, they were just like, I kill my kids.
[00:44:38.354 --> 00:44:39.374]  I love it.
[00:44:39.374 --> 00:44:40.255]  It's like this.
[00:44:40.255 --> 00:44:41.996]  I can hurt little things.
[00:44:41.996 --> 00:44:43.317]  I've got power.
[00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:44.878]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:44:44.878 --> 00:44:47.459]  That might be a good question for them.
[00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:51.582]  If they know anything about nugget porn, they might.
[00:44:51.582 --> 00:44:51.942]  Who knows?
[00:44:51.942 --> 00:44:54.304]  They're such wonderful students of history.
[00:44:54.304 --> 00:44:54.684]  Who knows?
[00:44:54.684 --> 00:44:55.324]  All right.
[00:44:55.324 --> 00:44:58.266]  Thank you, Matt.
[00:44:58.266 --> 00:44:59.067]  Nugget porn.
[00:44:59.067 --> 00:44:59.667]  Crush porn.
[00:45:03.752 --> 00:45:12.583]  And again, folks, fighting this almost promotes it, but I've told you there's stuff a lot worse than what we talk about on air, that's some of it, and then it just gets worse.
[00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:18.750]  They've had famous cases in Europe, I'll have Watson write a new article just boiling it all down, in England, in France, in the Netherlands, in...
[00:45:20.988 --> 00:45:36.635]  Finland, in just all those countries, where they'll find a dungeon under some police chief's house, you know, with 18 skeletons of two-year-olds in it, and some two- and three-year-olds in cages that weigh one-half what they should, and satanic pentagrams.
[00:45:36.635 --> 00:45:40.577]  I mean, you know, it's just, that's who runs things, okay?
[00:45:40.577 --> 00:45:47.781]  And then you look over here, with all the pedophiles in Congress, this is what they're into.
[00:45:47.781 --> 00:45:50.482]  They look at Marilyn Monroe, and she's disgusting.
[00:45:52.557 --> 00:45:57.961]  And they think we're bad because we like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:12.111]  They look at a horse, or a dismembered body, or a child, or a dead animal, and they see beauty because they are demons.
[00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:18.175]  Jimmy Savelle, best friends with the Prince of Wales.
[00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:20.377]  Highest level security clearance in the Royal Family.
[00:46:22.233 --> 00:46:30.641]  Had necrophilic sex in the hospitals with the dead children and had a secret torture area for the little girls in the charity he ran.
[00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:37.228]  And while he raped them, he would tell them that Satan was going to inhabit them and suck their soul.
[00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:41.952]  And now they've declared national security because they're beginning to find the dead bodies.
[00:46:41.952 --> 00:46:44.715]  That's who's coming for you when they get your guns.
[00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:46.316]  That's who wants full control.
[00:46:47.185 --> 00:46:50.768]  And once they get a tyranny in place, they will do it to everybody.
[00:46:50.768 --> 00:46:53.309]  They want to pull down everything that's good.
[00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:56.131]  They want to destroy basic human liberty.
[00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:58.193]  They want to overturn everything wholesome.
[00:46:58.193 --> 00:46:59.694]  They are coming.
[00:46:59.694 --> 00:47:01.395]  They are coming.
[00:47:01.395 --> 00:47:02.296]  You think it's bad?
[00:47:02.296 --> 00:47:03.597]  You've seen nothing.
[00:47:03.597 --> 00:47:08.740]  This is only the enemy scouts we've already run into.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.262]  We haven't even been hit by the center of their vanguard.
[00:47:15.009 --> 00:47:17.531]  And they all have that crazed look of Savelle.
[00:47:17.531 --> 00:47:18.512]  You want to know how he looks?
[00:47:18.512 --> 00:47:22.195]  If you're watching us on TV, you can put that headline back up there.
[00:47:22.195 --> 00:47:26.798]  Celebrity's arrest could soar after horrified police discover Jimmy Savelle's secret lair.
[00:47:26.798 --> 00:47:30.561]  And you see that look in his face?
[00:47:30.561 --> 00:47:32.823]  That's the trendy liberal.
[00:47:32.823 --> 00:47:33.424]  Hi!
[00:47:33.424 --> 00:47:36.386]  Oh, yes!
[00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:41.350]  I want to help kids like the Sandusky Foundation with troubled little boys and girls.
[00:47:42.967 --> 00:47:51.170]  And, of course, Savelle was a big anti-gun guy and a big liberal, because he really wants to help you and your family.
[00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.751]  What does Melissa Harris Perry say on MSNBC?
[00:47:54.751 --> 00:47:58.613]  Your kids belong to us.
[00:47:58.613 --> 00:48:02.294]  I'll get you and your little dog, too.
[00:48:02.294 --> 00:48:05.575]  And when I look at these people, I can see them.
[00:48:05.575 --> 00:48:06.736]  I know who they are.
[00:48:08.035 --> 00:48:18.221]  And they've got giant masses of good police, good social workers, good people who are compartmentalized and are so good, they can't recognize what they're right next to.
[00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:35.451]  And they are just like, just like the 18, 17-year-old women that would see the non-threatening Ted Bundy in his gray suit and his yellow Volkswagen going, hey, let's go have some ice cream.
[00:48:35.451 --> 00:48:36.412]  Let's go see a movie.
[00:48:38.237 --> 00:48:39.757]  You sure are a beautiful young lady.
[00:48:39.757 --> 00:48:43.579]  In the back of his mind, I'm going to torture her for a month straight.
[00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:44.919]  I'm going to bite chunks out of her.
[00:48:44.919 --> 00:48:47.160]  I'm going to make her beg for her mommy and daddy.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]  They're never coming.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.401]  That's the music I like to hear.
[00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:55.762]  So you just remember that I've studied these psychopaths.
[00:48:55.762 --> 00:48:58.123]  I know them and I'm the opposite of them.
[00:48:58.123 --> 00:49:00.164]  I am a sheepdog 110%.
[00:49:00.164 --> 00:49:06.666]  I'm looking for other sheepdogs that want to take these people on and want to get in there politically with these wolves and we will tear them down.
[00:49:06.666 --> 00:49:07.786]  We will destroy them.
[00:49:09.028 --> 00:49:11.209]  I have an instinct to nurture and build up the innocent.
[00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:23.271]  I have an instinct to smash the brains out of perverts, smash the brains out of pedophiles, kick their teeth in, drag them down, bring them low, throw them into the sea.
[00:49:23.271 --> 00:49:24.992]  Burden's too good for them.
[00:49:24.992 --> 00:49:27.552]  Hanging's too good for them.
[00:49:27.552 --> 00:49:29.793]  Quote a scene out of Heavy Metal.
[00:49:29.793 --> 00:49:33.014]  They should be cornered to little pieces and buried alive.
[00:49:33.014 --> 00:49:38.115]  And if you don't have that instinct to hate predators that want to feed on innocent, you're not alive.
[00:49:42.096 --> 00:49:50.999]  Now, before I go any further, we're going to come back from break and shift gears into world news, the attack on the Second Amendment, bombshell news on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:49:50.999 --> 00:50:03.404]  But briefly, when I announced that we're selling out of survival shield nascent iodine X2 with the incredible properties and just it's the good allergen and just what it does is a game changer in my body, I know.
[00:50:03.404 --> 00:50:05.644]  It's amazing, just a chain reaction.
[00:50:05.644 --> 00:50:09.266]  You got to go to the detox first though, it hits most people in two weeks.
[00:50:09.266 --> 00:50:09.906]  It's hardcore.
[00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:13.766]  Hardcore, the amount of energy it's given me, you name it.
[00:50:13.766 --> 00:50:14.947]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:14.947 --> 00:50:16.768]  And I started announcing we had a limited supply.
[00:50:16.768 --> 00:50:19.089]  I thought it'd take three weeks to sell out.
[00:50:19.089 --> 00:50:22.251]  At current rates, it's going to sell out in about five, six days.
[00:50:22.251 --> 00:50:25.272]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:26.913]  We've never sold out of X2.
[00:50:26.913 --> 00:50:29.995]  We sold out of original Survival Shield a couple times.
[00:50:29.995 --> 00:50:35.057]  The problem is, is that the process is really hard to do because it's pure.
[00:50:35.057 --> 00:50:37.879]  It's put into gas form and then injected into the organic palm oil.
[00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:44.226]  And we are running low on the supply of crystals itself.
[00:50:44.226 --> 00:50:48.090]  It could be a few months until we get more, and then after that, who knows?
[00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:56.278]  I hate to even announce that because it's a good selling issue up front, but it's true that we're running out, so mid-term, long-term, we could never have it again, potentially.
[00:50:56.278 --> 00:50:57.098]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:58.911 --> 00:51:05.056]  So I say to Market Lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[00:51:05.056 --> 00:51:10.860]  And I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.002]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:51:13.002 --> 00:51:17.406]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.

[00:51:58.531 --> 00:52:00.472]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:04.093]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:52:04.093 --> 00:52:05.453]  A pair of scissors.
[00:52:05.453 --> 00:52:11.255]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:52:11.255 --> 00:52:16.177]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:52:16.177 --> 00:52:17.157]  The phone line.
[00:52:17.157 --> 00:52:22.419]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:52:22.419 --> 00:52:26.140]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.623]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:52:29.623 --> 00:52:32.106]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:36.917]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:36.977 --> 00:53:37.757]  This capitalism?
[00:53:37.757 --> 00:53:43.941]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:43.941 --> 00:53:47.643]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:53:48.584 --> 00:53:49.644]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:53:50.285 --> 00:53:50.565]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:12.502]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:12.502 --> 00:54:12.962]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:12.962 --> 00:54:14.525]  Central we're here live.
[00:54:14.525 --> 00:54:19.151]  You see once I get into subjects like this so people understand what we're fighting.
[00:54:19.151 --> 00:54:26.742]  Just like abortion leads to killing babies, killing the handicapped, killing old people, putting veterans on don't treat list.
[00:54:29.009 --> 00:54:30.630]  This all comes out of snuff porn.
[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:32.291]  And I should have said that at the first.
[00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:34.432]  Joe Jennings said this all comes out of snuff porn.
[00:54:34.432 --> 00:54:39.734]  And snuff porn has been going on for a hundred years since film started.
[00:54:39.734 --> 00:54:42.756]  And it's where men, women, children are killed on tape.
[00:54:42.756 --> 00:54:46.177]  Hollywood gets busted all the time importing it out of Eastern Europe.
[00:54:46.177 --> 00:54:47.418]  It's kept very, very quiet.
[00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:56.965]  But the FBI does bust people, and the descriptions of snuff porn in a national Italian TV piece that came out a few years ago was incredible.
[00:54:56.965 --> 00:55:00.087]  By the way, they fired both the reporters that put it out, it was true.
[00:55:00.087 --> 00:55:10.974]  They were paying upwards of $50,000 per VHS tape, that's how it was put on there, non-digital, of two-year-olds in Russia being raped and their heads being blown off.
[00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:14.696]  And look, I don't normally talk about stuff like this, but it's in the news.
[00:55:14.696 --> 00:55:15.677]  People need to know.
[00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:23.154]  And then Joe Biggs ran up here and said, the back office told him he had to come tell the story because they're back there watching and listening right now.
[00:55:23.154 --> 00:55:25.435]  Joe Biggs ran into this.
[00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:28.857]  And that's where crush porn comes from, herding dogs, herding cats.
[00:55:28.857 --> 00:55:29.897]  You get arrested for that.
[00:55:29.897 --> 00:55:33.559]  So people do it with rats and mice.
[00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:36.141]  And wait till Joe Biggs tells the story.
[00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:44.305]  I meant to shift gears into other news, but we're putting bookends on this right now to understand the type of just abject evil being pushed.
[00:55:44.305 --> 00:55:45.086]  I mean, what's next?
[00:55:46.289 --> 00:55:47.550]  Joe Biggs.
[00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:57.398]  Yeah, so I had a friend back in Charlie's, one of my best buds, and he started dating this new girl, really attractive lady, but none of us knew what she did.
[00:55:57.398 --> 00:56:01.502]  It was really mysterious, and we kept asking her.
[00:56:01.502 --> 00:56:11.270]  She wouldn't say, and well, one day we were at a party, and I guess she had had a few shots and decided to open up, and I said, well, what is it that you do?
[00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.611]  And she goes, well, I get paid to
[00:56:14.755 --> 00:56:31.425]  Wear lingerie, have a robe over the top, then we get a webcam, film it, I strip down and I wear high heels and I squash cockroaches, goldfish, mice, rats, and it's a fetish porn called crush porn.
[00:56:32.759 --> 00:56:38.121]  Which is really just people who want to see snuff films, but can't pay for it.
[00:56:38.121 --> 00:56:39.962]  And again, this is what evil is, folks.
[00:56:39.962 --> 00:56:41.642]  This is what's running our Congress.
[00:56:41.642 --> 00:56:43.623]  This is why they're doing such evil stuff.
[00:56:43.623 --> 00:56:49.585]  That's why they're doing all these terrible anti-human things, because these are people that have lost their souls.
[00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:52.426]  And Joe, you were telling me that she was incredibly beautiful.
[00:56:52.426 --> 00:56:54.447]  What they're into is the destruction of innocence.
[00:56:54.447 --> 00:56:59.109]  Taking God's creation, a beautiful woman that should be a wife, a mother,
[00:57:00.089 --> 00:57:07.312]  And turning her into a killer of innocents, taking a mother, getting her to kill her babies, that's what this is all about.
[00:57:07.312 --> 00:57:09.353]  Yeah, she only had to do it a few nights a week.
[00:57:09.353 --> 00:57:15.396]  I mean, she had enough money to have a Mercedes Benz and a BMW and a nice house.
[00:57:16.776 --> 00:57:21.538]  And, you know, we started to notice that something was up when her feet really smelled horrible.
[00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:28.320]  And it was from all those, you know, animals and rats and bugs that she was squashing, like butterflies.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.061]  Out of control.
[00:57:30.061 --> 00:57:31.582]  I can never look at her the same again.
[00:57:31.582 --> 00:57:37.844]  And someone actually pays for that, to wash it.
[00:57:37.844 --> 00:57:39.464]  They actually get off on that.
[00:57:41.696 --> 00:57:45.438]  I tell you, it's unbelievable.
[00:57:45.438 --> 00:57:47.420]  Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:54.384]  Again, I mentioned this mutilation porn stuff a long time ago and they have news articles saying I made it up.
[00:57:54.384 --> 00:58:01.569]  Kind of like I mentioned how the chemicals they put in the water make people become basically multisexual by design and give you cancer.
[00:58:01.569 --> 00:58:03.550]  That's all mainstream news now.
[00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:06.212]  This is all planned, folks, and it's just pure
[00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:07.532]  Evil.
[00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:14.895]  It's all about feeding the desires of wicked, twisted, degenerate, aberrant people.
[00:58:14.895 --> 00:58:19.237]  And that's why they want to make us basically accept what they're doing.
[00:58:19.237 --> 00:58:22.819]  That's their ultimate fetish, is conquering us.
[00:58:22.819 --> 00:58:25.060]  This is scum of the earth conquering us.
[00:58:26.417 --> 00:58:40.882]  I mean, Rand Paul came out and said we shouldn't be 1984 and have illegal spying, and they had an FBI informant in Ceylon write an article saying he's racist because we should all be spied on and have no rights to unify us under tyranny is the ultimate liberalism.
[00:58:40.882 --> 00:58:44.343]  See, they're sick cults of tyrants.
[00:58:44.343 --> 00:58:45.443]  They're filth.
[00:58:45.443 --> 00:58:47.664]  They love the aberrant nature of being spied on.
[00:58:48.925 --> 00:59:05.573]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the Nightly News, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:59:05.573 --> 00:59:09.095]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:59:09.435 --> 00:59:13.480]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.042]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:59:15.042 --> 00:59:18.345]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[00:59:18.345 --> 00:59:23.471]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:59:23.471 --> 00:59:24.292]  It's always about security.
[00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:24.732]  Thank you.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.196]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.964]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.964 --> 01:00:11.525]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.086]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:17.269]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.269 --> 01:00:21.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:28.798]  Alright, if you just joined us, we're segwaying out of a nightmare first hour that I don't like covering but had to be covered.
[01:00:30.162 --> 01:00:38.867]  The media now is pushing articles, the National Post and others, the new trendiness is have your arms and legs cut off and have taxpayers pay for it.
[01:00:38.867 --> 01:00:41.408]  So that's the next thing they're pushing.
[01:00:41.408 --> 01:00:42.489]  I mean, why are you against it?
[01:00:42.489 --> 01:00:47.851]  These people are plagued by their arms and legs and you're just not cool enough to understand it.
[01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:52.214]  Meanwhile, I want to come back in the next longer segment and get into several
[01:00:53.493 --> 01:01:00.855]  Very important video clips that I have here dealing with the situation in the South China Sea.
[01:01:00.855 --> 01:01:06.237]  Obama says, I will never engage in politics in which I'm trying to divide people.
[01:01:06.237 --> 01:01:10.298]  That is, of course, another inverse satanic statement by the devil.
[01:01:10.298 --> 01:01:11.958]  You know, they say demons talk backwards.
[01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.459]  That's what all this is.
[01:01:13.459 --> 01:01:14.919]  It's hilarious.
[01:01:14.919 --> 01:01:18.400]  President Obama sternly warns China about South China Sea expansion.
[01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:20.744]  U.S.
[01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.748]  spy plane records China's artificial islands.
[01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:24.849]  China threatens.
[01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:27.572]  That happened last week, but now we have the audio of the encounter.
[01:01:27.572 --> 01:01:31.557]  We're going to play some of that.
[01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:40.807]  We're going to get into what's happening on Capitol Hill in the aftermath of Senator Rand Paul's filibuster two days ago.
[01:01:42.139 --> 01:01:49.103]  Exposing the Patriot Act and holding up its reauthorization, which means they'll probably stage a terror attack now and say that it's his fault.
[01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:52.985]  He's even said that, basically that they hope that happens.
[01:01:52.985 --> 01:02:05.072]  Our own Wayne Madsen is up on Capitol Hill at the National Press Club, where Rand Paul and others are set, I guess it's happening right now, to talk about the 28 pages
[01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:22.489]  And how it, Senators have said, he's having the press conference with former Senator Bob Graham, who's read the secret pages that Saudi Arabia bare minimum was quarterbacking the attack, our government stood down.
[01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:28.534]  That is over the top bombshell, validates everything we said about it being an inside job.
[01:02:28.534 --> 01:02:33.459]  I mean, it's an inside job if I open the door to let a burglar in to rob the house.
[01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:46.105]  Doesn't mean I'm the burglar, it means I opened the door, I knew he was going to do it, I heard he was going to do it, and so I bought a bunch of extra stuff and got insurance on it, knowing he was going to rob, so I ended up getting insurance money.
[01:02:46.105 --> 01:02:48.166]  That's an inside job.
[01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:52.348]  At bare minimum, it is an inside job, and we knew that day one.
[01:02:52.348 --> 01:03:02.393]  Now of course from there, it gets into different agencies involved in the attacks, piggybacking bombs in the buildings on top of the attacks, to then make sure they got the insurance money.
[01:03:04.525 --> 01:03:06.426]  And destroyed all the records that were in there.
[01:03:06.426 --> 01:03:07.787]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.569]  But we're going to have Wayne Madsen.
[01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:11.350]  He's going to start joining us once a week.
[01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:12.511]  I talked to Wayne yesterday.
[01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:14.052]  He does want to get on board with us.
[01:03:14.052 --> 01:03:21.277]  So I'm going to start flying him around the country like I do Joe Biggs at least twice a month to different important events or investigative stories.
[01:03:22.447 --> 01:03:32.409]  That we're working on and he'll be joining us once a week on the radio TV show and he'll be writing articles five days a week for InfoWars.com.
[01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:38.150]  He's a real hardcore journalist, former NSA officer, major whistleblower, really honored to have Wayne Madsen.
[01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:39.831]  We're finalizing the plan this week.
[01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:44.992]  He'll be working with us five days a week, full-time, Wayne Madsen on the InfoWars team.
[01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:50.293]  But that's why I better not skip network breaks like I've already done today.
[01:03:51.374 --> 01:04:07.608]  I better not plug, because it's expensive to fly Joe Biggs to Phoenix and to different cities around the country like Maryland.
[01:04:07.608 --> 01:04:12.092]  It's expensive to send three reporters, Paul Watson from England, from all beyond.
[01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:17.792]  Rob Dew, Josh Owens from Texas are all going to Bilderberg.
[01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:22.554]  This is one of the most important Bilderbergs ever because they're discussing from our inside sources the future of World War III.
[01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:27.116]  They have a special report on that coming up as well after the break.
[01:04:27.116 --> 01:04:28.497]  And we're going to be sending them there.
[01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:31.379]  I would love to go and see the Alps.
[01:04:31.379 --> 01:04:34.980]  It's in the Alps on the Swiss border.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:41.244]  I would love to go and be interviewed by the media and hang out in Europe, but I've just got too much to do here.
[01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.125]  But now I've got the forces
[01:04:44.326 --> 01:04:51.317]  The skeleton crew, but nevertheless the forces, to really magnify our intel and warn the world and the public.
[01:04:51.317 --> 01:04:55.323]  So that's why it's important to go to InfoWarsTore.com and fund our operation.
[01:04:55.323 --> 01:04:57.647]  We're getting great, high-quality products at low prices.
[01:04:59.525 --> 01:05:11.869]  Fresh off their victories against manspreading, for which multiple people have already been arrested in places like New York, feminists are now setting their sights on the highest target possible, Almighty God.
[01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:23.913]  The article, Feminist Clergy Wants Christians to Refer to God as She, breaks down how an activist group over in England, Women in the Church or WATCH, has already had success putting female bishops in the church.
[01:05:24.773 --> 01:05:26.394]  But they didn't stop there.
[01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:29.535]  The chairperson for WATCH was quoted as saying, She told The Telegraph,
[01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:52.978]  Keeping in mind that multiple times throughout the Bible, Jesus refers to God as his father, not his mother, his father.
[01:05:52.978 --> 01:05:56.201]  You can find this and many other reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.925 --> 01:06:18.688]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:19.109]  Well then,
[01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:23.491]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:06:23.491 --> 01:06:25.032]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:25.032 --> 01:06:33.477]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:06:33.477 --> 01:06:37.399]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:06:37.399 --> 01:06:39.781]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:44.203]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:06:44.203 --> 01:06:48.306]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store, whatever you do,
[01:06:48.706 --> 01:06:51.909]  Get your Head Down firearm today.
[01:06:51.909 --> 01:06:56.572]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:06:56.572 --> 01:06:57.533]  HDfirearms.com.
[01:06:57.533 --> 01:06:59.755]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:59.755 --> 01:07:00.335]  Good, brother.
[01:07:00.335 --> 01:07:02.277]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:07:02.277 --> 01:07:03.998]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:07:03.998 --> 01:07:08.021]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:10.643]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:13.065]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:15.087]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[01:07:15.347 --> 01:07:21.131]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:24.474]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:26.015]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:07:26.015 --> 01:07:28.937]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:07:28.937 --> 01:07:30.698]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:07:30.698 --> 01:07:33.140]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.281]  I don't know.
[01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:05.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.125]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:19.793]  We are now into hour number two on this live Tuesday, the second day of June 2015 transmission.
[01:08:19.793 --> 01:08:32.000]  Infowars.com reporter, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, will join us from Capitol Hill at the National Press Club, where Rand Paul, the senator, and Senator Bob Graham, the former senator, are currently giving a speech
[01:08:33.405 --> 01:08:50.410]  Dealing with the 28 pages redacted from the 9-11 report that senators that have seen it, congressmen that have seen it, like Walter Jones who's been on this show, Congressman Jones, says, shows our government stood down on 9-11 and that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked the attacks bare minimum.
[01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:56.792]  That makes 9-11 an inside job, as we warned you, because our government knew, bare minimum, let it happen as a pretext to take American liberty.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:07.706]  And now 15 years later, Al-Qaeda is reborn as ISIS and has taken over much of the Middle East, being rewarded for a job well done on 9-11.
[01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:20.314]  And defense intelligence leaked last week to Judicial Watch the fact that indeed our government's funding Al-Qaeda and the Wahhabist arms, the Salafist, all out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:20.314 --> 01:09:25.377]  This is a Western-backed takeover of the Middle East by jihadis to kill every Christian they find.
[01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:32.736]  Bombshell intel, bottom of the hour.
[01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:37.161]  Coming up, I want to get into feminist clergy want Christians to refer to God as she.
[01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:40.664]  We're going to tell you what's behind that.
[01:09:40.664 --> 01:09:48.912]  We're also going to get into this amazing new story that is so, so important out of CBS
[01:09:50.259 --> 01:09:56.163]  Something like 19.5% of Americans are on some type of anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication.
[01:09:56.163 --> 01:10:00.586]  Painkillers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicide.
[01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:02.067]  Also, Vince Vaughn.
[01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:08.911]  We knew he was a patriot, but now Vince Vaughn is as pro-gun as it gets.
[01:10:08.911 --> 01:10:14.855]  And he came out in a GQ magazine and sounds like he's Alex Jones, or Ron Paul.
[01:10:14.855 --> 01:10:17.137]  So, good job to Vince Vaughn.
[01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:24.725]  I think he's got some good comedy movies as well, but I'll certainly next time I'm looking at films, you know, they're on the Netflix or whatever.
[01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:28.848]  I'm not a big media consumer, but I do watch movies a few times a week.
[01:10:28.848 --> 01:10:29.308]  I used to.
[01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:29.909]  I've been so busy.
[01:10:29.909 --> 01:10:31.710]  I haven't been lately.
[01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:34.011]  I'll definitely cue up a Vince Vaughn.
[01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:37.454]  You vote with your dollars or you lose everything.
[01:10:37.454 --> 01:10:38.594]  And that goes for this show.
[01:10:38.594 --> 01:10:39.655]  We appreciate you.
[01:10:39.655 --> 01:10:43.497]  And that goes for supporting our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:10:43.497 --> 01:10:47.260]  And as I was saying earlier, I'm going to send three reporters to Austria.
[01:10:49.827 --> 01:10:55.262]  To the Alps, the Austrian Alps, to cover Bilderberg 2015.
[01:10:55.262 --> 01:10:58.270]  That is one of the most important years ever.
[01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:02.274]  This video report is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:02.274 --> 01:11:04.435]  We're going to tweet it out at RealAlexJones.
[01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:08.578]  Bilderberg2015, prepare for global conflict.
[01:11:08.578 --> 01:11:12.160]  Prepare for what could be World War III in their own words.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.543]  Bilderberg, at least prepare for nuclear war and global conflict.
[01:11:15.543 --> 01:11:19.225]  The video is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:26.190]  If you're a radio listener, you can simply watch the free feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show or share the YouTube video.
[01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.011]  This premiered last night on the Nightly News, but
[01:11:29.443 --> 01:11:34.696]  It is your purchasing of t-shirts, ball caps, PrisonPlanet.tv nightly news memberships.
[01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:48.782]  The support of our sponsors, the buying of the nutraceuticals, the super high quality Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12, the Lung Cleanse, our high quality Silver Bullet, 30 parts per million.
[01:11:48.782 --> 01:11:51.682]  You can get it higher, but the doctors we talk to say it's not good.
[01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.803]  It's toxic at levels above that.
[01:11:53.803 --> 01:12:00.725]  We've got the OxyCleanse, the Prostagard, the ChildEase, high quality water filters, super quality organic coffee.
[01:12:01.605 --> 01:12:05.026]  High-quality, non-GMO, open-pollinated heirloom seeds.
[01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:06.666]  Super high-quality, storable foods.
[01:12:06.666 --> 01:12:08.587]  Discounted at the lowest rates.
[01:12:08.587 --> 01:12:11.627]  Provided by the great folks at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.488]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:12:14.488 --> 01:12:20.729]  Shop with the good guys to fund the continued operations of InfoWars.com.
[01:12:20.729 --> 01:12:23.630]  Because you see our reporters in the field all over the world.
[01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.990]  Every day now.
[01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:26.770]  You see the reports every day.
[01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:28.851]  You see the people waking up.
[01:12:29.639 --> 01:12:35.341]  We're here giving the enemy a maximum challenge and hitting them upside the head with the truth.
[01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:38.702]  And that's the ace of spades when it comes to this card game of life.
[01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:42.803]  But you gotta be willing to play that card and stick to your guns.
[01:12:42.803 --> 01:12:46.144]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:52.786]  I'm done ranting on that subject, but I should add briefly, before we go to the special report on Bilderberg, that it's bittersweet
[01:12:54.221 --> 01:13:17.541]  I've never, in the couple years we've had Survival Shield X2, Deep Earth Crystal Source, Nacin Iodine, the good halogen, it's done amazing things for my glands, my health, you've heard the Ray Reviews, try it out for yourself, supports the broadcast, consult your physician first, because if you've already got an iodine deficiency, then it can be spectacular, including with detox, once you get it in your body.
[01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:21.384]  We found this source because it was hard to get the other clean source out of kelp.
[01:13:23.146 --> 01:13:25.027]  And have it pass California standards.
[01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:30.452]  That's why everybody else that has it, you know, can't pass California standards, basically, that are so high they're not meant to be able to be passed.
[01:13:30.452 --> 01:13:33.194]  Well, ours does, and the test, we have them on the website.
[01:13:33.194 --> 01:13:34.835]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:13:34.835 --> 01:13:40.459]  So we found this other, deeper source, mined in the United States, between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:46.604]  The problem is, when these companies go in for this, they're usually going for helium or something else.
[01:13:46.604 --> 01:13:48.045]  It's a byproduct.
[01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:49.566]  It's very expensive to extract.
[01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.603]  The website says 8,000 feet, but it's just between 7 and 12.
[01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:56.485]  You can just put that on there.
[01:13:56.485 --> 01:13:58.847]  And it's just amazing.
[01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:00.408]  I mean, it's bright purple crystals.
[01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:04.351]  You put on a hot plate, it turns purple gas and goes into the air.
[01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.212]  I mean, that's how magic this stuff is.
[01:14:09.648 --> 01:14:10.648]  We are running out of it.
[01:14:10.648 --> 01:14:13.209]  We're not just running out of our current supply, we're running out of the crystals.
[01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:18.571]  We'll probably end up getting another supply, but it's a big deal to jump through all the hoops.
[01:14:18.571 --> 01:14:22.052]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:14:22.052 --> 01:14:22.833]  888-253-3139.
[01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:26.414]  We have giant discounts when you get two packs, five packs, or ten packs.
[01:14:26.414 --> 01:14:27.074]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:14:35.177 --> 01:14:40.960]  I'm going to stop belaboring that.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.521]  All right, let's go to Jon Bowne's report.
[01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:47.463]  InfoWars reporter Jon Bowne reporting on some of the key intel we've gotten.
[01:14:47.463 --> 01:14:50.984]  We do have sources very close to Bilderberg.
[01:14:50.984 --> 01:14:53.325]  We do have a lot of their agenda already.
[01:14:53.325 --> 01:14:56.627]  We'll be publishing that ahead of our crew arriving.
[01:14:56.627 --> 01:15:00.689]  Again, Paul Watson, Rob Doove, and Josh Owens will all be in place there.
[01:15:02.608 --> 01:15:10.100]  So we're sending our news director there, as well as one of our best cameramen, and Paul Watson, one of our best writers of our amazing team.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.967]  We're going to have massive coverage of this key Bilderberg, and here's why it's so important.
[01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:25.013]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.
[01:15:25.013 --> 01:15:30.897]  The Bilderberg Group will coalesce June 9th through the 14th in the Austrian mountains at the Inner Alpen Hotel.
[01:15:30.897 --> 01:15:42.866]  How many of these instigators of widespread tyranny will be discussing their million-dollar safe bunkers between meetings as they hide like moles while their hellish plans are unleashed on the gullible masses?
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.261]  What?
[01:15:46.261 --> 01:15:47.202]  A safe room.
[01:15:47.202 --> 01:15:49.025]  Castle keep in medieval times.
[01:15:49.025 --> 01:15:50.206]  Bored concrete walls.
[01:15:50.206 --> 01:15:52.930]  Buried phone line not connected to the house's main line.
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:57.756]  With your own ventilation system and a bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
[01:15:57.756 --> 01:15:59.578]  What's to keep someone from prying open the door?
[01:15:59.578 --> 01:16:00.359]  Steel.
[01:16:00.359 --> 01:16:01.060]  Very thick steel.
[01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:10.056]  A decade ago, safe rooms would only have been of interest to A-list celebrities who wanted to protect against stalkers.
[01:16:10.056 --> 01:16:19.963]  But they are now becoming popular with elites who wish to guard against potential civil unrest, which could cause crime rates to skyrocket in the aftermath of an economic collapse.
[01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:32.613]  According to a New York Times report, the typically 8 feet by 12 feet bulletproof rooms are an increasingly sought-after means of the elite feeling protected, just as moats and armies protected them in centuries past.
[01:16:32.873 --> 01:16:48.782]  Wealthy individuals, including foreigners who are more familiar with such stringent security measures, are having safe rooms installed to protect their personal possessions, as well as their own physical safety, against potential domestic disorder that could arise out of sudden economic collapse.
[01:16:49.102 --> 01:16:57.364]  This huge disparity is not because of some flaw in capitalism, or because of the Reagan tax cuts, or even the greed of Wall Street.
[01:16:57.364 --> 01:17:08.107]  The problem is central banks that are out of control, printing money like no one ever imagined, and have created a massive worldwide financial inflation.
[01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:14.853]  And when you have a financial inflation, the people that own the stocks and the bonds get the windfall.
[01:17:14.853 --> 01:17:18.236]  After 9-11, he got requests for one or two safe rooms a year.
[01:17:18.236 --> 01:17:22.640]  But that number has recently jumped to more than 20 rooms annually.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.321]  Probably to about 25 this year.
[01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:26.683]  Did about 21, 22 last year.
[01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:30.326]  But we're looking at possibly going up to maybe 30 the following year.
[01:17:30.326 --> 01:17:31.928]  So we just see an increase every year.
[01:17:32.108 --> 01:17:37.355]  The notion that the elite are making preparations for mass civil disorder is no conspiracy theory.
[01:17:37.355 --> 01:17:46.588]  Fearing global unrest and the possibility of another major conflict, many members of the elite have been buying remote property and land in places like New Zealand.
[01:17:46.588 --> 01:17:49.092]  A lot of very wealthy and powerful people are quite afraid right now.
[01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.994]  They see us on an unstable trajectory.
[01:17:51.994 --> 01:17:58.017]  They don't see our political institutions being, what you might call, representative, responsive, and pulling things together.
[01:17:58.017 --> 01:18:02.720]  Things are getting more and more dangerous, as the Ferguson, Missouri, brings to bear.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:16.388]  Ironically, Johnson is president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, an organization founded and bankrolled by billionaire George Soros, who himself is funding the very same movement aggravating the civil unrest, the Black Lives Matter movement.
[01:18:16.548 --> 01:18:28.495]  These two men, Frederick Young and Philando Hunter, were sentenced on this day to life in prison without parole for robbing, torturing, murdering the two teens who had been in Detroit trying to buy drugs.
[01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:36.580]  I'd like to say sorry to the families of Ayanna Jones, Michael Brown, Eric Gardner, and I want to apologize to them for not being able to get justice.
[01:18:43.166 --> 01:18:53.376]  The risk of domestic disorder is also heightened by the fact that distrust in government and leadership in the United States and other Western countries continues to remain near historic lows.
[01:18:53.376 --> 01:18:55.298]  Corruption, social alienation,
[01:18:55.458 --> 01:19:00.422]  The Euro, the creation of the Euro, was all about not creating a strong Europe, but it was, because he's not European, he's a Canadian-American.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:30.624]  It was about making sure that nations, that each nation would no longer have control of its own fiscal state.
[01:19:30.624 --> 01:19:40.089]  That they would be stuck competing against each other by reducing services and provided by the government for those you keep keeping your work for.
[01:19:40.089 --> 01:19:42.530]  And he was very blunt about it, that that's the purpose of it.
[01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:48.313]  It's not to make Europe stronger, it's to make the nations within Europe impotent.
[01:19:52.713 --> 01:19:54.954]  And that's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT.
[01:19:54.954 --> 01:19:56.415]  Ross Perot was right.
[01:19:56.415 --> 01:19:57.495]  The race to the bottom.
[01:19:57.495 --> 01:20:03.137]  And we got the SPP, North American Union documents, three years ago when Judicial Watch sued and got them.
[01:20:03.137 --> 01:20:14.281]  And they said, they had all these corporate chiefs there at the governmental meeting telling the Secretary of State of Mexico, Canada and the United States what to do.
[01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:18.303]  And they said, we're going to lower the US and Canada to the level of Mexico.
[01:20:18.943 --> 01:20:34.995]  Just as we've done with the Euro, so there's nowhere to run, nowhere to compete, and now we're going to play nations off against each other, all over the world, Asia, European Union, North American Union, to basically get all the tax money for bankers as bailouts.
[01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:45.399]  And take people's pension funds, and now we see Bloomberg reporting that federal regulators are preparing to take at least half of people's pensions in the U.S.
[01:20:45.399 --> 01:20:52.322]  As real wages drop, it will also become increasingly harder to pacify younger generations via consumer culture.
[01:20:52.322 --> 01:20:58.764]  Lifestyles built around the acquisition of products will become harder to maintain as the economic environment worsens.
[01:20:58.764 --> 01:20:59.524]  These factors
[01:20:59.764 --> 01:21:08.291]  When combined with further police brutality and a growing sense of injustice, almost guaranteed to cause more civil unrest over the next two years.
[01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:16.917]  Fulfilling economist Martin Armstrong's prediction that a serious political uprising will erupt by 2016 in the United States.
[01:21:16.917 --> 01:21:18.679]  John Bound for Infowars.com
[01:21:22.054 --> 01:21:24.255]  And that's from last night's Nightly News.
[01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:26.476]  That's why it's so important to watch the Nightly News.
[01:21:26.476 --> 01:21:28.197]  It's always 30 minutes long.
[01:21:28.197 --> 01:21:32.859]  We're going to an hour later this month, full-time.
[01:21:32.859 --> 01:21:34.540]  But some nights it's five hours long.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:45.384]  In fact, last Friday night, covering the Draw Muhammad contest in Phoenix, we were live for four and a half hours.
[01:21:45.384 --> 01:21:47.445]  On election night, eight hours.
[01:21:47.445 --> 01:21:50.326]  So that's why it's important to be a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:52.816 --> 01:21:55.318]  All right, we just skipped this network break.
[01:21:55.318 --> 01:22:00.161]  I want to say again hi to all the stations and affiliates out there and the listeners.
[01:22:00.161 --> 01:22:09.707]  Let me now go ahead and launch into this piece of news that I already mentioned but I want to detail.
[01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:13.209]  This is from CBS News.
[01:22:13.209 --> 01:22:15.371]  We have it linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:22:17.026 --> 01:22:31.472]  Just like we kept hammering the studies that were out there that fluoride, seven-fold increase in bone cancer, brain damage, IQ reductions, fractures in bones, just you name it, Harvard studies and others, we kept hammering.
[01:22:31.472 --> 01:22:36.655]  Because of lawsuits and other things, the feds have now said lower it by half and ban it in pesticide.
[01:22:36.655 --> 01:22:46.099]  And we're just going to continue hammering the SSRIs and other anti-anxiety medications because as a family, they make people psychotic killers.
[01:22:47.622 --> 01:22:51.223]  Not everybody, but a goodly percentage.
[01:22:51.223 --> 01:22:55.263]  Every mass shooter I've ever seen has been on one of these.
[01:22:55.263 --> 01:23:04.805]  And as soon as I heard some guy was wandering around like a zombie last year, a couple years ago, and shot a cop for no reason at Walmart, I said, that guy's going to be probably on Xanax or something.
[01:23:04.805 --> 01:23:08.526]  It was Xanax.
[01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:13.167]  Because you can take the stuff like that and go to bed and just wake up and basically sleepwalk.
[01:23:14.994 --> 01:23:16.815]  But they'll never prosecute the companies.
[01:23:16.815 --> 01:23:20.537]  They'll always throw the zombie in prison.
[01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:24.159]  As if that does anything.
[01:23:24.159 --> 01:23:29.122]  Painkillers, anti-anxiety medications linked to increased risk of homicide.
[01:23:29.122 --> 01:23:33.865]  CBS Atlanta, for the first time ever, that is not true.
[01:23:33.865 --> 01:23:39.188]  Scientists have linked prescription drugs that affect the central nervous system to an increased risk of committing homicide.
[01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:48.254]  Is that why we forced about 12 years ago all Prozac derivative drugs to say it can cause psychotic breaks and make you kill people?
[01:23:48.254 --> 01:23:50.355]  And commit suicide?
[01:23:50.355 --> 01:23:55.117]  It was known when they tried to approve it in the seventies and they couldn't.
[01:23:55.117 --> 01:24:04.162]  European researchers found that people who were taking a class of tranquilizers called, and I can't pronounce this, benzodide
[01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:08.777]  Benzodiazepines.
[01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:18.922]  Benzodiazepines were more likely to kill someone than those who were not taking these medicines, reports Live Science.
[01:24:18.922 --> 01:24:20.943]  Yeah, that's why Joe Biggs has told the story.
[01:24:20.943 --> 01:24:25.805]  I did some research and talked to other combat units and it happened to them as well.
[01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:34.250]  But when they were on daily patrols, getting blown up by IEDs every few weeks, getting shot at every day, killing people almost every day,
[01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:44.324]  They ordered them to take classic opiates, and that's also to addict them and then claim they're drug addicts later.
[01:24:44.324 --> 01:24:51.110]  But I can have Joe come in here and tell you the story, but they knew because it made them basically machines while compromising them.
[01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:54.813]  Elvis was ordered to go on speed when he was in the Army.
[01:24:54.813 --> 01:24:56.715]  That has been declassified.
[01:24:56.715 --> 01:25:00.358]  They would make him play so many shows, they said, listen, you will take this, you will do it.
[01:25:02.568 --> 01:25:04.270]  That's all part of the control.
[01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:12.640]  European researchers found that people who are taking the class of tranquilizers, those drugs are used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and panic disorders.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:20.169]  Pain relievers such as opioid medication, see, and anti-inflammatories were also found to increase a person's risk of homicide.
[01:25:21.351 --> 01:25:32.497]  I think that these chemical substances affect the impulse control of a person, said Dr. Jari Tillowin, lead author, and the professor told Medical Daily.
[01:25:32.497 --> 01:25:36.659]  The only surprising result was the painkillers also increased the risk.
[01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:43.023]  There has been one time since I was 18 years old that I have been in a fight.
[01:25:43.023 --> 01:25:47.285]  One time I got attacked by guys in a parking lot, politically, but that was separate.
[01:25:47.285 --> 01:25:48.346]  There's been one time
[01:25:49.676 --> 01:26:06.446]  Where somebody kind of got in my face and I just grabbed him and started choking him up against the wall and that was when I'd partially dislocated my shoulder about 12 years ago and I was taking painkillers because I was just in so much pain and I was on painkillers at the time.
[01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:10.544]  And I just had, it was like I was a zombie.
[01:26:10.544 --> 01:26:11.544]  I wasn't even on that much.
[01:26:11.544 --> 01:26:16.308]  I'd driven to the grocery store, somebody smarted off to me, walked up and got in my face, and I just didn't even think.
[01:26:16.308 --> 01:26:20.992]  I just went, just grabbed him by the neck, put him up against the wall and was just squeezing their throat.
[01:26:20.992 --> 01:26:24.094]  And I mean, that's just, and I was like, whoa, whoa.
[01:26:24.094 --> 01:26:28.558]  And then I left, and thank God the person didn't call the cops.
[01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:33.362]  And I just thought, oh my gosh, it's the painkillers.
[01:26:33.362 --> 01:26:34.683]  I've been on the painkillers three days.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.945]  And I mean, imagine our troops are being put on this stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:44.368]  And it removes inhibition.
[01:26:44.368 --> 01:26:47.191]  And it puts basically the animal centers of the brain in control.
[01:26:47.191 --> 01:26:48.572]  Very, very scary.
[01:26:48.572 --> 01:26:56.440]  Shifting gears, something that my dad, who's a dentist and oral surgeon, always told me, and he had little brochures he'd show patients when he was signing them up to, you know, get quarterly
[01:26:57.628 --> 01:27:06.913]  Teeth cleanings, one of the most important things you can do in your life is not just moderate exercise and good clean water and eating organic foods and supplementation.
[01:27:06.913 --> 01:27:09.455]  And it's not that I'm some health expert beach boy.
[01:27:09.455 --> 01:27:12.036]  I didn't care for 15 years, turned in a job at the hut.
[01:27:12.036 --> 01:27:13.697]  I'm changing my life now.
[01:27:13.697 --> 01:27:15.038]  But I do know what if I speak.
[01:27:15.038 --> 01:27:20.381]  I remember my dad, because I was a dental assistant for a couple years, part-time.
[01:27:20.381 --> 01:27:23.223]  He would go over the fact in the studies that plaque
[01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:26.832]  Getting under your gums causes infections.
[01:27:26.832 --> 01:27:29.974]  It's an area for really bad anaerobic bacteria to get into your bloodstream.
[01:27:29.974 --> 01:27:34.778]  They then colonize the heart valves and basically eat your heart valves.
[01:27:34.778 --> 01:27:37.720]  So it's very important to get your teeth cleaned.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.901]  Deep scaling.
[01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:40.142]  And here it is in The Independent.
[01:27:40.142 --> 01:27:43.024]  Of course, they're saying it's the first time ever.
[01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:45.726]  They always say that when it's an old story they've republished.
[01:27:45.726 --> 01:27:48.908]  Not brushing your teeth can lead to dementia and heart disease.
[01:27:48.908 --> 01:27:50.510]  That's right, it grows brain plaques as well.
[01:27:51.661 --> 01:28:00.288]  Allowing bacteria to build up in the chips and cracks on the surface of the teeth can lead to gum disease, which damages cells around the body.
[01:28:00.288 --> 01:28:02.510]  You can tell Alexander Ward is not a dentist.
[01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.651]  No, it's not so much the chips on the top.
[01:28:04.651 --> 01:28:10.136]  It's the gum line down in the roots into the blood vessels, brother.
[01:28:10.136 --> 01:28:12.718]  It's not stuff so much going through the roots.
[01:28:12.718 --> 01:28:13.879]  At the top, it's the bottom.
[01:28:17.401 --> 01:28:29.507]  The study shows that 89% of people believed to have bad teeth contribute towards somebody's age, with 40% admitting that they have never considered how their smile could be affecting their appearance.
[01:28:29.507 --> 01:28:36.790]  Later this week, BBC will air the first of two part series examining Britain's oral hygiene, examining our attitude towards taking care of our teeth.
[01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:39.051]  Now why is it a joke that Brits don't take care of their teeth?
[01:28:40.762 --> 01:28:56.731]  The documentary also shows that those with chronic inflammation can lead to damage of the circulation system and vital organs, with research showing that bad gums, I guess they do get it right finally, can be linked to the development of illnesses including heart disease and Alzheimer's.
[01:28:56.731 --> 01:29:04.316]  35% of people said that a good smile was the first thing they noticed about someone, although many overlooked the need to look after their teeth in later life.
[01:29:05.677 --> 01:29:18.827]  Yeah, I mean, if you like dying of heart attacks or having your valves filled, and it's not whitening your teeth or just brushing the surface, you have to floss and you have to get below the gum line.
[01:29:18.827 --> 01:29:22.489]  And if you don't do this every quarter, you're going to have to be numbed up to have it done.
[01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:26.833]  You're going to bleed all over the place, it's going to be stinking and a mess, and it's going to hurt for a week.
[01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:33.798]  But me, I mean, my dad, he's retired now, so I've got another dentist, but they not go in there, no deadening, they go way below the gum line, bam!
[01:29:34.478 --> 01:29:37.540]  And it's just, my gums are all elastic.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.141]  Praise God I've got such good teeth.
[01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.323]  But believe me, take care of your gums, folks.
[01:29:42.323 --> 01:29:45.644]  It's one of the most important things you can do.
[01:29:45.644 --> 01:29:48.426]  It's your first line of defense.
[01:29:48.426 --> 01:29:49.827]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.827 --> 01:29:52.348]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.348 --> 01:29:55.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.091 --> 01:30:09.276]  The latest case of big pharma and government vaccine cover-up is brought to you by Cheryl Atkinson, the former CBS reporter who was instrumental in outing the Justice Department's Fast and Furious program.
[01:30:09.276 --> 01:30:13.138]  She writes, government wipes recent vaccine injury data from website.
[01:30:13.138 --> 01:30:18.521]  In March, the Health Resources and Service Administration, or HRSA, removed more than a year's worth of
[01:30:18.701 --> 01:30:21.084]  of vaccine injury data from its charts.
[01:30:21.084 --> 01:30:26.649]  Now concessions won by flu shot victims shows 42 when in actuality it's 88.
[01:30:26.649 --> 01:30:29.072]  Total Tdap cases compensated since 2006 shows 103 when it's actually 129.
[01:30:29.072 --> 01:30:31.614]  And concessions won by vaccine victims since 2006 shows 127 when actually it's 198.
[01:30:31.614 --> 01:30:34.157]  Since 1988 the federal government has paid money to vaccine injured victims
[01:30:42.245 --> 01:30:44.648]  To the tune of 3.1 billion dollars.
[01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:48.453]  This money comes from fees of every vaccine dose given in this country.
[01:30:48.453 --> 01:30:53.098]  Which means you, not Big Pharma, is paying for all this safe and effective treatment.
[01:30:53.098 --> 01:30:55.441]  You can read more about vaccines at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:56.242]  Rob Dew reporting.

[01:32:52.264 --> 01:33:13.056]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:13.056 --> 01:33:16.098]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.098 --> 01:33:17.498]  What is a rally?
[01:33:17.498 --> 01:33:20.220]  In its most ancient form it's when you're on the battlefield
[01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:28.672]  You're generally being overrun, but as a military leader, you know you can win the fight.
[01:33:28.672 --> 01:33:42.897]  Generally, you get on your horse with your best people and go right at the center of the enemy with a battle charge and a roar with your flags, getting everybody whipped up with a bold gambit to show that the battle can be won.
[01:33:44.755 --> 01:33:48.698]  And that's what I'm doing here is I'm rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:48.698 --> 01:33:50.619]  Patriots that are pro-human.
[01:33:50.619 --> 01:33:56.203]  Patriots that are truly wanting to progress towards the stars.
[01:33:56.203 --> 01:33:59.505]  Not progress and be progressive like cancer.
[01:33:59.505 --> 01:34:01.347]  Like the globalists.
[01:34:01.347 --> 01:34:05.790]  Who want to build a true liberal society of open ideas and freedom.
[01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:07.411]  Not a cult of globalism.
[01:34:08.883 --> 01:34:10.403]  We're here to take back those terms.
[01:34:10.403 --> 01:34:11.784]  We're here to take back the planet.
[01:34:11.784 --> 01:34:16.784]  And what we're selling, freedom, is a lot more popular than what they're selling, tyranny.
[01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.485]  They've just mispackaged it.
[01:34:18.485 --> 01:34:20.905]  It's easy to shoot down the globalists politically.
[01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:23.446]  You've just got to have the will to do it.
[01:34:23.446 --> 01:34:37.368]  If you Google the name Rand Paul, and you click the News tab, as I've done here in the TV studio, Governor Pataki, Rand Paul made a terrible mistake.
[01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:44.195]  Rand Paul, video, violated Senate rules.
[01:34:44.195 --> 01:34:47.856]  You know, all these demonization.
[01:34:47.856 --> 01:34:54.199]  Lindsey Graham, it would be devastating for the GOP to nominate Rand Paul.
[01:34:54.199 --> 01:34:57.680]  And it goes on to demonize
[01:34:59.417 --> 01:35:04.560]  Rand Paul, how dare him get up and admit there's illegal spying that the courts have already ruled illegal?
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:08.102]  How dare him say they can't record every phone conversation without warrants?
[01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:11.224]  How dare him?
[01:35:11.224 --> 01:35:12.124]  He's just horrible.
[01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:16.207]  How dare him say the president shouldn't be a dictator?
[01:35:16.207 --> 01:35:19.989]  How dare him say that, you know, we should be nice to puppy dogs?
[01:35:19.989 --> 01:35:23.571]  They are inverting reality, acting like what he did was radical, but breaking.
[01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:38.384]  Out of Politico, one hour ago, Rand Paul says declassify 9-11 report pages on Saudi Arabian involvement in 9-11.
[01:35:38.384 --> 01:35:46.188]  And our very own Wayne Madsen is on the Hill, right outside the Hill in D.C.
[01:35:46.188 --> 01:35:48.449]  He's just been at the National Press Club.
[01:35:51.209 --> 01:36:04.213]  And he was there covering the historic presentation by current Senator Rand Paul, former Senator Graham, 9-11 Commissioner, and others who have seen the secret 28 pages and what it entails.
[01:36:04.213 --> 01:36:12.956]  Walter Jones, the Congressman from North Carolina, was also there, frequent guest on this transmission.
[01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:18.802]  So joining us is Wayne Madsen to break all of this down.
[01:36:18.802 --> 01:36:22.246]  I tell you, Wayne, it's obviously very dangerous what Senator Paul's doing.
[01:36:22.246 --> 01:36:23.287]  He's a leader.
[01:36:23.287 --> 01:36:24.228]  He's a doctor.
[01:36:24.228 --> 01:36:25.650]  He's a family man.
[01:36:25.650 --> 01:36:28.833]  He's showing he's bold on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:36:28.833 --> 01:36:32.878]  He's showing that he's nonpartisan when it comes to defending our Republic.
[01:36:32.878 --> 01:36:34.080]  He's the only senator
[01:36:35.316 --> 01:36:43.862]  To actually get up and try to shoot down the Patriot Act and put himself right in the face of the globalist so-called juggernaut.
[01:36:44.693 --> 01:36:46.474]  This is true leadership.
[01:36:46.474 --> 01:36:47.714]  This is true Americana.
[01:36:47.714 --> 01:37:03.920]  And if we don't support this as a people, if we don't admire this, if we don't see this as heroic in the face of incredible tyranny, then we can't get mad at politicians who become statesmen down the road for not doing something.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.720]  They're blackmailed.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.721]  They're harassed.
[01:37:05.721 --> 01:37:06.981]  They're targeted by the media.
[01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:08.342]  They go through all sorts of dirty tricks.
[01:37:09.042 --> 01:37:12.203]  You gotta be super clean to be able to do what he's doing.
[01:37:12.203 --> 01:37:26.408]  And he has really gone up a notch, in my view, from me liking him, trusting him, admiring him, not liking some of the politics he's played, but still knowing he's the best real politician out there in the polls who is a statesman that could beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:27.182 --> 01:37:28.184]  And he's not a warmonger.
[01:37:28.184 --> 01:37:29.806]  He wants to cut off foreign aid.
[01:37:29.806 --> 01:37:32.751]  But I tell you, I think he's in real danger now.
[01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:34.373]  They're trying to politically assassinate him.
[01:37:34.373 --> 01:37:35.776]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:37:35.776 --> 01:37:38.620]  But first, you were there for the presentation.
[01:37:39.571 --> 01:37:44.014]  We don't have filters here and just have to read what Politico says.
[01:37:44.014 --> 01:37:49.278]  Wayne Madsen, former NSA officer, award-winning investigative journalist, best-selling author.
[01:37:49.278 --> 01:38:01.368]  WayneMadsenReport.com, who broke the Hastert-Pitot Ring news back in 2006 on this broadcast, and at WayneMadsenReport.com, joins us now.
[01:38:01.368 --> 01:38:03.409]  Wayne Madsen, thank you.
[01:38:03.409 --> 01:38:04.971]  Yes, Alex, thanks.
[01:38:04.971 --> 01:38:08.473]  Well, the press conference was at 10 o'clock today.
[01:38:08.473 --> 01:38:09.074]  The Senate
[01:38:10.409 --> 01:38:30.824]  Congressional Visitors Center and Senator Paul led off the press conference announcing his support for a Senate bill to basically urge the president to declassify the 28 pages from the joint congressional report of 2002 on the failures of 9-11.
[01:38:33.439 --> 01:38:57.045]  And joining Senator Paul were former Senator Bob Graham from Florida, who was the actual chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has, of course, read those 28 pages, was the last final chop authority on those 28 pages with the rest of the report, and he urged, and he has been urging,
[01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:58.870]  The White House.
[01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:04.092]  I know he's visited the White House in order for him to declassify the pages.
[01:39:04.092 --> 01:39:23.419]  And Senator Paul announced that he has two co-sponsors for this Senate bill that would declassify the 28 pages, and they are Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, I should say, of New York.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:37.182]  He said he's also planning on attaching this bill as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act next week.
[01:39:37.182 --> 01:39:38.443]  Incredible!
[01:39:38.443 --> 01:39:42.724]  There are two avenues to get this through.
[01:39:42.724 --> 01:39:51.325]  On the House side, we had Representative Jones, Representative Lynch, and Representative Massey speak.
[01:39:51.325 --> 01:39:54.106]  What we heard from both Senator Paul and
[01:39:54.848 --> 01:40:06.695]  Uh, the congressman from the House side are that they have resistance from the bipartisan leadership in both houses on getting this through.
[01:40:06.695 --> 01:40:17.841]  They have very few co-sponsors, and it's quite clear that the leadership, and that's Mitch McConnell in the Senate and John Boehner, the House Speaker and various chairmen,
[01:40:18.323 --> 01:40:18.363]  of
[01:40:29.051 --> 01:40:36.193]  His presentation, he said that the Saudi government has expressed support for releasing the 28 pages.
[01:40:36.193 --> 01:40:42.535]  So I asked him a question at the press conference, who in the Saudi government would be in favor of that?
[01:40:42.535 --> 01:40:49.077]  Because the present King Salman was the governor of Riyadh province before 9-11.
[01:40:49.077 --> 01:40:56.219]  And I understand from talking to Saudi opposition forces, and these are democratic opposition forces, that
[01:40:58.059 --> 01:41:12.868]  Several al-Qaeda members passed through Riyadh when Salman was governor of Riyadh on their way to Pakistan and Afghanistan and they were given logistical support, cash, and a whole lot of support by the present king of Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:14.724 --> 01:41:21.727]  Yeah, that sounds like in a movie when the guy has a dead body in his trunk and he says, sure, search my car, just trying to play a confidence game.
[01:41:21.727 --> 01:41:33.793]  We know from different folks we've had on, like Springman and others, from the visa section in Jeddah, that they were basically ordered by the CIA to let the 15 of the 19 hijackers in, even though they were flagged as terrorists.
[01:41:33.793 --> 01:41:36.274]  But when I get excited about Rand Paul, it's for this reason.
[01:41:37.202 --> 01:41:40.266]  He comes out, he points out that they've lied to us about spying on us.
[01:41:40.266 --> 01:41:42.568]  He points out it's not been used to stop terror.
[01:41:42.568 --> 01:41:44.430]  He points out that we've been helping fund ISIS.
[01:41:45.484 --> 01:41:49.527]  He brings up the fact that, hey, Saudi Arabia was allowed 9-11.
[01:41:49.527 --> 01:41:51.808]  Don't claim I'm against national security.
[01:41:51.808 --> 01:41:53.490]  Release the information.
[01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:56.151]  He really seems to be in their face right now.
[01:41:56.151 --> 01:41:59.434]  A lot of politicians are saying, we don't like your strategy.
[01:41:59.434 --> 01:42:01.015]  You're not playing it safe.
[01:42:01.015 --> 01:42:03.156]  You know, you're going to lose now for doing this.
[01:42:03.156 --> 01:42:03.917]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:06.118]  He's doing the right thing.
[01:42:06.118 --> 01:42:09.501]  And it shows how alien that is to the mindset in Washington.
[01:42:09.501 --> 01:42:13.584]  What do you make of what Rand Paul's doing and taking a leadership role in this?
[01:42:14.754 --> 01:42:38.489]  Well, he had, you know, I've covered the politics here for a while, and to hear a Democrat like Bob Graham, former governor of Florida and longtime Democratic senator, was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was actually thanking and praising Rand Paul for his efforts, as were
[01:42:39.411 --> 01:42:50.520]  The members from the House side, including Democratic Congressman Stephen Lynch from Massachusetts.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:57.546]  I mean, it smells and looks like old-fashioned statesmanship and actually trying to have a free country.
[01:42:57.546 --> 01:43:03.831]  Yeah, I was somewhat surprised to see a spirit of bipartisanship at that press conference today.
[01:43:03.831 --> 01:43:05.212]  I should also add that there was a
[01:43:06.394 --> 01:43:19.577]  A Republican Virginia State Senator in the audience and he has also proposed a resolution urging the 28 pages, you know, that's just a sense of the, that would be a sense of the Virginia Senate.
[01:43:19.577 --> 01:43:26.838]  They don't have any authority over that type of thing, but he's introduced a similar resolution in the Virginia Senate.
[01:43:26.838 --> 01:43:31.119]  Well, I happen to know Rand Paul for 20 years and I can tell folks he's the real deal.
[01:43:33.911 --> 01:43:35.853]  They're coming after him more than anybody.
[01:43:35.853 --> 01:43:42.858]  I think that, for anybody who's smart, folks should know he's then the man to nominate out of the Republican field.
[01:43:42.858 --> 01:43:47.482]  The First Lady from there on the East Coast, Ms.
[01:43:47.482 --> 01:43:57.630]  Lindsey Graham, has come out, though, demonizing him, saying he'd be a horrible choice for a Republican nominee.
[01:43:57.630 --> 01:44:01.634]  But the word is that Lindsey Graham might be getting ready to run.
[01:44:02.944 --> 01:44:14.532]  Well, he has, I think, his announcement, I think, he's either done it this week or he's planning to do it this week.
[01:44:14.532 --> 01:44:19.976]  I would urge some of his opponents to just send people to Columbia, South Carolina.
[01:44:19.976 --> 01:44:31.465]  I've heard about him in South Carolina from a well-known journalist for the state newspaper, and that's the paper of record in South Carolina.
[01:44:34.128 --> 01:44:43.716]  So these people are well aware of Miss South Carolina's past, shall we say, exploits in the state.
[01:44:43.716 --> 01:44:45.678]  So he's fully compromised.
[01:44:45.678 --> 01:44:48.540]  I mean, if he comes out of the closet, then he wouldn't be as dangerous.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.442]  We're not attacking him because he's gay.
[01:44:50.442 --> 01:44:53.064]  We're attacking him because they can blackmail him with the information.
[01:44:53.815 --> 01:44:57.718]  And he's a hypocrite because he has sponsored a lot of anti-gay legislation.
[01:44:57.718 --> 01:45:07.524]  But the major thing is if he does come out, he's of course not going to be elected president or get the Republican nomination.
[01:45:07.524 --> 01:45:12.668]  He probably won't win his seat again if he runs for re-election from South Carolina.
[01:45:12.668 --> 01:45:17.451]  So this is the dilemma that he faces because of his total hypocrisy.
[01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.592]  Well, I mean, he thinks he's going to attack Rand Paul.
[01:45:19.592 --> 01:45:21.014]  We're not going to attack him right back.
[01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:21.814]  He's got another thing coming.
[01:45:21.814 --> 01:45:23.235]  We're committed to this fight.
[01:45:23.235 --> 01:45:24.736]  We know he's a dangerous person.
[01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:26.778]  We know he represents a dangerous mafia.
[01:45:26.778 --> 01:45:33.303]  And yes, everybody should recognize we have huevos the size of, you know, bowling balls to even be talking about these issues.
[01:45:33.303 --> 01:45:35.405]  But it's time it all comes down.
[01:45:35.405 --> 01:45:37.486]  It's time the House of Cards comes down.
[01:45:37.486 --> 01:45:42.470]  It's time that all of them, Boehner, all of them that are compromised... What's the... I know you've studied Boehner.
[01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:46.393]  And I know he's tied in with Hastert and the rest of that jolly crowd.
[01:45:49.351 --> 01:45:50.893]  What's the dirt they've got on Boehner?
[01:45:50.893 --> 01:46:01.961]  I mean, when he's doing stuff that's 87% unpopular, like TPP with his crew, with his state constituency, I mean, they've got to have something big on old Boehner.
[01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:11.409]  I know he famously handed out tobacco company checks on the floor of the House in the 90s that was illegal, basically, and then claimed it was legal, but what else do they have on this guy, the Speaker of the House?
[01:46:12.122 --> 01:46:20.344]  Well, I don't want to talk about his drinking because we've had very successful members of Congress in the past who were also alcoholics.
[01:46:20.344 --> 01:46:24.285]  So you can't use that, that can't be used as any sort of negative.
[01:46:24.285 --> 01:46:30.747]  When you talk about the past, and many of these were, you know, they may have been drunks, but they were also statesmen.
[01:46:30.747 --> 01:46:36.729]  We talk about former House Speaker Carl Albert and Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirks and
[01:46:37.209 --> 01:46:37.689]  A fish!
[01:46:58.414 --> 01:47:03.398]  And, uh, but I think, uh, you know, when you talk about painter, you got to talk about the lobbying.
[01:47:03.398 --> 01:47:10.904]  Uh, apparently there was talk about him having an extramarital affair with a, with a top lobbyist, uh, some years ago.
[01:47:10.904 --> 01:47:13.986]  So yes, there is a taint of scandal there, but, um.
[01:47:14.787 --> 01:47:19.530]  And I really think that Boehner did not want to serve another term in Congress.
[01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:23.273]  Apparently he's been promised some big job.
[01:47:23.273 --> 01:47:24.554]  He wants to move to Florida.
[01:47:24.554 --> 01:47:28.897]  He bought a big house in Florida, so clearly he's looking at retirement.
[01:47:28.897 --> 01:47:31.599]  He wants to cash in on the looting of America.
[01:47:31.599 --> 01:47:35.442]  Yeah, and you know, so he can buy the best Merlot after he's retired.
[01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:38.306]  And play golf all day.
[01:47:38.306 --> 01:47:45.361]  So it sounds like his greatest crime then in the club is he's not a pedophile because it seems like he's got to be a pedophile to be up at the top these days.
[01:47:46.388 --> 01:47:53.453]  Right, I think he, you know, I mean, he's very useful to some people, but I think he's a rather aloof speaker.
[01:47:53.453 --> 01:47:59.958]  We have to really look at his staff, senior staff members, and that would be as speaker.
[01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:02.520]  He has his own staff as speaker.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:08.345]  They're separate from his staff where he represents his district in Ohio.
[01:48:08.345 --> 01:48:13.108]  And also, you've got to look at some of the committee chairs that he's appointed to these top committees.
[01:48:13.108 --> 01:48:14.770]  So I think the problem with Boehner is
[01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:24.958]  His relative aloofness from day-to-day matters.
[01:48:24.958 --> 01:48:34.345]  I'm not going to hold the drinking against him because, as I say, we've had in the past... Well, we've been hypocrites then, too, so let's just get real.
[01:48:34.345 --> 01:48:35.426]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:48:36.707 --> 01:48:51.962]  But I really want to say that in answer to my question, Senator Paul said, when I asked him, I said, who specifically in the Saudi government because of the, and I think it's King Salman as Governor Riyadh, his name is all over the
[01:48:53.139 --> 01:48:57.943]  28 pages, and he said he'd have to get, you know, get that information.
[01:48:57.943 --> 01:49:00.504]  He couldn't recall who that official was.
[01:49:00.504 --> 01:49:14.714]  But the word I got today was that the reason this bill has been totally unsuccessful in getting more Senate support is because the Bush family is putting direct pressure on Mitch McConnell.
[01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:22.539]  And we know that, you know, he's the other senator from Kentucky and ostensibly, you know, ran Paul and McConnell.
[01:49:23.332 --> 01:49:35.528]  Uh, they have a sort of a mutual supportive relationship politically and both Republicans from the same state, but that the Bush family and the oil companies and the Saudi lobbyists
[01:49:36.250 --> 01:49:58.586]  uh... and the saudi embassy here is really putting a full court press on making sure it was a dozen more you broke it at the time it was in the miami herald of someone in guardian of the bushes were at a carlisle group uh... contractor breakfast that morning in dc at the bin laden table george herbert walker bush uh... bush forty one was there eating
[01:49:59.699 --> 01:50:05.863]  With them, when the attacks took place, they were allowed to all fly out of the country when air traffic was grounded.
[01:50:05.863 --> 01:50:09.645]  So they don't want this whole Bush-Saudi connection being opened up.
[01:50:09.645 --> 01:50:14.748]  And I think, knowing Rand Paul, in his speech, that was a little bit of a backhand.
[01:50:14.748 --> 01:50:16.409]  He's probably been threatened by the Saudis.
[01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:18.670]  That was a backhanded threat, probably.
[01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:21.412]  That, oh, and I know you want this released.
[01:50:21.412 --> 01:50:24.333]  Like, like, you know, oh, you really want us to serve a search warrant on you.
[01:50:24.333 --> 01:50:26.895]  It's kind of a, I think it was more of a snarky remark.
[01:50:28.382 --> 01:50:29.663]  Right, it could have been.
[01:50:29.663 --> 01:50:44.970]  I mean, he also said, he's talked about the bipartisan support from various committees, current and former committee chairs, former intelligence agency officials have urged
[01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:50.774]  Let's talk about that document when we come back, and I want to get the latest on the giant gerbil, Dennis Hastert.

[01:54:23.508 --> 01:54:27.392]  We're here live, back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[01:54:27.392 --> 01:54:30.314]  I want to thank all of you that are PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:54:30.314 --> 01:54:35.618]  You can see the nightly news, all my films in HD and a lot more, special reports, expanded coverage.
[01:54:35.618 --> 01:54:43.465]  PrisonPlanet.tv, one membership, 20 people can use each one, $5.95 a month, get a yearly membership, get three months free.
[01:54:43.465 --> 01:54:49.290]  And your purchase of PrisonPlanet.tv members allows us to have full-time professional journalists.
[01:54:50.256 --> 01:54:54.357]  McBrain worked for Scripps Howard News Service and others.
[01:54:54.357 --> 01:54:59.958]  Wayne Madsen's worked for a bunch of big mainline institutions, famous author, written for you name it.
[01:54:59.958 --> 01:55:03.899]  We've got all these other great reporters here as well that have worked in TV and radio.
[01:55:03.899 --> 01:55:06.600]  And we're hiring more people.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:13.201]  I plan to hire about three more camera people, maybe two or three more reporters, investigative journalists, two or three more writers, and then that's it.
[01:55:13.201 --> 01:55:16.482]  I don't intend to grow any more because it's a lot to manage.
[01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:24.446]  We just need to be able to have two crews be in different places at one time.
[01:55:24.446 --> 01:55:29.152]  And still have a crew here to do reports in Austin and in studio.
[01:55:29.152 --> 01:55:31.435]  And I basically got two crews right now.
[01:55:31.435 --> 01:55:33.137]  But when holidays come up, I got one crew.
[01:55:34.309 --> 01:55:35.950]  So, it's a balancing act.
[01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:46.615]  Your support financially is what is allowing it for me to be able to hammer out a deal to have Wayne Madsen come to work full-time, that's five days a week with us, as an investigative journalist.
[01:55:46.615 --> 01:55:49.956]  And some of the stuff he's got planned is mooey dangerous.
[01:55:49.956 --> 01:55:52.177]  It's dangerous because it's important.
[01:55:52.177 --> 01:55:56.299]  I mean, we're not playing games here, is what I'm saying.
[01:55:56.299 --> 01:55:59.120]  I'm not going to go up against the globalists and do it with my mittens on.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.701]  The gloves are off.
[01:56:01.806 --> 01:56:03.126]  We want a free country.
[01:56:03.126 --> 01:56:05.187]  We're not going to be enslaved.
[01:56:05.187 --> 01:56:07.088]  Fortune favors the bold.
[01:56:07.088 --> 01:56:10.649]  To quote John Paul Jones, founder of the U.S.
[01:56:10.649 --> 01:56:14.690]  Navy, I have only begun to fight.
[01:56:14.690 --> 01:56:16.810]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:56:16.810 --> 01:56:20.971]  So thank you all for being PrisonPlanet.tv members and visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:24.252]  All right, Wayne, we've got about three or four minutes left before this segment ends.
[01:56:24.252 --> 01:56:25.913]  You said that Senator Graham
[01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:29.952]  Yes, Senator Graham held up another document from the Treasury Department.
[01:56:29.952 --> 01:56:35.495]  It was a classified document and it was about a Saudi organization with strong ties to the Saudi government that funded Al-Qaeda and
[01:56:55.826 --> 01:56:58.008]  Obviously funded some of the hijackers.
[01:56:58.008 --> 01:57:02.772]  This document was, he showed us the document.
[01:57:02.772 --> 01:57:11.519]  It was probably about 90 to 100 pages in length and he flipped through every page and every single page was blacked out.
[01:57:11.519 --> 01:57:17.123]  There wasn't one item there that was left open for public use.
[01:57:18.471 --> 01:57:18.992]  I think so.
[01:57:35.413 --> 01:57:36.374]  The 28 pages.
[01:57:36.374 --> 01:57:39.358]  It's not so much what it says in the text.
[01:57:39.358 --> 01:57:43.623]  It may be what's in the footnotes and reference material is cited.
[01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:44.724]  Think of it as an onion.
[01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:52.653]  And when you start peeling back the onion, you get down to different layers and it opens up, you know, different avenues for investigation.
[01:57:52.653 --> 01:57:54.295]  And that's obvious.
[01:57:54.295 --> 01:57:55.377]  Obviously, what the
[01:57:55.979 --> 01:57:57.699]  In closing, Wayne, what are they going to do
[01:58:21.371 --> 01:58:26.512]  When this ends up coming out, or it's already basically out, Defense Intelligence says our government's running Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:26.512 --> 01:58:28.692]  What are they going to do?
[01:58:28.692 --> 01:58:35.914]  Well, you know, I mean, it's going to, I think, show people that we're lying to on a daily basis.
[01:58:35.914 --> 01:58:36.494]  Wayne, hold on.
[01:58:36.494 --> 01:58:36.774]  Back at 60.
[01:58:36.774 --> 01:58:39.194]  We'll do five more minutes and let you get back to reporting.
[01:58:39.194 --> 01:58:41.555]  He's up there on Capitol Hill right now.
[01:58:41.555 --> 01:58:43.495]  They also are having an event at the National Press Club.
[01:58:43.495 --> 01:58:44.475]  That's how I got that confused.
[01:58:44.475 --> 01:58:46.556]  But this is at the Senate Press Area.
[01:58:46.556 --> 01:58:46.876]  We'll be back.
[01:58:49.039 --> 01:58:54.181]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.280]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:08.061]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.061 --> 02:00:09.821]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.821 --> 02:00:11.402]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.402 --> 02:00:12.942]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.942 --> 02:00:17.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.124 --> 02:00:21.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.688 --> 02:00:30.315]  Dr. Steve Pucinich says he got some interesting info on Jade Elm and he's against it.
[02:00:30.315 --> 02:00:32.498]  We're going to be talking about that coming up.
[02:00:32.498 --> 02:00:35.302]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, now on the InfoWars team.
[02:00:35.302 --> 02:00:36.743]  We're finalizing that.
[02:00:36.743 --> 02:00:37.985]  Reporting from Capitol Hill.
[02:00:38.866 --> 02:00:46.129]  Where Rand Paul and others just gave a bipartisan presentation on the former Senator Bob Graham, who wasn't on the 9-11 Commission.
[02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.850]  Why was I saying that?
[02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:48.790]  I get confused.
[02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:51.131]  So many names, they all mix together.
[02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:58.515]  With this whole Saudi connection coming out, other points that you were about to add to that, and where do you see all this going?
[02:00:58.515 --> 02:01:03.357]  Because obviously folks in the military are upset if defense intelligence leaked.
[02:01:04.594 --> 02:01:16.838]  Last week, and this was confirmed to be a real leak, that indeed the army said we're ordered to fund Al-Qaeda, fund the Salafists, which is Al-Qaeda as well, basically ISIS.
[02:01:16.838 --> 02:01:20.399]  I mean, this really shows why they're scared of leaks.
[02:01:22.163 --> 02:01:25.185]  Yes, and we just had a revelation from the State Department.
[02:01:25.185 --> 02:01:37.731]  They admitted that the former head of the Tajikistan Special Forces, trained by Blackwater on a State Department contract, is now a top field commander for ISIS.
[02:01:37.731 --> 02:01:49.557]  So here we have yet another factoid that indicates that ISIS is a construct of Western intelligence facilities.
[02:01:49.557 --> 02:01:51.198]  How do they think they're going to get away with this?
[02:01:52.501 --> 02:01:58.724]  Well, I think the fact is that we're seeing more and more of these revelations and they're being confirmed by the agencies.
[02:01:58.724 --> 02:02:21.413]  Of course, the Defense Intelligence Agency tried to work warm its way out of that report that you mentioned about that it was the policy to create a Salafist principality in Syria and Iraq to bring down Bashar Assad and ultimately the Iraqi government, which is allied against very close ties with Iran.
[02:02:22.646 --> 02:02:27.469]  Um, but I don't think we see the resistance now from the agencies.
[02:02:27.469 --> 02:02:31.471]  There's people that want to get the truth out.
[02:02:31.471 --> 02:02:34.872]  That's really, I mean, your job was internal security at the NSA.
[02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:48.687]  But, I mean, we see them going after folks like William Benny and Drake and others, but you've talked about how they spend a lot of their time now just spying on people in government, but it's not going to work when more and more people just start leaking.
[02:02:48.687 --> 02:02:50.328]  They can't stop everybody.
[02:02:50.328 --> 02:02:52.929]  We could see leaks at any time that could bring down the Globalist.
[02:02:52.929 --> 02:02:57.592]  I think that's why they want to have an internet kill switch and things like that.
[02:02:57.592 --> 02:03:03.435]  Well, I think we're seeing more people going through more documents like the DIA report
[02:03:04.298 --> 02:03:12.364]  You know, whatever the document was, it indicated, yes, this guy from Tajikistan, the head of their special forces, was in fact drained by Blackwater.
[02:03:12.364 --> 02:03:23.153]  I think people are getting smart on how to go through these documents, whether they're as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request or they're from other sources.
[02:03:23.153 --> 02:03:27.837]  So I think we're getting better at what we're doing.
[02:03:28.536 --> 02:03:34.017]  And it's beyond the spin of, sure, we created Saddam, then he turned on us, or we created Bin Laden, then he turned on us.
[02:03:34.017 --> 02:03:34.917]  No.
[02:03:34.917 --> 02:03:48.781]  They are funding these groups whole cloth now, and commanding them to engage in war crimes, to destabilize the world, then attack the West, so they can legitimize the police state, and, you know, this is a dead duck.
[02:03:48.781 --> 02:03:51.481]  Politically, it's not going to fly, in my view.
[02:03:51.481 --> 02:03:54.942]  Right, and we had families there today at this press conference, they should mention
[02:03:55.883 --> 02:04:02.187]  One young boy, 14 years old, was four days old when his father was killed on 9-11.
[02:04:02.187 --> 02:04:08.111]  And the daughter of one of the victims said, we are the children of 9-11.
[02:04:08.111 --> 02:04:14.456]  They made a personal appeal to President Obama to release the 28 pages so they can at least have some closure.
[02:04:14.456 --> 02:04:16.557]  They say they don't trust the government anymore.
[02:04:16.557 --> 02:04:18.719]  And that's a theme we heard.
[02:04:18.719 --> 02:04:22.101]  We, the children of 9-11, do not trust our own government.
[02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:24.143]  All right, Wayne Madsen, great job.
[02:04:24.143 --> 02:04:25.885]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:04:25.885 --> 02:04:30.189]  Be talking to you more in the next few days about official capacity here at InfoWars.
[02:04:30.189 --> 02:04:31.110]  Welcome to the team, buddy.
[02:04:31.110 --> 02:04:32.251]  You bet.
[02:04:32.251 --> 02:04:32.611]  Thank you.
[02:04:32.611 --> 02:04:35.314]  All right, there goes Wayne Madsen reporting from Capitol Hill.
[02:04:35.314 --> 02:04:37.516]  You can hear the reporters chattering in the background.
[02:04:38.197 --> 02:04:43.323]  I've got a few words to say about a house of cards when we come back on the other side.
[02:04:43.323 --> 02:04:49.310]  I know I'm not talking about the HBO television show or Netflix or whatever it is.
[02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:50.832]  No, I mean the real house of cards.
[02:04:50.832 --> 02:04:51.853]  Stay with us.
[02:04:51.853 --> 02:04:52.934]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:52.934 --> 02:04:55.738]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:59.287 --> 02:05:07.933]  It becomes more apparent every day that movie stars who don't swear allegiance to leftist dogma are targeted and in some cases blacklisted altogether.
[02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:10.214]  Earlier this year, Robert Downey Jr.
[02:05:10.214 --> 02:05:15.658]  was berated, rather pathetically I might add, by a reporter for not being liberal enough.
[02:05:15.658 --> 02:05:17.039]  Does that mean you're not a liberal?
[02:05:17.039 --> 02:05:21.142]  The reporter asked, to which Downey responds, are we promoting a movie?
[02:05:21.142 --> 02:05:24.444]  He then went on to assert that he is not a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:05:24.944 --> 02:05:29.487]  Now, actor Vince Vaughn is in hot water for standing up for gun rights.
[02:05:29.487 --> 02:05:31.189]  It's not about duck hunting.
[02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:33.610]  It's about the ability of the individual.
[02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:36.973]  It's the same reason we have freedom of speech, Vaughn said.
[02:05:36.973 --> 02:05:38.193]  And he's right.
[02:05:38.193 --> 02:05:39.774]  And he's not the only one.
[02:05:39.774 --> 02:05:46.439]  Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, and Carl Malone, to name a few, are also outspoken advocates for the Second Amendment.
[02:05:46.439 --> 02:05:53.164]  I know that standing up for individual rights isn't as trendy as saying men are misogynist from birth, but it is something we need nonetheless.
[02:05:53.664 --> 02:05:58.848]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:05:58.848 --> 02:06:01.470]  Infowarslife.com.

[02:06:11.338 --> 02:06:17.303]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not
[02:06:17.363 --> 02:06:17.884]  We're good to go.
[02:06:34.767 --> 02:06:38.570]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:49.399]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[02:06:49.399 --> 02:06:57.026]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:06:58.757 --> 02:07:03.919]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[02:07:03.919 --> 02:07:11.242]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[02:07:11.242 --> 02:07:19.326]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:07:19.326 --> 02:07:20.306]  The bad news is
[02:07:20.646 --> 02:07:28.332]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[02:07:28.332 --> 02:07:33.136]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[02:07:33.136 --> 02:07:40.502]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:40.502 --> 02:07:43.384]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:07:43.624 --> 02:07:50.607]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[02:07:50.607 --> 02:07:54.589]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:59.184 --> 02:08:00.744]  It's all a PSYOP.
[02:08:00.744 --> 02:08:07.306]  The threat fusion centers, the militarization of police, military on the streets, TSA on the streets.
[02:08:07.306 --> 02:08:12.267]  During the Boston bombing, half of the houses in the city searched without warrants.
[02:08:12.267 --> 02:08:15.168]  Women drug out of their homes at gunpoint.
[02:08:15.168 --> 02:08:17.589]  It's all an exercise of power.
[02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:25.731]  It's all a conditioning program to train the American people to accept what is only normal in third world dictatorships.
[02:08:26.621 --> 02:08:31.184]  Will we allow our journey towards despotism and tyranny to be complete?
[02:08:31.184 --> 02:08:36.408]  Or will we turn the situation around and restore our beloved republic?
[02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:36.748]  Police!
[02:08:36.748 --> 02:08:37.729]  Fire it!
[02:08:37.729 --> 02:08:43.513]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[02:08:43.513 --> 02:08:47.616]  We need to make sure too that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave.
[02:08:47.616 --> 02:08:49.237]  We need to make note, call it in.
[02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:54.573]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[02:08:54.573 --> 02:08:58.356]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[02:08:58.356 --> 02:09:01.858]  And instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:09:01.858 --> 02:09:03.720]  You said guns will be taken?
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:05.021]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:09.003]  We will take all weapons.
[02:09:09.003 --> 02:09:15.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide, now well into the third hour of this June 2nd, 2015 transmission.
[02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:21.251]  A lot of really important news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:21.251 --> 02:09:24.853]  Rand Paul joins fight to release secret 9-11 documents.
[02:09:24.853 --> 02:09:25.433]  Bilderberg 2015.
[02:09:25.433 --> 02:09:29.875]  Elites prepare for nuclear economic devastation.
[02:09:29.875 --> 02:09:34.436]  Liberals worship Caitlyn Jenner as transgender goddess.
[02:09:34.436 --> 02:09:37.557]  That's what's important as we see the world destabilize.
[02:09:37.557 --> 02:09:40.679]  Florida court rules off-the-grid living illegal.
[02:09:40.679 --> 02:09:43.680]  Hacked emails expose George Soros as Ukraine puppet master.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:47.764]  Paul Craig Roberts has an article, ruled by corporations.
[02:09:47.764 --> 02:09:52.469]  Trendy's ready for the ultimate wearable implantable microchip under their skin.
[02:09:52.469 --> 02:09:56.394]  Obama, I will never engage in the politics in which I'm trying to divide people.
[02:09:56.394 --> 02:09:58.376]  Talk about a 1984 statement.
[02:09:58.376 --> 02:10:01.400]  That's some of the news on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:13.004]  I haven't gotten to FBI behind mysterious surveillance aircraft over cities, planes carrying video, cell phones, snooping technology, hidden behind fictitious government front companies.
[02:10:13.004 --> 02:10:17.066]  I told you about this, I don't know, more than 10 years ago.
[02:10:17.066 --> 02:10:23.089]  They've got, not just the FBI, the EPA has them, the FDA has them.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:34.384]  The Department of Energy has them, and they're just fleets of Cessnas, and they fly around Department of Energy, Department of the Interior.
[02:10:34.384 --> 02:10:40.326]  If you build a barn on your property when you're not supposed to, you know, they come and find you.
[02:10:40.326 --> 02:10:48.689]  They use predator drones on people because the cows that come on their property in South Dakota, no, North Dakota three times, under law, you can then take the cows.
[02:10:48.689 --> 02:10:51.610]  They did that, so they had predator drones from the Air Force come in.
[02:10:52.981 --> 02:10:55.583]  We reported on it, they made fun of us and said that wasn't happening.
[02:10:55.583 --> 02:11:02.930]  Coming up in about 40 after when Steve Pchening leaves us, I will break that down in detail.
[02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:07.934]  But I'm glad that's finally hitting the news.
[02:11:07.934 --> 02:11:16.602]  But before we go any further, I wanted to just bring up the fact that Jade Helm is still coming up in July and August.
[02:11:18.177 --> 02:11:20.798]  I don't expect it to be a military takeover at that time.
[02:11:20.798 --> 02:11:34.222]  We said day one it's conditioning to train our military to accept it, to train the public to accept it, and it's been in the Army times, the Army War College has reported it stars and stripes that the military is quote training to crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[02:11:35.885 --> 02:11:37.706]  And it's training for domestic insurrection.
[02:11:37.706 --> 02:11:54.495]  While George Soros and the Democrats and the State Department and the Justice Department have been caught trying to foment any political angst in this country against the police themselves, when there's a lot of bad police and a lot of bad training, most of it federal, it's still a scapegoat.
[02:11:55.737 --> 02:12:03.840]  And so, they want to preemptively start unrest so Obama can be the savior this summer, as economic problems and other things intensify.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:15.385]  And as Al Sharpton said, they want to federalize the states and brand any state actions to secure security and order as racist.
[02:12:15.385 --> 02:12:21.247]  Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us, former head of psychological operations of the State Department, one of the guys that helped found Delta Force.
[02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:22.841]  We're good to go.
[02:12:32.682 --> 02:12:38.384]  And he joins us now to give us his take on Jade Helm and a lot of other issues that are going on.
[02:12:38.384 --> 02:12:47.227]  I want to ask you about blackmail in Congress, with the pervert rings that seem to permeate things, and where he sees the election going.
[02:12:47.227 --> 02:12:50.948]  Also, we thank Sir Rand Paul, calling for the 28 pages to be released.
[02:12:50.948 --> 02:12:52.648]  Steve Pchenik dot com.
[02:12:52.648 --> 02:12:54.569]  Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:12:54.569 --> 02:12:56.510]  It's always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:59.751]  I want to thank you for what you did in bringing up Jade Helm.
[02:12:59.751 --> 02:13:01.131]  Actually, I was not aware of it.
[02:13:01.836 --> 02:13:06.195]  I live in the south near Georgia and actually a couple people came up to me and asked me about it.
[02:13:06.818 --> 02:13:09.399]  When I checked into it, I was incredulous.
[02:13:09.399 --> 02:13:36.207]  I couldn't believe that we would spend $10 billion on a game that has no value whatsoever, that is not even remotely related to human terrain, which means psychological warfare, understanding cultures, understanding distant cultures, understanding different topographies, and using that in Texas, New Mexico, Nevada.
[02:13:36.927 --> 02:13:52.286]  It actually mirrored, and I couldn't believe that General Adorno hadn't read my book, State of Emergency, where it's exactly what I wrote about when the federal government came into the state government, actually in Nevada and Texas and Colorado, over water rights.
[02:13:52.386 --> 02:13:54.968]  You know, I forgot, that's one of the last books she wrote.
[02:13:54.968 --> 02:13:55.948]  I hadn't even thought of that.
[02:13:55.948 --> 02:13:58.630]  You basically predicted that in one of your books.
[02:13:58.630 --> 02:14:04.394]  And then, there's another book that just came out that Colonel Schaefer wrote, where the same thing happens.
[02:14:04.394 --> 02:14:12.419]  We gotta get Schaefer back on, because he said, I can't tell you what's classified, but I've put it in a novel, and I wonder if he was trying to warn us of something.
[02:14:12.419 --> 02:14:20.924]  Well, I warned you about it in State of Emergency, where I literally took an actual episode from Nye County, N.Y.E.
[02:14:20.924 --> 02:14:21.825]  County, Nevada.
[02:14:22.445 --> 02:14:37.812]  Over water rights and the federal government came in and confronted our National Guard and state troopers and to me this was the beginning of the second Civil War and I couldn't believe when I read that General Adorno who really is not qualified to
[02:14:38.283 --> 02:14:40.805]  to be in a military command post anymore.
[02:14:40.805 --> 02:14:43.687]  He was a consultant to Condoleezza Rice.
[02:14:43.687 --> 02:14:45.989]  He was never trained in psychological warfare.
[02:14:45.989 --> 02:14:48.591]  He was never trained, really, in counterterrorism.
[02:14:48.591 --> 02:15:01.622]  He's the kind of political general that we've had all along, from McChrystal to McRaven to Mullins to, you know, a whole bunch of these generals who've done absolutely nothing.
[02:15:01.622 --> 02:15:05.465]  And in light of the fact that we are literally losing men
[02:15:06.090 --> 02:15:21.803]  Money and time and our allies in Palmyra Syria where I was there during the second Iraq war and losing men and money and allies in Iraq where we have been spending billions if not trillions of dollars since the Bush administration.
[02:15:21.803 --> 02:15:23.264]  I find this incursion.
[02:15:23.863 --> 02:15:25.805]  We're good to go.
[02:15:44.165 --> 02:15:48.728]  And it looks like it's pointed at legitimate state actions, so it's very tyrannical.
[02:15:48.728 --> 02:16:01.015]  But showing Texas is hostile, showing Southern California is hostile, Utah is hostile, they admit in the early document it's to win hearts and minds, it's to simulate illegal activity, it's to study culture.
[02:16:01.015 --> 02:16:03.137]  Clearly then they're talking about our culture.
[02:16:04.057 --> 02:16:08.238]  It looks like a total mess and a disaster and an indictment of the U.S.
[02:16:08.238 --> 02:16:08.718]  military.
[02:16:25.203 --> 02:16:32.387]  Because they have been losing more and more wars since 9-11, which you know was created by Bush and Cheney.
[02:16:32.387 --> 02:16:41.832]  They have destroyed more countries, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and now they're in the process of other countries, of literally losing them.
[02:16:41.832 --> 02:16:43.633]  They're all over Africa.
[02:16:43.633 --> 02:16:48.176]  What in God's name is our military and special forces doing all over Africa?
[02:16:48.776 --> 02:16:51.977]  Fighting different insurgencies when we're not winning anything.
[02:16:51.977 --> 02:16:54.558]  We have no national security interest.
[02:16:54.558 --> 02:16:59.360]  And the Chinese are coming into every area that we're in and buying their way.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.542]  They don't have any kinetic actions whatsoever.
[02:17:02.542 --> 02:17:07.664]  Yet our military has failed for the past 30 to 40 years.
[02:17:07.664 --> 02:17:12.866]  I would do what General Marshall, George Marshall, did when he started to implement World War II.
[02:17:12.866 --> 02:17:16.887]  I would fire the first 600 Navy admirals and generals.
[02:17:16.887 --> 02:17:17.948]  We have had nothing.
[02:17:18.468 --> 02:17:21.530]  Nothing but incompetent military senior officials.
[02:17:21.530 --> 02:17:29.234]  I understand it's incompetent overall, but what do you think, looking at it, was the establishment's plan to launch this?
[02:17:29.234 --> 02:17:33.596]  I don't think the establishment is that clever or that effective or that brave.
[02:17:33.596 --> 02:17:36.717]  Quite frankly, most of our generals are not very brave.
[02:17:36.717 --> 02:17:45.602]  They are men who really want to stay into the system so they can garner their pensions and then make money in the military-industrial complex.
[02:17:46.042 --> 02:17:48.625]  They don't have the guts to become tyrannical.
[02:17:48.625 --> 02:17:50.807]  You don't have that kind of man here.
[02:17:50.807 --> 02:17:52.869]  You don't even have it in Obama.
[02:17:52.869 --> 02:17:57.433]  You basically have men who are following orders, just like the Germans did.
[02:17:57.433 --> 02:17:59.975]  They're following... Okay, well who's giving the orders then?
[02:17:59.975 --> 02:18:04.620]  Because that sounds even scarier to have incompetence poking China and Russia.
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:06.501]  That's correct.
[02:18:06.501 --> 02:18:08.102]  Now you hit it on the head, Alex.
[02:18:08.102 --> 02:18:12.845]  That's what I wanted to inform you and your people, is that this is beyond incompetence.
[02:18:12.845 --> 02:18:17.468]  This is gross negligence and incompetence, but I don't mind firing them.
[02:18:17.468 --> 02:18:20.731]  I don't mind if they stay in their forts, Fort Bliss or Hood.
[02:18:20.731 --> 02:18:27.075]  I mind paying $10 billion for a totally useless exercise, which at the same time
[02:18:27.797 --> 02:18:41.322]  Exacerbates any concerns that we have about the government, reaffirms the fact that we, the American people, do not trust our civilian leaders, our military leaders, our intelligence leaders, or our legislative leaders.
[02:18:41.322 --> 02:18:57.228]  In fact, what's happening with this very exercise, and why I thank you and your audience, is that it reaffirmed that under no condition do we have any trust whatsoever, whether you're Republican, Democrat... So it's a good message to send, don't ever try to bring in martial law?
[02:18:58.495 --> 02:18:59.196]  You can't.
[02:18:59.196 --> 02:19:05.499]  I mean, when I needed the military and I needed the FBI in a hostage situation, they were incompetent.
[02:19:05.499 --> 02:19:08.781]  They immediately said, no, doctor, I have Posse Comitatus.
[02:19:08.781 --> 02:19:12.123]  I said, fine, don't come in, but don't bother me.
[02:19:12.123 --> 02:19:19.127]  And then the FBI couldn't handle repelling when they had a hostage situation in the Hanafi Muslims.
[02:19:19.127 --> 02:19:20.168]  So what you have...
[02:19:20.828 --> 02:19:28.173]  I ought to have you on for a full hour sometime about the stuff that's declassified on some of the famous hostage situations that you've... Well, my point is very simple.
[02:19:28.173 --> 02:19:42.162]  You have a make-believe military that is in fact losing men in a guacamole game where they're creating all kinds of episodes and incidents and crises all over the world thanks to Bush, Cheney, Carter, Clinton.
[02:19:44.445 --> 02:19:45.246]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:19:45.246 --> 02:19:47.630]  I mean, it sounds like Project Loki.
[02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:49.613]  Sounds like Loki runs our foreign policy.
[02:19:49.613 --> 02:19:50.314]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:50.314 --> 02:19:50.775]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.098 --> 02:20:03.642]  When you're listening to the radio and you hear... We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
[02:20:03.642 --> 02:20:04.663]  You listen closely.
[02:20:04.663 --> 02:20:09.768]  Your pulse rate increases and you wonder if you're prepared for whatever man-made or natural disaster has occurred.
[02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:13.651]  If food became unavailable, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[02:20:13.971 --> 02:20:22.094]  Have you checked and found emergency food can cost as much as $300 for a month's supply and is full of weird chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[02:20:58.863 --> 02:21:03.108]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:03.108 --> 02:21:03.729]  It's true.
[02:21:03.729 --> 02:21:07.874]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:07.874 --> 02:21:10.277]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:10.277 --> 02:21:14.743]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:21:15.043 --> 02:21:27.933]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:21:38.682 --> 02:21:39.503]  Big Berkey.
[02:21:39.503 --> 02:21:43.206]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:21:43.206 --> 02:21:44.967]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[02:21:48.090 --> 02:21:49.391]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:21:49.391 --> 02:21:50.432]  For the love of clean water.
[02:21:58.943 --> 02:22:05.686]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:05.686 --> 02:22:10.087]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:10.087 --> 02:22:13.589]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:13.589 --> 02:22:14.709]  Not fun!
[02:22:14.709 --> 02:22:23.112]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:23.112 --> 02:22:27.874]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:28.214 --> 02:22:29.375]  My name is Errol.
[02:22:29.375 --> 02:22:30.896]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:22:30.896 --> 02:22:33.477]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:22:33.477 --> 02:22:41.322]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:41.322 --> 02:22:47.646]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:22:47.646 --> 02:22:48.126]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:14.111]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:14.111 --> 02:24:15.432]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:24:15.432 --> 02:24:16.233]  Dr. Steve Pachenik.
[02:24:17.262 --> 02:24:22.007]  Here's our guest, Steve McShannock.com.
[02:24:22.007 --> 02:24:27.071]  But obviously there is a directive to militarize police to override the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:24:27.071 --> 02:24:28.713]  There is a totalitarian vein.
[02:24:28.713 --> 02:24:33.738]  All these multinational corporations openly want a planetary government run by them.
[02:24:33.738 --> 02:24:36.080]  The opposite of a free market.
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:38.362]  They are trying to get the police to train with the military.
[02:24:38.362 --> 02:24:39.843]  That's a long-term project.
[02:24:40.796 --> 02:24:44.058]  So that's why folks are concerned about Jade Helm.
[02:24:44.058 --> 02:24:50.861]  But I was surprised by the huge response, and even governors and senators coming out and saying they were concerned.
[02:24:50.861 --> 02:24:59.685]  I think it is a no-confidence vote, regardless of the current political class, with an 8% approval rating and gallop of Congress.
[02:24:59.685 --> 02:25:01.346]  So with that climate, Dr. Pucinich,
[02:25:02.609 --> 02:25:13.786]  And the federal government funding white privileged classes in elementary schools nationwide, and teachers are reporting that it's causing just pandemonium as everybody turns on each other.
[02:25:13.786 --> 02:25:17.251]  Why is the system trying to run a divide and conquer operation?
[02:25:18.452 --> 02:25:22.295]  What is your take on Soros funding anti-police operations?
[02:25:22.295 --> 02:25:28.340]  I mean, obviously there are problems with police, but there's a larger destabilization program here.
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:31.322]  What do you think the method of the madness is?
[02:25:31.322 --> 02:25:38.027]  Or is it a bunch of 60s radicals that are now in control, and even though they run things, they want to destroy it?
[02:25:38.027 --> 02:25:44.012]  Or is it just mental illness that they want to wreck the country because they're destructive?
[02:25:44.012 --> 02:25:46.954]  Is it deviance?
[02:25:46.954 --> 02:25:47.575]  What's happening?
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:53.805]  Well, I think the best way to summarize all of this is just complete incompetency.
[02:25:53.805 --> 02:26:04.733]  What we've elected is a president who never had a job, had never been in the military, had never really run anything, and on the basis of his charisma was elected.
[02:26:04.733 --> 02:26:08.036]  That's the same thing we elected in terms of the sociopaths.
[02:26:08.636 --> 02:26:09.737]  Bush Jr.
[02:26:09.737 --> 02:26:11.098]  who totally lied.
[02:26:11.098 --> 02:26:20.803]  A man who was willing to use force and the intelligence system and the military in order to kill people, our own people, in the United States.
[02:26:20.803 --> 02:26:28.367]  The problem is, we have not been willing to hold these people accountable for their miscreant behaviors.
[02:26:28.367 --> 02:26:35.431]  So if the American people are not willing to stand up and say, I want Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld,
[02:26:36.384 --> 02:26:57.063]  Uh, all the generals who are involved and all the admirals who are involved, General Myers and others, to be held accountable for our 9-11 stand-down, false flag, and the incompetency, as well as the CIA, we will continue to have incompetent, self-serving leaders who are intent on just serving themselves.
[02:26:57.063 --> 02:26:59.566]  They have nothing to do with the United States.
[02:27:00.246 --> 02:27:09.675]  Every general that's involved here, Adorno, to Cleveland, to every other military individual, including McChrystal, were all promised jobs.
[02:27:09.675 --> 02:27:13.558]  So you have somebody like McRaven, who was a total disaster.
[02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:16.440]  As Seymour Hersh said, there wasn't even a raid.
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:18.702]  He becomes the president of Texas A&M.
[02:27:18.702 --> 02:27:19.003]  Why?
[02:27:19.583 --> 02:27:32.311]  Because the Bush family takes care of everybody who colludes with them, including Gates, the head of the CIA, who was a very ineffectual CIA director and a very ineffectual Secretary of Defense.
[02:27:32.311 --> 02:27:35.153]  So until the American public, at the local level,
[02:27:35.882 --> 02:27:42.707]  Refuses to have our military stand ground in an area where it involves posse comitatus.
[02:27:42.707 --> 02:27:53.255]  You have commissioners at the local level in Texas, Nevada, Utah, and in Florida where we can say, no, you cannot come in here, it's posse comitatus.
[02:27:53.255 --> 02:28:00.221]  No, we have police forces that enact judicial actions.
[02:28:00.221 --> 02:28:04.364]  Sure, there are preparations for massive civil unrest at an unprecedented level.
[02:28:04.364 --> 02:28:05.365]  What do you think those are about?
[02:28:05.905 --> 02:28:08.006]  Well, I don't think they're very effective.
[02:28:08.006 --> 02:28:10.188]  Number one, we're a very large country.
[02:28:10.188 --> 02:28:13.910]  Number two, I've seen our military repeatedly defeated.
[02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:17.192]  Alex, this is something your audience has to understand.
[02:28:17.192 --> 02:28:20.734]  We have been defeated with trillions of dollars in Iraq.
[02:28:20.734 --> 02:28:29.160]  This is the 12th year that we now... Secretary of Defense... But that's the larger globalist plan to destabilize the world while sapping our resources.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:32.581]  Well, I don't think there's a destabilization plan.
[02:28:32.581 --> 02:28:35.242]  Again, let me go back to where you and I differ.
[02:28:35.242 --> 02:28:49.107]  I think our incompetence is so grand and so fungible that we have been funding people who should have been eliminated and totally, totally dismissed, but we don't have a legislative system that is effective.
[02:28:49.107 --> 02:28:55.769]  No, I know there's a lot of incompetence, but the social engineers make money off the crises they create, never get in trouble.
[02:28:56.329 --> 02:29:04.698]  But basically these social engineers, which is the military-industrial complex, we don't have a leader who comes out of the military and the business world.
[02:29:04.698 --> 02:29:06.199]  We need that next leader.
[02:29:06.199 --> 02:29:07.400]  It's not Hillary.
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:08.081]  It's not another Bush.
[02:29:08.081 --> 02:29:09.663]  Let me ask you this for the next segment then.
[02:29:09.663 --> 02:29:14.828]  I mean, China's moving artillery into their sandcastle islands they're building.
[02:29:14.828 --> 02:29:16.430]  You've got the situation with Russia.
[02:29:16.430 --> 02:29:19.252]  I mean, the world's really heating up and I don't...
[02:29:20.379 --> 02:29:21.620]  Let me, let me be frank.
[02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:26.021]  I wrote about the Spratly Islands 30 years ago in Pax Pacifica.
[02:29:26.021 --> 02:29:28.442]  There we have been doing a pretty good job.
[02:29:28.442 --> 02:29:28.762]  St.
[02:29:28.762 --> 02:29:33.144]  Pac, our commanders in the Pacific, has handled that exceedingly well.
[02:29:33.144 --> 02:29:33.544]  Stay there.
[02:29:33.544 --> 02:29:42.348]  Explain to us your take, Steve Pichinning, Dr. Steve Pichinning, on the situation in the South China Sea and the sandcastles, as the Pentagon calls them.
[02:29:42.348 --> 02:29:47.250]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, for breaking news and the tip of the spear info.
[02:29:48.206 --> 02:29:52.159]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.159 --> 02:29:54.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.733 --> 02:30:12.075]  Fresh off their victories against manspreading, for which multiple people have already been arrested in places like New York, feminists are now setting their sights on the highest target possible, Almighty God.
[02:30:12.075 --> 02:30:24.138]  The article, Feminist Clergy Wants Christians to Refer to God as She, breaks down how an activist group over in England, Women in the Church or WATCH, has already had success putting female bishops in the church.
[02:30:24.978 --> 02:30:26.599]  But they didn't stop there.
[02:30:26.599 --> 02:30:31.743]  The chairperson for WATCH was quoted as saying, Quietly, clergy are just talking about God as she every now and then.
[02:30:44.531 --> 02:30:53.161]  Keeping in mind that multiple times throughout the Bible, Jesus refers to God as his father, not his mother, his father.
[02:30:53.161 --> 02:30:56.405]  You can find this and many other reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:59.304 --> 02:31:00.565]  Another major health threat.
[02:31:00.565 --> 02:31:05.527]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:05.527 --> 02:31:08.208]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:08.208 --> 02:31:15.251]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:15.251 --> 02:31:18.252]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:18.252 --> 02:31:21.273]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:21.273 --> 02:31:23.214]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:23.214 --> 02:31:26.055]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:26.135 --> 02:31:31.857]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:31.857 --> 02:31:35.359]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:35.359 --> 02:31:38.460]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:45.783]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:31:59.090 --> 02:32:16.025]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:32:16.025 --> 02:32:19.268]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:32:19.588 --> 02:32:23.652]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:32:23.652 --> 02:32:25.193]  HDfirearms.com.
[02:32:25.193 --> 02:32:28.516]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:32:28.516 --> 02:32:33.640]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[02:32:52.076 --> 02:32:56.761]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[02:32:56.761 --> 02:32:57.682]  HDFirearms.com
[02:33:16.622 --> 02:33:21.685]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:21.685 --> 02:33:26.508]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.508 --> 02:33:32.391]  Those of you who are graduating this afternoon with high honors, awards, and distinctions, I say well done.
[02:33:32.391 --> 02:33:38.014]  And as I like to tell the C students, you too can be president.
[02:33:39.662 --> 02:33:44.909]  If your dad was the president and basically installed you in there, yes.
[02:33:44.909 --> 02:33:51.859]  And I guess you could say Kim Jong-un could say, you know, my dad said, you too can be a horrible, insane dictator.
[02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:55.371]  Who executes people with anti-aircraft guns.
[02:33:55.371 --> 02:33:56.932]  I mean, this is really getting crazy.
[02:33:56.932 --> 02:34:02.235]  Dr. Steve Pachinik, stevepachinik.com, psychological warfare expert.
[02:34:02.235 --> 02:34:05.097]  Involved in a lot of operations, the Camp David Accords, you name it.
[02:34:05.097 --> 02:34:07.198]  Been there for so much of history.
[02:34:07.198 --> 02:34:10.400]  He's a psychiatrist and also a medical doctor.
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:12.721]  MIT and Harvard, pretty smart guy.
[02:34:12.721 --> 02:34:14.262]  Seen a lot.
[02:34:14.262 --> 02:34:16.383]  Again, co-authored books with Tom Clancy.
[02:34:16.383 --> 02:34:17.324]  He's got a new book out.
[02:34:19.619 --> 02:34:26.023]  Where he breaks down basically a lot of non-fiction information we'll tell you about before he leaves.
[02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:35.069]  But finishing up, Dr. Pachinik, with this larger subject, there is a hubris, there is an arrogance.
[02:34:35.069 --> 02:34:38.531]  I know there's a method to their badness, they have plans.
[02:34:38.531 --> 02:34:41.773]  But even people that were more competent, like Napoleon and Hitler,
[02:34:43.206 --> 02:34:46.207]  Obviously failed beating Russia.
[02:34:46.207 --> 02:34:53.450]  And I see this disease in elites throughout history, believing that they are basically invincible, infallible.
[02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:58.752]  So I think some megalomania has entered the psyche here of the establishment.
[02:34:58.752 --> 02:35:09.576]  I know you're a psychiatrist, but looking at this, looking at what's happening in China, look at what's happening around the world, I see a lot of power tripping megalomania out of other leaders as well.
[02:35:09.576 --> 02:35:11.677]  We can't afford to have mistakes like we've had
[02:35:12.677 --> 02:35:22.420]  Pre-atomic and hydrogen weapons, and it really is scary to see elites running the New Zealand and buying bunkers at record levels.
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:26.041]  I mean, obviously the establishment itself is pretty freaked out right now.
[02:35:26.041 --> 02:35:27.141]  Is it the debt bubble?
[02:35:27.141 --> 02:35:28.602]  Is it the QE?
[02:35:28.602 --> 02:35:33.263]  I mean, why are the establishment running around like chickens with their heads cut off?
[02:35:34.161 --> 02:35:37.984]  Well, number one, we really don't have very much of an establishment.
[02:35:37.984 --> 02:35:44.469]  The people in the White House are not very well trained or tutored in psychological warfare or foreign policy.
[02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:45.670]  This is one of the weakest
[02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:56.416]  White House as we've had in the past 30-40 years, but the real issue is there are elements in our Navy and intelligence community that did understand.
[02:35:56.416 --> 02:36:00.379]  There's a book I wrote back specific of the Spratly Islands.
[02:36:00.379 --> 02:36:03.160]  The CIA knew about it 20-30 years ago.
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:07.103]  Our Navy was effective and they still are.
[02:36:07.103 --> 02:36:08.183]  I mean, they went out there.
[02:36:08.183 --> 02:36:10.705]  Now, why is the Spratly Islands important to us?
[02:36:11.388 --> 02:36:16.795]  Because China is basically breaking her promise to saying we're not a hegemony.
[02:36:16.795 --> 02:36:19.117]  We're not going to be a conquering nation.
[02:36:19.117 --> 02:36:22.702]  We're basically a very peaceful country.
[02:36:22.702 --> 02:36:28.409]  We made a deal to give them the Panama Canal, bases everywhere, let them dominate, and now they're double-crossing.
[02:36:29.133 --> 02:36:38.882]  Well, the truth of the matter is we've never believed this storyline, but now they've broken their own narrative by basically going into the Spratly Islands.
[02:36:38.882 --> 02:36:41.965]  For most of you out there, the Spratly Islands are a group of islands.
[02:36:42.498 --> 02:36:58.362]  They have no national security interest to us, and none to China, except for the fact that 1,000 miles off of the navigation zone of China, that's 1,000 miles, and they contain a lot of oil beneath those islands, and they're near Vietnam and the Philippines.
[02:36:58.362 --> 02:37:09.185]  We have basically been the guarantor of all naval movement, including civilian and military, through the Straits of Malacca to the China Sea to the Indian Ocean.
[02:37:09.685 --> 02:37:22.728]  And let's not forget, in the last two years, China's basically started having war out there, grabbing oil rigs and also having ground war on their border with Vietnam, so these two are getting at each other's throat.
[02:37:22.728 --> 02:37:32.150]  Well, the one thing that China has to remember, and the world has to remember, that the only country that ever beat China in war, not once but twice, was Vietnam.
[02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:33.130]  I repeat that again.
[02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:38.171]  Vietnam beat the Chinese in a military kinetic action in the 70s,
[02:37:39.361 --> 02:37:40.481]  Twice.
[02:37:40.481 --> 02:37:47.363]  And China has to remember that, even though Vietnam is much smaller and looks much more ineffective.
[02:37:47.363 --> 02:37:53.644]  I would warn the Chinese that the Vietnamese are far more effective in combat than they would imagine.
[02:37:53.644 --> 02:37:56.805]  But China's role is a far more nefarious role.
[02:37:56.805 --> 02:37:59.225]  It's an economic domination.
[02:37:59.225 --> 02:38:01.746]  What they've done is to break away from the dollar.
[02:38:01.746 --> 02:38:03.286]  They've broken away from our
[02:38:03.866 --> 02:38:13.013]  Currency in our Federal Reserve System so that they can create their own credit system, their own monetary system, and basically go all over the world.
[02:38:13.013 --> 02:38:25.963]  What's happened in the process, all of our allies have joined what's called the Asian International Infrastructure Bank, AIIB, which is a spinoff of something called the International Monetary Fund.
[02:38:25.963 --> 02:38:30.246]  Without getting too complicated, we are now in a strategic conflict
[02:38:31.327 --> 02:38:48.894]  With China, not on a military basis as much as we are on a financial, economic, strategic base where they're going to Africa and building up roads and infrastructure and we're going to Africa getting involved in kinetic action or combat which has no value whatsoever.
[02:38:48.894 --> 02:38:57.098]  So when I say gross incompetence, this is really a degradation of our capacity on our own infrastructure because we need that money.
[02:38:57.618 --> 02:38:58.860]  We sold that off to the Chinese?
[02:39:20.914 --> 02:39:26.620]  Advanced scholars in China and then there are students in America.
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:35.368]  In other words, the Chinese who have studied and gotten up to the college level are far more advanced than all of our students combined.
[02:39:35.368 --> 02:39:36.990]  So our education system is
[02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:38.050]  It's faltering.
[02:39:38.050 --> 02:39:41.852]  And it's not in arts and humanities, it's in engineering, chemical engineering.
[02:39:41.852 --> 02:39:47.014]  Engineering, chemical engineering, and it's in all the sciences, but also in the humanities.
[02:39:47.014 --> 02:39:49.775]  I mean, Chinese know more about our own history.
[02:39:49.775 --> 02:39:59.479]  I went to Beijing, there was a ten-story building that was filled with nothing but American politics, American books, and these Chinese kids read them, and they know it.
[02:39:59.479 --> 02:40:01.080]  They know our history better than we do.
[02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:05.063]  So the real issue now is where is the leadership coming from?
[02:40:05.063 --> 02:40:07.624]  It has to come from below to above.
[02:40:07.624 --> 02:40:10.706]  The leaders that have come forth are not really effective.
[02:40:10.706 --> 02:40:18.992]  The Bushes, the Clintons, perhaps the Rand Pauls because he stood up and he showed a moment of courage, which I really applaud.
[02:40:18.992 --> 02:40:20.073]  We need more of that.
[02:40:20.573 --> 02:40:23.715]  We can't have the rest of the Republican and Democratic Party.
[02:40:23.715 --> 02:40:30.120]  We need another party to arise from the grassroots, as you effectively have done to create the Tea Party.
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.841]  That Tea Party was co-opted.
[02:40:31.841 --> 02:40:41.788]  But I have faith in the American public that's going to say, look, I don't want to spend money for a war that comes into my area and a military that's totally ineffectual.
[02:40:42.128 --> 02:40:42.548]  Sure.
[02:40:42.548 --> 02:40:43.369]  Totally incompetent.
[02:41:01.696 --> 02:41:26.543]  But if the globalists and the people that think they're going to have these pipe dreams, they're going to have a civil war in America, try to take our guns, and then have their little socialist brigades back up police and military to go around and arrest veterans and conservatives and libertarians, that will elicit a response that'll be like trying to get a moose hunting permit.
[02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:30.244]  I mean, there'll be no operatives left very quickly.
[02:41:31.464 --> 02:41:39.749]  I don't know how insane the establishment is, or maybe the plan is to start a civil war, have us all kill each other, and that's what brings down America.
[02:41:39.749 --> 02:41:45.252]  I mean, I'm a lay guy, but I'm on the ground, I've been doing this 20 years, I know how stuff works.
[02:41:45.252 --> 02:41:48.974]  There is a narrative in the American psyche of a globalist.
[02:41:49.946 --> 02:41:50.727]  Takeover.
[02:41:50.727 --> 02:41:59.674]  People are ready for it, they're not scared, and I just don't think that all these people like George Soros and others understand what they're messing with.
[02:41:59.674 --> 02:42:01.715]  I think they take our restraint as weakness.
[02:42:01.715 --> 02:42:03.677]  What do you think they're thinking?
[02:42:03.677 --> 02:42:06.819]  Well, let me make the following point.
[02:42:06.819 --> 02:42:12.904]  The people in the Northeast, in the Midwest, in California are really not relevant to the arrest of the United States.
[02:42:12.904 --> 02:42:14.425]  Let me make it very simple.
[02:42:14.425 --> 02:42:15.286]  I live in the South.
[02:42:15.936 --> 02:42:21.960]  I see states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas.
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.641]  You know, we're all growing.
[02:42:23.641 --> 02:42:27.143]  The Midwestern states, the Northeastern states are dead.
[02:42:27.143 --> 02:42:28.404]  California is dead.
[02:42:28.404 --> 02:42:35.588]  I mean, Silicon Valley is producing a lot of junk that really doesn't create any effective assets.
[02:42:35.588 --> 02:42:38.050]  It's just a variation on the theme.
[02:42:38.050 --> 02:42:44.154]  I'm not worried about the sources of the world or the conscious of the world or any one of the
[02:42:44.807 --> 02:42:59.763]  So called demagogues because when they have to implement any effective action on the local level, particularly with those of us who have guns, who are trained and believe in the Second Amendment, they will back off very quickly.
[02:42:59.763 --> 02:43:05.550]  The reason I know that is I can assure you I see policemen on the federal level coming in with vests.
[02:43:06.330 --> 02:43:18.733]  And it's absurd because if you're coming in to offer us a subpoena or a warrant and you're wearing a vest, it's already flagging in to people like myself who are not looking for trouble.
[02:43:18.733 --> 02:43:20.453]  You're looking for trouble.
[02:43:20.453 --> 02:43:29.835]  And in the areas that I live in and the rest of America, those of us who are aware of our Second Amendment rights and our liberties will not tolerate that.
[02:43:29.835 --> 02:43:33.216]  The Northeast, the West Coast, it's not relevant anymore.
[02:43:33.627 --> 02:43:36.650]  Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, they're finished.
[02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:38.172]  Ohio is finished.
[02:43:38.172 --> 02:43:48.423]  So you have to look at the states that really are garnering assets and are building up factories, and they really are in Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida, because we're right-to-work states.
[02:43:48.423 --> 02:43:55.471]  Why is it the South, that everybody bashes and says we're all stupid and idiots all day, are the only places growing in America?
[02:43:55.911 --> 02:43:58.612]  Because, you know, we play dumb south.
[02:43:58.612 --> 02:44:02.252]  In other words, we allow the northerners to have their prejudice.
[02:44:02.252 --> 02:44:04.513]  We allow them to say what they want.
[02:44:04.513 --> 02:44:07.333]  But in effect, we don't pay the state taxes.
[02:44:07.333 --> 02:44:08.634]  We don't have unions.
[02:44:08.634 --> 02:44:12.014]  We don't have to have 14 different variations of taxes.
[02:44:12.014 --> 02:44:13.675]  We're growing economically.
[02:44:13.675 --> 02:44:21.396]  Every foreign country, foreign company that comes in, comes into Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida.
[02:44:21.396 --> 02:44:24.837]  We got more high-tech in here, in the northern area of Florida.
[02:44:25.237 --> 02:44:25.297]  Yes.
[02:44:41.178 --> 02:44:42.119]  Can no longer exist.
[02:44:42.119 --> 02:44:51.263]  Well, if you look at the old Civil War, the first one, the North won because it was the industrial power with about 10 times the industry and the British pulled out on funding the South.
[02:44:51.263 --> 02:44:53.064]  I wouldn't have supported the South or the North.
[02:44:53.064 --> 02:44:56.626]  The whole thing was a big tragedy, obviously, to control Western expansion.
[02:44:56.626 --> 02:45:01.029]  It was a fight over two different power blocks and almost happened under Andrew Jackson.
[02:45:01.029 --> 02:45:07.092]  But undoubtedly, it's sad to see what socialism and corrupt government has done.
[02:45:07.092 --> 02:45:10.374]  And not the South is perfect or Texas, the gateway to the West.
[02:45:11.475 --> 02:45:16.039]  But, I mean, the values on the West Coast and the East Coast are gone.
[02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:24.828]  These people are zombies on average, and I just can't believe all these Californians, I know they're not Californians, they're folks that went to California and failed.
[02:45:24.828 --> 02:45:29.313]  They come here, and then they want to jack up taxes and recreate what they just left.
[02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:45.538]  Well, the fact of the matter is, people like myself who shot films there and with startup companies, when we have to have a special broker in California in order to pay our California taxes, forget the regular taxes, then we pull out.
[02:45:45.538 --> 02:45:50.782]  I mean, California is just a question of basically evaporating, literally.
[02:45:50.782 --> 02:45:52.283]  I mean, they have a drought.
[02:45:52.283 --> 02:45:54.544]  They have not dealt effectively with their drought.
[02:45:54.544 --> 02:45:56.226]  They will have no water.
[02:45:56.226 --> 02:45:56.766]  The water is
[02:45:56.766 --> 02:45:59.588]  The left wouldn't let them build reservoirs 30 years ago.
[02:45:59.588 --> 02:46:01.410]  They're suicidal!
[02:46:01.410 --> 02:46:04.373]  Well, that's their own self-destructiveness and their own arrogance.
[02:46:04.373 --> 02:46:05.233]  You're a psychiatrist.
[02:46:05.233 --> 02:46:11.539]  I wanted to ask you, what is up, and I'm not judging people, but obsessively pushing men wearing dresses.
[02:46:11.539 --> 02:46:14.561]  Now they're saying we should pay for people to mutilate themselves.
[02:46:14.561 --> 02:46:16.683]  In fact, what's the name they give it?
[02:46:16.683 --> 02:46:19.546]  They call it trans-abled, cutting your arms and legs off.
[02:46:20.326 --> 02:46:25.090]  People, the new moral standard is to not care and be evil.
[02:46:25.090 --> 02:46:28.713]  The new moral standard is to be a loser, to be a slacker.
[02:46:28.713 --> 02:46:31.595]  This is what's being pushed at universities and everywhere.
[02:46:31.595 --> 02:46:38.741]  Is this just the end consequence of spoiled rotten kids having spoiled rotten kids and decadence, Dr. Pachinik?
[02:46:38.741 --> 02:46:45.867]  Well, what's happening is coming in as a media penetration of a sense of neutralizing
[02:46:46.725 --> 02:46:48.646]  Our male dominance.
[02:46:48.646 --> 02:46:55.371]  It's an attempt to basically neutralize the testosterone that we've had in the past in this country.
[02:46:55.371 --> 02:46:59.234]  And you have things like Jenners, which I don't agree with.
[02:46:59.234 --> 02:47:04.037]  I really would question all the surgeons who go into the transgender surgery.
[02:47:04.037 --> 02:47:05.818]  I've always questioned it.
[02:47:05.818 --> 02:47:10.861]  30 years ago, when John Hopkins started it, I said these people have psychiatric problems.
[02:47:10.861 --> 02:47:13.403]  It's not a question of just identity.
[02:47:13.403 --> 02:47:16.245]  And it's not just a question of what they are to themselves.
[02:47:16.745 --> 02:47:21.530]  However, it's not my problem, but it is my problem when I have to pay for that.
[02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:27.296]  I will not pay for those tranny experiments or the transgender transformations.
[02:47:27.296 --> 02:47:28.637]  That's their problem.
[02:47:28.637 --> 02:47:29.478]  That's not my problem.
[02:47:29.478 --> 02:47:30.298]  And let's expand.
[02:47:30.298 --> 02:47:37.746]  Now they're saying people don't feel good with their arms and legs, we gotta pay to have those cut off so they can have fetish sex with the limbs.
[02:47:39.568 --> 02:47:44.434]  That's going clearly to the extremes, but the bottom line that we have to go back to is the common sense.
[02:47:44.434 --> 02:47:46.436]  No, but this, sir, sir, I know it's to the extremes.
[02:47:46.436 --> 02:47:48.758]  It's being pushed in the National Post.
[02:47:48.758 --> 02:47:53.524]  This, watch, this is, this is the next mass mental illness is what I'm saying.
[02:47:53.524 --> 02:47:55.125]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:47:55.125 --> 02:48:00.972]  We don't have enough psychiatrists to treat a hundred million people, so you tell me what our society is saying.
[02:48:01.698 --> 02:48:11.164]  We did not produce enough psychiatrists nor will we to treat a hundred million people yet Obama and the Obamacare people say we have mental health provisions.
[02:48:11.164 --> 02:48:12.605]  No, we don't have any.
[02:48:12.605 --> 02:48:13.906]  We have no provisions.
[02:48:13.906 --> 02:48:14.506]  Let me ask you this.
[02:48:14.506 --> 02:48:22.132]  What I'm saying is it seems like the decadence you read about in empires that are about to fall is really going to seed right now and I really see
[02:48:23.992 --> 02:48:38.216]  People that want to work, that are normal, that care about just being happy and being secure, versus hordes of spoiled, rotten, bizarro totalitarians that call themselves leftists trying to conquer us with their mental illness.
[02:48:38.216 --> 02:48:47.478]  I mean, isn't there times in history when a large portion of society goes insane because of cultural reasons or whatever, and then they end up assaulting the people that aren't insane?
[02:48:48.291 --> 02:48:56.259]  Well, what we have now is, we have gone, and that's what I was trying to say from the beginning, we have gone from a republic to an empire.
[02:48:56.259 --> 02:49:06.950]  When we have soldiers in 722 bases in 220 countries, without any clear directive as to why we're there, other than the fact we're Pax Americana,
[02:49:07.450 --> 02:49:08.171]  That's it.
[02:49:22.805 --> 02:49:25.888]  And now, we are literally falling back to the weakest, Donald.
[02:49:25.888 --> 02:49:27.149]  We don't have education.
[02:49:27.149 --> 02:49:28.510]  We don't have infrastructure.
[02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:30.552]  And the elite's waging war on men.
[02:49:30.552 --> 02:49:34.776]  The Russians are holding men up because they know that's what's going to make a strong society.
[02:49:34.776 --> 02:49:40.061]  What type of elite, or is it just Hollywood mental illness, wants to screw up men?
[02:49:40.061 --> 02:49:41.122]  I just cannot believe it.
[02:49:41.744 --> 02:49:49.270]  Well, there's a whole notion now where we have more and more people of other persuasions that are in politics.
[02:49:49.270 --> 02:49:51.291]  Look at Mr. Asterisk.
[02:49:51.291 --> 02:50:05.442]  Look at the amount of homosexuals that we have who will, you know, I have nothing against them, but the whole issue of feminizing men has become a prevalent issue in the United States and the United States culture.
[02:50:05.982 --> 02:50:11.143]  When you have Bruce Jenner on the cover of Vogue magazine, I find that sick.
[02:50:11.143 --> 02:50:15.604]  We must be weak if our national obsession is men becoming women.
[02:50:15.604 --> 02:50:20.426]  I mean, that just sounds like the signpost of a country about to collapse to me.
[02:50:20.426 --> 02:50:21.726]  Well, it is.
[02:50:21.726 --> 02:50:29.328]  And in turn, you can understand how the Muslims in the Middle East can look at us and say we're a completely decadent society.
[02:50:29.328 --> 02:50:30.548]  When you have a Bruce Jenner,
[02:50:31.088 --> 02:50:41.013]  Rationalizing how he was a woman all the time and then transformed it and glorifies it and reifies it on Vogue magazine and then you have a media campaign.
[02:50:41.013 --> 02:50:43.694]  You realize we've lost a whole concern.
[02:50:43.694 --> 02:50:44.355]  Absolutely.
[02:50:44.355 --> 02:50:48.257]  I mean just the focus it should be on space exploration or scientific developments.
[02:50:48.257 --> 02:50:48.697]  Correct.
[02:50:48.697 --> 02:50:52.899]  If you want to be a woman go ahead but I don't don't force feed me and I'm sick of it.
[02:50:52.899 --> 02:50:55.120]  Final segment with Dr. Pachinic straight ahead.
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:56.201]  Powerful transmission.
[02:50:58.786 --> 02:51:00.828]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:51:00.828 --> 02:51:06.333]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:51:06.333 --> 02:51:10.917]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:51:10.917 --> 02:51:14.240]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:19.782]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:51:19.782 --> 02:51:26.383]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:51:26.383 --> 02:51:31.265]  Some might call us a premium product, but we simply strive to be a product that worked.
[02:51:31.265 --> 02:51:38.927]  Supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:51:39.167 --> 02:51:46.293]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:51:46.293 --> 02:51:53.378]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.
[02:51:53.378 --> 02:51:57.922]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[02:51:58.602 --> 02:52:00.542]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:00.542 --> 02:52:04.163]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:52:04.163 --> 02:52:05.524]  A pair of scissors.
[02:52:05.524 --> 02:52:11.305]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:52:11.305 --> 02:52:16.246]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:52:16.246 --> 02:52:17.226]  The phone line.
[02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:22.467]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:52:22.467 --> 02:52:26.208]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:52:26.388 --> 02:52:29.691]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:52:29.691 --> 02:52:32.153]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[02:52:32.153 --> 02:52:36.517]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[02:52:36.517 --> 02:52:37.598]  Scissors can't cut it.
[02:52:37.598 --> 02:52:40.060]  And that means your home stays safe.
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:43.643]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[02:52:43.863 --> 02:52:47.348]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[02:52:58.297 --> 02:53:01.679]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods?
[02:53:01.679 --> 02:53:02.519]  It's true.
[02:53:02.519 --> 02:53:06.701]  That's why for quality storable foods, you need Ready Made Resources.
[02:53:06.701 --> 02:53:12.964]  For over 19 years, we've become the name you can trust for thousands of products, like NuMana Healthy Food Storage.
[02:53:12.964 --> 02:53:16.846]  All NuMana storable foods are non-GMO, non-soy and gluten-free available.

[02:53:22.228 --> 02:53:23.929]  Ready Made Resources.
[02:53:23.929 --> 02:53:26.270]  We don't just sell the products, we live it.
[02:53:27.757 --> 02:53:28.998]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:28.998 --> 02:53:33.501]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:33.501 --> 02:53:39.185]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:39.185 --> 02:53:42.748]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:42.748 --> 02:53:45.570]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:50.453]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:50.713]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:50.713 --> 02:53:52.074]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:05.842 --> 02:54:13.988]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the nutritionists, medical doctors, and others on breaking down the massive iodine deficiencies in this country.
[02:54:13.988 --> 02:54:22.015]  Back in the 20s, the feds spurred food manufacturers to add small amounts of iodine to salt and other staples.
[02:54:22.015 --> 02:54:23.576]  Then by the 60s, it was removed.
[02:54:23.576 --> 02:54:30.982]  The bad halogen, as the Harvard study shows, is the whole fluoride family, bromine, bromide, chlorine.
[02:54:30.982 --> 02:54:32.403]  That goes into the thyroid.
[02:54:32.403 --> 02:54:34.645]  You've got record thyroid problems out there.
[02:54:35.618 --> 02:54:42.562]  Then we discovered, launching our nutraceutical company three years ago, that we couldn't carry other people's iodine.
[02:54:42.562 --> 02:54:49.587]  Because it just wasn't really true nascent iodine, and it was in alcohol, and it just caused stomachaches, you name it.
[02:54:49.587 --> 02:54:55.311]  So we went and got a deep earth source of it, the only folks that have this, and it's simply amazing.
[02:54:55.311 --> 02:54:56.311]  It's Survival Shield X2.
[02:54:57.964 --> 02:55:08.493]  And the problem is, is that we're selling out of our current supply and are running out in our last remanufacturing that's going on of the crystals themselves.
[02:55:08.493 --> 02:55:11.675]  And it could be six months, a year before we get more.
[02:55:11.675 --> 02:55:15.218]  I don't think it's going to be, but it's definitely probably going to be months.
[02:55:15.218 --> 02:55:19.181]  We've got one more run being done that's small, and then we're trying to secure more.
[02:55:19.181 --> 02:55:22.764]  And it's a very serious process to go through all this.
[02:55:22.764 --> 02:55:27.048]  Ours is so pure that it comes in the pure crystal form and gases.
[02:55:27.648 --> 02:55:28.933]  There's a scientific name for it.
[02:55:28.933 --> 02:55:32.066]  When you put it on a hot plate, it turns purple and into purple gas.
[02:55:33.244 --> 02:55:44.126]  So it's just amazing and just go read about what it does and all the details at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:44.126 --> 02:55:48.407]  This is how we fund sending three reporters to Bilderberg.
[02:55:48.407 --> 02:55:51.588]  This is how we report sending Joe Biggs to events.
[02:55:51.588 --> 02:55:52.568]  It's how we're doing this.
[02:55:52.568 --> 02:55:56.389]  So thank you all for shopping with the good guys at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:58.930]  All right, Dr. Steve Pachinik of StevePachinik.com.
[02:56:00.330 --> 02:56:04.871]  Folks can find your books there, including your latest non-fiction.
[02:56:04.871 --> 02:56:09.112]  I just see a general mental illness in the public, especially in young people.
[02:56:09.112 --> 02:56:13.692]  Either they're awake or they're just into being losers, into being decadent.
[02:56:13.692 --> 02:56:18.673]  For decadence sake, it's a media-induced malaise.
[02:56:18.673 --> 02:56:28.035]  I guess the disease of the Hollywood elite, who we know are incredibly decadent, is now kind of transmuting in a mob psychology to the public.
[02:56:29.402 --> 02:56:37.429]  Uh, and it's growing, and I don't mean to be hysterical, but in closing, can you speak to what you see as a psychiatrist, and then any other key points here in the last four minutes?
[02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:46.436]  Well, basically what I'm saying is that we're a nation that has lost our own direction because of the absence of leadership, and we're accountable for that.
[02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:50.934]  We have to begin to say to ourselves, what do we want as a leader?
[02:56:50.934 --> 02:56:59.702]  Do we want a woman who's been involved in a history of liaisons which may or may not be legal, who's been involved in chicanery?
[02:56:59.702 --> 02:57:04.407]  Do we want a man who's been involved in a history of illegal activities?
[02:57:04.947 --> 02:57:08.772]  And who has never had a real job or never been in the military.
[02:57:08.772 --> 02:57:15.800]  We are not holding our leaders accountable at the level of voting, at the level of accountability, at the local level.
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:23.449]  We're allowing the big donors to basically steamroll us through into a situation which is not acceptable.
[02:57:23.969 --> 02:57:25.489]  At some point, we will blow.
[02:57:25.489 --> 02:57:32.931]  That means at some point, the local entities will refuse to have the military in their presence.
[02:57:32.931 --> 02:57:36.192]  They will refuse to have their sons go into the military.
[02:57:36.192 --> 02:57:37.912]  And I see the reverse.
[02:57:37.912 --> 02:57:49.995]  I see people who are very well dedicated to this country, who have very strong Christian values, who work exceedingly hard, and are very disappointed with our government, but they basically decided to work
[02:57:50.635 --> 02:57:56.199]  They're ours and create their businesses and they're doing it well in the South.
[02:57:56.199 --> 02:57:57.079]  That's what I see.
[02:57:57.079 --> 02:57:58.900]  So I see the reverse of it.
[02:57:58.900 --> 02:58:06.185]  I've left the areas where I find the millennials and those who came out of college and have no skills or even those who have skills.
[02:58:06.605 --> 02:58:10.948]  They're spoiled brats that want to dominate producers as their act of conquest.
[02:58:10.948 --> 02:58:13.010]  They don't join the military to be a man.
[02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:14.771]  They don't do a business to be a man.
[02:58:14.771 --> 02:58:15.992]  They don't help the community be a man.
[02:58:15.992 --> 02:58:17.093]  They run around trying to dictate culture.
[02:58:29.742 --> 02:58:34.525]  Just like every other spoiled rotten kid tries to tell their parents what to do, so they throw them out.
[02:58:34.525 --> 02:58:35.886]  Thank you so much, Dr. Piccinni.
[02:58:35.886 --> 02:58:37.347]  Well, thank you, and thank you, Rodney.
[02:58:37.347 --> 02:58:37.767]  Thank you.
[02:58:37.767 --> 02:58:38.587]  I'm gonna come back.
[02:58:38.587 --> 02:58:39.368]  Thank you, sir.
[02:58:39.368 --> 02:58:42.850]  In overdrive on the House of Cards point that I didn't make.
[02:58:42.850 --> 02:58:43.711]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:48.988 --> 02:58:54.151]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[02:58:54.151 --> 02:59:01.474]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[02:59:01.474 --> 02:59:09.558]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:59:09.558 --> 02:59:10.539]  The bad news is
[02:59:10.879 --> 02:59:18.566]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[02:59:18.566 --> 02:59:23.350]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[02:59:23.350 --> 02:59:30.737]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:30.737 --> 02:59:33.620]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:40.826]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[02:59:40.826 --> 02:59:45.109]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:45.109 --> 02:59:47.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.801 --> 03:00:08.427]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.427 --> 03:00:11.990]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:19.437]  Well, it's in mainstream news that serotonin reuptake inhibitors are causing people to commit suicide and to commit crimes.
[03:00:19.437 --> 03:00:23.260]  It's in the news that fluorides brain damage you and your family.
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:24.781]  Basically, everything we talk about is coming out.
[03:00:24.781 --> 03:00:28.525]  It's in the news that our own government is running Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:00:29.853 --> 03:00:31.314]  It's just all coming out.
[03:00:31.314 --> 03:00:39.937]  So we're now entering this paradox where they either lie and say none of it's happening, the politicians, or they say, oh, it's no big deal.
[03:00:39.937 --> 03:00:44.098]  And they try to get the military and the police prepared to go after patriots.
[03:00:44.098 --> 03:00:47.759]  There wouldn't be any businesses left if you took out the patriots.
[03:00:47.759 --> 03:00:52.081]  We're the only people around basically doing anything.
[03:00:52.081 --> 03:00:56.722]  And so, this war on reality is going to come to an end.
[03:00:56.722 --> 03:00:58.383]  And as Dr. Pucinich said, it's going to blow.
[03:01:00.373 --> 03:01:04.577]  And so the preparations of DHS are to deal with it blowing.
[03:01:04.577 --> 03:01:12.505]  The blowing is like blood cells, white blood cells coming to an infection, morons!
[03:01:12.505 --> 03:01:14.708]  Somebody's got to say no to all the deviants!
[03:01:16.837 --> 03:01:21.698]  And by deviants, I don't mean somebody that likes to go drink beer or whatever.
[03:01:21.698 --> 03:01:25.499]  I'm talking about people that are just into being deviant to be deviant.
[03:01:25.499 --> 03:01:28.180]  They want to pull everything down.
[03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:29.281]  They want to conquer it.
[03:01:29.281 --> 03:01:31.121]  It's their temper tantrum.
[03:01:31.121 --> 03:01:37.543]  It's like a bad cat you have that you don't know why it craps on your bed, but it does it.
[03:01:37.543 --> 03:01:39.103]  You got a bad cat.
[03:01:39.103 --> 03:01:40.824]  A good cat wouldn't act like that.
[03:01:40.824 --> 03:01:43.484]  Everybody that's had cats knows about bad cats.
[03:01:43.484 --> 03:01:45.005]  We got bad cats running the country.
[03:01:46.451 --> 03:01:47.791]  And you got a house of cards here.
[03:01:47.791 --> 03:01:52.012]  We don't have to pull the biggest one at the bottom out.
[03:01:52.012 --> 03:01:57.094]  You pull out some top ones, a lot of it will collapse, and then more will collapse down.
[03:01:57.094 --> 03:02:00.114]  You can pull one out anywhere it's coming down.
[03:02:00.114 --> 03:02:01.995]  The 28 pages.
[03:02:01.995 --> 03:02:02.915]  All of it.
[03:02:02.915 --> 03:02:04.235]  It's already collapsed.
[03:02:04.235 --> 03:02:10.877]  It's just that in time, the one or two seconds it takes for it to fall is like a decade.
[03:02:11.872 --> 03:02:13.253]  They already know it's fallen.
[03:02:13.253 --> 03:02:18.377]  When you've got Congress with an 8% approval rating in Gallup, that's a collapsed government.
[03:02:18.377 --> 03:02:23.300]  They either go the Kim Jong Un way and rule by guns or they're dying.
[03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:30.526]  But thank God we've got people like Rand Paul up there just telling about the elephant in the room and saying we've got to get the NSA spying on everybody to stop.
[03:02:30.526 --> 03:02:31.286]  It's illegal.
[03:02:31.286 --> 03:02:32.647]  It's been ruled illegal.
[03:02:32.647 --> 03:02:37.050]  And the mainstream media acts like he's a space alien with 14 heads.
[03:02:37.050 --> 03:02:39.052]  And the Republican leadership acts like he's a demon.
[03:02:40.526 --> 03:02:43.767]  And then go, you made a really bad decision, this will hurt your career.
[03:02:43.767 --> 03:02:45.968]  As if that's all that matters.
[03:02:45.968 --> 03:02:48.868]  I can get killed doing what I'm doing.
[03:02:48.868 --> 03:02:51.629]  And almost everybody else just goes with what's safe.
[03:02:51.629 --> 03:03:01.132]  Don't you realize at a certain point, if one side of the boat was safe, because let's say there was a swordfish flopping around on deck, one just killed a guy this week, they're dangerous.
[03:03:01.132 --> 03:03:06.433]  My son caught a five foot one, cut the guy on the boat when it came in the boat, just a few weeks ago.
[03:03:06.433 --> 03:03:08.474]  That was just a five foot one.
[03:03:09.554 --> 03:03:17.863]  If everybody runs the other side of the boat to get away from the swordfish, it's going to tump over, the ship's going to go on top of you, and it's going to kill everybody.
[03:03:17.863 --> 03:03:23.529]  You don't run from the swordfish, you gaff it, or you kick it over the side of the boat.
[03:03:23.529 --> 03:03:28.355]  But see, everybody gets so threatened by the globalists, they run to one side of the boat, boom, the ship tumps over.
[03:03:29.994 --> 03:03:35.159]  You ever seen a stampede of people running and then they start killing each other, falling over each other?
[03:03:35.159 --> 03:03:39.002]  It's a time bomb how domesticated and wimpy people are.
[03:03:39.002 --> 03:03:41.064]  And I'm not on a power trip.
[03:03:41.064 --> 03:03:50.952]  But I get around the general public and man, they are narcissistic, they are conceited, they are dumb, they don't know how anything works.
[03:03:50.952 --> 03:03:54.095]  And I'll be honest with you, it's being in Austin.
[03:03:55.811 --> 03:04:00.674]  Austin wasn't like this 23 years ago when I first moved here from Dallas.
[03:04:00.674 --> 03:04:05.517]  Dallas was just rough and aggressive and dominant and male.
[03:04:05.517 --> 03:04:20.147]  And I moved down here and it's got some nice aspects but it is overall more of a feminine city and people just dominate through manipulation and through complaining and through weird neuroses and passive-aggressive stuff.
[03:04:22.324 --> 03:04:29.489]  It's growing because the rejects that couldn't make it in California, they're not really Californians, and that's a point Californians made to me.
[03:04:29.489 --> 03:04:32.331]  And all these other folks are now running here.
[03:04:32.331 --> 03:04:37.155]  The same people's parents who ran to California and failed, they're now coming here.
[03:04:37.155 --> 03:04:40.117]  And just experiencing them, it's like they're not alive.
[03:04:40.933 --> 03:04:44.475]  They're just these mindless morons.
[03:04:44.475 --> 03:04:47.017]  And we cannot allow them to take over.
[03:04:47.017 --> 03:04:48.317]  We have to defeat them.
[03:04:48.317 --> 03:04:55.261]  And in a republic, they don't have a right to make us their slaves just because they vote to hook us up to, you know, a plow.
[03:04:55.261 --> 03:04:56.062]  It's just not happening.
