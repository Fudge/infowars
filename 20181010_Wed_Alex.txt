[00:00.000 --> 00:25.720]  It's Wednesday, October 10th, 2018, we're now only 27 days out from the midterms and
[00:25.720 --> 00:34.000]  yes Hurricane Michael is slamming in to the Florida Panhandle as we speak at 140 miles
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  an hour.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.520]  They're calling it the hellstorm.
[00:36.520 --> 00:40.240]  So notice the media hyped up the hurricane a month ago that they thought would be totally
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.080]  devastating and it was bad but not as devastating as they thought and now out of nowhere comes
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.760]  Hurricane Michael and it looks like it is going to be a hellstorm.
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.600]  So let's pray for everybody.
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.040]  They're in the Panhandle, everybody in Louisiana, Mississippi especially and other areas of
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.240]  the deep south but here's the deal.
[01:00.240 --> 01:04.800]  We've been dealing with natural storms on this planet since God created us and they
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.080]  come and they go and it's just part of life on this planet.
[01:09.080 --> 01:12.680]  But the cycle we're going through politically is the real issue.
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.120]  We've hit rock bottom and we have our own corrupt elites allied with the communist, Chinese
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.120]  and others in an attempt to try to totally take control of civilization and society.
[01:22.120 --> 01:24.920]  And we're just 27 days out.
[01:24.920 --> 01:32.600]  We have reports flooding in that are on infowars.com with a whole string of critical reports that
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.960]  are absolutely critical that people check out.
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.840]  And the biggest one is Trump on Dems, their whole campaign is to resist, ours is to create.
[01:41.840 --> 01:44.600]  These are not good people, folks.
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.920]  Now that's an important headline from Information Liberation, excellent website, information
[01:48.920 --> 01:50.200]  liberation.com.
[01:50.200 --> 01:55.160]  But the article's really about the left launching vicious violent attacks all over the United
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.160]  States.
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.200]  We're going to look at some of these when we come back from break.
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.360]  You have got in blue controlled areas like San Francisco, like Portland, Oregon, like
[02:04.360 --> 02:10.480]  Seattle, Washington, like Austin, Texas, like Los Angeles, California, Washington, D.C.,
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.720]  Baltimore, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois.
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.520]  The left literally shooting police officers in the back of the head, burning Trump supporters'
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.280]  vehicles, vandalizing everyday Republican candidate headquarters, shooting members of
[02:26.280 --> 02:32.600]  Congress, doxing their families, sending them beheading videos, breaking Rand Paul's
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.420]  ribs, puncturing his lung.
[02:35.420 --> 02:36.420]  So much violence.
[02:36.420 --> 02:38.440]  I can't even keep track of it.
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.520]  And then we've got Hillary Clinton, and we're going to play a clip of this when we come
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.840]  back saying that, oh, there's no place for civil discourse, because you've got all the
[02:46.840 --> 02:51.480]  Republicans and us and others saying, let's have civil discourse, let's not have violence.
[02:51.480 --> 02:55.160]  And you've got Hillary Clinton and others saying, oh, no, until we win the midterms,
[02:55.160 --> 02:56.160]  we're not going to be civil.
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.160]  Well, we know they're going to get worse if they do win the midterms.
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.200]  This is an authoritarian push.
[03:01.200 --> 03:04.400]  And then you've got people like the editor of Raw Story.
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.600]  When Congressman Scalise, who was shot in the hospital months, almost died, shattered
[03:09.600 --> 03:15.040]  a whole bunch of his bones, organs, it's a tough cookie, survived combat in Iraq, but
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.320]  almost got killed here.
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.720]  And the scumbag coming to shoot him was trying to kill all 17 Republicans that were conservative.
[03:22.720 --> 03:23.720]  That was his plan.
[03:23.720 --> 03:26.800]  Thank God the leftist couldn't shoot very well.
[03:26.800 --> 03:33.760]  And so you see the Raw Story editor celebrating and saying, boo-hoo, you deserve this.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.920]  This is a response of defense against you.
[03:35.920 --> 03:37.560]  You can go read his tweets.
[03:37.560 --> 03:38.840]  I'm paraphrasing him.
[03:38.840 --> 03:42.880]  And then other people defended that, and Twitter leaves that up, just like the professors
[03:42.880 --> 03:51.440]  that say, you know, kill Gorsuch, cut his testicles off, or, excuse me, kill Kavanaugh.
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.040]  This is the type of insanity we're dealing with, and it's only intensifying.
[03:56.040 --> 03:58.200]  And they're going to get more violent if they win the midterms.
[03:58.200 --> 04:01.280]  They're going to get more violent if they lose the midterms.
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.280]  They are now truly a domestic terror organization, just as Homeland Security listed them as
[04:06.280 --> 04:07.280]  that a year and a half ago.
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.920]  But we have to get on the ball and deal with this, because when you look at the white trash
[04:11.920 --> 04:19.480]  scum that makes up Antifa, literal, you know, little black clothes, skinny jeans, welfare
[04:19.480 --> 04:25.960]  head, scum, basically, you have to understand, they're only the smokescreen for the real
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.480]  violent forces that are waiting behind the scenes.
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.960]  They're just the detonator and the cover for the globalist operations, and we know that
[04:32.960 --> 04:36.400]  from the George Soros documents we got in January of this year that we'll cover when
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.240]  we come back, where they were planning martial law in Maryland, using Antifa with the police
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.040]  to trigger the black community.
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.840]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com,
[04:47.840 --> 04:50.520]  tomorrow's news today.
[04:50.520 --> 04:55.440]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.000]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula, or just want
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.200]  an alternative, in FullWars life has the formula for you.
[05:08.200 --> 05:12.840]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and

[05:17.240 --> 05:21.960]  Containing powerful antioxidants, such as Azazanthin and Omega-3's, Ultimate Crill Oil
[05:21.960 --> 05:27.280]  can help you experience the benefits of fish oil, with less required DHA and EPA.
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.720]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health,
[05:31.720 --> 05:36.000]  joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.600]  maintain cognitive function, and more.
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.920]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[05:42.920 --> 05:48.200]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality Crill Oil concentrate.
[05:48.200 --> 05:52.120]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately, it's time to see what Crill Oil
[05:52.120 --> 06:13.120]  can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:13.120 --> 06:24.040]  Changing war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.040 --> 06:30.960]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for,
[06:30.960 --> 06:32.360]  what you care about.
[06:32.360 --> 06:38.680]  That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.840]  when civility can start again.
[06:40.840 --> 06:47.240]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for.
[06:47.240 --> 06:50.960]  That's Hillary Clinton, the sore loser on CNN last night.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.960]  Think about that.
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.960]  What is she saying?
[06:52.960 --> 06:53.960]  Well, she's projecting.
[06:53.960 --> 06:54.960]  They always do the inverse.
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.160]  Just like the creator of Minecraft has come out and said, look, liberals are now inherently
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.680]  the party of evil, twisted, lying scum that hate you, that hate humanity, that hate the
[07:04.680 --> 07:07.840]  normal biological order of the universe.
[07:07.840 --> 07:11.000]  This Trump has come out and said, because when you come to that realization, that the
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.920]  radicalization process of the so-called left in the community colleges and in the mainline
[07:16.920 --> 07:22.040]  colleges has taken a bunch of people, told them they're oppressed, then trained them
[07:22.040 --> 07:29.440]  to go out and be the new brown shirt or Maoist foot soldiers to dominate and control society.
[07:29.440 --> 07:35.160]  So with 27 days out from the election, we can survive things like Hurricane Michael
[07:35.160 --> 07:40.320]  that is going to be devastating and a serious problem, the part of life on this planet.
[07:40.320 --> 07:44.280]  We'll have coverage of that coming up at the bottom of the hour with the latest.
[07:44.280 --> 07:51.040]  But it's the political crisis and the cultural crisis and the spiritual crisis of the inherent
[07:51.040 --> 08:02.000]  nastiness and cultural and spiritual vandals that truly wish because they don't have
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.040]  inherent power and they don't have God in their heart and soul to pull down the universe
[08:07.040 --> 08:10.560]  and to seek and destroy everything that is decent.
[08:10.560 --> 08:15.480]  Those of us that don't want to be inherently evil and who aren't inherently out looking
[08:15.480 --> 08:21.000]  to destroy other people can't understand why globalists and their minions will go out
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.280]  of their way to do bad things when good things that they could do would actually build them
[08:26.280 --> 08:27.800]  and others up.
[08:27.800 --> 08:30.760]  But it's been part of the decadence process.
[08:30.760 --> 08:34.960]  The problem with a big free open society is it creates so much wealth that within a few
[08:34.960 --> 08:41.960]  generations it always creates a very nasty, very decadent, very spoiled elites, but also
[08:41.960 --> 08:48.840]  giant throngs of people that don't want to work and who ally themselves with the establishment
[08:48.840 --> 08:49.840]  as their muscle.
[08:49.840 --> 08:54.280]  It happened in ancient China, it happened in ancient Rome, it happened in ancient areas
[08:54.280 --> 09:00.600]  of the Middle Ages throughout Western Europe, it's happened in Latin America, look at Venezuela,
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.080]  it happens over and over again, it's called mob rule.
[09:05.080 --> 09:07.960]  And that's what we're going into right now.
[09:07.960 --> 09:12.880]  So again, front and center today, and if you're a TV viewer you can see this incredible footage
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.160]  of your radio listener, obviously you can hear the shocking audio, most of it bleeped.
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.000]  We have footage from all over the country of people having their cars burned, people
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.960]  being physically attacked, Republican campaign headquarters having rape sprayed all over
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.760]  them, and the thread running through all this is, they either call you a rapist or they
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.320]  call you KKK.
[09:36.320 --> 09:44.280]  So if Antifa randomly sets up a checkpoint in Washington DC or in places like Portland,
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.320]  Oregon, if you don't let them direct you wherever they want while they yell and scream and cuss
[09:49.320 --> 09:56.560]  at you, they beat your car with metal batons and they say FU white scumbag, or they say
[09:56.560 --> 09:58.280]  FU rapist.
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.880]  Of your white, they're authorized to be mean to you because that's the brainwashing.
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.120]  And whether it's in Baltimore, Maryland, or whether it's in Portland, Oregon, or Seattle,
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.680]  Washington, they all get training manuals funded by George Soros and Alexander Soros,
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.760]  and we got secret documents in January of this year that I've made a big deal of because
[10:16.760 --> 10:22.600]  they are the Rosetta Stone understanding this, and it's 20 plus pages of an action manual
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.440]  for one of the managers and the individual's brother when he got in trouble, got the stuff
[10:27.440 --> 10:35.280]  out of his house, where they're paid handsomely in blue cities to work with the police in
[10:35.280 --> 10:41.400]  controlled areas to block roads, to break windows, to set things on fire, to even sometimes
[10:41.400 --> 10:48.800]  burn vehicles, which they pre-deploy as part of a drill that they burn.
[10:48.800 --> 10:55.240]  But here's the key, yes it's theater, yes it's fake with the Antifa, but they're there
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.160]  on the news during day one of whatever provocation there is that the police shoot somebody, it's
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.320]  a questionable shooting or whatever the case may be, whether the police beat somebody questionably
[11:04.320 --> 11:11.000]  or not questionably, then that draws out the Antifa who go into operation, they already
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.600]  have their manual, and then day two, or sometimes even that night, the general public sees it
[11:16.600 --> 11:20.960]  on the news, the news shows it is favorable, shows Antifa is favorable, the police stand
[11:20.960 --> 11:28.520]  down and then the general public starts showing up, and in the Baltimore, Maryland documents,
[11:28.520 --> 11:33.160]  they say we're targeting the black community, we're trying to get the urban community to
[11:33.160 --> 11:38.320]  get angry and cause a chain reaction.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.600]  So these are false flags, but they're trying to then trigger the general public to come
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.040]  out and it talks about where you go, what streets you're allowed to attack, what trash
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.480]  cans you're allowed to burn, that's why it's like why do they burn a trash can, why do
[11:50.480 --> 11:54.040]  they attack this particular store, why do they throw bottles at the police but they
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.760]  are not really throwing them that hard, because in the blue cities the police have been ordered
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.400]  to stand down, and the captains and others are working with the Antifa and even having
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.920]  pre-planning meetings before, the model of this was 1999 in Seattle, and I made the film
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.840]  The Takeover, that's still on YouTube on other folks' channels, our channel has been removed,
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.680]  let's police state to The Takeover, and we even got the training manuals, Delta Force
[12:19.680 --> 12:25.640]  under the command of Bill Clinton, they were under his command, Delta Force actually managed
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.840]  the Antifa, put them in a government building, housed them, protect them, and then allowed
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.160]  them to attack the police for a day so they could then turn the police and the federal
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.440]  police on the 50,000 peaceful demonstrators that were liberals and were against transferring
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.920]  power to the World Trade Organization because they saw it as globalist and corrupt.
[12:44.920 --> 12:50.760]  That was back when the left was against globalism and realized it was neoliberal colonial fascism,
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.960]  actually good leftists, and so that's how the whole thing started, Soros was even funding
[12:55.960 --> 13:01.200]  it then, so you use them as the group to get a riot going, and then you can bring your
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.800]  control in to clamp down everybody after the Antifa's carried it out, or under Obama's
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.680]  plans, they were planning to stir it up even worse, according to these documents, to try
[13:10.680 --> 13:15.040]  to create martial law in Baltimore and then other cities around the country, to have blacks
[13:15.040 --> 13:19.960]  rise up and actually have a civil emergency, and then announce strong city initiative for
[13:19.960 --> 13:26.240]  the UN to come in under the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, this is the mainstream news,
[13:26.240 --> 13:30.600]  and have the UN take over the police, and then they would order through Soros operatives
[13:30.600 --> 13:37.160]  and media for the blacks and others to stop rioting, who had been detonated by the white
[13:37.160 --> 13:43.800]  professor level Antifa, and these are mainly professors and people who are out doing agiprop
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.440]  type propaganda, there's manuals, the manuals have fallen into our hands, and I want to
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.000]  encourage other Antifa people that realize this is wrong and evil and you've been programmed
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.600]  to send us more manuals and more documents, but this is the main reason Soros and others
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.480]  have been coming after us, when I pointed out that they staged the situation in Charlottesville,
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.320]  not that the woman didn't really get killed, not that the individuals who were working
[14:08.320 --> 14:14.200]  in the whole Hillary scheme actually killed the lady, I'm saying by them kicking that
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.200]  off, by them having Antifa there, by the cops corralling the white nationalists into them,
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.880]  it was meant to cause that explosion, and we come back, I'm going to get to the biggest
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.120]  story yet that ties into all of this, and we're going to show the footage and break
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.200]  it down, because if you read the Maryland documents, and then if you look at what happened
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.120]  in Charlottesville, and you look at what happened in Portland and other cities the last three
[14:36.120 --> 14:43.200]  days, they've now ordered Antifa that is centrally commanded by these rise up groups
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.520]  and others that do the full page ads in the New York Times, other publications calling
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.000]  for an overthrow of Trump and Pence and driving the regime from power, they're now more and
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.760]  more blocking traffic in morning rush hour and agitating the vehicles and bumping the
[14:59.760 --> 15:03.760]  vehicles and saying, oh, are you going to hit me, and then even when someone doesn't
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.920]  even bump them because they're bumping them, they then chase the vehicles down and try
[15:08.920 --> 15:16.360]  to panic them, and you almost saw another Charlottesville in Portland, because they're
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.480]  terrorizing and beating the car batons and the old man races away, and then he kind of
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.360]  realizes, wait, I don't want to be a hit and run if they just ran into me, so he stops
[15:25.360 --> 15:30.040]  and he's all day, he's like, why are you doing this, they're like, well, I mean, you'll

[17:29.360 --> 17:30.360]  Hear that?
[17:30.360 --> 17:35.840]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[18:00.320 --> 18:05.600]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.840]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.840 --> 18:38.320]  symptoms.
[18:38.320 --> 18:40.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.520 --> 18:41.520]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.520 --> 18:46.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.240]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.960]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.960 --> 19:02.440]  Go to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.560 --> 20:13.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.160 --> 20:15.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:15.840 --> 20:23.840]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[20:23.840 --> 20:30.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:30.720 --> 20:36.000]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  If you just joined me, this is the most critical issue of 27 Days Out.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.640]  We know that the Soros Group and others fund Antifa through the same national organizations
[20:45.640 --> 20:50.320]  and through university leadership, where they have university professors openly saying kill
[20:50.320 --> 20:57.960]  Pence, kill Gorsuch, kill Kavanaugh, kill everybody, kill Trump, kill talk show host, then they
[20:57.960 --> 21:00.680]  send the orders out to do different things.
[21:00.680 --> 21:01.680]  And they give them action plans.
[21:01.680 --> 21:07.080]  And the new action plan, which we know clearly was getting beta tested from the research
[21:07.080 --> 21:12.320]  we've seen from Antifa, is to go out and block roads and create crises and then hope
[21:12.320 --> 21:18.280]  that you panic someone by chasing them and yelling at them and screaming at them and
[21:18.280 --> 21:22.680]  then hoping that in the hysteria, somebody gets run over or somebody gets hurt.
[21:22.680 --> 21:25.760]  This almost happened in Portland two days ago.
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.200]  We just played that footage.
[21:27.200 --> 21:30.960]  I'm going to roll it again, just as B roll.
[21:30.960 --> 21:37.360]  And this is so horrifying because the same thing that happened tragically in Charlottesville
[21:37.360 --> 21:39.160]  almost just happened again.
[21:39.160 --> 21:43.760]  In local media, working with local police, who you saw stand down in Portland, they were
[21:43.760 --> 21:48.520]  waiting down the street overseeing it in case anybody did resist Antifa, they could then
[21:48.520 --> 21:49.720]  be cracked down on.
[21:49.720 --> 21:53.760]  They were waiting with the experiment, like the CIA has practiced and many others, Jim
[21:53.760 --> 21:57.280]  Morrison studied this in college, is how to cause a riot.
[21:57.280 --> 22:00.680]  And so you've got the cars coming through rush hour, you're screaming names at them,
[22:00.680 --> 22:06.080]  you're calling them scumbags, you're calling them KKK, you're hitting their cars with batons,
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.240]  you're bobbing their vehicles, they've just been given the orders, go agitate, block roads,
[22:11.240 --> 22:13.880]  so that someone else gets run over.
[22:13.880 --> 22:18.080]  But the local thugs don't even know this, they're given the action plans, which have
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.080]  fallen into our hands.
[22:19.080 --> 22:24.360]  And these are Death Star plans for Antifa, so that there can be another Charlottesville
[22:24.360 --> 22:27.720]  and then it won't matter who runs over somebody, they'll just call them a white supremacist
[22:27.720 --> 22:30.080]  on the news and you saw local news do this.
[22:30.080 --> 22:36.800]  They said, oh my God, loving liberal demonstrators, thearticlesonantifawords.com almost got run
[22:36.800 --> 22:41.560]  over and murdered by a right-wing extremist in Portland who rammed them with his vehicle.
[22:41.560 --> 22:45.960]  And of course they don't show the F you screw you, hitting his car with batons, chasing
[22:45.960 --> 22:50.400]  him down, they just show the people going, oh my God, it was so scary.
[22:50.400 --> 22:55.680]  We were lovingly out here in our black uniforms, harassing everyone and blocking roads like
[22:55.680 --> 23:01.440]  thugs from Nazi Germany, and then this horrible mean people try to hurt us, and then that's
[23:01.440 --> 23:02.880]  how this works.
[23:02.880 --> 23:07.960]  And then if you question somebody getting killed, well, you're going to be called an
[23:07.960 --> 23:15.200]  extremist in fake news, just like I didn't say that nobody died at Parkland and Florida
[23:15.200 --> 23:20.040]  this year, they don't care, they just say, I did that, and I need to be sued for it.
[23:20.040 --> 23:25.120]  You see, so this is the mind control operation they're bringing in, this is the whole system
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.120]  we're dealing with right now, and you can see them now trying to activate a Charlottesville
[23:30.120 --> 23:31.120]  type crisis.
[23:31.120 --> 23:35.120]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you go to m4wars.com, we have live streams of this.
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.120]  I want to zoom in on some of the videos of the people in the background and the Antifa
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.800]  leadership sending their thugs out on the street, and if you look at these individuals,
[23:46.800 --> 23:52.400]  I bet money, if you get their mask off, they are local professors and local social workers
[23:52.400 --> 23:57.000]  and operatives of foundations, and they've got in their hip pockets their little battle
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.360]  plans stamped from Alexander Soros' group, because he's really taken over from his dad.
[24:03.360 --> 24:06.920]  But if you look at the satisfaction, it's like something you saw in old newsreels of
[24:06.920 --> 24:12.800]  Nazi Germany or old newsreels of Soviet Russia, where you see the commasars, the political
[24:12.800 --> 24:17.280]  police, and they're standing there with just looks of satisfaction, smoking cigarettes
[24:17.280 --> 24:22.160]  and watching people having traffic blocked, and families called names with their kids
[24:22.160 --> 24:27.720]  going to school and trying to panic somebody into driving through the crowd, I mean, this
[24:27.720 --> 24:28.720]  is a sick op.
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.360]  You've got all the leftists standing around behind, the few that don't have masks on,
[24:32.360 --> 24:38.120]  but just gleeful little, little villainish looks that, ooh, we've got the power, we're
[24:38.120 --> 24:41.200]  the political party, we're taking this country over.
[24:41.200 --> 24:46.560]  And I face these people all over the country, from Austin, Texas, to Seattle, Washington,
[24:46.560 --> 24:53.520]  DC, to Denver, I've been facing Antifa for 20 years.
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.480]  And Antifa are professors, they are communists, they are malice brigades, I try to go out
[24:59.480 --> 25:02.640]  and have a pro-life demonstration, I show up and try to block our signs and take our
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.240]  free speech, that's what they're all about, is taking your rights, suppressing you, keeping
[25:07.240 --> 25:13.960]  you off the streets, while big tech centers you off the web, they censor you off the streets.
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.520]  In blue cities, they're cowards, with the police and the media protecting them, Soros
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.760]  and globalist money, media lying and covering for them, when they attack women and children,
[25:23.760 --> 25:27.000]  they're heroes, and they say the opposite happened.
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.760]  And big media, big tech, censoring and then Antifa on the street, trying to get the proletariat,
[25:37.760 --> 25:42.040]  trying to get the general populace to rise up, and they got all the Hollywood movies
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.720]  that are agitating it, and white people are racist, and there needs to be a race war,
[25:45.720 --> 25:50.320]  it's all coming together, it's in the WikiLeaks that came out that Hillary was trying to push
[25:50.320 --> 25:57.760]  a race war, it's come out, they've had the left Antifa on tape, and in top Twitter people,
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.680]  that Twitter uses to attack Trump saying hey, we're here to sow the division, we're here
[26:01.680 --> 26:07.800]  to divide America, everything Trump has said, everything Trump has said, that's what these
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.040]  people are doing.
[26:09.040 --> 26:12.240]  So again, why am I so excited, why am I so focused, why am I so upset?
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.000]  Because this is their battle plan, this is their program, and they don't want us to be
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.760]  getting the word out, that's why they're censoring Info Wars and trying to block us ahead of
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.800]  the midterms, because they're planning to provocateur and stage these crises to bring
[26:25.800 --> 26:27.760]  in total control.
[26:27.760 --> 26:33.440]  So again, take this live stream, and later when we archive this video to infowars.com,
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.360]  we have discovered how they're trying to stage a new false flag, at least one of their operations,
[26:38.360 --> 26:44.120]  and we understand it, and we know how to beat it, and law enforcement is getting informed,
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.080]  and you're getting informed, and I'm getting informed, and Congress is getting informed,
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.680]  and it's a very, very exciting time, and also a very, very dangerous time to be alive.
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.160]  That said, we'll cover this very serious hurricane that's just made landfall, Hurricane Michael
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.720]  hitting the panhandle when we come back, I want to say this again, we're running the
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.800]  biggest special ever with free shipping and 50% off, because as you know, they're trying
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.200]  to shut down our websites now, and our shopping cart, and our ability to even take payment

[30:16.280 --> 30:20.160]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[30:20.160 --> 30:25.040]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[30:25.040 --> 30:26.040]  You are the Infowar.
[30:26.040 --> 30:31.120]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[30:31.120 --> 30:36.200]  go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[30:36.200 --> 30:42.080]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:42.080 --> 30:47.640]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[30:47.640 --> 30:50.000]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[30:50.000 --> 30:55.440]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.120]  slash newsletter.
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.680]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[30:59.680 --> 31:04.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[31:04.600 --> 31:08.840]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[31:08.840 --> 31:13.040]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[31:13.040 --> 31:20.120]  lights every day, but thanks to SupermailVitality at Infowars.com, I still have that energy.
[31:20.120 --> 31:24.320]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[31:24.320 --> 31:28.520]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[31:28.520 --> 31:33.480]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[31:33.480 --> 31:40.720]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[31:40.720 --> 31:44.400]  So go to Infowars.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.
[31:44.400 --> 31:48.360]  This is actually our last run of SupermailVitality.
[31:48.360 --> 31:53.680]  So I want you to experience SupermailVitality before it's too late.
[31:53.680 --> 32:00.440]  Use the Supermail in use with SupermailVitality.com.
[32:00.440 --> 32:05.440]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[32:05.440 --> 32:10.040]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[32:10.040 --> 32:14.240]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[32:14.240 --> 32:16.240]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[32:16.240 --> 32:20.280]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had
[32:20.280 --> 32:21.760]  no future if we didn't do this.
[32:21.760 --> 32:24.520]  So we've already had incredible success.
[32:24.520 --> 32:29.400]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[32:29.400 --> 32:34.240]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread
[32:34.240 --> 32:39.960]  the word about our articles and videos, Infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[32:39.960 --> 32:42.960]  these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[32:42.960 --> 32:47.440]  We have huge sales at Infowars.com right now and we're still able to operate the shop
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.280]  and garden, get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
[32:52.280 --> 32:53.280]  and you're right to the market.
[32:53.280 --> 32:56.720]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globe will swing when.
[32:56.720 --> 33:03.480]  This is Infowars Darker Sour, we do your support, I'm counting on you.
[33:03.480 --> 33:19.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:19.280 --> 33:36.840]  Alex Royer is about to take over live, I should be back in studio tomorrow, I want to thank
[33:36.840 --> 33:37.840]  you all for your prayers and support, I am Alex Jones, your host, if you're a new viewer,
[33:37.840 --> 33:38.840]  or a listener on local radio stations or TV stations, please listeners, don't just support
[33:38.840 --> 33:42.320]  Infowars, support those local stations, they are just as important as we are.
[33:42.320 --> 33:46.600]  Become a sponsor, thank their sponsors, send a local station a hundred bucks and a thank
[33:46.600 --> 33:47.600]  you note.
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.080]  If you're in a war, it takes money to win a war, they've been trying to shut down talk
[33:51.080 --> 33:54.360]  radio, they've been trying to shut down local TV, but it's becoming more important than
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.840]  ever with all the censorship hitting the web that we understand that talk radio and local
[33:58.840 --> 34:05.200]  television is critical and that word of mouth trumps big tech censorship, anti-fascist censorship,
[34:05.200 --> 34:10.360]  the college is censoring and their attempt to bring us into authoritarianism and they've
[34:10.360 --> 34:16.160]  overplayed their hand, there is a huge awakening taking place across the planet, not just here.
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.680]  Just in populist candidates, just common sense candidates, Trump type candidates are being
[34:20.680 --> 34:26.640]  elected everywhere, from Brazil to Europe, that's why the enemy is coming down like a
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.640]  ton of bricks and that's why again, we're running the biggest special in our history,
[34:31.640 --> 34:37.640]  it's Christmas, it's Thanksgiving, it's Black Friday, it's Cyber Monday, all rolled into
[34:37.640 --> 34:43.080]  one, these are all the specials, we were going to dole out over the next two months at once
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.960]  now and I had it where a lot of stuff wouldn't be on special because we weren't going to
[34:46.960 --> 34:50.280]  have more come into the new year, that's how you do it, you sell your inventory, by the
[34:50.280 --> 34:53.720]  end of the year you've got to pay tax on it and so I was going to dole it out and have
[34:53.720 --> 34:57.040]  sometimes a regular price, sometimes it's sale, so we could bring in more money and
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.680]  fund ourselves, but I can't do that because they are, as you've seen, cutting us back
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.920]  to where we've been unable to operate other than you writing checks into us for product
[35:07.920 --> 35:12.480]  and so, payment processing is up right now, it gets your order in, it gets right to you,
[35:12.480 --> 35:15.920]  do your Christmas shopping now ladies and gentlemen, get the products you need now,
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.800]  get X2, it's the last run of it, but we're selling out of it, hopefully we'll get a better
[35:19.800 --> 35:23.840]  supply of it and be able to redo it, but at this time, that deal's not been made, so
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.480]  I've got to trick up my sleeve, the point is, infowarsstore.com, enforcelife.com, get your
[35:28.480 --> 35:32.120]  brain force, get your body's ultimate turmeric formula, get the highest quality fish oils
[35:32.120 --> 35:38.880]  for children and adults, krill oil, wild harvested of the fjord salmon oil with special processes
[35:38.880 --> 35:44.560]  that remove the mercury, highest quality, great prices, infowarsstore.com, enforcelife.com,
[35:44.560 --> 35:49.360]  you shop with us, you fund our operation, we will be steadfast, we will build the new
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.040]  model to relaunch America and the world, we're doing it, you see what Trump says, we want
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.960]  to build the world, we want a pro-human future, the globalist want an anti-human future, everything
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.800]  we've said is now the operating system of the relaunch, we rebooted, I just got chills,
[36:05.800 --> 36:09.160]  of course, took the best of Americana, the best of Renaissance, the best of what the
[36:09.160 --> 36:14.760]  globalists don't like with history and a belief in our destiny, a love of Christ, and fused
[36:14.760 --> 36:19.840]  it together with the American reboot, that's like selling snow cones in hell, folks.
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.960]  The globalists are selling tyranny and hatred and division and backbroken systems and twisted
[36:25.960 --> 36:32.320]  garbage and racism, we are promoting what humans are really meant to do, go to the stars,
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.280]  and it takes funding in this war, I'm willing to go all the way, never back down, never
[36:36.280 --> 36:40.480]  give in, but I need your prayers, I need you to share the articles and videos, and I need
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.120]  you to absolutely get the products that you need already at infowarsstore.com, biggest
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.400]  sale ever, take advantage of it right now, and again, you stand with us and God stands
[36:50.400 --> 36:56.240]  with us and we all stand together, we are unstoppable, infowarsstore.com, fire war bonds
[36:56.240 --> 37:02.440]  today, and we absolutely commit to you to turn it up another notch in the face of the
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.440]  NWO.
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, so you've just heard from Alex Jones, this is the Alex
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.760]  Jones show, welcome back, live to the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[37:14.760 --> 37:23.560]  Now, while Alex, as of now, may be done for the day, he is working on an exclusive breaking
[37:23.560 --> 37:28.880]  news report right now that we expect to release definitely by the end of the week, maybe by
[37:28.880 --> 37:39.080]  the end of the day, and it's shocking in its content, but at the same time, it's like there
[37:39.080 --> 37:45.920]  is no other option for this individual, and so we will be working on that and maybe even
[37:45.920 --> 37:52.640]  revealing that today, so be monitoring infowars.com, of course, they're not going to allow that
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.200]  to spread on social media, they'll shut you down and censor you if you try to share it,
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.320]  so that's what we're dealing with, but there's still plenty of news and I'm going to open
[38:01.320 --> 38:07.440]  up the phone lines because no guests on the schedule today, Roger Stone will join me in
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.200]  the fourth hour, but no guests, so I'm going to open up the phone lines, and I'm going
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.200]  to try to take as many calls as possible today while getting through this news and hitting
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.920]  all the video clips in the next two and a half hours.
[38:20.920 --> 38:28.680]  So in fact guys, let's go ahead and just start taking calls right now, 1-877-789-ALIX, 1-877-789-ALIX,
[38:28.680 --> 38:36.080]  and the lines will be filled in 30 seconds, 27 days guys, is that the updated number?
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.760]  27 days till the midterms, I would say for the topic, you know, if they wanted to call
[38:42.760 --> 38:49.520]  in and still weigh in on the Trump Rosenstein situation because we didn't really clear out
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.200]  all the calls on that.
[38:51.200 --> 38:54.520]  We'll take calls, what do you think about the Trump Rosenstein which was a big deal
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.360]  then wasn't a big deal, and then did Trump flip Rosenstein, was there seen basically
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.680]  a double O agent the whole time, okay, so what's going on with that, and then I guess
[39:04.680 --> 39:12.520]  I think that the big question or concern on everyone's mind right now is where does the
[39:12.520 --> 39:22.760]  left go from here, and quite frankly, I think Rand Paul understands what's going on and
[39:22.760 --> 39:29.520]  in a recent interview we'll have the clip later on in the broadcast, Rand Paul is worried
[39:29.520 --> 39:35.160]  someone is going to be killed in the current political climate, well, yeah, his name was
[39:35.160 --> 39:42.480]  Steve Scalise and luckily he didn't get killed, his name was Rand Paul and luckily he didn't
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.840]  get killed, he was the man running against Eric Swalwell in California where the guy
[39:46.840 --> 39:55.240]  tried to stab him with a switchblade that was inoperative, so yeah, the left has already
[39:55.240 --> 40:06.160]  tried to kill multiple people in this country, it's by God's grace they haven't yet, and
[40:06.160 --> 40:13.360]  they're just going to keep pushing the envelope though until it happens, so where do you think
[40:13.360 --> 40:18.960]  the left goes from here, what does President Trump have to do about it, or what do we have
[40:18.960 --> 40:26.000]  to do about it to try to stop it, and then if you want to weigh in on the issue of yesterday
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.760]  that we didn't get to all the calls, what do you think of the Trump Rosenstein situation
[40:33.760 --> 40:38.240]  and the meeting, isn't Kanye West having lunch with the president right now, is that
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.640]  going on right now, what do you think, maybe we should just take off, what do you think
[40:43.640 --> 40:51.200]  Kanye West is eating right now with President Donald Trump, is it a McDonald's hamburger,
[40:51.200 --> 41:04.000]  is it a well done steak with ketchup, did President Trump hit the red alert diet coke
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.520]  button, you know this is going to be interesting actually and I'll tell you what because I've
[41:10.520 --> 41:17.920]  got a shocking clip from CNN last night, truly shocking folks, truly shocking, in fact how
[41:17.920 --> 41:28.240]  long is that clip, let's go to this clip now, as Kanye West is having lunch with the president
[41:28.240 --> 41:34.560]  of the United States, listen to what was said on CNN last night about Kanye West, this
[41:34.560 --> 41:41.520]  is honestly next level folks, I mean again where does the left go from here, they keep
[41:41.520 --> 41:48.440]  lowering the bar, listen to CNN last night a panel on Kanye West, Kanye West is what
[41:48.440 --> 41:53.480]  happens when Negroes don't read, what, and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.760]  to use it and pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take
[41:56.760 --> 42:04.440]  pictures, that's funny to them, just look at Scott, listen, he can't believe how racist
[42:04.440 --> 42:10.240]  you are, trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay, they've had it with him and he's an
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.760]  attention whore like the president, he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson, he's
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.200]  the token Negro of the Trump administration, this is ridiculous and no one should make
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.480]  it Kanye West seriously, he's clearly has issues, he's already been hospitalized, he's
[42:26.480 --> 42:31.680]  already been hospitalized, hospitalized.
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.160]  Did you hear the racism on CNN last night, ladies and gentlemen, they called Kanye West
[42:36.160 --> 42:42.780]  a token Negro, this is what happened when the Negroes go out the plantation of the
[42:42.780 --> 42:49.720]  Democrat party, they say come back here token Negro, look at that Negro, he can't read,
[42:49.720 --> 42:55.400]  those aren't my words, that was on CNN last night, but they'll print a story about me
[42:55.400 --> 42:59.600]  covering what CNN said and let's say I'm a racist.

[46:27.840 --> 46:33.320]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.440]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.960]  done, I'm breaking the contract.
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.280]  Well, I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially the last run.
[46:43.280 --> 46:48.640]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2 and we've got a good supply of it.
[46:48.640 --> 46:50.080]  It'll be gone a couple of months.
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.040]  X2, if you haven't experienced it in 4store.com, if you have experienced it in my greatest,
[46:55.040 --> 46:56.600]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[46:56.600 --> 47:03.040]  It's available right now for a limited time in 4store.com right now.
[47:03.040 --> 47:10.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.040 --> 47:20.440]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[47:20.440 --> 47:27.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance and now your host, Owen
[47:27.360 --> 47:36.640]  Troyer, you want to see what goes on at CNN when nobody's watching, which is pretty much
[47:36.640 --> 47:47.480]  all the time, you want to know what goes on at CNN when nobody's watching total unhinged
[47:47.480 --> 47:54.160]  commentary that's now gone beyond just the Trump hatred and the Trump derangement syndrome.
[47:54.160 --> 48:01.080]  Now anybody, if you show support for Trump or don't come out as absolutely totally against
[48:01.080 --> 48:09.760]  Trump, you're now anything under the sun that they can accuse you of or say you are.
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.240]  Whatever the insult is, it's all fair game for CNN.
[48:15.240 --> 48:21.000]  Listen to CNN last night, of course, Kanye West having lunch with President Trump today.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.960]  Oh, no, oh, look at President Trump helping the black community, look at President Trump
[48:27.960 --> 48:34.760]  meeting with Kim Kardashian to free a woman from prison for a small drug sentence.
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.880]  Look at Kanye West, that mad man wants to meet with Trump, the racist who's doing more
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.760]  for the black community than any Democrats have done for 50 years, unbelievable, Kanye,
[48:45.760 --> 48:47.320]  get back on your plantation.
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.040]  Kanye, put your shackles back on.
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.800]  So let's go to CNN, Bakari Sellers, Tara Settmeyer, and Scott Jennings.
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.600]  I don't think Jennings waited on this one.
[48:58.600 --> 49:03.400]  I think we're just hearing Bakari Sellers and Tara Settmeyer in this segment with Don Lemon.
[49:03.400 --> 49:06.200]  All black people, mind you.
[49:06.200 --> 49:12.920]  So it's okay for them to be racist against the black man, I suppose, and the white man.
[49:12.920 --> 49:20.320]  But if I said anything close to what these people said, in fact, oh, I'm not even gonna
[49:20.320 --> 49:22.760]  go down that road.
[49:22.760 --> 49:29.400]  But you know, everyone knows, if I would have said anything like what Bakari Sellers and
[49:29.400 --> 49:37.400]  Tara Settmeyer are about to say in this segment, I would never be allowed to go on anywhere
[49:37.400 --> 49:39.600]  again if I was on CNN, that is.
[49:39.600 --> 49:43.600]  It would just be total destruction of my career.
[49:43.600 --> 49:52.000]  Listen to the CNN panel who saw Kanye West go on the Underground Railroad with Harriet
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.440]  Tubman and escape slavery.
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.880]  And CNN said, Kanye, get your ass back here, boy!
[49:59.880 --> 50:02.760]  Except they said it a little bit differently.
[50:02.760 --> 50:04.280]  Here's CNN last night.
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.600]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read and we have this now and now Donald Trump
[50:10.600 --> 50:11.600]  is going to use it.
[50:11.600 --> 50:12.600]  That's Bakari Sellers.
[50:12.600 --> 50:14.760]  Let's start that again.
[50:14.760 --> 50:18.560]  Listen to what Bakari Sellers says about Kanye West.
[50:18.560 --> 50:28.200]  Oh, little Bakari Sellers is upset that Kanye West got free and he's still a slave.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.200]  Isn't that funny?
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.760]  Oh my gosh, isn't that funny?
[50:31.760 --> 50:38.640]  Kanye West broke the shackles of slavery and sprinted off the plantation and said, come
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.400]  join me, Bakari Sellers, and Bakari Sellers said, screw you.
[50:44.400 --> 50:46.600]  How dare you?
[50:46.600 --> 50:49.120]  You come back to slavery, Kanye.
[50:49.120 --> 50:51.440]  Listen to what Bakari Sellers says.
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.640]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read and we have this now and now Donald Trump
[50:56.640 --> 50:59.880]  is going to use it and pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with
[50:59.880 --> 51:02.120]  him and take pictures.
[51:02.120 --> 51:03.120]  And now they laugh.
[51:03.120 --> 51:04.120]  This is a joke.
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.120]  Look at that, Scott.
[51:05.120 --> 51:07.120]  Yeah, real funny, Don Lemon.
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.120]  Listen, Raffles are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[51:12.120 --> 51:15.800]  They've had it with him and he's an attention whore like the president.
[51:15.800 --> 51:22.600]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson, he's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[51:22.600 --> 51:23.920]  This is ridiculous.
[51:23.920 --> 51:26.280]  And no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[51:26.280 --> 51:28.280]  He's clearly has issues.
[51:28.280 --> 51:29.920]  He's already been hospitalized.
[51:29.920 --> 51:36.060]  He's already been hospitalized.
[51:36.060 --> 51:38.440]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[51:38.440 --> 51:40.640]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[51:40.640 --> 51:43.340]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[51:43.340 --> 51:45.120]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[51:45.120 --> 51:46.120]  That's Bakari Sellers.
[51:46.120 --> 51:47.120]  That's how haircut.
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.040]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[51:51.040 --> 51:52.120]  Kanye West is what happens when...
[51:52.120 --> 51:57.520]  You know, I would imagine that this is some form of projection on Don Lemon, Tara Settmeier,
[51:57.520 --> 52:00.320]  in Bakari cellars behalf, they actually don't read.
[52:00.320 --> 52:01.760]  They are actually low IQ.
[52:01.760 --> 52:03.720]  And again, they're the black people
[52:03.720 --> 52:06.920]  that are still on the slave plantation,
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.760]  watching Kanye West run to freedom,
[52:10.760 --> 52:13.760]  telling them you don't have to be slaves anymore.
[52:13.760 --> 52:14.920]  Come on.
[52:14.920 --> 52:16.560]  And they rebuke him.
[52:18.600 --> 52:20.640]  And then what do you think this is gonna do
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.400]  to Kanye West's attitude?
[52:22.400 --> 52:23.440]  You fools.
[52:23.440 --> 52:28.040]  I mean, the left is so destructive right now.
[52:28.040 --> 52:32.800]  It's just, I can't imagine where it goes from here.
[52:34.320 --> 52:36.520]  We all know where it goes from here, folks.
[52:41.800 --> 52:45.720]  It's not good, but we'll know who to look at
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.520]  and who to blame when it all comes down.
[52:49.520 --> 52:54.520]  And it'll be the gentleman sitting behind me
[52:56.120 --> 53:01.120]  at CNN that have been inciting violence in this country
[53:03.240 --> 53:07.240]  ever since Trump announced he's running for president.
[53:07.240 --> 53:11.240]  They have been building this up ever since Trump announced.
[53:11.240 --> 53:16.240]  And if they really think they're gonna win in November
[53:18.440 --> 53:20.200]  with rhetoric like this,
[53:20.200 --> 53:24.040]  doesn't that just tell you how insane they really are?
[53:25.320 --> 53:27.240]  Let's go out to the phone lines.
[53:28.240 --> 53:29.240]  Let's go to Lawrence.
[53:30.240 --> 53:31.640]  Go ahead, Lawrence, you're on the air.
[53:31.640 --> 53:33.240]  The Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[53:34.240 --> 53:35.240]  Oh, and it's a pleasure.
[53:35.240 --> 53:36.240]  How you doing?
[53:36.240 --> 53:37.240]  Thank you for calling.
[53:37.240 --> 53:38.240]  I'm doing fine.
[53:38.240 --> 53:39.240]  Excellent.
[53:39.240 --> 53:42.240]  You know, I don't even know where to start,
[53:42.240 --> 53:45.240]  but I'm just gonna just shoot straight from the hip.
[53:45.240 --> 53:47.240]  I'm a black guy from Cleveland.
[53:47.240 --> 53:52.240]  All right, and I've been following politics,
[53:52.240 --> 53:56.240]  what's going on, and just to speak generalistically
[53:56.240 --> 54:00.240]  because, you know, I don't read.
[54:00.240 --> 54:01.240]  Ha, ha, ha.
[54:01.240 --> 54:03.240]  Yeah, right, yeah, right.
[54:03.240 --> 54:06.240]  If you're not a Democrat voter or a CNN audience
[54:06.240 --> 54:07.240]  and you're black,
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.240]  they just assume you don't read, right?
[54:09.240 --> 54:10.240]  That's right.
[54:10.240 --> 54:12.240]  Even though it's the exact opposite.
[54:13.240 --> 54:14.240]  That's right.
[54:14.240 --> 54:15.240]  That's exactly right.
[54:15.240 --> 54:18.240]  So this Bakari, he should be ashamed of himself
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.240]  because it is Kanye West's constitutional right,
[54:23.240 --> 54:24.240]  or it probably isn't,
[54:24.240 --> 54:27.240]  but it's Kanye West's constitutional right
[54:27.240 --> 54:30.240]  to choose what he wants to select
[54:30.240 --> 54:33.240]  as his spokesperson or his thought process
[54:33.240 --> 54:36.240]  or the politics or policies that he wants
[54:36.240 --> 54:37.240]  to choose.
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.240]  And to say that this is what happens
[54:39.240 --> 54:41.240]  when Negroes don't read is a slap in the face
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.240]  to his rights and to himself
[54:43.240 --> 54:46.240]  and a slap in the face to all others in the Midwest
[54:46.240 --> 54:49.240]  and, by the way, there's a growing sentiment.
[54:49.240 --> 54:55.240]  And you know this from your research and your studies,
[54:55.240 --> 54:58.240]  but there's a growing sentiment in the black community
[54:58.240 --> 55:00.240]  that they've been, and I don't want to cuss,
[55:00.240 --> 55:02.240]  but they've been really done wrong
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.240]  by the Democratic Party
[55:03.240 --> 55:06.240]  and we know it.
[55:06.240 --> 55:09.240]  And the best thing that I ever heard Donald Trump ever say
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.240]  was bye-bye, see you again in four years.
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.240]  That was a wake-up call to the black community,
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.240]  and we took that and we ran with it because we knew it.
[55:18.240 --> 55:21.240]  And I'm here in the Midwest and I've seen it.
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.240]  I've seen black people not vote for Hillary Clinton
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.240]  not only because of the Bill Clinton policies,
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.240]  but because of the overall tiredness that everyone has
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.240]  for politics in general.
[55:35.240 --> 55:38.240]  And we have a straight shooter, a person who's just speaking
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.240]  from the heart, Donald Trump, and it's impressive for us.
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.240]  So, and go back to your point.
[55:45.240 --> 55:48.240]  Kanye West is just going to eat this up.
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.240]  This is exactly what Kanye West wants.
[55:50.240 --> 55:53.240]  So, you know, Kanye West is smart enough
[55:53.240 --> 55:55.240]  to be able to handle himself,
[55:55.240 --> 55:58.240]  and he knows what the Democrats have been doing to,
[55:58.240 --> 56:00.240]  especially black people in the Midwest,
[56:00.240 --> 56:04.240]  but black people in general, and he's tired of it.
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.240]  And it's just an example, finally, for Kanye West,
[56:10.240 --> 56:12.240]  or for black people, that Kanye West is saying
[56:12.240 --> 56:15.240]  it's okay to have a freedom of selection.
[56:15.240 --> 56:18.240]  It's okay to break free from the plantation.
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.240]  Yeah, his message is a message of choice and love
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.240]  more than anything, but Lawrence, I mean,
[56:25.240 --> 56:27.240]  I'm just trying to get this to your head.
[56:27.240 --> 56:30.240]  How does a black audience member of CNN
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.240]  watch that segment and not be totally disgusted?
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.240]  Most of them are brainwashed, Owen.
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.240]  But still, I mean, that's like a slap in the face.
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.240]  Yeah, man.
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.240]  I mean, they're mainly brainwashed.
[56:48.240 --> 56:50.240]  They go to these colleges.
[56:50.240 --> 56:53.240]  The colleges don't want them to think freely.
[56:53.240 --> 56:57.240]  And also, there's a sense of giving to think the way
[56:57.240 --> 57:00.240]  that everybody is thinking at these college campuses
[57:00.240 --> 57:05.240]  at these certain events, and they want handouts.
[57:05.240 --> 57:06.240]  Bakari Sellers.
[57:06.240 --> 57:08.240]  Bakari Sellers, Lawrence, Bakari Sellers said
[57:08.240 --> 57:11.240]  that you're illiterate and a token black man.
[57:11.240 --> 57:13.240]  Bakari Sellers said that about you last night on CNN.
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.240]  Bakari Sellers said that about every black Trump supporter
[57:16.240 --> 57:17.240]  in America.
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.240]  Bakari Sellers said you're illiterate and a token black person
[57:21.240 --> 57:23.240]  from Terrace, Thatmire.
[57:23.240 --> 57:25.240]  I mean, Lawrence, I'm just stunned.
[57:25.240 --> 57:31.240]  I don't see how they maintain any audience with rhetoric like that.
[57:31.240 --> 57:33.240]  That's so true, man.
[57:33.240 --> 57:36.240]  But I mean, there's people out there that's eating that up, man.
[57:36.240 --> 57:37.240]  They love it.
[57:37.240 --> 57:38.240]  That's sad.
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.240]  That's just sad to me.
[57:39.240 --> 57:40.240]  It's just sad.
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.240]  Again, it's slaves.
[57:42.240 --> 57:44.240]  Watching the slaves leave the plantation,
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.240]  they could leave too, but being mad that they're free
[57:47.240 --> 57:49.240]  while they're still slaves.
[57:49.240 --> 57:52.240]  Scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula
[57:52.240 --> 57:55.240]  for inflammatory support and joint support.
[57:55.240 --> 57:58.240]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.240]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.240]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[58:04.240 --> 58:06.240]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.240]  It is well known in traditional medicine for exuding properties.
[58:10.240 --> 58:14.240]  Our pure turmeric extract, plus peppering from black pepper,
[58:14.240 --> 58:16.240]  makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support
[58:16.240 --> 58:19.240]  your flexibility, mobility, joint function,
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.240]  immune system, and so much more.
[58:21.240 --> 58:24.240]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.240]  1 to 5% of active ingredients.
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.240]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95%
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  of the active ingredients.
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.240]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as
[58:35.240 --> 58:38.240]  spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[58:38.240 --> 58:41.240]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[59:21.240 --> 59:24.240]  cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA,

[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.240]  Last night, CNN had a panel
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.240]  in which they wanted to let black Trump supporters
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.240]  know exactly what they thought about them.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.240]  Here's Bakari Sellers and Tara Settmeyer
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.240]  on Don Lemonhead's show last night on CNN,
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.240]  just letting all black Trump supporters know
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.240]  what they think about you.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.240]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.240]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.240]  is going to use it and pervert it,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.240]  and he's going to have somebody
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240]  who can stand with him and take pictures.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.240]  They think that's funny.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.240]  Listen, black folks are about to trade
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.240]  Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240]  They've had it with him,
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.240]  and he's an attention whore like the president.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.240]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.240]  He's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.240]  This is ridiculous,
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.240]  and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.240]  He clearly has issues.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.240]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.240]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:25.240]  Yeah, you know, the truth is that nobody takes you seriously.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.240]  The truth is that you don't read books.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  The truth is that you're still a slave
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.240]  to the Democrat Party that fought for slavery.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.240]  Kanye West left the plantation, freed his mind,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.240]  freed himself from the shackles,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.240]  and you're sitting there watching him jealous
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.240]  because you haven't figured it out yet.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.240]  That's all it is.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.240]  But make no mistake about it, folks.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.240]  CNN just let every black person out there
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.240]  that supports Trump know how they feel about them.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.240]  They want you back on their plantation.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.240]  You're not allowed to think for yourself.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.240]  And just imagine.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:16.240]  Now, see, if I say something negative about Kanye West,
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.240]  all the Kanye West fans immediately come to his defense
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.240]  and attack me because they love Kanye.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.240]  It doesn't matter what the political spectrum of the context is.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.240]  There is none.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.240]  If I say something negative about Kanye West,
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.240]  Kanye West fans immediately are there to stand up for him
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]  and attack me.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.240]  But if CNN says that about Kanye West,
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  he's a token negro?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.240]  He's a negro that doesn't read?
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.240]  Where are the Kanye West fans?
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.240]  Oh, they don't attack the left
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.240]  because they've all gone mentally insane.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240]  They're all on the plantation together.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.240]  They're all in the cult.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  So they're allowed to insult Kanye West.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.240]  But if I said something negative about Kanye West,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240]  I would be attacked 24-7.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.240]  In fact, I just put out a tweet of the Make America Great Again red hat that he wears,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240]  and I tweeted put your Superman cape on in reference to what he said,
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.240]  and I got attacked by all the Kanye fans.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.240]  Oh, it's so great.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.240]  Remember when Kanye West wrote the song Jesus Walks?
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]  What was the verse?
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.240]  They said you can write about anything except for Jesus.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.240]  They said that if you're black, you can stand for anything except for Trump.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240]  They said if you're in the music industry, you can sing about anything
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240]  and rap about anything except for Jesus.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240]  What did Kanye do?
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.240]  He wrote a top 40 song called Jesus Walks.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.240]  He supported President Trump.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.240]  Let's squeeze in a quick call from Alex in Michigan.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.240]  Alex Firewreck.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.240]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  It's good to talk to you again.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240]  Go ahead.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.240]  I have a couple ideas that could save Info Wars
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240]  if you'll let me have them at the end here,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]  or now it's up to you.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.240]  You got 40 seconds.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240]  Oh, OK.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.240]  What Alex should do is he doesn't need to sell the hardcore fans.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.240]  I'm like Survival Shield X2 and all the ingredients in the products.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.240]  We know those are good ingredients, you know what I mean?
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.240]  So what Alex should do is start selling in bulk like the bulk herbs people want.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.240]  Like myself, I make a lot of teas with herbs.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.240]  I buy them bulk from other places that I wish I could buy from Info Wars,
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.240]  but you know what I mean?
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.240]  No, look, it's a great idea,
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.240]  and we get a lot of great ideas about what to sell.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.240]  But the problem is, Alex, you have a great idea.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.240]  We've got thousands of great ideas and 100 different things we're trying to do,
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.240]  so it's tough to just take on a project.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.240]  Removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.240]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain,
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.240]  and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240]  and away from you and your family.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.240]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction,
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:44.240]  you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.240]  Head to infowarstore.com,
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.240]  and whether it's your first water filtration purchase
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.240]  or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems,
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.240]  it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Hole House filtration system today.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.240]  For every question they don't want you to ask,
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.240]  he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.240]  He is Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:21.240]  So we just had the last caller call in with a suggestion
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:25.240]  on something to sell at infowarstore.com,
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.240]  and we appreciate all ideas.

[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.240]  It's almost impossible to go to infowarstore.com
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.240]  and not find something that you would be interested in or curious about.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.240]  And the monster special we have going on right now,
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.240]  the entire InfoWars Life Product line is 50% off.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.240]  That's right, the entire InfoWars Life Product line is 50% off.

[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240]  Just read the five store reviews for yourself.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.240]  But 50% off, 50% off, this is unheard of,
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.240]  50% off the entire InfoWars Life Product line.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.240]  But you know what, 50% off, that's not even,
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.240]  that's really only halfway there, pun not intended.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.240]  That's really only halfway there, the 50% off.

[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:29.240]  Now, we heard from Alex earlier. Alex is working on a report right now,
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:39.240]  and you know when Alex gets a tip on something or some exclusive intel on something
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:49.240]  that he's going to make sure to report it properly and get it out there, though,
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.240]  just so you can know what's going on.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.240]  But I'm not going to get too much into it because I'm going to let Alex do it.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.240]  And we've already put some clues out there, but Alex is working on a report.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.240]  It'll either air by the end of today or tomorrow on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:13.240]  And well, it's about the 2020 presidential election.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:21.240]  I'll just leave it at that. And it's some big breaking news.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:30.240]  Also, Alex is going to be live tonight as we kick off our extended band coverage
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.240]  of the 2018 midterm election. Alex Jones goes live tonight at 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Central.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:43.240]  We will be doing this weeknights leading up to the November 6th red wave,
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:48.240]  which is going to be massively historic, and the breakdown,
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.240]  the mental and physical breakdown of the left is going to continue.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.240]  But we will have all the live coverage weeknights starting tonight,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.240]  8 to 10 p.m. Central with Alex Jones, our extended live coverage.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:08.240]  And I'll just go ahead and say this, folks. What we're doing right now is basically
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.240]  we're dipping our toes in the water to see if we're ready to expand.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.240]  So Alex, with this extended coverage, is dipping his toe in the water
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.240]  to see if we can actually, we have the capacity to expand right now.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.240]  Now, that means we need more crew, which means we need more funding.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.240]  That means, you know, we got to hire more people, which means we need more funding,
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.240]  which means we're going to see what kind of funding we can get from this
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.240]  massive sale at infowarstore.com.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.240]  We're going to see how the reception is to this extended live coverage,
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.240]  8 to 10 p.m. weeknights. Are you going to share it?
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.240]  Are you going to talk about it? Are you going to share the links?
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.240]  Are you going to tell your friends and family? Are we going to get a lot of traffic?
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.240]  Are you going to fund us? Are you going to go to infowarstore.com
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.240]  and supply us with the funds to hire new crew so that we can expand our live coverage?
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.240]  And if the answer to those questions are yes, you know where we go from here.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.240]  But that's where we're at. You already know about the censorship.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.240]  You already know about the attacks trying to stop us from getting financing.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.240]  You already know about all the lawsuits. It's all designed to take us down.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:17.240]  But thank God and thank you for making sure that info wars is still on the air every day
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.240]  and we've been able to expand. But it's been tough.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.240]  So now we're looking at things and we're saying, okay, do we have the capacity to expand?
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:30.240]  Will our audience fund us? Will our audience tune in if we actually start another live broadcast?
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.240]  So all those questions are going to be answered leading up to the midterms and you have all the answers.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:41.240]  All right, let's squeeze in a quick phone call here. Darian calling in from Wisconsin.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240]  Go ahead, Darian.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240]  Hi, Owen. How are you?
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.240]  I'm great. Thank you.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.240]  You know, I really don't want to focus on the problems.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.240]  Okay, I hear a lot about, you know, the insanity and all of this stuff.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.240]  What I'm not hearing a lot of is the solutions.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.240]  You know, when Trump got up in his speech, I think a lot of people missed the dream part.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.240]  He talked a lot about dreams.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.240]  You know, the reason we're in the state we're in is because we've lost our dreams.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.240]  We don't create. We don't innovate. We don't design.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.240]  We've been oppressed. We've been kicked. We've been beaten.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:22.240]  And the reason our enemy is so successful is because they're united in a horrible nightmare.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240]  Yeah, it's a dream. I call it a nightmare.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.240]  And they work together and they have their hands in everything that matters.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.240]  I started a business up here in Eau Claire at the East Street Center.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.240]  I'm next to medical doctors. I've got my hands in the medical industry.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.240]  I'm a software engineer. I'm also a scientist. Okay.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240]  And I have been calling businesses.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:46.240]  And in 2004, when I did hardware, it was a wonderful market.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240]  But all our manufacturing has gone to China.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240]  All our cell phones are in China.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240]  AMD and Intel, they went to China.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240]  And now businesses are desperate.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.240]  So what I did, and this is just kind of a blueprint,
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  is I started calling businesses and I started going, how can I help you?
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.240]  And the way I'm conquering this is I'm putting together a big B2B
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.240]  and all the businesses are going to be networked.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.240]  And when I have a few hundred businesses that I'm going to approach them,
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.240]  I'm going to say, hey, let's make our own semiconductors.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.240]  Let's make our own technology.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.240]  Then we don't have to order from China.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.240]  One person can't do it alone.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.240]  No, you're 100% right. You have to network.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:31.240]  And there needs to be, though, I think that there needs to be some sort of trend
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.240]  or campaign that's made in America.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.240]  You know, that needs to be something that people look when they're shopping
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240]  and consuming, was it made in America?
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.240]  Is that made in America?
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.240]  Is this good made in America?
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.240]  I feel like just even that little consciousness to pay attention to that
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.240]  could be a drastic sea change as well.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.240]  Yeah, your iodine not being able to do that anymore?
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240]  It's horrible.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240]  I wanted to distribute it from you guys.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.240]  I wanted to approach you guys and start literally putting that up in my storefront here
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.240]  because I've been doing cancer research.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.240]  By next year, I have approached several medical doctors.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:12.240]  I may have an effective treatment for cancer that doesn't involve radiating someone, okay?
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.240]  This is what people need to be doing.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.240]  We need to be making our own way.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.240]  You can focus on the problems till you're blue in the face,
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.240]  but we don't have solutions for what's coming next.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.240]  Well, I'll tell you what, one solution to taking control of our own destiny again
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:36.240]  and being able to create and build and just be independent is lower taxes.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.240]  Having more money that gives you more control of your destiny.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.240]  Then you can go and fund projects.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.240]  You can spend more time to try to create something.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.240]  That's why Trump is cutting the taxes.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.240]  That's why Trump is bringing the manufacturing back, the repatriation, everything
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.240]  so people can have more money and be more independent and build things.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.240]  That's what the globalist wants to stop.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:03.240]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.240]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.240]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.240]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.240]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.240]  The deep state began with World War I.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.240]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:24.240]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.240]  Man, I'll tell you, before I moved down here to Austin, Texas
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.240]  and started doing politics every day,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.240]  I called a lot of fun, entertaining sporting events,
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.240]  buzzer beaters, you know, championships.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.240]  But covering what's going on in America right now,
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240]  I mean, there is...
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.240]  Sports does not hold a candle, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.240]  It is so epic what's going on.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:54.240]  And just seeing the moves, seeing what's on the horizon, it's all epic.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.240]  Quickly, I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention what's going on in Florida.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.240]  Perhaps we'll cover it a little bit later on in the show
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.240]  once we get to a lot more calls on some of this news.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:13.240]  But Hurricane Michael has made landfall, I believe, in Florida.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.240]  It looks like it has just made landfall in Panama City
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:23.240]  and is moving northeast right now.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:28.240]  And, you know, it's just like everything else on news.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.240]  They cover hurricanes and it's fake news.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.240]  And I'm not saying the hurricane is fake news.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:35.240]  Obviously, the hurricane is a serious issue here.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.240]  The flooding has already been devastating in Florida.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.240]  But you notice how there was no build-up to this, really?
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.240]  It just kind of, like, came out of nowhere.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.240]  So it's not even as big of a story.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.240]  So, like, the last hurricane, I already forgot the name of it,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.240]  huge build-up, weeks of build-up, days of build-up,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.240]  and then it kind of came and, you know, it happened,
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.240]  but, yeah, okay, like a week and a half of build-up,
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.240]  you know, it was okay, but not the worst thing.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.240]  Hurricane Michael, no build-up, you know,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240]  nobody really talks about it.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.240]  And then it's actually, like, a really bad one
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.240]  and it's going to flood almost the entire northern panhandle.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.240]  And it's like, well, okay, maybe it gets a little news coverage.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.240]  So it's just like everything else in television news.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.240]  It's all scripted. It's all fake.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]  It's all for ratings.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.240]  And, you know, it's just whatever.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:29.240]  But interestingly enough,
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.240]  some people are starting to understand how fake the news is
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.240]  on a much larger scale.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240]  Study, economic boom largely ignored
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240]  as TV's Trump coverage hits 92% negative.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240]  So it was at 91.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.240]  91, we need to go up to 92.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.240]  So you never hear about the record economic numbers,
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  the record jobs growth, everything else,
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.240]  the record low unemployment, and then Gallup has the poll.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:59.240]  Only 20% of people have a great deal slash quite a lot of confidence
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.240]  in TV news, even less in Congress.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.240]  See, folks, and that's why everything they say,
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.240]  oh, you're the blue wave is inevitable.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.240]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240]  People aren't buying it.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.240]  People are not buying it anymore.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.240]  And so they know all the negative coverage is fake.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.240]  So you notice, though, I mean, the numbers pretty much correlate.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.240]  Meanwhile, Gay Frogs is actually a real story.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:27.240]  And now apparently there's like a whole swamp of them in San Francisco.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:31.240]  But they make fun of Alex Jones reporting on that fact.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.240]  Meanwhile, they ignore all the real news that's going on in this country.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.240]  But you know what?
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.240]  One thing I've learned here, covering the most recent Trump rallies,
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.240]  is that Trump rallies don't make television news.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.240]  Nobody covers it.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:50.240]  Fox News, Fox Business, MSNBC, CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:54.240]  I monitor it all. I do it. I do it live.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.240]  None of them cover them.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.240]  Zero coverage of the Trump rally.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.240]  So you know what?
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.240]  We'll go ahead and play some clips from the Trump rally.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:11.240]  First, let's go to a quick clip of President Trump talking about the Democrat campaign to resist.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.240]  The very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:23.240]  Radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.240]  They want to destroy that man.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.240]  Because they want to destroy me too, but that's okay.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.240]  Me, we understand. Him, how can you do that?
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.240]  They want to destroy everything. That's all they're good at.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.240]  Resisting. The whole campaign is resist.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.240]  Ours is to create.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.240]  That's the kind of stuff that's going to get him reelected.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  And again, the blue wave, folks, it's so fake news.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240]  It's just so fake news.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.240]  What evidence do they have of a blue wave?
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.240]  Barack Obama spoke in California. What was it last week, I think?
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.240]  The 7,500 seat venue didn't even get 1,000 butts in the seats.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.240]  That's Obama. That's the cult leader.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.240]  Couldn't even get 1,000 people to turn out in California.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:18.240]  Trump does four rallies a week and gets an aggregate of 100,000 people.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.240]  Oh, yeah. Blue wave.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.240]  Now, you've heard locker up at just about every Trump rally.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.240]  Of course, this is normally aimed at Hillary Clinton,
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:38.240]  but it took an interesting turn at last night's rally in Iowa when the crowd chanted locker up.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  Senator Feinstein, that's another beauty.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.240]  That's a beauty.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.240]  Did you leak the documents?
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.240]  No, I didn't.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.240]  Did we leak?
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.240]  Did we leak?
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.240]  No. No.
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.240]  No, we didn't. Did you ever see?
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.240]  No. She said no.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:17.240]  He just said no, we didn't leak.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.240]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein. Can you believe it?
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.240]  Now, was that the worst body language, honestly?
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.240]  In other words, did she leak it 100%?
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.240]  No. I don't want to get sued. 99%.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.240]  Now, I can't get sued.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:43.240]  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob,
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.240]  and that's what the Democrats have become.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.240]  Hammering. Hammering. Hammering.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.240]  All right, let's take a phone call. Let's jump out to Don calling in from Florida.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.240]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:03.240]  I don't know if anybody notices this a couple of days ago on GAB.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.240]  A Kanye West account appeared.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.240]  At the same time, he deleted his account on Twitter.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.240]  I know he deleted his Twitter account. I haven't seen if he's gone on GAB or anything.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.240]  Is it official? Do you know that's his account?
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:26.240]  I don't. I'm not sure, but I know it appeared at the same time that he went off with Twitter.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.240]  Well, Andrew Torba was on this week, guys, wasn't he?
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:39.240]  Well, he's promoting. It's like four tweets or four posts on there where he's promoting his new album or something that got canceled.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.240]  Well, I am not sure about this, but I'll tell you what.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  I can reach out to Andrew Torba in the break and see if he's aware of this,
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:54.240]  but that's really what GAB would need more than anything is just a rush of traffic
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:01.240]  because a major user of Twitter just switched over to GAB, like a President Trump or even a Kanye West.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.240]  So that would be good for GAB.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:11.240]  I've never seen the account before. It looks like it's new and it's got these posts that only date back a couple of days.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:18.240]  Here's what I'll say as a larger issue. Social media is so unhealthy, man.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.240]  I mean, it is so unhealthy for your mental health, and that's why you have all the tech elites and Steve Jobs.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  They don't let their kids on social media. They don't let their kids on their iPads.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.240]  They know how bad it is for the human brain, but the Twitter stuff is even worse, man,
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  because you read this crap on there, you see the dementia and everything of it.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.240]  I mean, and you don't even know what's real and what's fake.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:51.240]  You could be sitting on Twitter for an hour reading a bunch of fake bots, getting angry, and it's not even real.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:29:20.240]  I kind of just hope the social media trend just kind of goes away.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.240]  Visit Versomedia.com.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:33.240]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.240]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.240]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:47.240]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:52.240]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.240]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:23.240]  FakeTV.com.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:32.240]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago,
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.240]  so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:41.240]  Well, I wrote the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:46.240]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it,
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.240]  but it'll be gone in a couple of months.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:54.240]  If you haven't experienced it, in Forward Store.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you stop up on it.

[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.240]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.240]  This wave does.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:34.240]  It gives President Donald Trump the mandate to move against the criminals in the Democrat Party.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.240]  That he's now labeled as criminals.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.240]  And last night, inched another step further saying,
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.240]  Folks, you don't even want to know the crimes these people have committed.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:50.240]  I know it. I've seen it. It's unfathomable. You can't even know.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.240]  What will he say tonight in his rally?
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:34:02.240]  But I want to go to some of these clips just to kind of show you again where we're at in the political climate right now.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:06.240]  And it begins with Hillary Clinton.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.240]  Now, you know, this is like a competition.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.240]  What is a more stunning audio clip?
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:17.240]  Is it the CNN panel saying Kanye West is an illiterate Negro?
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:23.240]  Or is it Hillary Clinton calling for civil war in the United States?
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.240]  Guys, listen to Hillary Clinton last night on CNN.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:37.240]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:43.240]  That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:55.240]  that's when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:01.240]  No, it's American prosperity. It's American independence.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.240]  It's choosing our own destiny. It's freedom.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.240]  But here's the weird twist about what Hillary said.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.240]  She says you cannot be civil with someone that is out to destroy what you believe in.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.240]  She's basically calling for conservatives to start attacking liberals.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:25.240]  That's really what she's saying. It's the left that's trying to destroy America.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.240]  It's the Democrats that are trying to destroy America.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.240]  It's the Democrats trying to destroy everything we believe in.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:41.240]  God, freedom, independence, borders, safety, truth, justice, humanity.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.240]  That's everything we believe in that they're trying to destroy.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  I would love to ask Hillary Clinton supporters, you know, Hillary said you can't be civil with someone out to destroy everything you believe in.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.240]  What is it that you believe in that we're trying to destroy?
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.240]  What are they going to say?
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.240]  There's no answer to that.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.240]  Who's trying to destroy America? The Democrats. The left.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.240]  They don't even deny it anymore.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.240]  They'll tell you out on the streets of their protests, screw America. It was never great.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.240]  Cuomo, New York, America was never great.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:25.240]  That's all they say now. Angela Rye. CNN, America was not great.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.240]  It's only been racist.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.240]  Really? Move to Africa.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.240]  Oh, but you won't make millions of dollars as a fake news person, will you?
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.240]  No. That's only here in racist America, isn't it, Angela?
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:45.240]  So there's Hillary Clinton stunningly saying you cannot be civil with someone that wants to destroy everything you believe in.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:49.240]  She's trying to incite a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.240]  And why is Hillary all of a sudden going back out in public?
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.240]  Why is she about to announce a huge tour with Bill Clinton?
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.240]  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.240]  Alex Jones has a breaking report coming up on all that, but let's move on now.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:12.240]  Because of the rhetoric of people like Hillary Clinton calling for violence in this country,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.240]  Rand Paul is worried that someone's going to be killed.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.240]  Of course, the left has already tried to do this to Rand Paul, to Steve's police.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:25.240]  But here's Rand Paul commenting on the current climate in America politically because of the left.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.240]  I feel that there's going to be no fascination.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:35.240]  I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation,
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.240]  those who are ratcheting up saying, getting their face,
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.240]  they have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this alleged violence.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.240]  Well, I can remember when you were attacked by your neighbor,
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.240]  even the local media sort of mocked that.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.240]  You know, the coverage, they know how to toe the line without actually going there,
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.240]  but you could tell by the tone of the headlines.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.240]  And it had been a Democrat that had been attacked.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.240]  It would have been entirely different.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.240]  The tone would have been entirely different.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.240]  And the tone was almost like, oh, poor little Rand got his ribs broke.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.240]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.240]  People were chasing down the developer of your neighborhood and other neighbors to try to figure out,
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.240]  well, you had this coming, right?
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.240]  I mean, the media was trying to figure out what way in which you had this coming.
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.240]  This is sort of the double standard.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.240]  If it's an accusation with no substantiation, it's utterly to be believed.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.240]  In my case, it wasn't an accusation.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240]  I actually was assaulted.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.240]  He's now a convicted felon.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.240]  There is an instability and a violent nature in this man.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.240]  There still is a risk of him committing further violence.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.240]  And yet the media discounted that completely because they don't like my politics.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.240]  So this just shows you that it's about politics.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:51.240]  There really isn't about concern or people wanting to lessen violence.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.240]  You know, there's all kinds of violence out there.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.240]  And if the media doesn't want to condemn it when it happens to a Republican,
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.240]  you can see what a double standard we have.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.240]  And here's the thing.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:04.240]  The Democrats are calling for it.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.240]  They're telling people, yeah, you're justified.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.240]  Go out and kill Republicans.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.240]  Go out and assault Trump supporters.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240]  You're justified.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240]  That's the right thing to do.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.240]  Ask Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein, Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.240]  They're all doing it.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240]  They're all women.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.240]  They like to use the women to push their violence, don't they?
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240]  That's what they do.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.240]  They give themselves privilege.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.240]  And then they think that because they've anointed themselves holier than thou,
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.240]  that they can just get away with anything.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.240]  Like, again, I go to this clip on CNN last night.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:39.240]  Just like Hillary Clinton is trying to incite a civil war.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.240]  What do you think people like Bakari Sellers and Tara Settmeyer are trying to do
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.240]  when they say things like this on CNN?
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.240]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.240]  And we have this now.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.240]  And now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:57.240]  And he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.240]  That's CNN, folks.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.240]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:07.240]  Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.240]  They've had it with him and he's an attention whore like the president.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.240]  He's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.240]  This is ridiculous.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.240]  And no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.240]  He's clearly has issues.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.240]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.240]  Listen to these people thinking that they are allowed to think for all black people.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.240]  Listen to these people on CNN claiming,
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.240]  if you're black, you have to think the way I tell you to.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.240]  How do you think that's going to make black people that support Trump feel?
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.240]  Again, here they are inciting violence, riling up their base,
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.240]  saying you're justified in hating these people.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:52.240]  You're justified in committing acts of violence against these people.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.240]  And I hope Rand Paul, well, I know he's right, but I hope someone follows up because...
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.240]  I mean, folks, we're lucky no one's died yet from leftist violence.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  Honestly, Heather Hayer, probably a victim of leftist violence.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.240]  I mean, honestly, that's really what happened.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.240]  But we'll get...
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.240]  That can be debated.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.240]  It'll be a clear-as-day situation, and it's going to happen.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.240]  And will Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton be held accountable?
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  Will they be hauled in front of a judge to say, you know, you're rhetoric called this?
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.240]  Caused this? I doubt it.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:29.240]  But again, let's go to the classic double standard of the Clintons.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.240]  Again, last night on CNN, listen to the devil witch Hillary comment on the differences
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.240]  between misconduct alleged against Clinton and alleged against Kavanaugh.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.240]  You say that you're going to talk about the difficulties that your husband went through,
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.240]  that you went through.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.240]  Obviously, you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998,
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.240]  the impeachment, the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  About the rape settlements.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.240]  Are you prepared to answer those questions?
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240]  Is he prepared to answer them?
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.240]  And how do you see that...
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.240]  Oh, he's going to have to.
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.240] ...similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.240]  And Kavanaugh and others today.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  Well, there's a very significant difference.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:18.240]  And that is the intense, long lasting partisan investigation that was conducted in the 90s.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:25.240]  If, you know, the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison,
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.240]  they should welcome such an investigation themselves.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.240]  What is she talking about?
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.240]  There has been investigations.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:41.240]  The New York Times calls up any woman that's been within two feet of Donald Trump and asked if he raped him.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.240]  Oh, but you know what?
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.240]  Here's the truth that Hillary would never tell you.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.240]  You know the difference between Kavanaugh and Clinton?
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.240]  That means Kavanaugh guilty and Clinton innocent?
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.240]  Bill Clinton is a Democrat.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:57.240]  Guilty until proven Democrat.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:03.240]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing, and survival still next to is the pure iodine.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]  No one else has this.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.240]  From deep earth, crystals between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.240]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.240]  It's the good halogen.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.240]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.240]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.240]  Your thyroid, you name it.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.240]  Mildrew Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.240]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:30.240]  It's the eat as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.240]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.240]  We have a combo of those.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.240]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.240]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.240]  Very simple stuff.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.240]  Filter your water.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.240]  Yeah, I find myself still on water filters.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.240]  Best out there for the price.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.240]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.240]  I hope we get more.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.240]  This is the last run it looks like.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.240]  Survival is still next to it, infowordsstore.com or infowordslife.com or AAA-2533139.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.240]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.240]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.240]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com,
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:38.240]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.240]  We'll win.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:42.240]  We have huge sales at infowordsstore.com right now.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.240]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.240]  despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.240]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.240]  sorrow's the blood we'll spain win.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.240]  This is infowordsdarker-sour.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:20.240]  Weed your support. I'm counting on you.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.240]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.240]  and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.240]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:53.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:57.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.240]  If you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.240]  Call 888-253-3139.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:33.240]  You know, info wars really is the black sheep of the media.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.240]  We really are the dark night.
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:50.240]  And it hit me in the break because I'm sitting here thinking about the censorship that we all are enduring.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.240]  But more than anyone, Alex Jones, who's been banned from existing on any social media platform,
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:00.240]  and this broadcast banned as well.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.240]  Think about it this way, though.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.240]  If it wasn't for info wars and Alex Jones,
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.240]  Donald Trump would probably not be the president of the United States.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:15.240]  And if you go back in time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:22.240]  from June, when was it that Trump announced, was it 2014 or 2015?
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.240]  I think it was 14.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:33.240]  June 2014 to July 2016 during the Republican race.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.240]  There were very few and far between news outlets that supported President Trump.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.240]  Fox News? Nope. Nope.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:50.240]  Most your favorite talk show hosts out there? Nope.
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.240]  Alex Jones stood alone with I Will Give Credit to Michael Savage.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.240]  He's the only other one that was on the Trump train from the get-go.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.240]  Ann Coulter? Very few and far between, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  Very few and far between.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.240]  Now, why am I saying this, leading into this segment, talking about us being the dark night?
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.240]  Well, because guess what? All of those news outlets, all of those hosts now love Trump.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.240]  They praise Trump every day. He's doing an amazing job.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:23.240]  He's so great. They talk about him. They have him on.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:31.240]  So they have no problem enjoying the fruits of our labor.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:36.240]  But then what happens? We get censored and who stands up for us?
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:39.240]  Who makes a big deal out of that?
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.240]  Fox News? No. A lot of them were for it.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.240]  Your favorite talk show host? No. Not really talking about it.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.240]  But boy, are they glad Trump's in.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.240]  Boy, are they thrilled that Trump is in.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:08.240]  But you give no credit to the people that got him in, which was this audience.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:17.240]  So just think about that. That is the level of black sheep dark night infowars really is.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:23.240]  We told you Trump would win. We got behind Trump. We told you he was the real deal before anyone else would.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:28.240]  While they were throwing all the arrows at him, we hit the barbed wire. We took it. We were right.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:37.240]  And then what happens? Everyone else climbs over our rotting corpse on the barbed wire and celebrates the victory and leaves us there to die.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:44.240]  And you know what? I love it.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:52.240]  Let's go back out to the phone lines. Let's go to Mark in Florida. Go ahead, Mark.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:57.240]  Hey Owen, I'd like to talk to you about how the left is trying to get rid of all our news sources.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:02.240]  We got to really consider that people like Carlson need to be supported.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:09.240]  And Fox News, like you were saying, is sort of a Trojan horse. They're pulling up Ben Shapiro real recently. It's a serious issue.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.240]  Yeah, Ben Shapiro will be hosting on Fox News before long.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.240]  And look, here's the other thing. I really don't want to get too much into it because I like a lot of these people.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:24.240]  But they know who they can put on air and then they won't cross lines. They know.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:29.240]  Sure, but I would just be wary. That's all. I'd like to talk about polarization for a minute if you'd like.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:36.240]  We've got to be real wary about the delusion of the left because Scott Adams, who's the cartoonist that draws Dilbert,
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:42.240]  had a great quote just after Trump won, which was, they've now unloaded all their big guns.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.240]  They've called Trump all the worst dictator names you could call him. They've compared him to Hitler.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:54.240]  They've launched their greatest salvo. And if they've launched their greatest salvo and failed, then if that's all they can do,
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:52:01.240]  now they have to commit as strong as they can to getting rid of Trump because this is the baseline, the foundation of their whole philosophy
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.240]  that Trump is indeed Hitler.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:11.240]  Yes, but I think there's still, I think that there's a bit of delusion there, Mark, because they still don't understand that the media isn't working.
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:19.240]  They've been so confident in the media industry working for them, not just, I mean, literally putting out their talking points and narratives.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:26.240]  I mean, like working as far as getting whatever their agenda is accomplished. So they're still under this delusion that if they still hit Trump,
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:32.240]  he's a racist, everything on CNN and MSNBC and the New York Times and the Washington Post every day, that they're going to win.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:35.240]  I really think they're still under that delusion, Mark.
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:41.240]  Oh, they certainly are. But what's worrying is that if they really believe that he's Hitler, there's a couple million people out there.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.240]  Oh, and that really do believe that. And those extremists are the ones we've got to be wary about.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.240]  Absolutely. And those are the people that go out and try to kill Republicans. They already have.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:54.240]  Those are the ones that Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and the criminal Democrat Party are trying to incite to violence.
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.240]  Because here's the thing, it's just like any classical, I mean, you can go back and look at history.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:11.240]  Whenever there's a leader of a country who's in big trouble, who knows if justice befell them, you know, they're going to have their head on a pike.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:17.240]  What do they do? They start a war. It's the perfect distraction. You don't want to get arrested and hung from the highest tree.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:23.240]  Go start a war. Go get a bunch of people fighting in the streets. That's what they're doing.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:27.240]  All these Democrats know their criminal behavior. They all know Trump knows it.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:36.240]  And so they're trying to start a war to distract from their crimes and hope if the war gets out of control enough, they can slink off into the dark of night.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.240]  Thank you for the call, Mark. Let's go to Mike in Idaho. Go ahead.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.240]  What's going on, Owen?
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.240]  Just a play-by-play of life in America.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:51.240]  Yes, sir. Play-by-play all day, man.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:56.240]  He's a tough man with the plan that liberals can't seem to understand, you know.
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.240]  I had to leave Portland because of it. I was living down there and it got so bad that I moved over to Idaho here.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:07.240]  You can walk a little bit taller.
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:14.240]  You know, it's just sad what the Democrats have done. You know, it's really not just the West Coast. They do it to every inner city.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:20.240]  You know, they do it to every inner city and then somehow they still have these people believing that they care about them and that they're going to fix things.
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.240]  Here are the Democrats running things for 50 years telling you, we're going to fix things.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:31.240]  Yeah, they didn't fix nothing. They made it the most unpleasant place to live and it actually used to be decent.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.240]  It used to be fairly okay, but it got so bad where I was actually working at Whole Foods.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:51.240]  And to make a long story short, I couldn't even operate amongst them because it was so bad with the gender police that I just gave up even trying to be level-headed with them because there was just basically a group of authoritarian...
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:57.240]  Honestly, man, it's sad. It really is sad because I think about my hometown of St. Louis.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:03.240]  I think about what the Democrats have done to that. I mean, they just destroyed that inner city, just destroyed it.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:10.240]  And it could be such a beautiful place. It's such beautiful architecture, the riverfront, everything, just like in every inner city that they destroy.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:17.240]  It's like San Francisco. I mean, it's so beautiful, but the Democrats just destroy it. They just destroy everything.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:23.240]  Thank you for the call, Mike. Let's go to a caller from California, Lori. She deals with this. Go ahead, Lori.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:35.240]  Yes, hi. I am a sixth generation Northern Californian. We do not have the resources to get up and leave like a majority of people I know who are conservatives have.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:44.240]  And we wouldn't do that. My husband and I are both deplorables. We totally support Trump. And I've been a listener for 15 years.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.240]  We really think that we need a red tsunami, not a red wave here in California.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:59.240]  Well, Lori, I was actually shocked by this. The last I checked, I believe it's the governor race in the state of California, guys, look this up.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.240]  I believe that the governor race is only a six-point margin right now for a Democrat, only six points.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:14.240]  Yeah. Yeah, we've got to vote for Cox. And then Feinstein is running against, for our senator, Feinstein against Leon.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:24.240]  So we have to vote for Feinstein because she's the lesser of two evils. And as horrible as this sounds, you know, if she dies off, then we get somebody better.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.240]  It's just, it's just, it's such a mess here.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:40.240]  But what do people say, Lori? What do people say in California that vote Democrat when you've had Pelosi, Waters and Feinstein running the state this entire, for like three decades, running it right into the ground?
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.240]  I mean, how do they reason that? What do they say to justify voting for these, for these women?
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:55.240]  You know, I honestly don't know. I honestly don't know because if you try to discuss it rationally and, you know, I like to talk to people.
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:03.240]  Find out why they feel, how they feel and what their thinking process is in a peaceful, in adult conversation, they go off on ramp.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.240]  And too many times I've tried talking like that and I've had to leave because, you know, I was afraid of violence.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:15.240]  And it's really sad because it's just what you're doing is you're, you're opening up the cult mindset.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:24.240]  And once, once, once you, once you tap that nerve, once you hit that nerve that, that, you know, lets them know, hey, you're in a cult
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:30.240]  and you know it. Once you hit that nerve, that's when they panic, you know, that, that's when they go into the panics
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:36.240]  and they start shrieking and yelling and cursing and calling you names because you just hit the nerve of reality.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:41.240]  You just hit the nerve and they'd rather not face the facts that they're a member of a cult.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.240]  A group think cult and they're totally ignorant. They can't face the facts.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:55.240]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:58:01.240]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.240]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:12.240]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:21.240]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:27.240]  to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:31.240]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:35.240]  This is actually our last run of SupermailVitality.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:40.240]  So I want you to experience SupermailVitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:46.240]  Unleash the Supermail in you with SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:58.240]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:01.240]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:06.240]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:14.240]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:17.240]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.240]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract,
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:26.240]  and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:30.240]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract,
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:38.240]  poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:43.240]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:43.240 --> 02:00:00.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:07.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, one of the favorite attacks against Infowars that the hearsay mafia engages in,
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:12.240]  the parrots of the New World Order engage in is Gay Frogs! Gay Frogs! Gay Frogs!
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:19.240]  They ignore the scientific studies, they ignore the videos and the reports of the studies they've done,
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.240]  but yes, chemicals are turning the frogs gay.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:31.240]  People always use our quote to make fun of Alex Jones, but really, it's actually happening.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:38.240]  In fact, it's not only turning frogs gay, it's completely changing their sex organs
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:43.240]  and turning male frogs into female frogs that can successfully reproduce.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:50.240]  Atrazine is one of the most widely used pesticides used on corn crops, rice, and wheat crops.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:57.240]  It's used by the massive companies that grow the food that goes into your cereal, your popcorn, your bread,
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.240]  and so many other different foods that you eat.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:05.240]  When exposed to small amounts of atrazine, some of the amphibian males grow up and literally become female.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:11.240]  So these are two males that not only are mating, but have the ability to lay eggs,
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.240]  even though they're genetically chromosomal males.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.240]  Atrazine reeks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs,
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:25.240]  emasculating three-quarters of them and turning one in ten into females, according to a study by Berkeley.
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:29.240]  Atrazine is banned in the EU, but is still used copiously in the US.
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:37.240]  It's used on everything from corn fields to Christmas tree farms, and it is one of the most pervasive chemicals in agriculture.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:44.240]  Atrazine creates immune potential and raises concerns that it may potentially take clinical diseases such as fibromyalgia,
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.240]  grave disease, neuropathy, psoriasis, lupus, or a number of different autoimmune diseases.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:58.240]  Prenatal exposure to pesticides disrupts testicular structure and alters testosterone levels in male animals.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:05.240]  Exposure to only one dose of atrazine disrupted neonatal male gonadal histrofunctional features,
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:09.240]  which means it changed the ability of the testicle to function.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:15.240]  Alterations described can have detrimental effect on the sexual saturation of any male animals.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:20.240]  The chemical is effectively eliminating male chromosomes at an alarming rate,
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.240]  at levels which are three times lower than what are currently appearing in our drinking water.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:33.240]  Atrazine affects men adversely by literally shrinking their gonads or causing them to effectively become women,
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:38.240]  but it also affects women causing low estrogen levels and irregular menstruation.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:44.240]  The effects of atrazine on male development are consistent across all vertebrate classes examined.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:52.240]  That means not only in the animals they tested, but even humans, dogs, horses, virtually all animals.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:59.240]  People are quick to shout conspiracy theorists when anyone talks about anything that sounds crazy,
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:04.240]  but you know, reality is actually stranger than fiction, and it does seem insane.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:07.240]  I mean, chemicals in the water turning the frogs gay?
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:14.240]  People always use that quote to make fun of Alex Jones when this has actually been scientifically proven.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:21.240]  Recently there's been a lot of talk about soy boys and how soy is emasculating men.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:28.240]  I don't think it's soy. You have to worry about, OK, zenoestrogens are everywhere.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.240]  Research BPA. BPA is a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:38.240]  which is what many bottles and even baby bottles are made out of.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:48.240]  And BPA is such a potent zenoestrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone replacement therapy.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:56.240]  And there have been many studies that show that BPA leeches off of baby bottles into the milk and therefore into the babies.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.240]  So we are essentially dosing infants with a synthetic estrogen.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:10.240]  So I recommend investing in a water filter and start using glass, stainless steel or ceramic bottles.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:15.240]  And remember, there is no liberty when there is forced medicine.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  These pesticides land up in our food and water, but our water is fluoridated deliberately when there is absolutely no reason to do so.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:29.240]  But that's the topic for our whole other video.
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.240]  Thanks for listening.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:37.240]  If you're concerned with how these chemicals are affecting humans and the environment, make sure to spread the word.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  And of course, we've got air filters, water filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:50.240]  But isn't it funny, as soon as we raise an awareness about an anthropogenic environment impact, they just discount it.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:05:15.240]  So it only counts if they bring it up, not if we do.
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:22.240]  Fluorolife is a powerful probiotic supplement with 20 of the most potent clinically studied probiotic strains.

[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:27.240]  You know, I'd like to start a campaign to return James Brown's wig to its rightful owner.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:30.240]  You know, Maxine Waters, she's stolen up in this country.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:37.240]  For her to steal James Brown's wig and get away with it, I want justice for James Brown's wig.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:55.240]  Maxine Waters is a criminal that stole James Brown's wig and you just cannot let the father of funk have his wig stolen by a kleptocrat like Maxine Waters.
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.240]  Because he's got soul.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:02.240]  Maxine Waters has no soul. She eats souls.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.240]  Anyway, you heard the report, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:12.240]  Yeah, Gay Frogs is a real thing. It's caused by Atrazine.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:21.240]  There have been multiple scientific studies done, but it doesn't matter because every time I go out in public and they see my info or my flag, they say Gay Frogs.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.240]  And that somehow gives them an intellectual victory. These are the brainwashed masses.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:42.240]  But, you know, it's just like what I was saying. Isn't it funny if the left comes out with any anthropogenic claim, whether it's, you know, climate change or pollution, whatever it is, coal.
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:50.240]  If humans are causing any impact to the environment, the left causes hell and says this is going to kill all of us and it must be stopped.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:58.240]  I can't believe you. You don't care about life. You won't pay a billion dollars to stop climate change. Oh my gosh.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.240]  It's man-made climate change. It's man-made global warming. Why won't you stop it?
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:06.240]  So that's their issue, which they have no science to base it off of.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:27.240]  And then we actually bring an issue of real anthropogenic environment impact. The Atrazine that we use to spray on plants and crops, agriculture, goes into the food and water, and then changes our very biology, changes the biology of animals on Earth.
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:40.240]  So we raise that issue, which is a scientific, factually proven man-made environmental impact. And then what does the left do? They just discount it. No, I just don't exist.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:51.240]  Alex Jones reported it. It's fake. No, no, no. Look, here's the science. Here's the videos. Here's the research. It's all there. Here are the frogs humping each other, laying eggs.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:09:01.240]  Oh, but infowars said it. So it's not true. No, no, no, no. Man-made global warming is true, though. We have no science. We have no facts.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:15.240]  We don't even take into account the sun or volcanoes or the ice core samples. We don't know anything except man-made global warming has to be real because we say so.
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:22.240]  But then we report on gay frogs, which is real. We have the science. We have the research. We have everything. And they say, no.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:29.240]  I mean, I just can't even believe this world I live in. How is this real?
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:37.240]  Anyway, folks, we know about the chemicals in the food and water. So that's why we sell water filters. Wow.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:48.240]  Imagine that. Water filters that we use here at the office, water filters that we use at our homes. So, you know, if you want to drink clean water, if you want to have clean air in your home,

[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:45.240]  This is part of our midterm election coverage. We plan on being live 8 to 10 weeknights up through November 6th. That, of course, is election night.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:52.240]  And we're going to see, do you share the broadcast? Do you tune in? Do you tell friends and family? Is our traffic up? Is it worth it?
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:58.240]  Are you funding us at infowarstore.com? Do we have the fuel? Do we have the capacity? Are we ready to go next level?
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:04.240]  Is the audience ready to take us next level? So that's where we're at right now.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:12.240]  But remember, infowarstore.com slash show, infowarstore.com slash show, infowarstore.com slash show.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:18.240]  I'm actually stunned how many people I meet out on the streets that tell me, like, oh, man, how are you guys?
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:24.240]  What are you guys doing now that you're banned? Like, what do you mean? They really think that we're shut down.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:30.240]  They really think we don't exist anymore. They really think we stop broadcasting. They don't know about infowarstore.com slash show.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:35.240]  It blows my mind how many people don't know. Honestly, it's stunning to me. Huge infowarst fans.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.240]  Wear our t-shirts. Tell me how great the settlements are. And they're like, what are you guys doing now?
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:45.240]  I'm like, well, infowarstore.com slash show, we always have our live streams. Oh, oh, wow, really?
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  It's stunning to me. So it's like, I need to come on air and just say infowarstore.com slash show at the beginning and end of every segment just to make sure everyone knows.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:13:01.240]  Because they want to find our intel. They still have the hunger for the truth, just like they always did, that made Alex Jones so powerful.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:08.240]  But it's amazing. So it's like, we don't even do the right, we don't even market ourselves. We're so obsessed with the information.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:23.240]  So infowarstore.com slash show, infowarstore.com slash show, infowarstore.com slash show. We're live 10 hours a day. We're live 10 hours a day from 8am to 6pm every weekday.
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:34.240]  And if we get the funding and we get the support through the election with our extended coverage, 8 to 10pm weeknights, we're going to launch new shows.
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:41.240]  So that's where we're at. 50% off the entire InfoWars live product line at infowarstore.com plus free shipping.
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:53.240]  Okay, guys, let's roll clip 11. So you've got these fake paid for protesters that Trump hit again last night in his rally in Iowa.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:58.240]  He'll be live in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight. He's talking about the paid protesters and now more Republicans are saying it.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:05.240]  Oh, and again, who reported that first? By the way, it's just like what I said. Who told you Trump was the real deal first, InfoWars?
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:10.240]  Who told you the protesters were paid for by Soros before anyone else would, InfoWars?
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:16.240]  Now, who's being censored more than anyone else by the tech left, InfoWars?
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:23.240]  Is anyone defending InfoWars? You really love to report on the Soros paid protesters now.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:29.240]  You really love to tell everyone how great Donald Trump is now. Why don't you give us a little love?
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:38.240]  No, that's fine. We'll be the dark night. Here's the clip, though. Listen to this undercover audio of these paid for Marxist protesters,
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:46.240]  which I believe is they're violating election law here, campaign law, but listen to what they say on this bus.
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  The likelihood is that we will be out all day and then be coming back later on. One thing that I wanted to say that is important.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.240]  If you post on social media, please do not mention that you are from New York City.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:18.240]  The reason is, much though they love us, the Faso campaign on September 15 posted that the Delgado campaign was sending bussing in busloads of New York City Democratic Socialist...
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.240]  Which is true. Which is what they're doing.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:27.240] ... bringing outsiders in to try to sway the campaign. And the campaign is understandably concerned about this,
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:35.240]  despite the fact that they know that the reason we're doing this is precisely because we care about New York and we care about our neighbors up there.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.240]  But please, if you post on social media, do not mention that you are from New York City.
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  So there's the leader of the paid protest traveling around and she's like, look, we got caught. We're not supposed to be doing this.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:52.240]  The people who are campaigning for said they don't want us doing this because it could be illegal. So just don't tell anyone.
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.240]  We're still going to do it, but just don't tell anyone.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:32.240]  Healthcare reform is confusing. But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions,

[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:34.240]  You know, I love the deception of the Democrats where Hillary Clinton is calling for civil war, Maxine Waters is calling for violence.
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:51.240]  I mean, you know, the left-wing media is making claims up to incite violence and justify it and then you see a slew of headlines in the last 48 hours saying Republicans are fear mongering before the midterms.
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:55.240]  Republicans are trying to make their voter base afraid before the midterms.
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:04.240]  Literally, folks, dozens of headlines. I was just telling this to the crew. I just remember seeing this when I was doing my news research last night. Dozens of these headlines.
[02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:11.240]  In fact, guys, can you just pull up the search engine results so that we can see all the different outlets that were running with that headline?
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:17.240]  And that's how you know it's a propaganda campaign right out of the Democrat Party.
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:25.240]  It usually originates, the headline at least, in the Washington Post or in the New York Times. But yeah, there it is.
[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:29.240]  I mean, how many stories would you say are there, guys?
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:34.240]  Like, at least 10, I would say at the top, and that's just a basic Google search.
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:38.240]  There were at least 10 that I saw.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:44.240]  There's the Washington Post and angry mob. Republicans work to recast Democrat protests as out of control anarchy.
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:51.240]  I love the deception of the left. I mean, seriously, do you realize the insanity of this?
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:58.240]  The crew is just going through all these headlines. But seriously, do you realize the next level insanity of this right now?
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:01.240]  This deception?
[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:16.240]  So the Democrats are literally calling for violence, calling for civil war, justifying it, doing it, actually engaging in all of this, promoting it.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:22.240]  And then out of the other side of their mouth, they say Republicans are fear mongering saying that leftists are getting violent.
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:26.240]  What is wrong? So, I mean, it's like, what?
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:34.240]  So here they are engaging in violence, trying to start a civil war, and then pointing at Republicans saying, why are you saying we're getting violent?
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:37.240]  Why are you telling your voters we're an angry mob?
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:41.240]  When it's like, you are an angry mob.
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:46.240]  I mean, it's beyond the pot calling the kettle black.
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:23:04.240]  They have such hubris in their control over the media that they can, in the same day, in the exact same moment even punch you right in the nose and then say, why are you blaming me for your nose bleed?
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:13.240]  Seriously, this is like somebody walks right up to you in the street and socks you in the nose and makes your nose bleed.
[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:19.240]  And then you're standing there and your nose is bleeding, you're like, hey man, what are you doing punching people in the nose?
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:25.240]  I'm not punching anyone in the nose, bro, why are you making everyone afraid of me? I'm not violent, I didn't punch you.
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:30.240]  And you're like, my friend was filming me, this is a street camera, everyone caught it, everybody saw it.
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:34.240]  Look at this guy, fear mongering. He's telling people I'm violent.
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.240]  Yeah, you punched me in the nose. Oh my gosh, he's fear mongering.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.240]  I mean, this is next level deception, this is unbelievable, and they all ran with the headline.
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:54.240]  So here they are, calling for violence, saying you're justified in your violence, get out of control, and then all the Democrats come out and say, the Republicans are fear mongering.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:24:04.240]  Uh, yeah, you're trying to kill us.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:19.240]  It's just so next level, I can't even, in fact, you know what, let's go out to Brazil, where they literally tried to kill Bolsonaro as they're in the middle of operation, or they call it Yavajato car wash.
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.240]  The last president is in jail, Lula.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:28.240]  So here's Brazil getting its independence and sovereignty draining their own swamp.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:34.240]  They call it Operation Car Wash, Yavajato, and so what do they do? They stab Bolsonaro, try to kill him.
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:41.240]  That's like, that's like Bolsonaro coming out and saying, yes, my political opponents are getting violent.
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:48.240]  And then the Brazilian news says, Bolsonaro is fear mongering. The guy got stabbed almost to death.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:25:00.240]  Let's go to Gabriel in Brazil. Huge elections coming up. It looks like Bolsonaro is a shoe-in right now, but what do you think, Gabriel?
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.240]  Do we still have Gabriel? I'm not hearing any audio.
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:06.240]  Well, that's unfortunate.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.240]  Okay. Can you hear me now?
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:10.240]  Okay, there you go, sir. Yes, go ahead.
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:12.240]  I'm going to tell you guys.
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:15.240]  Go ahead.
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:17.240]  Hello?
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:23.240]  I think we have a connection issue here because I guess Gabriel can't hear me. I can hear him now, but he can't hear me.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:28.240]  All right. Well, that's too bad. Let's go to, if you guys want to see if you can get it back connected.
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:33.240]  In the meantime, let's go to Elizabeth in North Carolina. Go ahead, Elizabeth.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:44.240]  I just wanted to tell you that I'm so annoyed because I think when Hillary came out the other day and said there would be no civility until the Democrats get back in power.
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:50.240]  I wanted to make people afraid because, you know, all of the chaos is going on.
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:53.240]  She wants them to be scared, so they'll just go ahead.
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:57.240]  Oh my gosh, exactly. I'm so glad you said that because it is next level.
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:04.240]  They're the ones fear-mongering. Jesus.
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:10.240]  It's unbelievable. They're fear-mongering. They're getting violent.
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.240]  And then you say, hey, the left is getting violent. We need to make sure we vote and keep them out of office.
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:17.240]  And then they say, oh my God, you're fear-mongering.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:21.240]  And can you imagine, Elizabeth, if President Trump said what Hillary Clinton said?
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:27.240]  Imagine if President Trump went on Fox News and said, well, you know, there's just no civility until we have a red wave.
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:32.240]  Can you imagine what the press would say about that?
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:40.240]  But I want to tell you, Dr. Savage made a video or a clip, a sound clip. I was listening to his radio station and sent back in the summer.
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:47.240]  And I think it was from, like, Homeland or something, and it reminded him it was like a government official,
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:52.240]  like making a small, subtle threat to a man that sounded like Alex Jones.
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:58.240]  And I thought you guys might pick up on it, but I know you're so busy, but I wanted to tell you about that.
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:03.240]  He played this and it really did. It was like he was threatening him to be quiet.
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:09.240]  Yeah, I think we even have the clip at Infowars.com. I mean, that character in Homeland is based off Alex Jones.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:18.240]  Yeah. And so anyway, I'm sure you did know that you knew about Dr. Savage playing that clip and kind of hinting that it put him in mind of Alex.
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:27.240]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, if there's any two kindred spirits in conservative media, it's Mike Savage
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:33.240]  and Alex Jones. They're censored everywhere. They're not allowed on Fox News, and they just tell it like it is.
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:38.240]  They're not controlled. Love them or hate them. That's just the fact. Thank you so much for the call, Elizabeth.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:44.240]  All right, let's give, okay, let's go to who's been on, Ethan in Kansas. Go ahead, Ethan.
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:49.240]  Great to talk to you, Owen. Got a quote for you here.
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:57.240]  As far as info with Army goes and people being maybe afraid or holding back on getting involved, the quote goes,
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:02.240]  history has been the inaction of those who could have acted, the indifference of those who should have known better,
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:08.240]  the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most that has made it possible for evil to triumph.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:13.240]  And you know, when you get in these people's faces and you put their back against the wall with truth and information,
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:20.240]  their violent nature really starts to come out. And that's why the CNN clip that you guys have been talking about today really does not surprise me
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:26.240]  because these people are racist. These people are hateful. They are violent. You know, that's the Trump rally in Mississippi, Kansas.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.240]  Both one of these people getting in their face and I was called a rapist. I was called, you know, everything under the sun.
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:35.240]  Yeah, you and your brother have been very active, right?
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.240]  Yes.

[02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:34.240]  So I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done. I'm breaking the contract.
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:39.240]  Well, I wrote the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:44.240]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:49.240]  It'll be gone in a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarslife.com.
[02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:52.240]  If you have experienced it, I suggest you stop up on it.

[02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:30.240]  So you have the Democrats fear-mongering, and then claiming the Republicans are fear-mongering.
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:34.240]  Well, yeah, we're just letting you know the truth that the Democrats get elected.
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:38.240]  They're going to raise your taxes, and they're going to open the borders.
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:42.240]  That's just a fact. It's not fear-mongering.
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:45.240]  But let's just look at some of these headlines.
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:52.240]  Nancy Pelosi warns hundreds of thousands of people will die if GOP health bill passes.
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:54.240]  Oh, here's another one.
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:34:01.240]  Economist Larry Summers, 10,000 people will die annually from GOP tax bill. Oh, wow.
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:09.240]  And then there's this one. Here's an entire list of times Democrats claim GOP policies would cause people to die.
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:15.240]  And this is like five, six, seven pages here, seven pages of the list.
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:19.240]  So I don't have time to go into all of it, but this is normal for the Democrat Party.
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.240]  It's what they always do. In fact, they ran an ad, I think it was back in the 90s.
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:25.240]  You probably find this on the Internet.
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:33.240]  They ran an ad where it was a Democrat paid for ad where they literally pushed Granny off a cliff.
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:39.240]  And they claim that this is what the Republicans are doing to, I think it was either Social Security or Medicaid.
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:46.240]  I don't remember. And they have a whole ad and it's a Republican pushing a grandma off a cliff.
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:51.240]  So this is not, this isn't new hat for the Democrat Party. This is old hat.
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:58.240]  They are the party of fear-mongering. They are the party of racism. They are the party of violence.
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:04.240]  And the nerve, the unmitigated nerve, the audacity of these people to go on television and say,
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:07.240]  Trump is fear-mongering and the Republicans are the party of violence.
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:12.240]  You two faced phony liars.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:17.240]  The good news is the American people are seeing through it. Yeah, here it is. Here's the ad.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:23.240]  Oh yeah, and here's little Granny. And it's the nice Republican pushing her off the cliff.
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:26.240]  It's the Democrats fear-mongering for you. Oh no, but it's the Republicans.
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:32.240]  The Democrats told me right after they told me Trump was going to kill me and put me in a cage.
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:37.240]  People are nuts, man.
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:46.240]  Alright, let's go back out to the phone lines. We've got Kent in Alabama. Fire away, Kent.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:36:00.240]  Oh, in much respect, dude. Thanks for taking the call. Hey, I gotta say that you have a new t-shirt or a meme on your hands with the Maxine Waters James Brown thought process because you on one side you have,
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:09.240]  I got soul and I'm super bad with James. And on the back, you have Maxine with, I've got your soul and I'm super bad.
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:18.240]  But anyway, or just on the front, it's James Brown and it's I've got soul and then on the back, it's Maxine Waters. I'm super bad.
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:24.240]  Right on, dude. Any of the above, you know, just follow that lead. You're on point there.
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.240]  Hey, you guys follow that lead. It's just like with the Info Wars Army, man. We got, we got our hands full here. I'm not, I'm not discounting your idea.
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:34.240]  It's a great idea. People should go out and make the t-shirt. You come out with a great idea, make the t-shirt, say, put Info Wars on it.
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:40.240]  You know, say it's an Info Wars t-shirt, it'll sell. It's like, that's what I'm saying with the Info Wars Army is so amazing because people like Ethan,
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:46.240]  who called in last segment, have just gone out there and done it. He goes out there every day and engages in political activism.
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:52.240]  He got the sign on the Monday night football game. There's people in Missouri, people in Portland that are going out every day in Trump hats in the middle of Portland.
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:58.240]  I mean, you know, that's, that's risky, but that's, you know, that's what it takes, a little bravery. Go ahead, Kent.
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:06.240]  Yeah, grass roots, dude, no doubt. You got, you got it going on. So, you know, the whole point of the Kanye scenario and the left and the demon crap,
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:17.240]  these people that, you know, use him as a pariah, it's like, okay, well, what happened with Hussain and Michelle when they had Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z and Ludacris out to the White House?
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:23.240]  It's like, they were loving him for that. I don't understand the disconnect, the double speak, if you will.
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:32.240]  Because if you're not a Democrat, a progressive or a liberal, you're a racist, bigot, rapist. I mean, what don't you get?
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:35.240]  And you didn't read when you were growing up. It's like, that's the...
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:40.240]  Oh yeah, that's the new one. Yeah, yeah, you don't read either now. Okay, yeah. You're uneducated.
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:47.240]  But I guess that's really just rehashing, you know, they just, they've really been saying that the whole time. It's just a new way of saying that we're uneducated.
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:56.240]  Well, yeah, but also look at the fact that they don't say anything about Taylor Swift. They love her. Oh, much love Taylor. You came out for the last. You love the demon crap.
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:06.240]  Oh, and guess who won an award at a music award ceremony 24 hours after Taylor Swift said that? Guess who won?
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.240]  No idea, dude.
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.240]  Taylor Swift.
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:12.240]  Of course.
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:26.240]  Now you see exactly, exactly. And now she'll get whatever a Netflix special and her songs on the radio. They just say, look, Taylor, we just need you to come out and do something for the Democrats.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:34.240]  We'll give you the AMA Award and we'll put your next track on the radio. Okay? And Taylor Swift says, okay.
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:39.240]  It's crazy because she's the American hero now for the left and she's just, you know...
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.240]  Well, she's hardly anything but she, I would disagree. She's hardly anything but, but it just proves she's a sellout just like everything else.
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:51.240]  And here's the sad thing about it that most people don't realize. Trump got it. Thank you for the call, Kent. Kanye West gets it.
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:39:00.240]  I guess Taylor Swift didn't get it. Taylor, you don't need these people. Like, that's what they don't get. Trump gets it. Kanye gets it.
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.240]  Candace Owen gets it. Like, people get it. Some people don't get it. They really think they need these people.
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:11.240]  Taylor Swift writes her own music. She's going to be worth more than Michael Jackson when it's all said and done.
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:19.240]  She produces her own songs. She writes her own lyrics. So she's making so much money. She's so smart in the music industry.
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:26.240]  She doesn't need any of these people. She doesn't need the AMAs. She doesn't need the radio stations, corporate radio playing her tracks.
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:35.240]  She sells out concerts like 500 bucks a head in a minute. She doesn't need this crap, but they have this weird phobia.
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:44.240]  If they don't have the establishment behind them, that they can't make it and they'll be destroyed. No, it only makes you more powerful.
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:49.240]  Let's take another call. Dean in Virginia. Go ahead, Dean.
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:56.240]  Well, thanks, Owen. The great thing about being on hold, you're able to expand on your points that you brought up.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:08.240]  One of my first points, questions is, can President Trump issue an executive order that in order to vote, you need a photo ID?
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:15.240]  You know, that's interesting. I don't know. I think that technically that's already the case, though.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:22.240]  I don't know if you have to present it at the polling station, but technically you do have to have a photo ID to vote.
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:26.240]  I mean, at some point you have to get the photo ID to eventually vote, you know what I'm saying?
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.240]  But I guess presenting it at the polling station is a different story.
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.240]  And enforcing it.
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:39.240]  They won't even let him ask on the US Census if you're an American citizen.
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:48.240]  You got the Census coming for 2020. He proposed putting the question, are you a US citizen? And you know what they said, no, you can't do that.
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:51.240]  There you go. More cutting back. I got another point for you.
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.240]  At the hearings, remember you heard all those paid educators screaming and yelling?
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:59.240]  Yeah, sounded like demonic screams from hell.
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:07.240]  I found out from a local radio guy that those were homeless people bused from Union Station.
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.240]  A cop said that to him when he asked, we're all homeless people because I see him coming in.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.240]  I see him all over the place when I come in from out of town. Well, they were bused over to the hearings.
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:23.240]  Number one, number two, isn't it true that in order to get into these hearings, you have to have a ticket?
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  Oh, I'm so glad you said this, Dean. I don't know. 110% they were all invited in by the Democrats. 110%.
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  To get a ticket, one of the demon rat aides has to give it to them.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.240]  They'll never admit this. They'll never admit this. It's 100% true.
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:45.240]  They were all invited in by the Democrat Party. And this was something you have to plan weeks in advance.
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:48.240]  You can't just invite someone in that day. They've been planning this.
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:55.240]  Now, here's the other point. Once they're being brought out because they're disruptive and they handcuffed them with the plastic ties.
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:00.240]  However, they are still shooting off their weapon. They're still shooting off their mouth.
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  Why don't they act and the first thing they do is duct tape their mouth?
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:12.240]  Well, you know, that's probably not good optics.
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:18.240]  I would say that for real, though, I mean, I don't know if you're serious about that, but I think a real solution.
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:22.240]  I'm not serious about it because they're still screaming and yelling. So what's the point of arresting them?
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.240]  Well, they're really not even being arrested. They're being executed out.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:31.240]  And excuse me, they're being let out and they're being asked.
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:35.240]  Do you mind if we arrest you? Do you mind?
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:37.240]  So they just really need to do it.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:40.240]  All right, here's the deal, folks. Coming up, thank you for the call, Dean.
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:43.240]  Big report from Alex Jones after this break. You're not going to want to miss it.
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:46.240]  Big report from Alex Jones on the other side of this break.
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  Then we're joined by Roger Stone on the fourth hour, but Alex Jones is coming up with a breaking report.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.240]  This is the Alex Jones show filling in for Alex and Mo and Shroyer. We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:43:01.240]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:05.240]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:10.240]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:17.240]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:20.240]  and it supports the informal war. It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:24.240]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:30.240]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:40.240]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:45.240]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:47.240]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:50.240]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at infowordslive.com.
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:24.240]  If you simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.240]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:32.240]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at infowords.com
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:37.240]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scum bags, we'll win.
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:40.240]  We have huge sales at infowordsstore.com right now
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.240]  and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:47.240]  despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:51.240]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, sorrow's the glove will sting when.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:45:20.240]  This is infowords darkest hour, we do your support, I'm counting on you.
